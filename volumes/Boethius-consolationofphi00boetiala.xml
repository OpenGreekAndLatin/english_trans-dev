            <title type="main">PREFACE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE book called ' The Consolation <lb/>
            of Philosophy' was throughout <lb/>
            the Middle Ages, and down to <lb/>
            the beginnings of the modern epoch in <lb/>
            the sixteenth century, the scholar's familiar <lb/>
            companion. Few books have exercised a <lb/>
            wider influence in their time. It has been <lb/>
            translated into every European tongue, and <lb/>
            into English nearly a dozen times, from <lb/>
            King Alfred's paraphrase to the transla- <lb/>
            tions of Lord Preston, Causton, Ridpath, <lb/>
            and Duncan, in the eighteenth century. <lb/>
            The belief that what once pleased so widely <lb/>
            must still have some charm is my excuse for <lb/>
            attempting the present translation. The <lb/>
            great work of Boethius, with its alternate <lb/>
            prose and verse, skilfully fitted together <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            like dialogue and chorus in a Greek play, <lb/>
            is unique in literature, and has a pathetic <lb/>
            interest from the time and circumstances <lb/>
            of its composition. It ought not to be <lb/>
            forgotten. Those who can go to the <lb/>
            original will find their reward. There <lb/>
            may be room also for a new translation <lb/>
            in English after an interval of close on a <lb/>
            hundred years.</p>
          <p>Some of the editions contain a repro- <lb/>
            duction of a bust purporting to represent <lb/>
            Boethius. Lord Preston's translation, for <lb/>
            example, has such a portrait, which it refers <lb/>
            to an original in marble at Rome. This I <lb/>
            have been unable to trace, and suspect that <lb/>
            it is apocryphal. The Hope Collection <lb/>
            at Oxford contains a completely different <lb/>
            portrait in a print, which gives no authority. <lb/>
            I have ventured to use as a frontispiece <lb/>
            a reproduction from a plaster - cast in <lb/>
            the Ashmolean Museum, taken from an <lb/>
            ivory diptych preserved in the Bibliotheca <lb/>
            Quiriniana at Brescia, which represents <lb/>
            Narius Manlius Boethius, the father of <lb/>
            the philosopher. Portraiture of this period <lb/>
            is so rare that it seemed that, failing a like- <lb/>
            ness of the author himself, this authentic <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            representation of his father might have <lb/>
            interest, as giving the consular dress and <lb/>
            insignia of the time, and also as illustrating <lb/>
            the decadence of contemporary art. The <lb/>
            consul we.irs a richly-embroidered cloak; <lb/>
            his right hand holds a staff surmounted <lb/>
            by the Roman eagle, his left the mappa <lb/>
            circensis, or napkin used for starting the <lb/>
            races in the circus; at his feet are palms <lb/>
            and bags of money-prizes for the victors <lb/>
            in the games. For permission to use this <lb/>
            cast my thanks are due to the authorities <lb/>
            of the Ashmolean Museum, as also to <lb/>
            Mr. T. W. Jackson, Curator of the Hope <lb/>
            Collection, who first called my attention to <lb/>
            its existence.</p>
          <p>I have to thank my brother, Mr. L. <lb/>
            James, of Radley College, for much <lb/>
            valuable help and for correcting the proof- <lb/>
            sheets of the translation. The text used <lb/>
            is that of Peiper, Leipsic, 1874.</p>

          <p>ANICIUS MANLIUS SEVERI- <lb/>
            NUS BOETHIUS lived in the <lb/>
            last quarter of the fifth century <lb/>
            A.D., and the first quarter of the sixth. <lb/>
            He was growing to manhood, when Theo- <lb/>
            doric, the famous Ostrogoth, crossed the <lb/>
            Alps and made himself master of Italy. <lb/>
            Boethius belonged to an ancient family, <lb/>
            which boasted a connection with the <lb/>
            legendary glories of the Republic, and <lb/>
            was still among the foremost in wealth <lb/>
            and dignity in the days of Rome's abase- <lb/>
            ment. His parents dying early, he was <lb/>
            brought up by Symmachus, whom the <lb/>
            age agreed to regard as of almost saintly <lb/>
            character, and afterwards became his son- <lb/>
            in-law. His varied gifts, aided by an <lb/>
            excellent education, won for him the <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            reputation of the most accomplished man <lb/>
            of his time. He was orator, poet, musician, <lb/>
            philosopher. It is his peculiar distinction <lb/>
            to have handed on to the Middle Ages <lb/>
            the tradition of Greek philosophy by his <lb/>
            Latin translations of the works of Aristotle. <lb/>
            Called early to a public career, the highest <lb/>
            honours of the State came to him un- <lb/>
            sought. He was sole Consul in 510 A.D., <lb/>
            and was ultimately raised by Theodoric <lb/>
            to the dignity of Magister Officiorum, or <lb/>
            head of the whole civil administration. <lb/>
            He was no less happy in his domestic life, <lb/>
            in the virtues of his wife, Rusticiana, and <lb/>
            the fair promise of his two sons, Sym- <lb/>
            machus and Boethius ; happy also in the <lb/>
            society of a refined circle of friends. <lb/>
            Noble, wealthy, accomplished, universally <lb/>
            esteemed for his virtues, high in the favour <lb/>
            of the Gothic King, he appeared to all <lb/>
            men a signal example of the union of <lb/>
            merit and good fortune. His felicity <lb/>
            seemed to culminate in the year 522 A.D., <lb/>
            when, by special and extraordinary favour, <lb/>
            his, two sons, young as they were for so <lb/>
            exalted an honour, were created joint <lb/>
            Consuls and rode to the senate-house <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            attended by a throng of senators, and the <lb/>
            acclamations of the multitude. Boethius <lb/>
            himself, amid the general applause, de- <lb/>
            livered the public speech in the King's <lb/>
            honour usual on such occasions. Within <lb/>
            a year he was a solitary prisoner at Pavia, <lb/>
            stripped of honours, wealth, and friends, <lb/>
            with death hanging over him, and a terror <lb/>
            worse than death, in the fear lest those <lb/>
            dearest to him should be involved in the <lb/>
            worst results of his downfall. It is in this <lb/>
            situation that the opening of the ' Consola- <lb/>
            tion of Philosophy' brings Boethius before <lb/>
            us. He represents himself as seated in his <lb/>
            prison distraught with grief, indignant at the <lb/>
            injustice of his misfortunes, and seeking <lb/>
            relief for his melancholy in writing verses <lb/>
            descriptive of his condition. Suddenly <lb/>
            there appears to him the Divine figure of <lb/>
            Philosophy, in the guise of a woman of <lb/>
            superhuman dignity and beauty, who by a <lb/>
            succession of discourses convinces him of <lb/>
            the vanity of regret for the lost gifts of <lb/>
            fortune, raises his mind once more to the <lb/>
            contemplation of the true good, and makes <lb/>
            clear to him the mystery of the world's <lb/>
            moral government.</p>

          <p>Boethius' complaint (SongI.).—CH. I. Philosophy <lb/>
            appears to Boethius, drives away the Muses <lb/>
            of Poetry, and herself laments (Song II.) the <lb/>
            disordered condition of his mind.-CH. II. <lb/>
            Boethius is speechless with amazement. <lb/>
            Philosophy wipes away the tears that have <lb/>
            clouded his eyesight.—CH. III. Boethius <lb/>
            recognises his mistress Philosophy. To his <lb/>
            wondering inquiries she explains her presence, <lb/>
            and recalls to his mind the persecutions to <lb/>
            which Philosophy has oftentimes from of <lb/>
            old been subjected by an ignorant world.- <lb/>
            CH. IV. Philosophy bids Boethius declare his <lb/>
            griefs.. He relates the story of his unjust <lb/>
            accusation and ruin. He concludes with a <lb/>
            prayer (Song V.) that the moral disorder in <lb/>
            human affairs may be set right.—CH. V. Phi- <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            losophy admits the justice of Boethius' self- <lb/>
            vindication, but grieves rather for the un- <lb/>
            happy change in his mind. She will first <lb/>
            tranquillize his spirit by soothing remedies. <lb/>
            —CH. VI. Philosophy tests Boethius' mental <lb/>
            state by certain questions, and discovers three <lb/>
            chief causes of his soul's sickness : (i) He has <lb/>
            forgotten his own true nature; (2) he knows <lb/>
            not the end towards which the whole universe <lb/>
            tends ; (3) he knows not the means by which <lb/>
            the world is governed.</p>

            Smoothly once in happier days, <lb/>
            Now perforce in tears and sadness <lb/>
            Learn a mournful strain to raise. <lb/>
            Lo, the Muses, grief-dishevelled, <lb/>
            Guide my pen and voice my woe; <lb/>
            Down their cheeks unfeigned the tear <lb/>
            drops <lb/>
            To my sad complainings flow! <lb/>
            These alone in dangers hour <lb/>
            Faithful found, have dared attend <lb/>
            On the footsteps of the exile <lb/>
            To his lonely journey's end. <note type="footnote"> I—2 </note> <lb/>

            These that were the pride and pleasure <lb/>
            . Of my youth and high estate <lb/>
            Still remain the only solace <lb/>
            Of the old man's mournful fate. <lb/>
            Old ? Ah yes ; swift, ere I knew it, <lb/>
            By these sorrows on me pressed <lb/>
            Age hath come ; lo, Grief hath bid me <lb/>
            Wear the garb that fits her best. <lb/>
            O'er my head untimely sprinkled <lb/>
            These white hairs my woes proclaim, <lb/>
            And the skin hangs loose and shrivelled <lb/>
            On this sorrow-shrunken frame. <lb/>
            Blest is death that intervenes not <lb/>
            In the sweet, sweet years of peace, <lb/>
            But unto the broken-hearted, <lb/>
            When they call him, brings release ! <lb/>
            Yet Death passes by the wretched, <lb/>
            Shuts his ear and slumbers deep ; <lb/>
            Will not heed the cry of anguish, <lb/>
            Will not close the eyes that weep. <lb/>
            For, while yet inconstant Fortune <lb/>
            Poured her gifts and all was bright, <lb/>
            Death's dark hour had all but whelmed <lb/>
            me <lb/>
            In the gloom of endless night. <lb/>
            Now, because misfortune's shadow <lb/>
            Hath o'erclouded that false face, <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            Cruel Life still halts and lingers, <lb/>
            Though I loathe his weary race. <lb/>
            Friends, why did ye once so lightly <lb/>
            Vaunt me happy among men ? <lb/>
            Surely he who so hath fallen <lb/>

          <p>While I was thus mutely pondering <lb/>
            within myself, and recording my sorrowful <lb/>
            complainings with my pen, it seemed to <lb/>
            me that there appeared above my head a <lb/>
            woman of a countenance exceeding vener- <lb/>
            able. Her eyes were bright as fire, and <lb/>
            of a more than human keenness; her <lb/>
            complexion was lively, her vigour showed <lb/>
            no trace of enfeeblement; and yet her <lb/>
            years were right full, and she plainly <lb/>
            seemed not of our age and time. Her <lb/>
            stature was difficult to judge. At one <lb/>
            moment it exceeded not the common <lb/>
            height, at another her forehead seemed to <lb/>
            strike the sky; and whenever she raised <lb/>
            her head higher, she began to pierce <lb/>
            within the very heavens, and to baffle the <lb/>
            eyes of them that looked upon her. Her <lb/>
            garments were of an imperishable fabric, <lb/>
            wrought with the finest threads and of the <lb/>
            most delicate workmanship; and these, as <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            her own lips afterwards assured me, she <lb/>
            had herself woven with her own hands. <lb/>
            The beauty of this vesture had been <lb/>
            somewhat tarnished by age and neglect, <lb/>
            and wore that dingy look which marble <lb/>
            contracts from exposure. On the lower- <lb/>
            most edge was inwoven the Greek letter <lb/>
            IT, on the topmost the letter 0,* and <lb/>
            between the two were to be seen steps, <lb/>
            like a staircase, from the lower to <lb/>
            the upper letter. This robe, moreover, <lb/>
            had been torn by the hands of violent <lb/>
            persons, who had each snatched away <lb/>
            what he could clutch.f Her right hand <lb/>
            held a note-book; in her left she bore <lb/>
            a staff. And when she saw the Muses of <lb/>
            Poesie standing by my bedside, dictating <lb/>
            the words of my lamentations, she was <lb/>
            moved awhile to wrath, and her eyes <lb/>
            flashed sternly. 'Who,' said she, 'has <lb/>
            allowed yon play-acting wantons to ap- <lb/>
            proach this sick man—these who, so far <note type="footnote"> * IT (P) stands for the Political life, the life of <lb/>

            from giving medicine to heal his malady, <lb/>
            even feed it with sweet poison ? These <lb/>
            it is who kill the rich crop of reason with <lb/>
            the barren thorns of passion, who accus- <lb/>
            tom men's minds to disease, instead of <lb/>
            setting them free. Now, were it some <lb/>
            common man whom your allurements were <lb/>
            seducing, as is usually your way, I should <lb/>
            be less indignant. On such a one I <lb/>
            should not have spent my pains for naught. <lb/>
            But this is one nurtured in the Eleatic <lb/>
            and Academic philosophies. Nay, get ye <lb/>
            gone, ye sirens, whose sweetness lasteth <lb/>
            not; leave him for my muses to tend and <lb/>
            heal!' At these words of upbraiding, the <lb/>
            whole band, in deepened sadness, with <lb/>
            downcast eyes, and blushes that confessed <lb/>
            their shame, dolefully left the chamber.</p>
          <p>But I, because my sight was dimmed <lb/>
            with much weeping, and I could not tell <lb/>
            who was this woman of authority so com- <lb/>
            manding—I was dumfoundered, and, with <lb/>
            my gaze fastened on the earth, continued <lb/>
            silently to await what she might do next. <lb/>
            Then she drew near me and sat on the <lb/>
            edge of my couch, and, looking into my <lb/>
            face all heavy with grief and fixed in sad- <lb/>

          <p>Yet once he ranged the open heavens, <lb/>
            The sun's bright pathway tracked ; <lb/>
            Watched how the cold moon waxed and <lb/>

          <p>' But the time,' said she, ' calls rather <lb/>
            for healing than for lamentation.' Then, <lb/>
            with her eyes bent full upon me, 'Art <lb/>
            thou that man,' she cries, ' who, erstwhile <lb/>
            fed with the milk and reared upon the <lb/>
            nourishment which is mine to give, had <lb/>
            grown up to the full vigour of a manly <lb/>
            spirit? And yet I had bestowed such <lb/>
            armour on thee as would have proved an <lb/>
            invincible defence, hadst thou not first <lb/>
            cast it away. Dost thou know me ? Why <lb/>
            art thou silent ? Is it shame or amaze- <lb/>
            ment that hath struck thee dumb ? Would <lb/>
            it were shame; but, as I see, a stupor <lb/>
            hath seized upon thee.' Then, when she <lb/>
            saw me not only answering nothing, but <lb/>
            mute and utterly incapable of speech, she <lb/>
            gently touched my breast with her hand, <lb/>
            and said : ' There is no danger; these are <lb/>

          <p>Even so the clouds of my melancholy <lb/>
            were broken up. I saw the clear sky, and <lb/>
            regained the power to recognise the face <lb/>
            of my physician. Accordingly, when I <lb/>
            had lifted my eyes and fixed my gaze <lb/>
            upon her, I beheld my nurse, Philosophy, <lb/>
            whose halls I had frequented from my <lb/>
            youth up.</p>
          <p>'Ah! why,' I cried, 'mistress of all <lb/>

            of my name, by sharing this trouble? <lb/>
            Even forgetting that it were not lawful <lb/>
            for Philosophy to leave companionless the <lb/>

            for the first time in an evil age, Wisdom <lb/>
            hath been assailed by peril ? Did I not <lb/>
            often in days of old, before my servant <lb/>
            Plato lived, wage stern warfare with the <lb/>
            rashness of folly? In his lifetime, too, <lb/>
            Socrates, his master, won with my aid the <lb/>
            victory of an unjust death. And when, <lb/>
            one after the other, the Epicurean herd, <lb/>
            the Stoic, and the rest, each of them as <lb/>
            far as in them lay, went about to seize the <lb/>
            heritage he left, and were dragging me off <lb/>
            protesting and resisting, as their booty, <lb/>
            they tore in pieces the garment which I <lb/>
            had woven with my own hands, and, <lb/>
            clutching the torn pieces, went off, be- <lb/>
            lieving that the whole of me had passed <lb/>
            into their possession. And some of them, <lb/>
            because some traces of my vesture were <lb/>
            seen upon them, were destroyed through <lb/>
            the mistake of the lewd multitude, who <lb/>
            falsely deemed them to be my disciples. <lb/>

            whose stories are neither old nor unknown <lb/>
            to fame. These men were brought to <lb/>
            destruction for no other reason than that, <lb/>
            settled as they were in my principles, their <lb/>
            lives were a manifest contrast to the ways <lb/>
            of the wicked. So there is nothing thou <lb/>
            shouldst wonder at, if on the seas of this <lb/>
            life we are tossed by storm-blasts, seeing <lb/>
            that we have made it our chiefest aim to <lb/>
            refuse compliance with evil-doers. And <lb/>
            though, maybe, the host of the wicked is <lb/>
            many in number, yet is it contemptible, <lb/>
            since it is under no leadership, but is <lb/>
            hurried hither and thither at the blind <lb/>
            driving of mad error.. And if at times and <lb/>
            seasons they set in array against us, and <lb/>
            fall on in overwhelming strength, our <lb/>
            leader draws off her forces into the citadel <lb/>
            while they are busy plundering the useless <lb/>
            baggage. But we from our vantage ground, <lb/>
            safe from all this wild work, laugh to see <lb/>
            them making prize of the most valueless <lb/>
            of things, protected by a bulwark which <lb/>
            aggressive folly may not aspire to reach.'</p><pb n="16"/>

          <p>Then I, gathering together what <lb/>
            strength I could, began : ' Is there still <lb/>
            need of telling? Is not the cruelty of <lb/>
            fortune against me plain enough ? Doth <lb/>
            not the very aspect of this place move <lb/>
            thee? Is this the library, the room <lb/>
            which thou hadst chosen as thy constant <lb/>
            resort in my home, the place where we so <lb/>
            often sat together and held discourse of <lb/>
            all things in heaven and earth ? Was my <lb/>
            garb and mien like this when I explored <lb/>
            with thee nature's hid secrets, and thou <note type="footnote"> 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            didst trace for me with thy wand the <lb/>
            courses of the stars, moulding the while <lb/>
            my character and the whole conduct of <lb/>
            my life after the pattern of the celestial <lb/>
            order ? Is this the recompense of my <lb/>
            obedience? Yet thou hast enjoined by <lb/>
            Plato's mouth the maxim, " that states <lb/>
            would be happy, either if philosophers <lb/>
            ruled them, or if it should so befall that <lb/>
            their rulers would turn philosophers." <lb/>
            By his mouth likewise thou didst point <lb/>
            out this imperative reason why philoso- <lb/>
            phers should enter public life, to wit, lest, <lb/>
            if the reins of government be left to un- <lb/>
            principled and profligate citizens, trouble <lb/>
            and destruction should come upon the <lb/>
            good. Following these precepts, I have <lb/>
            tried to apply in the business of public <lb/>
            administration the principles which I <lb/>
            learnt from thee in leisured seclusion. <lb/>
            Thou art my witness and that divinity <lb/>
            who hath implanted thee in the hearts of <lb/>
            the wise, that I brought to my duties no <lb/>
            aim but zeal for the public good. For <lb/>
            this cause I have become involved in <lb/>
            bitter and irreconcilable feuds, and, as <lb/>
            happens inevitably, if a man holds fast <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            to the independence of conscience, I have <lb/>
            had to think nothing of giving offence to <lb/>
            the powerful in the cause of justice. How <lb/>
            often have I encountered and balked <lb/>
            Conigastus in his assaults on the fortunes <lb/>
            of the weak ? How often have I thwarted <lb/>
            Trigguilla, steward of the king's house- <lb/>
            hold, even when his villainous schemes <lb/>
            were as good as accomplished? How <lb/>
            often have I risked my position and <lb/>
            influence to protect poor wretches from <lb/>
            the false charges innumerable with which <lb/>
            they were for ever being harassed by the <lb/>
            greed and license of the barbarians ? No <lb/>
            one has ever drawn me aside from justice <lb/>
            to oppression. When ruin was overtaking <lb/>
            the fortunes of the provincials through the <lb/>
            combined pressure of private rapine and <lb/>
            public taxation, I grieved no less than the <lb/>
            sufferers. When at a season of grievous <lb/>
            scarcity a forced sale, disastrous as it was <lb/>
            unjustifiable, was proclaimed, and threat- <lb/>
            ened to overwhelm Campania with starv- <lb/>
            ation, I embarked on a struggle with the <lb/>
            praetorian prefect in the public interest, <lb/>
            I fought the case at the king's judgment- <lb/>
            seat, and succeeded in preventing the en- <note type="footnote"> 2-2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            forcement of the sale. I rescued the <lb/>
            consular Paulinus from the gaping jaws of <lb/>
            the court bloodhounds, who in their <lb/>
            covetous hopes had already made short <lb/>
            work of his wealth. To save Albinus, <lb/>
            who was of the same exalted rank, from <lb/>
            the penalties of a prejudged charge, I <lb/>
            exposed myself to the hatred of Cyprian, <lb/>
            the informer.</p>
          <p>' Thinkest thou I had laid up for my- <lb/>
            self store of enmities enough ? Well, <lb/>
            with the rest of my countrymen, at any <lb/>
            rate, my safety should have been assured, <lb/>
            since my love of justice had left me no <lb/>
            hope of security at court. Yet who was <lb/>
            it brought the charges by which I have <lb/>
            been struck down ? Why, one of my <lb/>
            accusers is Basil, who, after being dis- <lb/>
            missed from the king's household, was <lb/>
            driven by his debts to lodge an informa- <lb/>
            tion against my name. There is Opilio, <lb/>
            there is Gaudentius, men who for many <lb/>
            and various offences the king's sentence <lb/>
            had condemned to banishment; and <lb/>
            when they declined to obey, and sought <lb/>
            to save themselves by taking sanctuary, <lb/>
            the king, as soon as he heard of it, de- <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            creed that, if they did not depart from the <lb/>
            city of Ravenna within a prescribed time, <lb/>
            they should be branded on the forehead <lb/>
            and expelled. What would exceed the <lb/>
            rigour of this severity? And yet on that <lb/>
            same day these very men lodged an infor- <lb/>
            mation against me, and the information <lb/>
            was admitted. Just Heaven ! had I de-' <lb/>
            served this by my way of life ? Did it <lb/>
            make them fit accusers that my condem- <lb/>
            nation was a foregone conclusion ? Has <lb/>
            fortune no shame-if not at the accusation <lb/>
            of the innocent, at least for the vileness <lb/>
            of the accusers? Perhaps thou wonder- <lb/>
            est what is the sum of the charges laid <lb/>
            against me ? I wished, they say, to save <lb/>
            the senate. But how? I am accused <lb/>
            of hindering an informer from producing <lb/>
            evidence to prove the senate guilty of <lb/>
            treason. Tell ine, then, what is thy <lb/>
            counsel, 0 my mistress. Shall I deny <lb/>
            the charge, lest I bring shame on thee ? <lb/>
            But I did wish it, and I shall never cease <lb/>
            to wish it. Shall I admit it ? Then the <lb/>
            work of thwarting the informer will come <lb/>
            to an end. Shall I call the wish for the <lb/>
            preservation of that illustrious house a <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            crime? Of a truth the senate, by its <lb/>
            decrees concerning me, has made it such ! <lb/>
            But blind folly, though it deceive itself <lb/>
            with false names, cannot alter the true <lb/>
            merits of things, and, mindful of the pre- <lb/>
            cept of Socrates, I do not think it right <lb/>
            either to keep the truth concealed or <lb/>
            allow falsehood to pass. But this, how- <lb/>
            ever it may be, I leave to thy judgment <lb/>
            and to the verdict of the discerning. <lb/>
            Moreover, lest the course of events and <lb/>
            the true facts should be hidden from <lb/>
            posterity, I have myself committed to <lb/>
            writing an account of the transaction.</p>
          <p>' What need to speak of the forged <lb/>
            letters by which an attempt is made to <lb/>
            prove that I hoped for the freedom of <lb/>
            Rome? Their falsity would have been <lb/>
            manifest, if I had been allowed to use the <lb/>
            confession of the informers themselves, <lb/>
            evidence which has in all matters the <lb/>
            most convincing force. Why, what hope <lb/>
            of freedom is left to us ? Would there <lb/>
            were any ! I should have answered with <lb/>
            the epigram of Canius when Caligula <lb/>
            declared him to have been cognisant of <lb/>
            a conspiracy against him. " If I had <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            known," said he, " thou shouldst never <lb/>
            have known." Grief hath not so blunted <lb/>
            my perceptions in this matter that I • <lb/>
            should complain because impious wretches <lb/>
            contrive their villainies against the virtu- <lb/>
            ous, but at their achievement of their <lb/>
            hopes I do exceedingly marvel. For evil <lb/>
            purposes are, perchance, due to the im- <lb/>
            perfection of human nature; that it <lb/>
            should be possible for scoundrels to carry <lb/>
            out their worst schemes against the inno- <lb/>
            cent, while God beholdeth, is verily mon- <lb/>
            strous. For this cause, not without <lb/>
            reason, one of thy disciples asked, " If <lb/>
            God exists, whence comes evil ? Yet <lb/>
            whence comes good, if He exists not ?" <lb/>
            However, it might well be that wretches <lb/>
            who seek the blood of all honest men and <lb/>
            of the whole senate should wish to <lb/>
            destroy me also, whom they saw to be a <lb/>
            bulwark of the senate and all honest men. <lb/>
            But did I deserve such a fate from the <lb/>
            Fathers also ? Thou rememberest, me- <lb/>
            thinks-since thou didst ever stand by <lb/>
            my side to direct what I should do or <lb/>
            say-thou rememberest, I say, how at <lb/>
            Verona, when the king, eager for the <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            general destruction, was bent on impli- <lb/>
            cating the whole senatorial order in the <lb/>
            charge of treason brought against Albinus, <lb/>
            with what indifference to my own peril <lb/>
            I maintained the innocence of its mem- <lb/>
            bers, one and all. Thou knowest that <lb/>
            what I say is the truth, and that I have <lb/>
            never boasted of my good deeds in a <lb/>
            spirit of self-praise. For whenever a man <lb/>
            by proclaiming his good deeds receives <lb/>
            the recompense of fame, he diminishes in <lb/>
            a measure the secret reward of a good <lb/>
            conscience.- What issues have overtaken <lb/>
            my innocency thou seest. Instead of <lb/>
            reaping the rewards of true virtue, I <lb/>
            undergo the penalties of a guilt falsely <lb/>
            laid to my charge—nay, more than this ; <lb/>
            never did an open confession of guilt <lb/>
            cause such unanimous severity among the <lb/>
            assessors, but that some consideration, <lb/>
            either of the mere frailty of human <lb/>
            nature, or of fortune's universal instability, <lb/>
            availed to soften the verdict of some few. <lb/>
            Had I been accused of a design to fire <lb/>
            the temples, to slaughter the priests with <lb/>
            impious sword, of plotting the massacre of <lb/>
            all honest men, I should yet have been <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            produced in court, and only punished on <lb/>
            due confession or conviction. Now for <lb/>
            my too great zeal towards the senate I <lb/>
            have been condemned to outlawry and <lb/>
            death, unheard and undefended, at a <lb/>
            distance of near five hundred miles <lb/>
            away.* Oh, my judges, well do ye de- <lb/>
            serve that no one should hereafter be <lb/>
            convicted of a fault like mine !</p>
          <p>'Yet even my very accusers saw how <lb/>
            honourable was the charge they brought <lb/>
            against me, and, in order to overlay it <lb/>
            with some shadow of guilt, they falsely <lb/>
            asserted that in the pursuit of my am- <lb/>
            bition I had stained my conscience with <lb/>
            sacrilegious acts. And yet thy spirit, in- <lb/>
            dwelling in me, had driven from the <lb/>
            chamber of my soul all lust of earthly <lb/>
            success, and with thine eye ever upon me, <lb/>
            there could be no place left for sacrilege. <lb/>
            For thou didst daily repeat in my ear and <lb/>
            instil into my mind the Pythagorean <lb/>
            maxim, " Follow after God." It was not <lb/>
            likely, then, that I should covet the assist- <lb/>
            ance of the vilest spirits, when thou wert <note type="footnote"> * The distance from Rome to Pavia, the place <lb/>
            of Boethius* imprisonment, is 455 Roman miles. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            moulding me to such an excellence as <lb/>
            should conform me to the likeness of <lb/>
            God. Again, the innocency of the inner <lb/>
            sanctuary of my home, the company of <lb/>
            friends of the highest probity, a father-in- <lb/>
            law revered at once for his pure character <lb/>
            and his active beneficence, shield me <lb/>
            from the very suspicion of sacrilege. Yet <lb/>
            -atrocious as it is-they even draw cre- <lb/>
            dence for this charge from thee; I am <lb/>
            like to be thought implicated in wicked- <lb/>
            ness on this very account, that I am <lb/>
            imbued with thy teachings and stablished <lb/>
            in thy ways. So it is not enough that my <lb/>
            devotion to thee should profit me nothing, <lb/>
            but thou also must be assailed by reason <lb/>
            of the odium which I have incurred. <lb/>
            Verily this is the very crown of my mis- <lb/>
            fortunes, that men's opinions for the most <lb/>
            part look not to real merit, but to the <lb/>
            event; and only recognise foresight where <lb/>
            Fortune has crowned the issue with her <lb/>
            approval. Whereby it comes to pass that <lb/>
            reputation is the first of all things to <lb/>
            abandon the unfortunate. I remember <lb/>
            with chagrin how perverse is popular <lb/>
            report, how various and discordant men's <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            judgments. This only will I say, that the <lb/>
            most crushing of misfortune's burdens is, <lb/>
            that as soon as a charge is fastened upon <lb/>
            the unhappy, they are believed to have <lb/>
            deserved their sufferings. I, for my part, <lb/>
            who have been banished from all life's <lb/>
            blessings, stripped of my honours, stained <lb/>
            in repute, am punished for well-doing.</p>
          <p>' And now methinks I see the villainous <lb/>
            dens of the wicked surging with joy and <lb/>
            gladness, all the most recklessly un- <lb/>
            scrupulous threatening a new crop of <lb/>
            lying informations, the good prostrate <lb/>
            with terror at my danger, every ruffian <lb/>
            incited by impunity to new daring and to <lb/>
            success by the profits of audacity, the <lb/>
            guiltless not only robbed of their peace of <lb/>
            mind, but even of all means of defence. <lb/>
            Wherefore I would fain cry out:</p>

          <p>When I had poured out ray griefs in <lb/>
            this long and unbroken strain of lamenta- <lb/>
            tion, she, with calm countenance, and in <lb/>
            no wise disturbed at my complainings, <lb/>
            thus spake:</p>
          <p>' When I saw thee sorrowful, in tears, <lb/>
            I straightway knew thee wretched and an <lb/>
            exile. But how far distant that exile I <lb/>
            should not know, had not thine own <lb/>
            speech revealed it. Yet how far indeed <lb/>
            from thy country hast thou, not been <lb/>
            banished, but rather hast strayed; or, if <lb/>
            thou wilt have it banishment, hast <lb/>
            banished thyself! For no one else could <lb/>
            ever lawfully have had this power over <lb/>
            thee. Now, if thou wilt call to mind from <lb/>
            what country thou art sprung, it is not <lb/>
            ruled, as once was the Athenian polity, by <lb/>
            the sovereignty of the multitude, but " one <lb/>
            is its Ruler, one its King," who takes de- <lb/>
            light in the number of His citizens, not in <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            their banishment ; to submit to whose <lb/>
            governance and to obey whose ordin- <lb/>
            ances is perfect freedom. Art thou <lb/>
            ignorant of that most ancient law of this <lb/>
            thy country, whereby it is decreed that <lb/>
            no one whatsoever, who hath chosen to <lb/>
            fix there his dwelling, may be sent into <lb/>
            exile? For truly there is no fear that <lb/>
            one who is encompassed by its ramparts <lb/>
            and defences should deserve to be exiled. <lb/>
            But he who has ceased to wish to dwell <lb/>
            therein, he likewise ceases to deserve to <lb/>
            do so. And so it is not so much the <lb/>
            aspect of this place which moves me, as <lb/>
            thy aspect; not so much the library walls <lb/>
            set off with glass and ivory which I miss, <lb/>
            as the chamber of thy mind, wherein I <lb/>
            once placed, not books, but that which <lb/>
            gives books their value, the doctrines <lb/>
            which my books contain. Now, what <lb/>
            thou hast said of thy services to the <lb/>
            commonweal is true, only too little com- <lb/>
            pared with the greatness of thy deservings. <lb/>
            The things laid to thy charge whereof <lb/>
            thou hast spoken, whether such as re- <lb/>
            dound to thy credit, or mere false accusa- <lb/>
            tions, are publicly known. As for the <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            crimes and deceits of the informers, thou <lb/>
            hast rightly deemed it fitting to pass them <lb/>
            over lightly, because the popular voice <lb/>
            hath better and more fully pronounced <lb/>
            upon them. Thou hast bitterly com- <lb/>
            plained of the injustice of the senate. <lb/>
            ' Thou hast grieved over my calumniation, <lb/>
            and likewise hast lamented the damage to <lb/>
            my good name. Finally, thine indigna- <lb/>
            tion blazed forth against fortune; thou <lb/>
            hast complained of the unfairness with <lb/>
            which thy merits have been recompensed. <lb/>
            Last of all thy frantic muse framed a <lb/>
            prayer that the peace which reigns in <lb/>
            heaven might rule earth also. But <lb/>
            since a throng of tumultuous passions <lb/>
            hath assailed thy soul, since thou art dis- <lb/>
            traught with anger, pain, and grief, strong <lb/>
            remedies are not proper for thee in this <lb/>
            thy present mood. And so for a time I <lb/>
            will use milder methods, that the tumours <lb/>
            which have grown hard through the influx <lb/>
            of disturbing passion may be softened by <lb/>
            gentle treatment, till they can bear the <lb/>
            force of sharper remedies.'</p><pb n="33"/>

          <p>' First, then, wilt thou suffer me by a <lb/>
            few questions to make some attempt to <lb/>
            test the state of thy mind, that I may learn <lb/>
            in what way to set about thy cure ?'</p>
          <p>{ Ask what thou wilt,' said I, ' for I will <lb/>
            answer whatever questions thou choosest <lb/>
            to put.'</p>
          <p>Then said she : ' This world of ours- <lb/>
            thinkest thou it is governed haphazard and <lb/>
            fortuitously, or believest thou that there is <lb/>
            in it any rational guidance ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay,' said I, ' in no wise may I deem <lb/>
            that such fixed motions can be determined <lb/>
            by random hazard, but I know that God, <lb/>
            the Creator, presideth over His work, nor <lb/>
            will the day ever come that shall drive me <lb/>
            from holding fast the truth of this belief.'</p>
          <p>' Yes,' said she ; ' thou didst even but <lb/>
            now affirm it in song, lamenting that men <lb/>
            alone had no portion in the divine care. <lb/>
            As to the rest, thou wert unshaken in the <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            belief that they were ruled by reason. <lb/>
            Yet I marvel exceedingly how, in spite of <lb/>
            thy firm hold on this opinion, thou art <lb/>
            fallen into sickness. But let us probe <lb/>
            more deeply : something or other is miss- <lb/>
            ing, I think. Now, tell me, since thou <lb/>
            doubtest not that God governs the world, <lb/>
            dost thou perceive by what means He <lb/>
            rules it ?'</p>
          <p>' I scarcely understand what thou <lb/>
            meanest,' I said, ' much less can I answer <lb/>
            thy question.'</p>
          <p>' Did I not say truly that something is <lb/>
            missing, whereby, as through a breach in <lb/>
            the ramparts, disease hath crept in to dis- <lb/>
            turb thy mind? But, tell me, dost thou <lb/>
            remember the universal end towards which <lb/>
            the aim of all nature is directed ?'</p>
          <p>' I once heard,' said I, ' but sorrow hath <lb/>
            dulled my recollection.'</p>
          <p>' And yet thou knowest whence all <lb/>
            things have proceeded.'</p>
          <p>'Yes, that I know,' said I, 'and have <lb/>
            answered that it is from God.'</p>
          <p>' Yet how is it possible that thou knowest <lb/>
            not what is the end of existence, when <lb/>
            thou dost understand its source and origin? <note type="footnote"> 3-2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            However, these disturbances of mind have <lb/>
            force to shake a man's position, but cannot <lb/>
            pluck him up and root him altogether out <lb/>
            of himself. But answer this also, I pray <lb/>
            thee : rememberest thou that thou art a <lb/>
            man?'</p>
          <p>' How should I not ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' Then, canst thou say what man is ?'</p>
          <p>, Is this thy question : Whether I know <lb/>
            myself for a being endowed with reason <lb/>
            and subject to death? Surely I do ac- <lb/>
            knowledge myself such.'</p>
          <p>Then she: ' Dost know nothing else <lb/>
            that thou art ?'</p>
          <p>' Nothing.'</p>
          <p>' Now,' said she, ' I know another cause <lb/>
            of thy disease, one, too, of grave moment. <lb/>
            Thou hast ceased to know thy own nature. <lb/>
            So, then, I have made full discovery both <lb/>
            of the causes of thy sickness and the <lb/>
            means of restoring thy health. It is <lb/>
            because forgetfulness of thyself hath be- <lb/>
            wildered thy mind that thou hast bewailed <lb/>
            thee as an exile, as one stripped of the <lb/>
            blessings that were his; it is because thou <lb/>
            knowest not the end of existence that thou <lb/>
            deemest abominable and wicked men to <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            be happy and powerful; while, because <lb/>
            thou hast forgotten by what means the <lb/>
            earth is governed, thou deemest that for- <lb/>
            tune's changes ebb and flow without the <lb/>
            restraint of a guiding hand. These are <lb/>
            serious enough to cause not sickness only, <lb/>
            but even death; but, thanks be to the <lb/>
            Author of our health, the light of nature <lb/>
            hath not yet left thee utterly. In thy true <lb/>
            judgment concerning the world's govern- <lb/>
            ment, in that thou believest it subject, not <lb/>
            to the random drift of chance, but to <lb/>
            divine reason, we have the divine spark <lb/>
            from which thy recovery may be hoped. <lb/>
            Have, then, no fear; from these weak <lb/>
            embers the vital heat shall once more be <lb/>
            kindled within thee. But seeing that it <lb/>
            is not yet time for strong remedies, and <lb/>
            that the mind is manifestly so constituted <lb/>
            that when it casts off true opinions it <lb/>
            straightway puts on false, wherefrom arises <lb/>
            a cloud of confusion that disturbs its true <lb/>
            vision, I will now try and disperse these <lb/>
            mists by mild and soothing application, <lb/>
            that so the darkness of misleading passion <lb/>
            may be scattered, and thou mayst come <lb/>

            Her very nature is caprice.—CH. II. Philo- <lb/>
            sophy in Fortune's name replies to Boethius' <lb/>

            CH. III. Boethius falls back upon his present <lb/>

            the lot of the unhappy. Philosophy shows <lb/>
            that much is still left for which he may be <lb/>
            thankful. None enjoy perfect satisfaction <lb/>
            with their lot. But happiness depends not <lb/>
            on anything which Fortune can give. It is <lb/>
            to be sought within.—CH. V. All the gifts of <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            Fortune are external; they can never truly <lb/>
            be our own. Man cannot find his good in <lb/>
            worldly possessions. Riches bring anxiety <lb/>
            and trouble.—CH. VI. High place without <lb/>
            virtue is an evil, not a good. Power is an <lb/>
            empty name.—CH. VII. Fame is a thing of <lb/>
            little account when compared with the im- <lb/>
            mensity of the Universe and the endlessness <lb/>
            of Time.—CH. VIII. One service only can <lb/>
            Fortune do, when she reveals her own nature <lb/>
            and distinguishes true friends from false.</p>

          <p>THEREAFTER for awhile she re- <lb/>
            mained silent; and when she <lb/>
            had restored my flagging atten- <lb/>
            tion by a moderate pause in her discourse, <lb/>
            she thus began: I If I have thoroughly <lb/>
            ascertained the character and causes of thy <lb/>
            sickness, thou art pining with regretful <lb/>
            longing for thy former fortune. It is the <lb/>
            change, as thou deemest, of this fortune <lb/>
            that hath so wrought upon thy mind. <lb/>
            Well do I understand that Siren's mani- <lb/>
            fold wiles, the fatal charm of the friendship <lb/>
            she pretends for her victims, so long as <lb/>
            she is scheming to entrap them-how she <lb/>
            unexpectedly abandons them and leaves <lb/>
            them overwhelmed with insupportable <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            grief. Bethink thee of her nature, char- <lb/>
            acter, and deserts, and thou wilt soon <lb/>
            acknowledge that in her thou hast neither <lb/>
            possessed, nor hast thou lost, aught of any <lb/>
            worth. Methinks I need not spend much <lb/>
            pains in bringing this to thy mind, since, <lb/>
            even when she was still with thee, even <lb/>
            while she was caressing thee, thou usedst <lb/>
            to assail her in manly terms, to rebuke her, <lb/>
            with maxims drawn from my holy treasure- <lb/>
            house. But all sudden changes of circum- <lb/>
            stances bring inevitably a certain commo- <lb/>
            tion of spirit. Thus it hath come to pass <lb/>
            that thou also for awhile hast been parted <lb/>
            from thy mind's tranquillity. But it is <lb/>
            time for thee to take and drain a draught, <lb/>
            soft and pleasant to the taste, which, as it <lb/>
            penetrates within, may prepare the way for <lb/>
            stronger potions. Wherefore I call to my <lb/>
            aid the sweet persuasiveness of Rhetoric, <lb/>
            who then only walketh in the right way <lb/>
            when she forsakes not my instructions, <lb/>
            and Music, my handmaid, I bid to join <lb/>
            with her singing, now in lighter, now in <lb/>
            graver strain.</p>
          <p>'What is it, then, poor mortal, that hath <lb/>
            cast thee into lamentation and mourning ? <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            Some strange, unwonted sight, methinks, <lb/>
            have thine eyes seen. Thou deemest <lb/>
            Fortune to have changed towards thee; <lb/>
            thou mistakest. Such ever were her ways, <lb/>
            . ever such her nature. Rather in her <lb/>
            very mutability hath she preserved towards <lb/>
            thee her true constancy. Such was she <lb/>
            when she loaded thee with caresses, when <lb/>
            she deluded thee with the allurements of <lb/>
            a false happiness. Thou hast found out <lb/>
            how changeful is the face of the blind <lb/>
            goddess. She who still veils herself from <lb/>
            others hath fully discovered to thee her <lb/>
            whole character. If thou likest her, take <lb/>
            her as she is, and do not complain. If <lb/>
            thou abhorrest her perfidy, turn from her <lb/>
            in disdain, renounce her, for baneful are <lb/>
            her delusions. The very thing which is <lb/>
            now the cause of thy great grief ought to <lb/>
            have brought thee tranquillity. Thou <lb/>
            hast been forsaken by one of whom no <lb/>
            one can be sure that she will not forsake <lb/>
            him. Or dost thou indeed set value on a <lb/>
            happiness that is certain to depart ? Again <lb/>
            I ask, Is Fortune's presence dear to thee <lb/>
            if she cannot be trusted to stay, and though <lb/>
            she will bring sorrow when she is gone ? <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            Why, if she cannot be kept at pleasure, <lb/>
            and if her flight overwhelms with calamity, <lb/>
            what is this fleeting visitant but a token of <lb/>
            coming trouble? Truly it is not enough <lb/>
            to look only at what lies before the eyes; <lb/>
            wisdom gauges the issues of things, and <lb/>
            this same mutability, with its two aspects, <lb/>
            makes the threats of Fortune void of terror, <lb/>
            and her caresses little to be desired. <lb/>
            Finally, thou oughtest to bear with what- <lb/>
            ever takes place within the boundaries of <lb/>
            Fortune's demesne, when thou hast placed <lb/>
            thy head beneath her yoke. But if thou <lb/>
            wishest to impose a law of staying and <lb/>
            departing on her whom thou hast of thine <lb/>
            own accord chosen for thy mistress, art <lb/>
            thou not acting wrongfully, art thou not <lb/>
            embittering by impatience a lot which <lb/>
            thou canst not alter ? Didst thou commit <lb/>
            thy sails to the winds, thou wouldst voyage <lb/>
            not whither thy intention was to go, but <lb/>
            whither the winds drave thee ; didst thou <lb/>
            entrust thy seed to the fields, thou wouldst <lb/>
            set off the fruitful years against the barren. <lb/>
            Thou hast resigned thyself to the sway of <lb/>
            Fortune; thou must submit to thy mis- <lb/>
            tress's caprices. What! art thou verily <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            striving to stay the swing of the revolving <lb/>
            wheel ? Oh, stupidest of mortals, if it <lb/>
            takes to standing still, it ceases to be the <lb/>
            wheel of Fortune.'</p>

          <p>Mad Fortune sweeps along in wanton <lb/>
            pride, <lb/>
            Uncertain as Euripus' surging tide ; <lb/>
            Now tramples mighty kings beneath her <lb/>
            feet; <lb/>
            Now sets the conquered in the victor's <lb/>
            seat. <lb/>
            She heedeth not the wail of hapless woe, <lb/>
            But mocks the griefs that from her mis- <lb/>
            chief flow. <lb/>
            Such is her sport; so proveth she her <lb/>
            power; <lb/>
            And great the marvel, when in one brief <lb/>
            hour <lb/>
            She shows her darling lifted high in bliss, <lb/>
            Then headlong plunged in misery's abyss.</p><pb n="48"/>

          <p>' Now I would fain also reason with thee <lb/>
            a little in Fortune's own words. Do thou <lb/>
            observe whether her contentions be just. <lb/>
            " Man," she might say, " why dost thou <lb/>
            pursue me with thy daily complainings ? <lb/>
            What wrong have I done thee? What <lb/>
            goods of thine have I taken from thee ? <lb/>
            Choose an thou wilt a judge, and let us <lb/>
            dispute before him concerning the rightful <lb/>
            ownership of wealth and rank. If thou <lb/>
            succeedest in showing that any one of <lb/>
            these things is the true property of mortal <lb/>
            man, I freely grant those things to be thine <lb/>
            which thou claimest. When nature brought <lb/>
            thee forth out of thy mother's womb, I took <lb/>
            thee, naked and destitute as thou wast, I <lb/>
            cherished thee with my substance, and, in <lb/>
            the partiality of my favour for thee, I <lb/>
            brought thee up somewhat too indulgently, <lb/>
            and this it is which now makes thee re- <lb/>
            bellious against me. I surrounded thee <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            with a royal abundance of all those things <lb/>
            that are in my power. Now it is my <lb/>
            pleasure to draw back my hand. Thou <lb/>
            hast reason to thank me for the use of <lb/>
            what was not thine own; thou hast no <lb/>
            right to complain, as if thou hadst lost <lb/>
            what was wholly thine. Why, then, dost <lb/>
            bemoan thyself? I have done thee no <lb/>
            violence. Wealth, honour, and all such <lb/>
            things are placed under my control. My <lb/>
            handmaidens know their mistress; with <lb/>
            me they come, and at my going they <lb/>
            depart. I might boldly affirm that if those., <lb/>
            things the loss of which thou lamentest <lb/>
            had been thine, thou couldst never have <lb/>
            lost them. Am I alone to be forbidden <lb/>
            to do what I will with my own ? Un- <lb/>
            rebuked, the skies now reveal the bright- <lb/>
            ness of day, now shroud the daylight in <lb/>
            the darkness of night; the year may now <lb/>
            engarland the face of the earth with flowers <lb/>
            and fruits, now disfigure it with storms and <lb/>
            cold. The sea is permitted to invite with <lb/>
            smooth and tranquil surface to-day, to- <lb/>
            morrow to roughen with wave and storm. <lb/>
            Shall man's insatiate greed bind me to a <lb/>
            constancy foreign to my character ? This <note type="footnote"> 4 </note> <lb/>

            is my art, this the game I never cease to <lb/>
            play. I turn the wheel that spins. I <lb/>
            delight to see the high come down and <lb/>
            the low ascend. Mount up, if thou wilt, <lb/>
            but only on condition that thou wilt not <lb/>
            think it a hardship to come down when <lb/>
            the rules of my game require it. Wert <lb/>
            thou ignorant of my character ? Didst not <lb/>
            know how Croesus, King of the Lydians, <lb/>
            erstwhile the dreaded rival of Cyrus, was <lb/>
            afterwards pitiably consigned to the flame <lb/>
            of the pyre, and only saved by a shower <lb/>
            sent from heaven? Has it 'scaped thee <lb/>
            how Paullus paid a meed of pious tears <lb/>
            to the misfortunes of King Perseus, his <lb/>
            prisoner? What else do tragedies make <lb/>
            such woeful outcry over save the overthrow <lb/>
            of kingdoms by the indiscriminate strokes <lb/>
            of Fortune ? Didst thou not learn in thy <lb/>
            childhood how there stand at the threshold <lb/>
            of Zeus two jars,' 'the one full of bless- <lb/>
            ings, the other of calamities' ? How if thou <lb/>
            hast drawn over-liberally from the good <lb/>
            jar? What if not even now have I de- <lb/>
            parted wholly from thee? What if this <lb/>
            very mutability of mine is a just ground <lb/>
            for hoping better things ? But listen now, <lb/>

          <p>' If Fortune should plead thus against <lb/>
            thee, assuredly thou wouldst not have one <lb/>
            word to offer in reply ; or, if thou canst <lb/>
            find any justification of thy complainings, <lb/>
            thou must show what it is. I will give <lb/>
            thee space to speak.'</p>

            plausible—yea, steeped in the honeyed <lb/>
            sweetness of music and rhetoric. But <lb/>
            their charm lasts only while they are <lb/>
            sounding in the ear; the sense of his mis- <lb/>
            fortunes lies deeper in the heart of the <lb/>
            wretched. So, when the sound ceases to <lb/>
            vibrate upon the air, the heart's indwelling <lb/>
            sorrow is felt with renewed bitterness.'</p>
          <p>Then said she: ' It is indeed as thou <lb/>
            sayest, for we have not yet come to the <lb/>
            curing of thy sickness ; as yet these are <lb/>
            but lenitives conducing to the treatment <lb/>
            of a malady hitherto obstinate. The <lb/>
            remedies which go deep I will apply in <lb/>
            due season. Nevertheless, to deprecate <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            thy determination to be thought wretched, <lb/>
            I ask thee, Hast thou forgotten the extent <lb/>
            and bounds of thy felicity ? I say nothing <lb/>
            of how, when orphaned and desolate, thou <lb/>
            wast taken into the care of illustrious men; <lb/>
            how thou wast chosen for alliance with <lb/>
            the highest in the state-and even before <lb/>
            thou wert bound to their house by marriage, <lb/>
            wert already dear to their love-which is <lb/>
            the most precious of all ties. Did not all <lb/>
            pronounce thee most happy in the virtues <lb/>
            of thy wife, the splendid honours of her <lb/>
            father, and the blessing of male issue ? I <lb/>
            pass over-for I care not to speak of <lb/>
            blessings in which others also have shared <lb/>
            -the distinctions often denied to age <lb/>
            which thou enjoyedst in thy youth. I <lb/>
            choose rather to come to the unparalleled <lb/>
            culmination of thy good fortune. If the <lb/>
            fruition of any earthly success has weight <lb/>
            in the scale of happiness, can the memory <lb/>
            of that splendour be swept away by any <lb/>
            rising flood of troubles ? That day when <lb/>
            thou didst see thy two sons ride forth from <lb/>
            h6me joint consuls, followed by a train of <lb/>
            senators, and welcomed by the good-will <lb/>
            of the people; when these two sat in <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            curule chairs in the Senate-house, and <lb/>
            thou by thy panegyric on the king didst <lb/>
            earn the fame of eloquence and ability; <lb/>
            when in the Circus, seated between the <lb/>
            two consuls, thou didst glut the multitude <lb/>
            thronging around with the triumphal <lb/>
            largesses for which they looked—methinks <lb/>
            thou didst cozen Fortune while she caressed <lb/>
            thee, and made thee her darling. Thou <lb/>
            didst bear off a boon which she had never <lb/>
            before granted to any private person. Art <lb/>
            thou, then, minded to cast up a reckoning <lb/>
            with Fortune ? Now for the first time she <lb/>
            has turned a jealous glance upon thee. If <lb/>
            thou compare the extent and bounds of <lb/>
            thy blessings and misfortunes, thou canst <lb/>
            not deny that thou art still fortunate. Or <lb/>
            if thou esteem not thyself favoured by <lb/>
            Fortune in that thy then seeming prosperity <lb/>

            calamitous passeth also. What ! art thou <lb/>
            but now come suddenly and a stranger to <lb/>
            the scene of this life? Thinkest thou <lb/>
            there is any stability in human affairs, <lb/>
            when man himself vanishes away in the <lb/>
            swift course of time ? It is true that there <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            is little trust that the gifts of chance will <lb/>
            abide; yet the last day of life is in a <lb/>
            manner the death of all remaining Fortune. <lb/>
            What difference, then, thinkest thou, is <lb/>
            there, whether thou leavest her by dying, <lb/>
            or she leave thee by fleeing away ?'</p>

            I deny the wonder of my fortune's swift <lb/>

            the more cruelly in the recalling. For <lb/>
            truly in adverse fortune the worst sting of <lb/>
            misery is to have been happy.'</p>

            the penalty of a mistaken belief, thou canst <lb/>
            not rightly impute the fault to circum- <lb/>

            howsoever thou mightest reckon thy for- <lb/>

            precious possession, what right hast thou <lb/>
            to talk of ill-fortune whilst keeping all <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            Fortune's better gifts? Yet Symmachus, <lb/>
            thy wife's father-a man whose splendid <lb/>
            character does honour to the human race <lb/>
            -is safe and unharmed; and while he <lb/>
            bewails thy wrongs, this rare nature, in <lb/>
            whom wisdom and virtue are so nobly <lb/>
            blended, is himself out of danger-a boon <lb/>
            thou wouldst have been quick to purchase <lb/>
            at the price of life itself. Thy wife yet <lb/>
            lives, with her gentle disposition, her peer- <lb/>
            less modesty and virtue-this the epitome <lb/>
            of all her graces, that she is the true <lb/>
            daughter of her sire—she lives, I say, and <lb/>
            for thy sake only preserves the breath of <lb/>
            life, though she loathes it, and pines away <lb/>
            in grief and tears for thy absence, wherein, <lb/>
            if in naught else, I would allow some <lb/>
            marring of thy felicity. What shall I say <lb/>
            of thy sons and their consular dignity- <lb/>
            how in them, so far as may be in youths <lb/>
            of their age, the example of their father's <lb/>
            and grandfather's character shines out? <lb/>
            Since, then, the chief care of mortal man <lb/>
            is to preserve his life, how happy art thou, <lb/>
            couldst thou but recognise thy blessings, <lb/>
            who possessest even now what no one <lb/>
            doubts to be dearer than life! Wherefore, <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            now dry thy tears. Fortune's hate hath <lb/>
            not involved all thy dear ones; the stress <lb/>
            of the storm that has assailed thee is not <lb/>
            beyond measure intolerable, since there <lb/>
            are anchors still holding firm which suffer <lb/>
            thee not to lack either consolation in the <lb/>
            present or hope for the future.'</p>
          <p>'I pray that they still may hold. For <lb/>
            while they still remain, however things <lb/>
            may go, I shall ride out the storm. Yet <lb/>
            thou seest how much is shorn of the <lb/>
            splendour of my fortunes.'</p>
          <p>' We are gaining a little ground,' said <lb/>
            she, ' if there is something in thy lot <lb/>
            wherewith thou art not yet altogether dis- <lb/>
            contented. But I cannot stomach thy <lb/>
            daintiness when thou complainest with <lb/>
            such violence of grief and anxiety because <lb/>
            thy happiness falls short of completeness. <lb/>
            Why, who enjoys such settled felicity as <lb/>
            not to have some quarrel with the circum- <lb/>
            stances of his lot? A troublous matter <lb/>
            are the conditions of human bliss ; either <lb/>
            they are never realized in full, or never <lb/>
            stay permanently. One has abundant <lb/>
            riches, but is shamed by his ignoble birth. <lb/>
            Another is conspicuous for his nobility, <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            but through the embarrassments of poverty <lb/>
            would prefer to be obscure. A third, <lb/>
            richly endowed with both, laments the <lb/>
            loneliness of an unwedded life. Another, <lb/>
            though happily married, is doomed to <lb/>
            childlessness, and nurses his wealth for a <lb/>
            stranger to inherit. Yet another, blest <lb/>
            with children, mournfully bewails the mis- <lb/>
            deeds of son or daughter. Wherefore, it <lb/>
            is not easy for anyone to be at perfect <lb/>
            peace with the circumstances of his lot. <lb/>
            There lurks in each several portion some- <lb/>
            thing which they who experience it not <lb/>
            know nothing of, but which makes the <lb/>
            sufferer wince. Besides, the more favoured <lb/>
            a man is by Fortune, the more fastidiously <lb/>
            sensitive is he; and, unless all things <lb/>
            answer to his whim, he is overwhelmed <lb/>
            by the most trifling misfortunes, because <lb/>
            utterly unschooled in adversity. So petty <lb/>
            are the trifles which rob the most fortunate <lb/>
            of perfect happiness! How many are <lb/>
            there, dost thou imagine, who would think <lb/>
            themselves nigh heaven, if but a small <lb/>
            portion from the wreck of thy fortune <lb/>
            should fall to them ? This very place <lb/>
            which thou callest exile is to them that <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            dwell therein their native land. So true <lb/>
            is it that nothing is wretched, but thinking <lb/>
            makes it so, and conversely every lot is <lb/>
            happy if borne with equanimity. Who <lb/>
            is so blest by Fortune as not to wish to <lb/>
            change his state, if once he gives rein to a <lb/>
            rebellious spirit ? With how many bitter- <lb/>
            nesses is the sweetness of human felicity <lb/>
            blent! And even if that sweetness seem <lb/>
            to him to bring delight in the enjoying, <lb/>
            yet he cannot keep it from departing when <lb/>
            it will. How manifestly wretched, then, <lb/>
            is the bliss of earthly fortune, which lasts <lb/>
            not for ever with those whose temper is <lb/>
            equable, and can give no perfect satisfac- <lb/>
            tion to the anxious-minded !</p>
          <p>' Why, then, ye children of mortality, <lb/>
            seek ye from without that happiness whose <lb/>
            seat is only within us ? Error and ignorance <lb/>
            bewilder you. I will show thee, in brief, <lb/>
            the hinge on which perfect happiness <lb/>
            turns. Is, there anything more precious <lb/>
            to thee than thyself? Nothing, thou wilt <lb/>
            say. If, then, thou art master of thyself, <lb/>
            thou wilt possess that which thou wilt <lb/>
            never be willing to lose, and which Fortune <lb/>
            cannot take from thee. And that thou <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            mayst see that happiness cannot possibly <lb/>
            consist in these things which are the sport <lb/>
            of chance, reflect that, if happiness is the <lb/>
            highest good of a creature living in ac- <lb/>
            cordance with reason, and if a thing which <lb/>
            can in any wise be reft away is not the <lb/>
            highest good, since that which cannot be <lb/>
            taken away is better than it, it is plain that <lb/>
            Fortune cannot aspire to bestow happiness <lb/>
            by reason of its instability. And, besides, <lb/>
            a man borne along by this transitory felicity <lb/>
            must either know or not know its un- <lb/>
            stability. If he knows not, how poor is a <lb/>
            happiness which depends on the blindness <lb/>
            of ignorance! If he knows it, he needs <lb/>
            must fear to lose a happiness whose loss <lb/>
            he believes to be possible. Wherefore, a <lb/>
            never-ceasing fear suffers him not to be <lb/>
            happy. Or does he count the possibility <lb/>
            of this loss a trifling matter? Insignificant, <lb/>
            then, must be the good whose loss can be <lb/>
            borne so equably. And, further, I know <lb/>
            thee to be one settled in the belief that <lb/>
            the souls of men certainly die not with <lb/>
            them, and convinced thereof by numerous <lb/>
            proofs; it is clear also that the felicity <lb/>
            which Fortune bestows is brought to an <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            end with the death of the body: therefore, <lb/>
            it cannot be doubted but that, if happiness <lb/>
            is conferred in this way, the whole human <lb/>
            race sinks into misery when death brings <lb/>
            the close of all. But if we know that <lb/>
            many have sought the joy of happiness <lb/>
            not through death only, but also through <lb/>
            pain and suffering, how can life make men <lb/>
            happy by its presence when it makes them <lb/>
            not wretched by its loss ?'</p>

            a soothing effect within thy mind, methinks <lb/>
            I may resort to remedies somewhat stronger. <lb/>
            Come, suppose, now, the gifts of Fortune <lb/>
            were not fleeting and transitory, what is <lb/>
            there in them capable of ever becoming <lb/>
            truly thine, or which does not lose value <lb/>
            when looked at steadily and fairly weighed <lb/>
            in the balance ? Are riches, I pray thee, <lb/>
            precious either through thy nature or in <lb/>
            their own ? What are they but mere gold <lb/>
            and heaps of money? Yet these fine <lb/>
            things show- their quality better in the <lb/>
            spending than in the hoarding; for I <lb/>
            suppose 'tis plain that greed always makes <lb/>
            men hateful, while liberality brings fame. <lb/>
            But that which is transferred to another <lb/>
            cannot remain in one's own possession; <lb/>
            and if that be so, then money is only <lb/>
            precious when it is given away, and, by <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            being transferred to others, ceases to be <lb/>
            one's own. Again, if all the money in the <lb/>
            world were heaped up in one man's posses- <lb/>
            sion, all others would be made poor. <lb/>
            . Sound fills the ears of many at the same <lb/>
            time without being broken into parts, but <lb/>
            your riches cannot pass to many without <lb/>
            being lessened in the process. And when <lb/>
            this happens, they must needs impoverish <lb/>
            those whom they leave. How poor and <lb/>
            cramped a thing, then, is riches, which <lb/>
            more than one cannot possess as an un- <lb/>
            broken whole, which falls not to any one <lb/>
            man's lot without the impoverishment of <lb/>
            everyone else ! Or is it the glitter of gems <lb/>
            that allures the eye? Yet, how rarely <lb/>
            excellent soever may be their splendour, <lb/>
            remember the flashing light is in the <lb/>
            jewels, not in the man. Indeed, I greatly <lb/>
            marvel at men's admiration of them; for <lb/>
            what can rightly seem beautiful to a <lb/>
            being endowed with life and reason, if it <lb/>
            lack the movement and structure of life ? <lb/>
            And although such things do in the end <lb/>
            take on them more beauty from their <lb/>
            Maker's care and their own brilliancy, <lb/>
            still they in no wise merit your admiration <note type="footnote"> 5 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            since their excellence is set at a lower <lb/>
            grade than your own.</p>
          <p>' Does the beauty of the fields delight <lb/>
            you ? Surely, yes ; it is a beautiful part of <lb/>
            a right beautiful whole. Fitly indeed do <lb/>
            we at times enjoy the serene calm of the <lb/>
            sea, admire the sky, the stars, the moon, <lb/>
            the sun. Yet is any of these thy con- <lb/>
            cern ? Dost thou venture to boast thyself <lb/>
            of the beauty of any one of them ? Art <lb/>
            thou decked with spring's flowers? is it <lb/>
            thy fertility that swelleth in the fruits of <lb/>
            autumn? Why art thou moved with <lb/>
            empty transports ? why embracest thou an <lb/>
            alien excellence as thine own ? Never <lb/>
            will fortune make thine that which the <lb/>
            nature of things has excluded from thy <lb/>
            ownership. Doubtless the fruits of the <lb/>
            earth are given for the sustenance of living <lb/>
            creatures. But if thou art content to <lb/>
            supply thy wants so far as suffices nature, <lb/>
            there is no need to resort to fortune's <lb/>
            bounty. Nature is content with few <lb/>
            things, and with a very little of these. If <lb/>
            thou art minded to force superfluities <lb/>
            upon her when she is satisfied, that which <lb/>
            thou addest will prove either unpleasant <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            or harmful. But, now, thou thinkest it <lb/>

            yet-if, indeed, there is any pleasure in <lb/>

            den to thy house, and exceeding dan- <lb/>
            gerous to their own master; while if they <lb/>
            are honest, how canst thou count other <lb/>
            men's virtue in the sum of thy possessions ? <lb/>
            From all which 'tis plainly proved that <lb/>
            not one of these things which thou <lb/>
            reckonest in the number of thy posses- <lb/>
            sions is really thine. And if there is in <lb/>
            them no beauty to be desired, why <lb/>
            shouldst thou either grieve for their loss <lb/>
            or find joy in their continued possession ? <lb/>
            While if they are beautiful in their own <lb/>
            nature, what is that to thee ? They would <lb/>
            have been not less pleasing in themselves, <lb/>
            though never included among thy posses- <lb/>
            sions. For they derive not their precious- <lb/>
            ness from being counted in thy riches, <lb/>
            but rather thou hast chosen to count them <note type="footnote"> 5—2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            in thy riches because they seemed to thee <lb/>
            precious.</p>
          <p>'Then, what seek ye by all this noisy out- <lb/>
            cry about fortune ? To chase away poverty, <lb/>
            I ween, by means of abundance. And <lb/>
            yet ye find the result just contrary. Why, <lb/>
            this varied array of precious furniture <lb/>
            needs more accessories for its protection ; <lb/>
            it is a true saying that they want most who <lb/>
            possess most, and, conversely, they want <lb/>
            very little who measure their abundance <lb/>
            by nature's requirements, not by the <lb/>
            superfluity of vain display. Have ye no <lb/>
            good of your own implanted within you, <lb/>
            that ye seek your good in things external <lb/>
            and separate ? Is the nature of things so <lb/>
            reversed that a creature divine by right of <lb/>
            reason can in no other way be splendid in <lb/>
            his own eyes save by the possession of <lb/>
            lifeless chattels ? Yet, while other things <lb/>
            are content with their own, ye who in your <lb/>
            intellect are God-like seek from the lowest <lb/>
            of things adornment for a nature of <lb/>
            supreme excellence, and perceive not <lb/>
            how great a wrong ye do your Maker. <lb/>
            His will was that mankind should excel <lb/>
            all things on earth. Ye thrust down your <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            worth beneath the lowest of things. For <lb/>
            if that in which each thing finds its good <lb/>
            is plainly more precious than that whose <lb/>
            good it is, by your own estimation ye put <lb/>
            yourselves below the vilest of things, when <lb/>
            ye deem these vile things to be your good: <lb/>
            nor does this fall out undeservedly. In- <lb/>
            deed, man is so constituted that he then <lb/>
            only excels other things when he knows <lb/>
            himself; but he is brought lower than the <lb/>
            beasts if he lose this self-knowledge. For <lb/>
            that other creatures should be ignorant of <lb/>
            themselves is natural; in man it shows as <lb/>
            a defect. How extravagant, then, is this <lb/>
            error of yours, in thinking that anything <lb/>
            can be embellished by adornments not its <lb/>
            own. It cannot be. For if such acces- <lb/>
            sories add any lustre, it is the accessories <lb/>
            that get the praise, while that which they <lb/>
            veil and cover remains in its pristine <lb/>
            ugliness. And again I say, That is no good, <lb/>
            which injures its possessor. Is this un- <lb/>
            true ? No, quite true, thou sayest. And <lb/>
            yet riches have often hurt those that <lb/>
            possessed them, since the worst of men, <lb/>
            who are all the more covetous by reason <lb/>
            of their wickedness, think none but them- <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            selves worthy to possess all the gold and <lb/>
            gems the world contains. So thou, who <lb/>
            now dreadest pike and sword, mightest <lb/>
            have trolled a carol " in the robber's face," <lb/>
            hadst thou entered the road of life with <lb/>
            empty pockets. Oh, wondrous blessed- <lb/>
            ness of perishable wealth, whose acquisi- <lb/>
            tion robs thee of security !'</p>

          <p>'What now shall I say of rank and power, <lb/>
            whereby, because ye know not true power <lb/>
            and dignity, ye hope to reach the sky ? <lb/>
            Yet, when rank and power have fallen to <lb/>
            the worst of men, did ever an Etna, belch- <lb/>
            ing forth flame and fiery deluge, work such <lb/>
            mischief? Verily, as I think, thou dost <lb/>
            remember how thine ancestors sought to <lb/>
            abolish the consular power, which had been <lb/>
            the foundation of their liberties, on account <lb/>
            of the overweening pride of the consuls, <lb/>
            and how for that self-same pride they had <lb/>
            already abolished the kingly title! And <lb/>
            if, as happens but rarely, these prerogatives <lb/>
            are conferred on virtuous men, it is only <lb/>
            the virtue of those who exercise them that <lb/>
            pleases. So it appears that honour cometh <lb/>
            not to virtue from rank, but to rank from <lb/>
            virtue. Look, too, at the nature of that <lb/>
            power which ye find so attractive and <lb/>
            glorious! Do ye never consider, ye <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            creatures of earth, what ye are, and over <lb/>
            whom ye exercise your fancied lordship ? <lb/>
            Suppose, now, that in the mouse tribe <lb/>
            there should rise up one claiming rights <lb/>
            and powers for himself above the rest, <lb/>
            would ye not laugh consumedly ? Yet if <lb/>
            thou lookest to his body alone, what <lb/>
            creature canst thou find more feeble than <lb/>
            man, who oftentimes is killed by the bite <lb/>
            of a fly, or by some insect creeping into <lb/>
            the inner passage of his system ! Yet what <lb/>
            rights can one exercise over another, save <lb/>
            only as regards the body, and that which <lb/>
            is lower than the body—I mean fortune ? <lb/>
            What! wilt thou bind with thy mandates <lb/>
            the free spirit ? Canst thou force from its <lb/>
            due tranquillity the mind that is firmly <lb/>
            composed by reason ? A tyrant thought <lb/>
            to drive a man of free birth to reveal his <lb/>
            accomplices in a conspiracy, but the <lb/>
            prisoner bit off his tongue and threw it <lb/>
            into the furious tyrant's face; thus, the <lb/>
            tortures which the tyrant thought the in- <lb/>
            strument of his cruelty the sage made an <lb/>
            opportunity for heroism. Moreover, what <lb/>
            is there that one man can do to another <lb/>
            which he himself may not have to undergo <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            in his turn ? We are told that Busiris, <lb/>
            who used to kill his guests, was himself <lb/>
            slain by his guest, Hercules. Regulus <lb/>
            had thrown into bonds many of the <lb/>
            Carthaginians whom he had taken in war; <lb/>
            soon after he himself submitted his hands <lb/>
            to the chains of the vanquished. Then, <lb/>
            thinkest thou that man hath any power <lb/>
            who cannot prevent another's being able <lb/>
            to do to him what he himself can do to <lb/>
            others ?</p>
          <p>'Besides, if there were any element of <lb/>
            natural and proper good in rank and power, <lb/>
            they would never come to the utterly bad, <lb/>
            since opposites are not wont to be asso- <lb/>
            ciated. Nature brooks not the union of <lb/>
            contraries. So, seeing there is no doubt <lb/>
            that wicked wretches are oftentimes set in <lb/>
            high places, it is also clear that things <lb/>
            which suffer association with the worst of <lb/>
            men cannot be good in their own nature. <lb/>
            Indeed, this judgment may with some <lb/>
            reason be passed concerning all the gifts <lb/>
            of fortune which fall so plentifully to all <lb/>
            the most wicked. This ought also to be <lb/>
            considered here, I think: No one doubts <lb/>
            a man to be brave in whom he has ob- <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            served a brave spirit residing. It is plain <lb/>
            that one who is endowed with speed is <lb/>
            swift-footed. So also music makes men <lb/>
            musical, the healing art physicians, rhetoric <lb/>
            public speakers. For each of these has <lb/>
            naturally its own proper working; there is <lb/>
            no confusion with the effects of contrary <lb/>
            things—nay, even of itself it rejects what <lb/>
            is incompatible. And yet wealth cannot <lb/>
            extinguish insatiable greed, nor has power <lb/>
            ever made him master of himself whom <lb/>
            vicious lusts kept bound in indissoluble <lb/>
            fetters; dignity conferred on the wicked <lb/>
            not only fails to make them worthy, but <lb/>
            contrarily reveals and displays their un- <lb/>
            worthiness. Why does it so happen ? <lb/>
            Because ye take pleasure in calling by <lb/>
            false names things whose nature is quite <lb/>
            incongruous thereto-by names which are <lb/>
            easily proved false by the very effects of <lb/>
            the things themselves; even so it is; these <lb/>
            riches, that power, this dignity, are none <lb/>
            of them rightly so called. Finally, we <lb/>
            may draw the same conclusion concerning <lb/>
            the whole sphere of Fortune, within which <lb/>
            there is plainly nothing to be truly desired, <lb/>
            nothing of intrinsic excellence; for she <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            neither always joins herself to the good, <lb/>
            nor does she make good men of those to <lb/>
            whom she is united.'</p>

            which is able to allure minds which, though <lb/>

            to any exquisite refinement by the perfect- <lb/>
            ing of the virtues—I mean, the love of <lb/>
            glory-and fame for high services rendered <lb/>
            to the commonweal. And yet consider <lb/>
            with me how poor and unsubstantial a <lb/>
            thing this glory is! The whole of this <lb/>
            earth's globe, as thou hast learnt from the <lb/>
            demonstration of astronomy, compared <lb/>
            with the expanse of heaven, is found no <lb/>
            bigger than a point; that is to say, if <lb/>
            measured by the vastness of heaven's <lb/>
            sphere, it is held to occupy absolutely no <lb/>
            space at all. Now, of this so insignificant <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            portion of the universe, it is about a fourth <lb/>
            part, as Ptolemy's proofs have taught us, <lb/>
            which is inhabited by living creatures <lb/>
            known to us. If from this fourth part <lb/>
            you take away in thought all that is usurped <lb/>
            by seas and marshes, or lies a vast waste <lb/>
            of waterless desert, barely is an exceeding <lb/>
            narrow area left for human habitation. <lb/>
            You, then, who are shut in and prisoned <lb/>
            in this merest fraction of a point's space, <lb/>
            do ye take thought for the blazoning of <lb/>
            your fame, for the spreading abroad of <lb/>
            your renown ? Why, what amplitude or <lb/>
            magnificence has glory when confined to <lb/>
            such narrow and petty limits ?</p>
          <p>'Besides, the straitened bounds of this <lb/>
            scant dwelling-place are inhabited by <lb/>
            many nations differing widely in speech, <lb/>
            in usages, in mode of life; to many of <lb/>
            these, from the difficulty of travel, from <lb/>
            diversities of speech, from want of com- <lb/>
            mercial intercourse, the fame not only of <lb/>
            individual men, but even of cities, is unable <lb/>
            to reach. Why, in Cicero's days, as he <lb/>
            himself somewhere points out, the fame <lb/>
            of the Roman Republic had not yet crossed <lb/>
            the Caucasus, and yet by that time her <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            name had grown formidable to the Par <lb/>
            thians and other nations of those parts. <lb/>
            Seest thou, then, how narrow, how con- <lb/>
            fined, is the glory ye take pains to spread <lb/>
            abroad and extend! Can the fame of a <lb/>
            single Roman penetrate where the glory <lb/>
            of the Roman name fails to pass ? More- <lb/>
            over, the customs and institutions of dif- <lb/>
            ferent races agree not together, so that <lb/>
            what is deemed praiseworthy in one country <lb/>
            is thought punishable in another. Where- <lb/>
            fore, if any love the applause of fame, it <lb/>
            shall not profit him to publish his name <lb/>
            among many peoples. Then, each must <lb/>
            be content to have the range of his glory <lb/>
            limited to his own people; the splendid <lb/>
            immortality of fame must be confined <lb/>
            within the bounds of a single race.</p>
          <p>' Once more, how many of high renown <lb/>
            in their own times have been lost in <lb/>
            oblivion for want of a record! Indeed, <lb/>
            of what avail are written records even, <lb/>
            which, with their authors, are overtaken <lb/>
            by the dimness of age after a somewhat <lb/>
            longer time ? But ye, when ye think on <lb/>
            future fame, fancy it an immortality that <lb/>
            ye are begetting for yourselves. Why, if <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            thou scannest the infinite spaces of eternity, <lb/>
            what room hast thou left for rejoicing in <lb/>
            the durability of thy name ? Verily, if a <lb/>
            single moment's space be compared with <lb/>
            ten thousand years, it has a certain relative <lb/>
            duration, however little, since each period <lb/>
            is definite. But this same number of <lb/>
            years—ay, and a number many times as <lb/>
            great-cannot even be compared with <lb/>
            endless duration; for, indeed, finite periods <lb/>
            may in a sort be compared one with <lb/>
            another, but a finite and an infinite never. <lb/>
            So it comes to pass that fame, though it <lb/>
            extend to ever so wide a space of years, if <lb/>
            it be compared to never-lessening eternity, <lb/>
            seems not short-lived merely, but altogether <lb/>
            nothing. But as for you, ye know not <lb/>
            how to act aright, unless it be to court the <lb/>
            popular breeze, and win the empty applause <lb/>
            of the multitude—nay, ye abandon the <lb/>
            superlative worth of conscience and virtue, <lb/>
            and ask a recompense from the poor words <lb/>
            of others. Let me tell thee how wittily <lb/>
            one did mock the shallowness of this sort <lb/>
            of arrogance. A certain man assailed one <lb/>
            who had put on the name of philosopher <lb/>
            as a cloak to pride and vain-glory, not for <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            the practice of real virtue, and added : <lb/>
            " Now shall I know if thou art a philo- <lb/>
            sopher if thou bearest reproaches calmly <lb/>
            and patiently." The other for awhile <lb/>
            affected to be patient, and, having endured <lb/>
            to be abused, cried out derisively: "Now, <lb/>
            do you see that I am a philosopher?" <lb/>
            The other, with biting sarcasm, retorted : <lb/>
            " I should have hadst thou held thy <lb/>
            peace." Moreover, what concern have <lb/>
            choice spirits-for it is of such men we <lb/>
            speak, men who seek glory by virtue- <lb/>
            what concern, I say, have these with fame <lb/>
            after the dissolution of the body in death's <lb/>
            last hour ? For if men die wholly-which <lb/>
            our reasonings forbid us to believe-there <lb/>
            is no such thing as glory at all, since he <lb/>
            to whom the glory is said to belong is <lb/>
            altogether non-existent. But if the mind, <lb/>
            conscious of its own rectitude, is released <lb/>
            from its earthly prison, and seeks heaven <lb/>
            in free flight, doth it not despise all earthly <lb/>
            things when it rejoices in its deliverance <lb/>
            from earthly bonds, and enters upon the <lb/>
            joys of heaven ?' <note type="footnote"> 6 </note></p><pb n="82"/>

          <p>But that thou mayst not think that I <lb/>
            wage implacable warfare against Fortune, <lb/>
            I own there is a time when the deceitful <lb/>
            goddess serves men well—I mean when <lb/>
            she reveals herself, uncovers her face, and <lb/>
            confesses her true character. Perhaps <lb/>
            thou dost not yet grasp my meaning. <lb/>
            Strange is the thing I am trying to express, <lb/>
            and for this cause I can scarce find words <lb/>
            to make clear my thought. For truly I be- <lb/>
            lieve that III Fortune is of more use to men <lb/>
            than Good Fortune. For Good Fortune, <lb/>
            when she wears the guise of happiness, <lb/>
            and most seems to caress, is always lying; <lb/>
            Ill Fortune is always truthful, since, in <lb/>
            changing, she shows her inconstancy. The <lb/>
            one deceives, the other teaches ; the one <lb/>
            enchains the minds of those who enjoy <lb/>
            her favour by the semblance of delusive <lb/>
            good, the other delivers them by the <lb/>
            knowledge of the frail nature of happiness. <lb/>
            Accordingly, thou mayst see the one fickle, <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            shifting as the breeze, and ever self-de- <lb/>
            ceived ; the other sober-minded, alert, and <lb/>
            wary, by reason of the very discipline of <lb/>
            adversity. Finally, Good Fortune, by her <lb/>
            allurements, draws men far from the true <lb/>
            good; III Fortune ofttimes draws men back <lb/>
            to true good with grappling-irons. Again, <lb/>
            should it be esteemed a trifling boon, <lb/>
            thinkest thou, that this cruel, this odious <lb/>
            Fortune hath discovered to thee the hearts <lb/>
            of thy faithful friends-that other hid from <lb/>
            thee alike the faces of the true friends and <lb/>
            of the false, but in departing she hath <lb/>
            taken away her friends, and left thee thine? <lb/>
            What price wouldst thou not have given <lb/>
            for this service in the fulness of thy pros- <lb/>
            perity when thou seemedst to thyself for- <lb/>
            tunate ? Cease, then, to seek the wealth <lb/>
            thou hast lost, since in true friends thou <lb/>
            hast found the most precious of all riches.'</p>

          <p>CH. I. Boethius beseeches Philosophy to con- <lb/>
            tinue. She promises to lead him to true <lb/>
            happiness.—CH. II. Happiness is the one <lb/>
            end which all created beings seek. They <lb/>
            aim variously at (a) wealth, or (b) rank, or <lb/>
            (c) sovereignty, or (d) glory, or (e) pleasure, <lb/>
            because they think thereby to attain either <lb/>
            (a) contentment, (b) reverence, (c) power, <lb/>
            (d) renown, or (e) gladness of heart, in one <lb/>
            or other of which they severally imagine <lb/>
            happiness to consist.-CH. III. Philosophy <lb/>
            proceeds to consider whether happiness can <lb/>
            really be secured in any of these ways. <lb/>
            (a) So far from bringing contentment, riches <lb/>
            only add to men's wants.—CH. IV. (b) High <lb/>
            position cannot of itself win respect. Titles <lb/>
            command no reverence in distant and bar- <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            barous lands. They even fall into contempt <lb/>
            through lapse of time.—CH. V. (c) Sove- <lb/>
            reignty cannot even bestow safety. History <lb/>
            tells of the downfall of kings and their <lb/>
            ministers. Tyrants go in fear of their lives. <lb/>
            -CH. VI. (d) Fame conferred on the un- <lb/>
            worthy is but disgrace. The splendour of <lb/>
            noble birth is not a man's own, but his <lb/>
            ancestors'.—CH. VII. (e) Pleasure begins in <lb/>
            the restlessness of desire, and ends in repent- <lb/>
            ance. Even the pure pleasures of home <lb/>
            may turn to gall and bitterness.—CH. VIII. <lb/>
            All fail, then, to give what they promise. <lb/>
            There is, moreover, some accompanying evil <lb/>
            involved in each of these aims. Beauty and <lb/>
            bodily strength are likewise of. little worth. <lb/>
            In strength man is surpassed by the brutes ; <lb/>
            beauty is but outward show.—CH. IX. The, <lb/>
            source of men's error in following these <lb/>
            phantoms of good is that they break up and <lb/>
            separate that which is in its nature one and <lb/>
            indivisible. Contentment, power, reverence, <lb/>
            renown, and joy are essentially bound up <lb/>
            one with the other, and, if they are to be'' <lb/>
            attained at all, must be . attained together. <lb/>
            True happiness, if it can be found, will <lb/>
            include them all. But it cannot be found <lb/>
            among the perishable things hitherto con- <lb/>
            sidered.—CH. X. Such a happiness neces- <lb/>
            sarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God <lb/>
            is very happiness, and in a manner, there-. <lb/>
            fore, the happy man partakes also of the <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            Divine nature. All other ends are relative <lb/>
            to this good, since they are all pursued only <lb/>
            for the sake of good; it is good which is the <lb/>
            sole ultimate end. And since the sole end is <lb/>
            also happiness, it is plain that this good and <lb/>
            happiness are in essence the same.—CH. XI. <lb/>
            Unity is another aspect of goodness. Now, <lb/>
            all things subsist so long only as they pre- <lb/>
            serve the unity of their being; when they <lb/>
            lose this unity, they perish. But the bent of <lb/>
            nature forces all things (plants and inani- <lb/>
            mate things, as well as animals) to strive to <lb/>
            continue in life. Therefore, all things desire <lb/>
            unity, for unity is essential to life. But <lb/>
            unity and goodness were shown to be the <lb/>
            same. Therefore, good is proved to be the <lb/>
            end towards which the whole universe <lb/>
            tends.*—CH. XII. Boethius acknowledges <lb/>
            that he is but recollecting truths he once <lb/>
            knew. Philosophy goes on to show that it <lb/>
            is goodness also by which the whole world <lb/>
            is governed.f Boethius professes compunc- <lb/>
            tion for his former folly. But the paradox <lb/>
            of evil is introduced, and he is once more <lb/>
            perplexed. <note type="footnote"> * This solves the second of the points left in <lb/>
            doubt at the end of bk. i., ch. vi. </note><note type="footnote"> t This solves the third. No distinct account <lb/>
            is given of the first, but an answer may be <lb/>

            iii., and iv. </note></p>

          <p>SHE ceased, but I stood fixed by <lb/>
            the sweetness of the song in <lb/>
            wonderment and eager expecta- <lb/>
            tion, my ears still strained to listen. And <lb/>
            then after a little I said : ' Thou sovereign <lb/>
            solace of the stricken soul, what refresh- <lb/>
            ment hast thou brought me, no less by <lb/>
            the sweetness of thy singing than by the <lb/>
            weightiness of thy discourse ! Verily, I <lb/>
            think not that I shall hereafter be unequal <lb/>
            to the blows of Fortune. Wherefore, I <lb/>
            no longer dread the remedies which thou <lb/>
            saidst were something too severe for my <lb/>
            strength ; nay, rather, I am eager to hear <lb/>
            of them and call for them with all <lb/>
            vehemence.'</p><pb n="92"/>
            
          <p>Then said she: ' I marked thee fasten- <lb/>
            ing upon my words silently and intently, <lb/>
            and I expected, or-to speak more truly—I <lb/>
            myself brought about in thee, this state of <lb/>
            mind. What now remains is of such sort <lb/>
            that to the taste indeed it is biting, but <lb/>
            when received within it turns to sweetness. <lb/>
            But whereas thou dost profess thyself <lb/>
            desirous of hearing, with what ardour <lb/>
            wouldst thou not burn didst thou but <lb/>

            thee!'</p>
          <p>' Whither ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' To true felicity,' said she, 'which even <lb/>

            behold in very truth, while thine eyes are <lb/>
            engrossed with semblances.'</p>
          <p>Then said I: ' I beseech thee, do thou <lb/>

            moment's loss.'</p>
          <p>' Gladly will I, for thy sake,' said she. <lb/>
            ' But first I will try to sketch in words, <lb/>
            and describe a cause which is more familiar <lb/>
            to thee, that, when thou hast viewed this <lb/>

          <p>For a little space she remained in a <lb/>
            fixed gaze, withdrawn, as it were, into the <lb/>
            august chamber of her mind; then she <lb/>
            thus began :</p>
          <p>'All mortal creatures in those anxious <lb/>
            aims which find employment in so many <lb/>
            varied pursuits, though they take many <lb/>
            paths, yet strive to reach one goal-the <lb/>
            goal of happiness. Now, the good is that <lb/>
            which, when a man hath got, he can lack <lb/>
            nothing further. This it is which is the <lb/>
            supreme good of all, containing within <lb/>
            itself all particular good; so that if any- <lb/>
            thing is still wanting thereto, this cannot <lb/>
            be the supreme good, since something <lb/>
            would be left outside which might be <lb/>
            desired. 'Tis clear, then, that happiness <lb/>
            is a state perfected by the assembling <lb/>
            together of all good things. To this state, <lb/>
            as we have said, all men try to attain, but <lb/>
            by different paths. For the desire of the <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            true good is naturally implanted in the <lb/>
            minds of men; only error leads them aside <lb/>
            out of the way in pursuit of the false. <lb/>
            Some, deeming it the highest good to <lb/>
            want for nothing, spare no pains to attain <lb/>
            affluence; others, judging the good to be <lb/>
            that to which respect is most worthily <lb/>
            paid, strive to win the reverence of their <lb/>
            fellow-citizens by the attainment of official <lb/>
            dignity. Some there are who fix the chief <lb/>
            good in supreme power; these either wish <lb/>
            themselves to enjoy sovereignty, or try to <lb/>
            attach themselves to those who have it. <lb/>
            Those, again, who think renown to be <lb/>
            something of supreme excellence are in <lb/>
            haste to spread abroad the glory of their <lb/>
            name either through the arts of war or of <lb/>
            peace. A great many measure the attain- <lb/>
            ment of good by joy and gladness of <lb/>
            heart; these think it the height of happi- <lb/>
            ness to give themselves over to pleasure. <lb/>
            Others there are, again, who interchange <lb/>
            the ends and means one with the other <lb/>
            in their aims; for instance, some want <lb/>
            riches for the sake of pleasure and power, <lb/>
            some covet power either for the sake of <lb/>
            money or in order to bring renown to <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            their name. So it is on these ends, then, <lb/>
            that the aim of human acts and wishes is <lb/>
            centred, and on others like to these-for <lb/>
            instance, noble birth and popularity, which <lb/>
            seem to compass a certain renown; wife <lb/>
            and children, which are sought for the <lb/>
            sweetness of their possession ; while as <lb/>
            for friendship, the most sacred kind indeed <lb/>
            is counted in the category of virtue, not <lb/>
            of fortune; but other kinds are entered <lb/>
            upon for the sake of power or of enjoy- <lb/>
            ment. And as for bodily excellences, it <lb/>
            is obvious that they are to be ranged with <lb/>
            the above. For strength and stature surely <lb/>
            manifest power; beauty and fleetness of <lb/>
            foot bring celebrity; health brings pleasure. <lb/>
            It is plain, then, that the only object sought <lb/>
            for in all these ways is happiness. For <lb/>
            that which each seeks in preference to all <lb/>
            else, that is in his judgment the supreme <lb/>
            good. And we have defined the supreme <lb/>
            good to be happiness. Therefore, that <lb/>
            state which each wishes in preference to <lb/>
            all others is in his judgment happy.</p>
          <p>' Thou hast, then, set before thine eyes <lb/>
            something like a scheme of human happi- <lb/>
            ness-wealth, rank, power, glory, pleasure. <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            Now Epicurus, from a sole regard to these <lb/>
            considerations, with some consistency con- <lb/>
            cluded the highest good to be pleasure, <lb/>
            because all the other objects seem to bring <lb/>
            some delight to the soul. But to return <lb/>
            to human pursuits and aims : man's mind <lb/>
            seeks to recover its proper good, in spite <lb/>
            of the mistiness of its recollection, but, <lb/>
            like a drunken man, knows not by what <lb/>
            path to return home. Think you they <lb/>
            are wrong who strive to escape want ? <lb/>
            Nay, truly there is nothing which can so <lb/>
            well complete happiness as a state abound- <lb/>
            ing in all good things, needing nothing <lb/>
            from outside, but wholly self-sufficing. Do <lb/>
            they fall into error who deem that which <lb/>
            is best to be also best deserving to receive <lb/>
            the homage of reverence ? Not at all. <lb/>
            That cannot possibly be vile and con- <lb/>
            temptible, to attain which the endeavours <lb/>
            of nearly all mankind are directed. Then, <lb/>
            is power not to be reckoned in the category <lb/>
            of good ? Why, can that which is plainly <lb/>
            more efficacious than anything else be <lb/>
            esteemed a thing feeble and void of <lb/>
            strength ? Or is renown to be thought of <lb/>
            no account? Nay, it cannot be ignored <note type="footnote"> 7 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            that the highest renown is constantly asso- <lb/>
            ciated with the highest excellence. And <lb/>
            what need is there to say that happiness <lb/>
            is not haunted by care and gloom, nor <lb/>
            exposed to trouble and vexation, since <lb/>
            that is a condition we ask of the very least <lb/>
            of things, from the possession and enjoy- <lb/>
            ment of which we expect delight ? So, <lb/>
            then, these are the blessings men wish to <lb/>
            win; they want riches, rank, sovereignty, <lb/>
            glory, pleasure, because they believe that <lb/>
            by these means they will secure indepen- <lb/>
            dence, reverence, power, renown, and joy <lb/>
            of heart. Therefore, it is the good which <lb/>
            men seek by such divers courses; and <lb/>
            herein is easily shown the might of Nature's <lb/>
            power, since, although opinions are so <lb/>
            various and discordant, yet they agree in <lb/>
            cherishing good as the end.'</p><pb n="99"/>

          <p>'Ye, too, creatures of earth, have some <lb/>
            glimmering of your origin, however faint, <lb/>
            and though in a vision dim and clouded. <lb/>
            yet in some wise, notwithstanding, ye <lb/>
            discern the true end of happiness, and so <lb/>
            the aim of nature leads you thither—to <lb/>
            that true good-while error in many forms <lb/>
            leads you astray therefrom. For reflect <lb/>
            whether men are able to win happiness by <lb/>
            those means through which they think to <lb/>
            reach the proposed end. Truly; if either <lb/>
            wealth, rank, or any of the rest, bring with <lb/>
            them anything of such sort as seems to <lb/>
            have nothing wanting to it that is good, <lb/>
            we, too, acknowledge that some are made <lb/>
            happy by the acquisition of these things. <lb/>
            But if they are not able to fulfil their <lb/>
            promises, and, moreover, lack many good <lb/>
            things, is not the happiness men seek in <lb/>
            them clearly discovered to be a false show ? <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            Therefore do I first ask thee thyself, who <lb/>
            but lately wert living in affluence, amid all <lb/>
            that abundance of wealth, was thy mind <lb/>
            never troubled in consequence of some <lb/>
            wrong done to thee ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay,' said I, ' I cannot ever remember <lb/>
            a time when my mind was so completely <lb/>
            at peace as not to feel the pang of some <lb/>
            uneasiness.'</p>
          <p>'Was it not because either something <lb/>
            was absent which thou wouldst not have <lb/>
            absent, or present which thou wouldst <lb/>
            have away ?'</p>
          <p>' Yes,' said I.</p>
          <p>' Then, thou didst want the presence of <lb/>
            the one, the absence of the other?'</p>
          <p>' Admitted.'</p>
          <p>' But a man lacks that of which he is <lb/>
            in want ?'</p>
          <p>' He does.'</p>
          <p>' And he who lacks something is not in <lb/>
            all points self-sufficing ?'</p>
          <p>' No ; certainly not,' said I.</p>
          <p>' So wert thou, then, in the plenitude <lb/>
            of thy wealth, supporting this insuffi- <lb/>
            ciency ?'</p>
          <p>' I must have been.'</p><pb n="103"/>
            
          <p>' Wealth, then, cannot make its possessor <lb/>
            independent and free from all want, yet <lb/>
            this was what it seemed to promise. More- <lb/>
            over, I think this also well deserves to be <lb/>
            considered-that there is nothing in the <lb/>
            special nature of money to hinder its being <lb/>
            taken away from those who possess it <lb/>
            against their will.'</p>
          <p>' I admit it.'</p>
          <p>' Why, of course, when every day the <lb/>
            stronger wrests it from the weaker without <lb/>
            his consent. Else, whence come lawsuits, <lb/>
            except in seeking to recover moneys which <lb/>
            have been taken away against their owner's <lb/>
            will by force or fraud?'</p>
          <p>' True,' said I.</p>
          <p>' Then, everyone will need some ex- <lb/>
            traneous means of protection to keep his <lb/>
            money safe.'</p>
          <p>' Who can venture to deny it ?'</p>
          <p>, Yet he would not, unless he possessed <lb/>
            the money which it is possible to lose.'</p>
          <p>, No; he certainly would not.'</p>
          <p>'Then, we have worked round to an <lb/>
            opposite conclusion: the wealth which <lb/>
            was thought to make a man independent <lb/>
            rather puts him in need of further protec- <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            tion. How in the world, then, can want <lb/>
            be driven away by riches? Cannot the <lb/>
            rich feel hunger? Cannot they thirst? <lb/>
            Are not the limbs of the wealthy sensitive <lb/>
            to the winter's cold? "But," thou wilt <lb/>
            say, " the rich have the wherewithal to <lb/>
            sate their hunger, the means to get rid of <lb/>
            thirst and cold." True enough ; want can <lb/>
            thus be soothed by riches, wholly removed <lb/>
            it cannot be. For if this ever-gaping, ever- <lb/>
            craving want is glutted by wealth, it needs <lb/>
            must be that the want itself which can be <lb/>
            so glutted still remains. I do not speak <lb/>
            of how very little suffices for nature, and <lb/>
            how for avarice nothing is enough. Where- <lb/>
            fore, if wealth cannot get rid of want, and <lb/>
            makes new wants of its own, how can ye <lb/>
            believe that it bestows independence ?'</p><pb n="105"/>

          <p>' Well, but official dignity clothes him to <lb/>
            whom it comes with honour and reverence! <lb/>
            Have, then, offices of state such power as <lb/>
            to plant virtue in the minds of their pos- <lb/>
            sessors, and drive out vice ? Nay, they <lb/>
            are rather wont to signalize iniquity than <lb/>
            to chase it away, and hence arises our <lb/>
            indignation that honours so often fall to <lb/>
            the most iniquitous of men. Accordingly, <lb/>
            Catullus calls Nonius an " ulcer-spot," <lb/>
            though " sitting in the curule chair." Dost <lb/>
            not see what infamy high position brings <lb/>
            upon the bad? Surely their unworthiness <lb/>
            will be less conspicuous if their rank does <lb/>
            not draw upon them the public notice ! <lb/>
            In thy own case, wouldst thou ever have <lb/>
            been induced by all these perils to think <lb/>
            of sharing office with Decoratus, since <lb/>
            thou hast discerned in him the spirit of a <lb/>
            rascally parasite and informer ? No ; we <lb/>
            cannot deem men worthy of reverence on <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            account of their office, whom we deem <lb/>
            unworthy of the office itself. But didst <lb/>
            thou see a man endued with wisdom, <lb/>
            couldst thou suppose him not worthy of <lb/>
            reverence, nor of that wisdom with which <lb/>
            he was endued ?'</p>
          <p>' No ; certainly not.'</p>
          <p>' There is in Virtue a dignity of her own <lb/>
            which she forthwith passes over to those <lb/>
            to whom she is united. And since public <lb/>
            honours cannot do this, it is clear that <lb/>
            they do not possess the true beauty of <lb/>
            dignity. And here this well deserves to <lb/>
            be noticed-that if a man is the more <lb/>
            scorned in proportion as he is despised <lb/>
            by a greater number, high position not <lb/>
            only fails to win reverence for the wicked, <lb/>
            but even loads them the more with con- <lb/>
            tempt by drawing more attention to them. <lb/>
            But not without retribution; for the wicked <lb/>
            pay back a return in kind to the dignities <lb/>
            they put on by the pollution of their touch. <lb/>
            Perhaps, too, another consideration may <lb/>
            teach thee to confess that true reverence <lb/>
            cannot come through these counterfeit <lb/>
            dignities. It is this: If one who had <lb/>
            been many times consul chanced to visit <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            barbaric lands, would his office win him <lb/>
            the reverence of the barbarians ? And <lb/>
            yet if reverence were the natural effect <lb/>
            of dignities, they would not forego their <lb/>
            proper function in any part of the world, <lb/>
            even as fire never anywhere fails to give <lb/>
            forth heat. But since this effect is not <lb/>
            due to their own efficacy, but is attached <lb/>
            to them by the mistaken opinion of man- <lb/>
            kind, they disappear straightway when they <lb/>
            are set before those who do not esteem <lb/>
            them dignities. Thus the case stands with <lb/>
            foreign peoples. But does their repute <lb/>
            last for ever, even in the land of their <lb/>
            origin ? Why, the prefecture, which was <lb/>
            once a great power, is now an empty name <lb/>
            -a burden merely on the senator's for- <lb/>
            tune ; the commissioner of the public corn <lb/>
            supply was once a personage-now what <lb/>
            is more contemptible than this office ? <lb/>
            For, as we said just now, that which hath <lb/>
            no true comeliness of its own now receives, <lb/>
            now loses, lustre at the caprice of those <lb/>
            who have to do with it. So, then, if <lb/>
            dignities cannot win men reverence, if <lb/>
            they are actually sullied by the contamina- <lb/>
            tion of the wicked, if they lose their <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            splendour through time's changes, if they <lb/>
            come into contempt merely for lack of <lb/>
            public estimation, what precious beauty <lb/>
            have they in themselves, much less to give <lb/>
            to others ?'</p>

          <p>' Well, then, does sovereignty and the <lb/>
            intimacy of kings prove able to confer <lb/>
            power ? Why, surely does not the happi- <lb/>
            ness of kings endure for ever ? And yet <lb/>
            antiquity is full of examples, and these <lb/>
            days also, of kings whose happiness has <lb/>
            turned into calamity. How glorious a <lb/>
            power, which is not even found effectual <lb/>
            for its own preservation ! But if happiness <lb/>
            has its source in sovereign power, is not <lb/>
            happiness diminished, and misery inflicted <lb/>
            in its stead, in so far as that power falls <lb/>
            short of completeness ? Yet, however <lb/>
            widely human sovereignty be extended, <lb/>
            there must still be more peoples left, over <lb/>
            whom each several king holds no sway. <lb/>
            Now, at whatever point the power on which <lb/>
            happiness depends ceases, here powerless- <lb/>
            ness steals in and makes wretchedness; <lb/>
            so, by this way of reckoning, there must <lb/>
            needs be a balance of wretchedness in the <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            lot of the king. The tyrant who had made <lb/>
            trial of the perils of his condition figured <lb/>
            the fears that haunt a throne under the <lb/>
            image of a sword hanging over a man's <lb/>
            head.* What sort of power, then, is this <lb/>
            which cannot drive away the gnawings of <lb/>
            anxiety, or shun the stings of terror? Fain <lb/>
            would they themselves have lived secure, <lb/>
            but they cannot; then they boast about <lb/>
            their power ! Dost thou count him to <lb/>
            possess power whom thou seest to wish <lb/>
            what he cannot bring to pass ? Dost thou <lb/>
            count him to possess power who encom- <lb/>
            passes himself with a body-guard, who <lb/>
            fears those he terrifies more than they fear <lb/>
            him, who, to keep up the semblance of <lb/>
            power, is himself at the mercy of his <lb/>
            slaves ? Need I say anything of the <lb/>
            friends of kings, when I show royal <lb/>
            dominion itself so utterly and miserably <lb/>
            weak-why ofttimes the royal power in <lb/>
            its plenitude brings them low, ofttimes <lb/>
            involves them in its fall? Nero drove his <lb/>
            friend and preceptor, Seneca, to the choice <lb/>
            of the manner of his death. Antoninus <lb/>
            exposed Papinianus, who was long power- <note type="footnote"> * The sword of Damocles. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            ful at court, to the swords of the soldiery. <lb/>
            Yet each of these was willing to renounce <lb/>
            his power. Seneca tried to surrender his <lb/>
            wealth also to Nero, and go into retire- <lb/>
            ment; but neither achieved his purpose. <lb/>
            When they tottered, their very greatness <lb/>
            dragged them down. What manner of <lb/>
            thing, then, is this power which keeps men <lb/>
            in fear while they possess it-which when <lb/>
            thou art fain to keep, thou art not safe, <lb/>
            and when thou desirest to lay it aside, <lb/>
            thou canst not rid thyself of ? Are friends <lb/>
            any protection who have been attached <lb/>
            by fortune, not by virtue ? Nay; him <lb/>
            whom good fortune has made a friend, ill <lb/>
            fortune will make an enemy. And what <lb/>

          <p>Again, how misleading, how base, a <lb/>
            thing ofttimes is glory ! Well does the <lb/>
            tragic poet exclaim : <lb/>
            " ' Oh, fond Repute, how many a time and oft <lb/>
            Hast thou raised high in pride the base-born <lb/>
            churl!"</p>
          <p>For many have won a great name through <lb/>
            the mistaken beliefs of the multitude- <lb/>
            and what can be imagined more shameful <lb/>
            than that ? Nay, they who are praised <lb/>
            falsely must needs themselves blush at <lb/>
            their own praises ! And even when praise <lb/>
            is won by merit, still, how does it add to <lb/>
            the good conscience of the wise man who <lb/>
            measures his good not by popular repute, <lb/>
            but by the truth of inner conviction ? <lb/>
            And if at all it does seem a fair thing to <lb/>
            get this same renown spread abroad, it <lb/>
            follows that any failure so to spread it is <lb/>
            held foul. But if, as I set forth but now, <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            there must needs be many tribes and <lb/>
            peoples whom the fame of any single man <lb/>
            cannot reach, it follows that he whom thou <lb/>
            esteemest glorious seems all inglorious in <lb/>
            a neighbouring quarter of the globe. As <lb/>
            to popular favour, I do not think it even <lb/>
            worthy of mention in this place, since it <lb/>
            never cometh of judgment, and never <lb/>
            lasteth steadily.</p>
          <p>'Then, again, who does not see how <lb/>
            empty, how foolish, is the fame of noble <lb/>
            birth? Why, if the nobility is based on <lb/>
            renown, the renown is another's! For, <lb/>
            truly, nobility seems to be a sort of reputa- <lb/>
            tion coming from the merits of ancestors. <lb/>
            But if it is the praise which brings renown, <lb/>
            of necessity it is they who are praised <lb/>
            that are famous. Wherefore, the fame of <lb/>
            another clothes thee not with splendour if <lb/>
            thou hast none of thine own. So, if there <lb/>
            is any excellence in nobility of birth, <lb/>
            methinks it is this alone-that it would <lb/>
            seem to impose upon the nobly born the <lb/>
            obligation not to degenerate from the <lb/>
            virtue of their ancestors.' <note type="footnote"> 8-2 </note></p><pb n="116"/>

          <p>' Then, what shall I say of the pleasures <lb/>
            of the body ? The lust thereof is full of <lb/>
            uneasiness; the sating, of repentance. <lb/>
            What sicknesses, what intolerable pains, <lb/>
            are they wont to bring on the bodies <lb/>
            of those who enjoy them-the fruits of <lb/>
            iniquity, as it were ! Now, what sweetness <lb/>
            the stimulus of pleasure may have I do <lb/>
            not know. But that the issues of pleasure <lb/>
            are painful everyone may understand who <lb/>
            chooses to recall the memory of his own <lb/>
            fleshly lusts. Nay, if these can make <lb/>
            happiness, there is no reason why the <lb/>
            beasts also should not be happy, since all <lb/>
            their efforts are eagerly set upon satisfying <lb/>
            the bodily wants. I know, indeed, that <lb/>
            the sweetness of wife and children should <lb/>
            be right comely, yet only too true to nature <lb/>
            is what was said of one-that he found in <lb/>
            his sons his tormentors. And how galling <lb/>
            such a contingency would be, I must needs <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            put thee in mind, since thou hast never in <lb/>
            any wise suffered such experiences, nor art <lb/>
            thou now under any uneasiness. In such <lb/>
            a case, I agree with my servant Euripides, <lb/>
            who said that a man without children was <lb/>
            fortunate in his misfortune.'*</p>

          <p>' It is beyond doubt, then, that these <lb/>
            paths do not lead to happiness; they <lb/>
            cannot guide anyone to the promised goal. <lb/>
            Now, I will very briefly show what serious <lb/>
            evils are involved in following them. Just <lb/>
            consider. Is it thy endeavour to heap up <lb/>
            money? Why, thou must wrest it from <lb/>
            its present possessor! Art thou minded <lb/>
            to put on the splendour of official dignity ? <lb/>
            Thou must beg from those who have the <lb/>
            giving of it; thou who covetest to outvie <lb/>
            others in honour must lower thyself to the <lb/>
            humble posture of petition. Dost thou <lb/>
            long for power? Thou must face perils, <lb/>
            for thou wilt be at the mercy of thy <lb/>
            subjects' plots. Is glory thy aim ? Thou <lb/>
            art lured on through all manner of hard- <lb/>
            ships, and there is an end to thy peace of <lb/>
            mind. Art fain to lead a life of pleasure ? <lb/>
            Yet who does not scorn and contemn one <lb/>
            who is the slave of the weakest and vilest <lb/>
            of things-the body? Again, on how <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            slight and perishable a possession do they <lb/>
            rely who set before themselves bodily <lb/>
            excellences ! Can ye ever surpass the <lb/>
            elephant in bulk or the bull in strength ? <lb/>
            Can ye excel the tiger in swiftness ? Look <lb/>
            upon the infinitude, the solidity, the swift <lb/>
            motion, of the heavens, and for once cease <lb/>
            to admire things mean and worthless. <lb/>
            And yet the heavens are not so much to <lb/>
            be admired on this account as for the <lb/>
            reason which guides them. Then, how <lb/>
            transient is the lustre of beauty! how <lb/>
            soon gone !-more fleeting than the fading <lb/>
            bloom of spring flowers. And yet if, as <lb/>
            Aristotle says, men should see with the <lb/>
            eyes of Lynceus, so that their sight might <lb/>
            pierce through obstructions, would not that <lb/>
            body of Alcibiades, so gloriously fair in <lb/>
            outward seeming, appear altogether loath- <lb/>
            some when all its inward parts lay open <lb/>
            to the view ? Therefore, it is not thy own <lb/>
            nature that makes thee seem beautiful, <lb/>
            but the weakness of the eyes that see thee. <lb/>
            Yet prize as unduly as ye will that body's <lb/>
            excellences ; so long as ye know that this <lb/>
            that ye admire, whatever its worth, can be <lb/>
            dissolved away by the feeble flame of a <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            three days' fever. From all which con- <lb/>
            siderations we may conclude as a whole, <lb/>
            that these things which cannot make good <lb/>
            the advantages they promise, which are <lb/>
            never made perfect by the assemblage of all <lb/>

            For not on leafy stems <lb/>
            Do ye within the green wood look for gold, <lb/>
            Nor strip the vine for gems ;</p>
          <p>Your nets ye do not spread <lb/>
            Upon the hill-tops; that the groaning board <lb/>
            With fish be furnished; <lb/>
            If ye are fain to chase <lb/>
            The bounding goat, ye sweep not in vain <lb/>

            The ocean's ruffled face.</p><pb n="122"/>
            
          <p>The sea's far depths they know, <lb/>
            Each hidden nook, wherein the waves <lb/>

            Where lurks the Tyrian shell, <lb/>

            This blindness they can bear; <lb/>

          <p>' This much may well suffice to set forth <lb/>
            the form of false happiness ; if this is now <lb/>
            clear to thine eyes, the next step is to show <lb/>
            what true happiness is.'</p>
          <p>' Indeed,' said I, ' I see clearly enough <lb/>
            that neither is independence to be found <lb/>
            in wealth, nor power in sovereignty, nor <lb/>
            reverence in dignities, nor fame in glory, <lb/>
            nor true joy in pleasures.'</p>
          <p>' Hast thou discerned also the causes <lb/>
            why this is so ?'</p>
          <p>' I seem to have some inkling, but I <lb/>
            should like to learn more at large from <lb/>
            thee.'</p>
          <p>' Why, truly the reason is hard at hand. <lb/>
            That which is simple and indivisible by <lb/>
            nature human error separates, and trans- <lb/>
            forms from the true and perfect to the <lb/>
            false and imperfect. Dost thou imagine <lb/>
            that which lacketh nothing can want <lb/>
            power ?</p>
          <p>' Certainly not.'</p><pb n="124"/>
            
          <p>' Right; for if there is any feebleness <lb/>
            of strength in anything, in this there must <lb/>
            necessarily be need of external protection.'</p>
          <p>' That is so.'</p>
          <p>' Accordingly, the nature of indepen- <lb/>
            dence and power is one and the same.'</p>
          <p>' It seems so.'</p>
          <p>' Well, but dost think that anything of <lb/>
            such a nature as this can be looked upon <lb/>
            with contempt, or is it rather of all things <lb/>
            most worthy of veneration ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay; there can be no doubt as to <lb/>
            that.'</p>
          <p>' Let us, then, add reverence to inde- <lb/>
            pendence and power, and conclude these <lb/>
            three to be one.'</p>
          <p>' We must if we will acknowledge the <lb/>
            truth.'</p>
          <p>'Thinkest thou, then, this combination <lb/>
            of qualities to be obscure and without <lb/>
            distinction, or rather famous in all renown ? <lb/>
            Just consider: can that want renown which <lb/>
            ' has been agreed to be lacking in nothing, <lb/>
            to be supreme in power, and right worthy <lb/>
            of honour, for the reason that it cannot <lb/>
            bestow this upon itself, and so comes to <lb/>
            appear somewhat poor in esteem ?'</p><pb n="125"/>
            
          <p>' I cannot but acknowledge that, being <lb/>
            what it is, this union of qualities is also <lb/>
            right famous.'</p>
          <p>'It follows, then, that we must admit <lb/>
            that renown is not different from the other <lb/>
            three.'</p>
          <p>' It does,' said I.</p>
          <p>' That, then, which needs nothing out- <lb/>
            side itself, which can accomplish all things <lb/>
            in its own strength, which enjoys fame <lb/>
            and compels reverence, must not this <lb/>
            evidently be also fully crowned with joy?'</p>
          <p>'In sooth, I cannot conceive,' said I, <lb/>
            ' how any sadness can find entrance into <lb/>
            such a state; wherefore I must needs <lb/>
            acknowledge it full of joy—at least, if our <lb/>
            former conclusions are to hold.'</p>
          <p>'Then, for the same reasons, this also <lb/>
            is necessary-that independence, power, <lb/>
            renown, reverence, and sweetness of <lb/>
            delight, are different only in name, but in <lb/>
            substance differ no wise one from the <lb/>
            other.'</p>
          <p>' It is,' said I.</p>
          <p>' This, then, which is one, and simple <lb/>
            by nature, human perversity separates, <lb/>
            and, in trying to win a part of that which <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            has no parts, fails to attain not only that <lb/>
            portion (since there are no portions), but <lb/>
            also the whole, to which it does not dream <lb/>
            of aspiring.'</p>
          <p>' How so ?' said I.</p>
          <p>c He who, to escape want, seeks riches, <lb/>
            gives himself no concern about power; <lb/>
            he prefers a mean and low estate, and <lb/>
            also denies himself many pleasures dear <lb/>
            to nature to avoid losing the money which <lb/>
            he has gained. But at this rate he does <lb/>
            not even attain to independence-a weak- <lb/>
            ling void of strength, vexed by distresses, <lb/>
            mean and despised, and buried in ob- <lb/>
            scurity. He, again, who thirsts alone for <lb/>
            power squanders his wealth, despises <lb/>
            pleasure, and thinks fame and rank alike <lb/>
            worthless without power. But thou seest <lb/>
            in how many ways his state also is defec- <lb/>
            tive. Sometimes it happens that he lacks <lb/>
            necessaries, that he is gnawed by anxieties, <lb/>
            and, since he cannot rid himself of these <lb/>
            inconveniences, even ceases to have that <lb/>
            power which was his whole end and aim. <lb/>
            In like manner may we cast up the reckon- <lb/>
            ing in case of rank, of glory, or of pleasure. <lb/>
            For since each one of these severally is <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            identical with the rest, whosoever seeks <lb/>
            any one of them without the others does <lb/>
            not even lay hold of that one which he <lb/>
            makes his aim.'</p>
          <p>' Well,' said I, ' what then ?'</p>
          <p>' Suppose anyone desire to obtain them <lb/>
            together, he does indeed wish for happi- <lb/>
            ness as a whole; but will he find it in <lb/>
            these things which, as we have proved, are <lb/>
            unable to bestow what they promise ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay ; by no means,' said I.</p>
          <p>' Then, happiness must certainly not be <lb/>
            sought in these things which severally are <lb/>
            believed to afford some one of the blessings <lb/>
            most to be desired.'</p>
          <p>'They must not, I admit. No con- <lb/>
            clusion could be more true.'</p>
          <p>'So, then, the form and the causes of <lb/>
            false happiness are set before thine eyes. <lb/>
            Now turn thy gaze to the other side; there <lb/>
            thou wilt straightway see the true happi- <lb/>
            ness I promised.'</p>
          <p>' Yea, indeed, 'tis plain to the blind,' <lb/>
            said I. 'Thou didst point it out even <lb/>
            now in seeking to unfold the causes of the <lb/>
            false. For, unless I am mistaken, that is <lb/>
            true and perfect happiness which crowns <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            one with the union of independence, power, <lb/>
            reverence, renown, and joy. And to prove <lb/>
            to thee with how deep an insight I have <lb/>
            listened-since all these are the same- <lb/>
            that which can truly bestow one of them <lb/>
            I know to be without doubt full and com- <lb/>
            plete happiness.'</p>
          <p>' Happy art thou, my scholar, in this <lb/>
            thy conviction; only one thing shouldst <lb/>
            thou add.'</p>
          <p>' What is that ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' Is there aught, thinkest thou, amid <lb/>
            these mortal and perishable things which <lb/>
            can produce a state such as this ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay, surely not; and this thou hast <lb/>
            so amply demonstrated that no word more <lb/>
            is needed.'</p>
          <p>, Well, then, these things seem to give <lb/>
            to mortals shadows of the true good, or <lb/>
            some kind of imperfect good; but the <lb/>
            true and perfect good they cannot bestow.'</p>
          <p>1 Even so,' said I.</p>
          <p>' Since, then, thou hast learnt what that <lb/>
            true happiness is, and what men falsely <lb/>
            call happiness, it now remains that thou <lb/>
            shouldst learn from what source to seek <lb/>
            this.'</p><pb n="129"/>
            
          <p>' Yes; to this I have long been eagerly <lb/>
            looking forward.'</p>
          <p>' Well, since, as Plato maintains in the</p>
          <p>" Timseus," we ought even in the most trivial <lb/>
            matters to implore the Divine protection, <lb/>
            what thinkest thou should we now do in <lb/>
            order to deserve to find the seat of that <lb/>
            highest good ?'</p>
          <p>' We must invoke the Father of all <lb/>
            things,' said I; 'for without this no enter- <lb/>
            prise sets out from a right beginning.'</p>
          <p>' Thou sayest well,' said she ; and forth- <lb/>

          <p>' Since now thou hast seen what is the <lb/>
            form of the imperfect good, and what the <lb/>
            form of the perfect also, methinks I should <lb/>
            next show in what manner this perfection <lb/>
            of felicity is built up. And here I conceive <lb/>
            it proper to inquire, first, whether any ex- <lb/>
            cellence, such as thou hast lately defined, <lb/>
            can exist in the nature of things, lest we <lb/>
            be deceived by an empty fiction of thought <lb/>
            to which no true reality answers. But it <lb/>
            cannot be denied that such does exist, <lb/>
            and is, as it were, the source of all things <lb/>
            good. For everything which is called im- <lb/>
            .perfect is spoken of as imperfect by reason <lb/>
            of the privation of some perfection ; so it <lb/>
            comes to pass that, whenever imperfection <lb/>
            is found in any particular, there must <lb/>
            necessarily be a perfection in respect of <lb/>
            that particular also. For were there no <lb/>
            such perfection, it is utterly inconceivable <lb/>
            how that so-called imperfection should <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            come into existence. Nature does not <lb/>
            make a beginning with things mutilated <lb/>
            and imperfect; she starts with what is <lb/>
            whole and perfect, and falls away later to <lb/>
            these feeble and inferior productions. So <lb/>
            if there is, as we showed before, a happi- <lb/>
            ness of a frail and imperfect kind, it <lb/>
            cannot be doubted but there is also a <lb/>
            happiness substantial and perfect.'</p>
          <p>' Most true is thy conclusion, and most <lb/>
            sure,' said I.</p>
          <p>'Next to consider where the dwelling- <lb/>
            place of this happiness may be. The <lb/>
            common belief of all mankind agrees that <lb/>
            God, the supreme of all things, is good. <lb/>
            For since nothing can be imagined better <lb/>
            than God, how can we doubt Him to be <lb/>
            good than whom there is nothing better? <lb/>
            Now, reason shows God to be good in <lb/>
            such wise as to prove that in Him is <lb/>
            perfect good. For were it not so, He <lb/>
            would not be supreme of all things; for <lb/>
            there would be something else more ex- <lb/>
            cellent, possessed of perfect good, which <lb/>
            would seem to have the advantage in <lb/>
            priority and dignity, since it has clearly <lb/>
            appeared that all perfect things are prior <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            to those less complete. Wherefore, lest <lb/>
            we fall into an infinite regression, we must <lb/>
            acknowledge the supreme God to be full <lb/>
            of supreme and perfect good. But we <lb/>
            have determined that true happiness is the <lb/>
            perfect good; therefore true happiness <lb/>
            must dwell in the supreme Deity.'</p>
          <p>' I accept thy reasonings,' said I; ' they <lb/>
            cannot in any wise be disputed.'</p>
          <p>' But, come, see how strictly and incon- <lb/>
            trovertibly thou mayst prove this our asser- <lb/>
            tion that the supreme Godhead hath fullest <lb/>
            possession of the highest good.'</p>
          <p>' In what way, pray ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' Do not rashly suppose that He who is <lb/>
            the Father of all things hath received that <lb/>
            highest good of which He is said to be <lb/>
            possessed either from some external source, <lb/>
            or hath it as a natural endowment in such <lb/>
            sort that thou mightest consider the <lb/>
            essence of the happiness possessed, and <lb/>
            of the God who possesses it, distinct and <lb/>
            different. For if thou deemest it received <lb/>
            from without, thou mayst esteem that <lb/>
            which gives more excellent than that which <lb/>
            has received. But Him we most worthily <lb/>
            acknowledge to be the most supremely <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            excellent of all things. If, however, it is <lb/>
            in Him by nature, yet is logically distinct, <lb/>
            the thought is inconceivable, since we are <lb/>
            speaking of God, who is supreme of all <lb/>
            things. Who was there to join these dis- <lb/>
            tinct essences? Finally, when one thing <lb/>
            is different from another, the things so <lb/>
            conceived as distinct cannot be identical. <lb/>
            Therefore that which of its own nature is <lb/>
            distinct from the highest good is not itself <lb/>
            the highest good-an impious thought of <lb/>
            Him than whom, 'tis plain, nothing can <lb/>
            be more excellent. For universally nothing <lb/>
            can be better in nature than the source <lb/>
            from which it has come; therefore on <lb/>
            most true grounds of reason would I con- <lb/>
            clude that which is the source of all things <lb/>
            to be in its own essence the highest good.'</p>
          <p>' And most justly,' said I.</p>
          <p>' But the highest good has been ad- <lb/>
            mitted to be happiness.'</p>
          <p>' Yes.'</p>
          <p>'Then,' said she, 'it is necessary to <lb/>
            acknowledge that God is very happiness.'</p>
          <p>' Yes,' said I; ' I cannot gainsay my <lb/>
            former admissions, and I see clearly that <lb/>
            this is a necessary inference therefrom.'</p><pb n="137"/>
            
          <p>'Reflect, also,' said she, 'whether the <lb/>
            same conclusion is not further confirmed <lb/>
            by considering that there cannot be two <lb/>
            supreme goods distinct one from the other. <lb/>
            For the goods which are different clearly <lb/>
            cannot be severally each what the other <lb/>
            is : wherefore neither of the two can be <lb/>
            perfect, since to either the other is want- <lb/>
            ing ; but since it is not perfect, it cannot <lb/>
            manifestly be the supreme good. By no <lb/>
            means, then, can goods which are supreme <lb/>
            be different one from the other. But we <lb/>
            have concluded that both happiness and <lb/>
            God are the supreme good; wherefore that <lb/>
            which is highest Divinity must also itself <lb/>
            necessarily be supreme happiness.'</p>
          <p>' No conclusion,' said I, ' could be truer <lb/>
            to fact, nor more soundly reasoned out, <lb/>
            nor more worthy of God.'</p>
          <p>'Then, further,' said she, 'just as geo- <lb/>
            metricians are wont to draw inferences <lb/>
            from their demonstrations to which they <lb/>
            give the name " deductions," so will I add <lb/>
            here a sort-of corollary. For since men <lb/>
            become happy by the acquisition of happi- <lb/>
            ness, while happiness is very Godship, it <lb/>
            is manifest that they become happy by the <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            acquisition of Godship. But as by the <lb/>
            acquisition of justice men become just, <lb/>
            and wise by the acquisition of wisdom, <lb/>
            so by parity of reasoning by acquiring <lb/>
            Godship they must of necessity become <lb/>
            gods. So every man who is happy is a <lb/>
            god; and though in nature God is One <lb/>
            only, yet there is nothing to hinder that <lb/>
            very many should be gods by participation <lb/>
            in that nature.'</p>
          <p>' A fair conclusion, and a precious,' said <lb/>
            I, ' deduction or corollary, by whichever <lb/>
            name thou wilt call it.'</p>
          <p>' And yet,' said she, ' not one whit fairer <lb/>
            than this which reason persuades us to add.'</p>
          <p>' Why, what ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' Why, seeing happiness has many par- <lb/>
            ticulars included under it, should all these <lb/>
            be regarded as forming one body of happi- <lb/>
            ness, as it were, made up of various parts, <lb/>
            or is there some one of them which forms <lb/>
            the full essence of happiness, while all the <lb/>
            rest are relative to this ?'</p>
          <p>' I would thou wouldst unfold the whole <lb/>
            matter to me at large.'</p>
          <p>' We judge happiness to be good, do we <lb/>
            not ?'</p><pb n="139"/>
            
          <p>' Yea, the supreme good.'</p>
          <p>' And this superlative applies to all; for <lb/>
            this same happiness is adjudged to be <lb/>
            the completest independence, the highest <lb/>
            power, reverence, renown, and pleasure.'</p>
          <p>' What then ?'</p>
          <p>' Are all these goods-independence, <lb/>
            power, and the rest — to be deemed <lb/>
            members of happiness, as it were, or are <lb/>
            they all relative to good as to their summit <lb/>
            and crown ?'</p>
          <p>' I understand the problem, but I desire <lb/>
            to hear how thou wouldst solve it.'</p>
          <p>' Well, then, listen to the determination <lb/>
            of the matter. Were all these members <lb/>
            composing happiness, they would differ <lb/>
            severally one from the other. For this is <lb/>
            the nature of parts-that by their difference <lb/>
            they compose one body. All these, how- <lb/>
            ever, have been proved to be the same; <lb/>
            therefore they cannot possibly be members, <lb/>
            otherwise happiness will seem to be built <lb/>
            up out of one member, which cannot be.'</p>
          <p>. There can be no doubt as to that,' <lb/>
            said I; ' but I am impatient to hear what <lb/>
            remains.'</p>
          <p>' Why, it is manifest that all the others <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            are relative to the good. For the very <lb/>
            reason why independence is sought is that <lb/>
            it is judged good, and so power also, <lb/>
            because it is believed to be good. The <lb/>
            same, too, may be supposed of reverence, <lb/>
            of renown, and of pleasant delight. Good, <lb/>
            then, is the sum and source of all desirable <lb/>
            things. That which has not in itself any <lb/>
            good, either in reality or in semblance, <lb/>
            can in no wise be desired. Contrariwise, <lb/>
            even things which by nature are not good <lb/>
            are desired as if they were truly good, if <lb/>
            they seem to be so. Whereby it comes <lb/>
            to pass that goodness is rightly believed <lb/>
            to be the sum and hinge and cause of all <lb/>
            things desirable. Now, that for the sake <lb/>
            of which anything is desired itself seems <lb/>
            to be most wished for. For instance, if <lb/>
            anyone wishes to ride for the sake of <lb/>
            health, he does not so much wish for the <lb/>
            exercise of riding as the benefit of his <lb/>
            health. Since, then, all things are sought <lb/>
            for the sake of the good, it is not these so <lb/>
            much as good itself that is sought by all. <lb/>
            But that on account of which all other <lb/>
            things are wished for was, we agreed, <lb/>
            happiness ; wherefore thus also it appears <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            that it is happiness alone which is sought. <lb/>
            From all which it is transparently clear <lb/>
            that the essence of absolute good and of <lb/>
            happiness is one and the same:</p>
          <p>' I cannot see how anyone can dissent <lb/>
            from these conclusions.'</p>
          <p>' But we have also proved that God and <lb/>
            true happiness are one and the same.'</p>
          <p>' Yes,' said I.</p>
          <p>' Then we can safely conclude, also, that <lb/>
            God's essence is seated in absolute good, <lb/>
            and nowhere else.'</p>

          <p>Then said she : ' What value wouldst <lb/>

            is the good.'</p>
          <p>, Yet this will I make clear to thee on <lb/>
            truest grounds of reason, if only our recent <lb/>
            conclusions stand fast.'</p>
          <p>' They will.'</p>
          <p>' Have we not shown that those things <lb/>
            which most men desire are not true and <lb/>
            perfect good precisely for this cause-that <lb/>
            they differ severally one from another, <lb/>
            and, seeing that one is wanting to another, <lb/>
            they cannot bestow full and absolute good; <lb/>
            but that they become the true good when <lb/>
            they are gathered, as it were, into one form <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            and agency, so that that which is indepen- <lb/>
            dence is likewise power, reverence, renown, <lb/>
            and pleasant delight, and unless they are <lb/>
            all one and the same, they have no claim <lb/>
            to be counted among things desirable ?'</p>
          <p>' Yes; this was clearly proved, and <lb/>
            cannot in any wise be doubted.'</p>
          <p>' Now, when things are far from being <lb/>
            good while they are different, but become <lb/>
            good as soon as they are one, is it not <lb/>
            true that these become good by acquiring <lb/>
            unity ?'</p>
          <p>' It seems so,' said I.</p>
          <p>' But dost not thou allow that all which <lb/>
            is good is good by participation in good- <lb/>
            ness ?'</p>
          <p>' It is.'</p>
          <p>' Then, thou must on similar grounds <lb/>
            admit that unity and goodness are the <lb/>
            same; for when the effects of things in <lb/>
            their natural working differ not, their <lb/>
            essence is one and the same.'</p>
          <p>' There is no denying it.'</p>
          <p>' Now, dost thou know,' said she, ' that <lb/>
            all which is abides and subsists so long <lb/>
            as it continues one, but so soon as it ceases <lb/>
            to be one it perishes and falls to pieces?'</p><pb n="145"/>
            
          <p>' In what way ?'</p>
          <p>' Why, take animals, for example. When <lb/>
            soul and body come together, and continue <lb/>
            in one, this is, we say, a living creature; <lb/>
            but when this unity is broken by the <lb/>
            separation of these two, the creature dies, <lb/>
            and is clearly no longer living. The body <lb/>
            also, while it remains in one form by the <lb/>
            joining together of its members, presents <lb/>
            a human appearance; but if the separa- <lb/>
            tion and dispersal of the parts break up <lb/>
            :the body's unity, it ceases to be what it <lb/>
            was. And if we extend our survey to all <lb/>
            other things, without doubt it will mani- <lb/>
            festly appear that each several thing sub- <lb/>
            sists while it is one, but when it ceases to <lb/>
            be one perishes.'</p>
          <p>' Yes ; when I consider further, I see it <lb/>
            to be even as thou sayest.'</p>
          <p>' Well, is there aught,' said she, ' which, <lb/>
            in so far as it acts conformably to nature, <lb/>
            abandons the wish for life, and desires to <lb/>
            come to death and corruption ?'</p>
          <p>' Looking to living creatures, which have <lb/>
            some faults of choice, I find none that, <lb/>
            without external compulsion, forego the <lb/>
            will to live, and of their own accord hasten <note type="footnote"> TO </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            to destruction. For every creature dili- <lb/>
            gently pursues the end of self-preservation, <lb/>
            and shuns death and destruction. As to <lb/>
            herbs and trees, and inanimate things <lb/>
            generally, I am altogether in doubt what <lb/>
            to think.'</p>
          <p>'And yet there is no possibility of <lb/>
            question about this either, since thou seest <lb/>
            how herbs and trees grow in places suitable <lb/>
            for them, where, as far as their nature <lb/>
            admits, they cannot quickly wither and <lb/>
            die. Some spring up in the plains, others <lb/>
            in the mountains ; some grow in marshes, <lb/>
            others cling to rocks; and others, again, <lb/>
            find a fertile soil in the barren sands; and <lb/>
            if you try to transplant these elsewhere, <lb/>
            they wither away. Nature gives to each <lb/>
            the soil that suits it, and uses her diligence <lb/>
            to prevent any of them dying, so long as <lb/>
            it is possible for them to continue alive. <lb/>
            Why do they all draw their nourishment <lb/>
            from roots as from a mouth dipped into <lb/>
            the earth, and distribute the strong bark <lb/>
            over the pith ? Why are all the softer <lb/>
            parts like the pith deeply encased within, <lb/>
            while the external parts have the strong <lb/>
            texture of wood, and outside of all is the <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            bark to resist the weather's inclemency, <lb/>
            like a champion stout in endurance ? <lb/>
            Again, how great is nature's diligence to <lb/>
            secure universal propagation by multiply- <lb/>
            ing seed ! Who does not know all these <lb/>
            to be contrivances, not only for the present <lb/>
            maintenance of a species, but for its lasting <lb/>
            continuance, generation after generation, <lb/>
            for ever? And do not also the things <lb/>
            believed inanimate on like grounds of <lb/>
            reason seek each what is proper to itself? <lb/>
            Why do the flames shoot lightly upward, <lb/>
            while the earth presses downward with its <lb/>
            weight, if it is not that these motions and <lb/>
            situations are suitable to their respective <lb/>
            natures ? Moreover, each several thing is <lb/>
            preserved by that which is agreeable to its <lb/>
            nature, even as it is destroyed by things <lb/>
            inimical. Things solid like stones resist <lb/>
            disintegration by the close adhesion of <lb/>
            their parts. Things fluid like air and <lb/>
            water yield easily to what divides them, <lb/>
            but swiftly flow back and mingle with those <lb/>
            parts from which they have been severed, <lb/>
            while fire, again, refuses to be cut at all. <lb/>
            And we are not now treating of the volun- <lb/>
            tary motions of an intelligent soul, but of <note type="footnote"> 10—2 </note> <lb/>

            the drift of nature. Even so is it that we <lb/>
            digest our food without thinking about it, <lb/>
            and draw our breath unconsciously in <lb/>
            sleep; nay, even in living creatures the <lb/>
            love of life cometh not of conscious will, <lb/>
            but from the principles of nature. For <lb/>
            oftentimes in the stress of circumstances <lb/>
            will chooses the death which nature shrinks <lb/>
            from ; and contrarily, in spite of natural <lb/>
            appetite, will restrains that work of repro- <lb/>
            duction by which alone the persistence of <lb/>
            perishable creatures is maintained. So <lb/>
            entirely does this love of self come from <lb/>
            drift of nature, not from animal impulse. <lb/>
            Providence has furnished things with this <lb/>
            most cogent reason for continuance : they <lb/>
            must desire life, so long as it is naturally <lb/>
            possible for them to continue living. <lb/>
            Wherefore in no way mayst thou doubt <lb/>
            but that things naturally aim at continuance <lb/>
            of existence, and shun destruction.'</p>
          <p>' I confess,' said I, ' that what I lately <lb/>
            thought uncertain, I now perceive to be <lb/>
            indubitably clear.'</p>
          <p>' Now, that which seeks to subsist and <lb/>
            continue desires to be one; for if its oneness <lb/>
            be gone, its very existence cannot continue.'</p><pb n="149"/>
            
          <p>' True,' said I.</p>
          <p>' All things, then, desire to be one.'</p>
          <p>' I agree.'</p>
          <p>'But we have proved that one is the <lb/>
            very same thing as good.'</p>
          <p>' We have.'</p>
          <p>' All things, then, seek the good; indeed, <lb/>
            you may express the fact by defining good <lb/>
            as that which all desire.'</p>
          <p>I Nothing could be more truly thought <lb/>
            out. Either there is no single end to <lb/>
            which all things are relative, or else the <lb/>
            end to which all things universally hasten <lb/>
            must be the highest good of all.'</p>
          <p>Then she: ' Exceedingly do I rejoice, <lb/>
            dear pupil; thine eye is now fixed on the <lb/>
            very central mark of truth. Moreover, <lb/>
            herein is revealed that of which thou didst <lb/>

          <p>' What is that ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' The end and aim of the whole universe. <lb/>
            Surely it is that which is desired of all ; <lb/>
            and, since we have concluded the good to <lb/>
            be such, we ought to acknowledge the end <lb/>
            and aim of the whole universe to be " the <lb/>

          <p>Then said I: ' With all my heart I agree <lb/>
            with Plato; indeed, this is now the second <lb/>
            time that these things have been brought <lb/>
            back to my mind-first I lost them through <lb/>
            the clogging contact of the body; then <lb/>
            after through the stress of heavy grief.'</p>
          <p>Then she continued: ' If thou wilt <lb/>
            reflect upon thy former admissions, it will <lb/>
            not be long before thou dost also recollect <lb/>
            that of which erstwhile thou didst confess <lb/>

          <p>' Awhile ago thou deemedst it beyond <lb/>
            all doubt that God doth govern the world.'</p>
          <p>' I do not think it doubtful now, nor <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            shall I ever; and by what reasons I am <lb/>
            brought to this assurance I will briefly <lb/>
            set forth. This world could never have <lb/>
            taken shape as a single system out of parts <lb/>
            so diverse and opposite were it not that <lb/>
            there is One who joins together these so <lb/>
            diverse things. And when it had once <lb/>
            come together, the very diversity of natures <lb/>
            would have dissevered it and torn it <lb/>
            asunder in universal discord were there <lb/>
            not One who keeps together what He has <lb/>
            joined. Nor would the order of nature <lb/>
            proceed so regularly, nor could its course <lb/>
            exhibit motions so fixed in respect of posi- <lb/>
            tion, time, range, efficacy, and character, <lb/>
            unless there were One who, Himself <lb/>
            abiding, disposed these various vicissitudes <lb/>
            of change. This power, whatsoever it be, <lb/>
            whereby they remain as they were created, <lb/>
            and are kept in motion, I call by the name <lb/>
            which all recognise—God.'</p>
          <p>Then said she : ' Seeing that such is <lb/>
            thy belief, it will cost me little trouble, I <lb/>
            think, to enable thee to win happiness, <lb/>
            and return in safety to thy own country. <lb/>
            But let us give our attention to the task <lb/>
            that we have set before ourselves. Have <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            we not counted independence in the <lb/>
            category of happiness, and agreed that <lb/>
            . God is absolute happiness ?'</p>
          <p>' Truly, we have.'</p>
          <p>' Then, He will need no external assist- <lb/>
            ance for the ruling of the world. Other- <lb/>
            wise, if He stands in need of aught, He <lb/>
            will not possess complete independence.'</p>
          <p>' That is necessarily so,' said I.</p>
          <p>'Then, by His own power alone He <lb/>
            disposes all things.'</p>
          <p>' It cannot be denied.'</p>
          <p>' Now, God was proved to be absolute <lb/>
            good.'</p>
          <p>' Yes ; I remember.'</p>
          <p>'Then, He disposes all things by the <lb/>
            agency of good, if it be true that He rules <lb/>
            all things by His own power whom we <lb/>
            have agreed to be good ; and He is, as it <lb/>
            were, the rudder and helm by which the <lb/>
            world's mechanism is kept steady and in <lb/>
            order.'</p>
          <p>' Heartily do I agree; and, indeed, I <lb/>
            anticipated what thou wouldst say, though <lb/>
            it may be in feeble surmise only.'</p>
          <p>' I well believe it,' said she ; ' for, as I <lb/>
            think, thou now bringest to the search <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            eyes quicker in discerning truth; but what <lb/>
            I shall say next is no less plain and easy <lb/>
            to see.'</p>
          <p>' What is it ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' Why,' said she, ' since God is rightly <lb/>
            believed to govern all things with the <lb/>
            rudder of goodness, and since all things <lb/>
            do likewise, as I have taught, haste towards <lb/>
            good by the very aim of nature, can it be <lb/>
            doubted that His governance is willingly <lb/>
            accepted, and that all submit themselves <lb/>
            to the sway of the Disposer as conformed <lb/>
            and attempered to His rule ?'</p>
          <p>' Necessarily so,' said I; ' no rule would <lb/>
            seem happy if it were a yoke imposed on <lb/>
            reluctant wills, and not the safe-keeping <lb/>
            of obedient subjects.'</p>
          <p>' There is nothing, then, which, while it <lb/>
            follows nature, endeavours to resist good.'</p>
          <p>' No; nothing.'</p>
          <p>' But if anything should, will it have the <lb/>
            least success against Him whom we rightly <lb/>
            agreed to be supreme Lord of happiness ?'</p>
          <p>' It would be utterly impotent.'</p>
          <p>' There is nothing, then, which has <lb/>
            either the will or the power to oppose this <lb/>
            supreme good.'</p><pb n="155"/>
            
          <p>' No; I think not.'</p>
          <p>' So, then,' said she, ' it is the supreme <lb/>
            good which rules in strength, and graciously <lb/>
            disposes all things.'</p>
          <p>Then said I: ' How delighted am I at <lb/>
            thy reasonings, and the conclusion to which <lb/>
            thou hast brought them, but most of all <lb/>
            at these very words which thou usest! I <lb/>
            am now at last ashamed of the folly that <lb/>
            so sorely vexed me.'</p>
          <p>' Thou hast heard the story of the giants <lb/>
            assailing heaven; but a beneficent strength <lb/>
            disposed of them also, as they deserved. <lb/>
            But shall we submit our arguments to the <lb/>
            shock of mutual collision ?-it may be from <lb/>
            the impact some fair spark of truth may <lb/>
            be struck out.'</p>
          <p>, If it be thy good pleasure,' said I.</p>
          <p>' No one can doubt that God is all- <lb/>
            powerful.'</p>
          <p>' No one at all can question it who <lb/>
            thinks consistently.'</p>
          <p>' Now, there is nothing which One who <lb/>
            is all-powerful cannot do.'</p>
          <p>' Nothing.'</p>
          <p>' But can God do evil, then ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay; by no means.'</p><pb n="156"/>
            
          <p>'Then, evil is nothing,' said she, 'since <lb/>
            He to whom nothing is impossible is <lb/>
            unable to do evil.'</p>
          <p>'Art thou mocking me,' said I, 'weaving <lb/>
            a labyrinth of tangled arguments, now <lb/>
            seeming to begin where thou didst end, <lb/>
            and now to end where thou didst begin, <lb/>
            or dost thou build up some wondrous <lb/>
            circle of Divine simplicity ? For, truly, a <lb/>
            little before thou didst begin with happi- <lb/>
            ness, and say it was the supreme good, <lb/>
            and didst declare it to be seated in the <lb/>
            supreme Godhead. God Himself, too, <lb/>
            thou didst affirm to be supreme good and <lb/>
            all-complete happiness; and from this <lb/>
            thou didst go on to add, as by the way, <lb/>
            the proof that no one would be happy <lb/>
            unless he were likewise God. Again, thou <lb/>
            didst say that the very form of good was <lb/>
            the essence both of God and of happiness, <lb/>
            and didst teach that the absolute One was <lb/>
            the absolute good which was sought by <lb/>
            universal nature. Thou didst maintain, <lb/>
            also, that God rules the universe by the <lb/>
            governance of goodness, that all things <lb/>
            obey Him willingly, and that evil has no <lb/>
            existence in nature. And all this thou <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            didst unfold without the help of assump- <lb/>
            tions from without, but by inherent and <lb/>
            proper proofs, drawing credence one from <lb/>
            the other.'</p>
          <p>Then answered she: ' Far is it from me <lb/>
            to mock thee; nay, by the blessing of <lb/>
            God, whom we lately addressed in prayer, <lb/>
            we have achieved the most important of <lb/>
            all objects. For such is the form of the <lb/>
            Divine essence, that neither can it pass <lb/>
            into things external, nor take up anything <lb/>
            external into itself; but, as Parmenides <lb/>
            says of it, <lb/>
            ' " In body like to a sphere on all sides perfectly <lb/>
            rounded," <lb/>
            it rolls the restless orb of the universe, <lb/>
            keeping itself motionless the while. And <lb/>
            if I have also employed reasonings not <lb/>
            drawn from without, but lying within the <lb/>
            compass of our subject, there is no cause <lb/>
            for thee to marvel, since thou hast learnt <lb/>

          <p>CH. I. The mystery of the seeming moral con- <lb/>
            fusion. Philosophy engages to make this <lb/>
            plain, and to fulfil her former promise to <lb/>
            the full.—CH. II. Accordingly, (a) she first <lb/>
            expounds the paradox that the good alone <lb/>
            have power, the bad are altogether power- <lb/>
            less.-CH. III. (b) The righteous never lack <lb/>
            their reward, nor the wicked their punish- <lb/>
            ment.-CH. IV. (c) The wicked are more <lb/>
            unhappy when they accomplish their desires <lb/>
            than when they fail to attain them. (d) Evil- <lb/>
            doers are more fortunate when they expiate <lb/>
            their crimes by suffering punishment than <lb/>
            when they escape unpunished. (e) The <lb/>
            wrong-doer is more wretched than he who <lb/>
            suffers injury.—CH. V. Boethius still cannot <lb/>
            understand why the distribution of happi- <note type="footnote"> I I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            ness and misery to the righteous and the <lb/>
            wicked seems the result of chance. Philo- <lb/>
            sophy replies that this only seems so because <lb/>
            we do not understand the principles of God's <lb/>
            moral governance.—CH. VI. The distinction <lb/>
            of Fate and Providence. The apparent <lb/>
            moral confusion is due to our ignorance of <lb/>
            the secret counsels of God's providence. If <lb/>
            we possessed the key, we should see how all <lb/>
            things are guided to good.—CH. VII. Thus <lb/>
            all fortune is good fortune; for it either re- <lb/>
            wards, disciplines, amends, or punishes, and <lb/>
            so is either useful or just.</p>

          <p>SOFTLY and sweetly Philosophy <lb/>
            sang these verses to the end <lb/>
            without losing aught of the <lb/>
            dignity of her expression or the serious- <lb/>
            ness of her tones; then, forasmuch as I <lb/>
            was as yet unable to forget my deeply- <lb/>
            seated sorrow, just as she was about to <lb/>
            say something further, I broke in and <lb/>
            cried: ' 0 thou guide into the way of <lb/>
            true light, all that thy voice hath uttered <lb/>
            from the beginning even unto now has <lb/>
            manifestly seemed to me at once divine <lb/>
            contemplated in itself, and by the force <lb/>
            of thy arguments placed beyond the pos- <lb/>
            sibility of overthrow. Moreover, these <lb/>
            truths have not been altogether unfamiliar <note type="footnote"> II—2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            to me heretofore, though because of in- <lb/>
            dignation at my wrongs they have for a <lb/>
            time been forgotten. But, lo ! herein is <lb/>
            the very chiefest cause of my grief-that, <lb/>
            while there exists a good ruler of the <lb/>
            universe, it is possible that evil should be <lb/>
            at all, still more that it should go un- <lb/>
            punished. Surely thou must see how <lb/>
            deservedly this of itself provokes astonish- <lb/>
            ment. But a yet greater marvel follows : <lb/>
            While wickedness reigns and flourishes, <lb/>
            virtue not only lacks its reward, but is <lb/>
            even thrust down and trampled under the <lb/>
            feet of the wicked, and suffers punishment <lb/>
            in the place of crime. That this should <lb/>
            happen under the rule of a God who <lb/>
            knows all things and can do all things, but <lb/>
            wills only the good, cannot be sufficiently <lb/>
            wondered at nor sufficiently lamented.'</p>
          <p>Then said she : ' It would indeed be <lb/>
            infinitely astounding, and of all monstrous <lb/>
            things most horrible, if, as thou esteemest, <lb/>
            in the well-ordered home of so great a <lb/>
            householder, the base vessels should be <lb/>
            held in honour, the precious left to neglect. <lb/>
            But it is not so. For if we hold unshaken <lb/>
            those conclusions which we lately reached, <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            thou shalt learn that, by the will of Him <lb/>
            of whose realm we are speaking, the good <lb/>
            are always strong, the bad always weak <lb/>
            and impotent; that vices never go un- <lb/>
            punished, nor virtues unrewarded ; that <lb/>
            good fortune ever befalls the good, and <lb/>
            ill fortune the bad, and much more of the <lb/>
            sort, which shall hush thy murmurings, <lb/>
            and stablish thee in the strong assurance <lb/>
            of conviction. And since by my late in- <lb/>
            structions thou hast seen the form of <lb/>
            happiness, hast learnt, too, the seat where <lb/>
            it is to be found, all due preliminaries <lb/>
            being discharged, I will now show thee <lb/>
            the road which will lead thee home. <lb/>
            Wings, also, will I fasten to thy mind <lb/>
            wherewith thou mayst soar aloft, that so, <lb/>
            all disturbing doubts removed, thou mayst <lb/>

          <p>Then said I: ' Verily, wondrous great <lb/>
            are thy promises; yet I do not doubt but <lb/>
            thou canst make them good: only keep <lb/>
            me not in suspense after raising such <lb/>
            hopes.'</p>
          <p>' Learn, then, first,' said she, ' how that <lb/>
            power ever waits upon the good, while the <lb/>
            bad are left wholly destitute of strength.* <lb/>
            Of these truths the one proves the other; <lb/>
            for since good and evil are contraries, if it <lb/>
            is made plain that good is power, the <lb/>
            feebleness of evil is clearly seen, and, con- <lb/>
            versely, if the frail nature of evil is made <lb/>
            manifest, the strength of good is thereby <lb/>
            known. However, to win ampler credence <lb/>
            for my conclusion, I will pursue both paths, <note type="footnote"> * The paradoxes in this chapter and chapter <lb/>
            iv. are taken from Plato's ' Gorgias.' See Jowett, <lb/>
            vol. ii., pp. 348-366, and also pp. 400, 401 <lb/>
            (' Gorgias,' 466-479, and 508, 509). </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            and draw confirmation for my statements <lb/>
            first in one way and then in the other.</p>
          <p>' The carrying out of any human action <lb/>
            depends upon two things-to wit, will and <lb/>
            power; if either be wanting, nothing can <lb/>
            be accomplished. For if the will be lack- <lb/>
            ing, no attempt at all is made to do what <lb/>
            is not willed; whereas if there be no power, <lb/>
            the will is all in vain. And so, if thou <lb/>
            seest any man wishing to attain some end, <lb/>
            yet utterly failing to attain it, thou canst <lb/>
            not doubt that he lacked the power of <lb/>
            getting what he wished for.'</p>
          <p>' Why, certainly not; there is no deny- <lb/>
            ing it.;</p>
          <p>' Canst thou, then, doubt that he whom <lb/>
            thou seest to have accomplished what he <lb/>
            willed had also the power to accomplish <lb/>
            it ?'</p>
          <p>' Of course not.'</p>
          <p>'Then, in respect of what he can ac- <lb/>
            complish a man is to be reckoned strong, <lb/>
            in respect of what he cannot accomplish <lb/>
            weak ?'</p>
          <p>' Granted,; said I.</p>
          <p>'Then, dost thou remember that, by <lb/>
            our former reasonings, it was concluded <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            that the whole aim of man's will, though <lb/>
            the means of pursuit vary, is set intently <lb/>
            upon happiness ?'</p>
          <p>' I do remember that this, too, was <lb/>
            proved.'</p>
          <p>' Dost thou also call to mind how happi- <lb/>
            ness is absolute good, and therefore that, <lb/>
            when happiness is sought, it is good which <lb/>
            is in all cases the object of desire ?'</p>
          <p>'Nay, I do not so much call to mind <lb/>
            as keep it fixed in my memory.'</p>
          <p>' Then, all men, good and bad alike, <lb/>
            with one indistinguishable purpose strive <lb/>
            to reach good ?'</p>
          <p>' Yes, that follows.'</p>
          <p>' But it is certain that by the attainment <lb/>
            of good men become good ?'</p>
          <p>4 It is.,</p>
          <p>' Then, do the good attain their object ?'</p>
          <p>' It seems so.'</p>
          <p>4 But if the bad were to attain the good <lb/>
            which is their object, they could not be <lb/>
            bad ?'</p>
          <p>' No.'</p>
          <p>' Then, since both seek good, but while <lb/>
            the one sort attain it, the other attain it <lb/>
            not, is there any doubt that the good are <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            endued with power, while they who are <lb/>
            bad are weak ?'</p>
          <p>' If any doubt it, he is incapable of <lb/>
            reflecting on the nature of things, or the <lb/>
            consequences involved in reasoning.'</p>
          <p>' Again, supposing there are two things. <lb/>
            to which the same function is prescribed <lb/>
            in the course of nature, and one of these <lb/>
            successfully accomplishes the function by <lb/>
            natural action, the other is altogether in- <lb/>
            capable of that natural action, instead of <lb/>
            which, in a way other than is agreeable to <lb/>
            its nature, it—I will not say fulfils its <lb/>
            function, but feigns to fulfil it: which of <lb/>
            these two would in thy view be the <lb/>
            stronger ?'</p>
          <p>' I guess thy meaning, but I pray thee <lb/>
            let me hear thee more at large.'</p>
          <p>' Walking is man's natural motion, is it <lb/>
            not ?'</p>
          <p>' Certainly.'</p>
          <p>' Thou dost not doubt, I suppose, that <lb/>
            it is natural for the feet to discharge this <lb/>
            function ?'</p>
          <p>' No ; surely I do not.'</p>
          <p>' Now, if one man who is able to use <lb/>
            his feet walks, and another to whom the <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            natural use of his feet is wanting tries to <lb/>
            walk on his hands, which of the two <lb/>
            wouldst thou rightly esteem the stronger?'</p>
          <p>' Go on,' said I; ' no one can question <lb/>
            but that he who has the natural capacity <lb/>
            has more strength than he who has it <lb/>
            not.'</p>
          <p>, Now, the supreme good is set up as <lb/>
            the end alike for the bad and for the good; <lb/>
            but the good seek it through the natural <lb/>
            action of the virtues, whereas the bad try <lb/>
            to attain this same good through all manner <lb/>
            of concupiscence, which is not the natural <lb/>
            way of attaining good. Or dost thou think <lb/>
            otherwise ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay; rather, one further consequence <lb/>
            is clear to me : for from my admissions it <lb/>
            must needs follow that the good have <lb/>
            power, and the bad are impotent.'</p>
          <p>' Thou anticipatest rightly, and that as <lb/>
            physicians reckon is a sign that nature is <lb/>
            set working, and is throwing off the disease. <lb/>
            But, since I see thee so ready at under- <lb/>
            standing, I will heap proof on proof. <lb/>
            Look how manifest is the extremity of <lb/>
            vicious men's weakness; they cannot even <lb/>
            reach that goal to which the aim of nature <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            leads and almost constrains them. What <lb/>
            if they were left without this mighty, this <lb/>
            well - nigh irresistible help of nature's <lb/>
            guidance ! Consider also how momentous <lb/>
            is the powerlessness which incapacitates <lb/>
            the wicked. Not light or trivial* are the <lb/>
            prizes which they contend for, but which <lb/>
            they cannot win or hold ; nay, their failure <lb/>
            concerns the very sum and crown of things. <lb/>
            Poor wretches ! they fail to compass even <lb/>
            that for which they toil day and night. <lb/>
            Herein also the strength of the good <lb/>
            conspicuously appears. For just as thou <lb/>
            wouldst judge him to be the strongest <lb/>
            walker whose legs could carry him to a <lb/>
            point beyond which no further advance <lb/>
            was possible, so must thou needs account <lb/>
            him strong in power who so attains the <lb/>
            end of his desires that nothing further to <lb/>
            be desired lies beyond. Whence follows <lb/>
            the obvious conclusion that they who are <lb/>
            wicked are seen likewise to be wholly <note type="footnote">* I No trivial game is here; the strife <lb/>

            destitute of strength. For why do they <lb/>
            forsake virtue and follow vice ? Is it from <lb/>
            ignorance of what is good ? Well, what <lb/>
            is more weak and feeble than the blindness <lb/>
            of ignorance ? Do they know what they <lb/>
            ought to follow, but lust drives them aside <lb/>
            out of the way ? If it be so, they are still <lb/>
            frail by reason of their incontinence, for <lb/>
            they cannot fight against vice. Or do they <lb/>
            knowingly and wilfully forsake the good <lb/>
            and turn aside to vice ? Why, at this rate, <lb/>
            they not only cease to have power, but <lb/>
            cease to be at all. For they who forsake <lb/>
            the common end of all things that are, <lb/>
            they likewise also cease to be at all. Now, <lb/>
            to some it may seem strange that we should <lb/>
            assert that the bad, who form the greater <lb/>
            part of mankind, do not exist. But the <lb/>
            fact is so. I do not, indeed, deny that <lb/>
            they who are bad are bad, but that they <lb/>
            are in an unqualified and absolute sense I <lb/>
            deny. Just as we call a corpse a dead <lb/>
            man, but cannot call it simply " man," so <lb/>
            I would allow the vicious to be bad, but <lb/>
            that they are in an absolute sense I cannot <lb/>
            allow. That only is which maintains its <lb/>
            place and keeps its nature; whatever falls <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            away from this forsakes the existence which <lb/>
            is essential to its nature. " But," thou <lb/>
            wilt say, " the bad have an ability." Nor <lb/>
            do I wish to deny it; only this ability of <lb/>
            theirs comes not from strength, but from <lb/>
            impotence. For their ability is to do evil, <lb/>
            which would have had no efficacy at all if <lb/>
            they could have continued in the perform- <lb/>
            ance of good. So this ability of theirs <lb/>
            proves them still more plainly to have no <lb/>
            power. For if, as we concluded just now, <lb/>
            ,evil is nothing, 'tis clear that the wicked <lb/>
            can effect nothing, since they are only able <lb/>
            to do evil.'</p>
          <p>' 'Tis evident.'</p>
          <p>' And that thou mayst understand what <lb/>
            is the precise force of this power, we <lb/>
            determined, did we not, awhile back, that <lb/>
            nothing has more power than supreme <lb/>
            good ?'</p>
          <p>' We did,' said I.</p>
          <p>' But that same highest good cannot do <lb/>
            evil ?'</p>
          <p>' Certainly not.'</p>
          <p>' Is there anyone, then, who thinks that <lb/>
            men are able to do all things ?'</p>
          <p>' None but a madman.'</p><pb n="176"/>
            
          <p>' Yet they are able to do evil?,</p>
          <p>' Ay; would they could not !'</p>
          <p>' Since, then, he who can do only good <lb/>
            is omnipotent, while they who can do evil <lb/>
            also are not omnipotent, it is manifest that <lb/>
            they who can do evil have less power. <lb/>
            There is this also : we have shown that <lb/>
            all power is to be reckoned among things <lb/>
            desirable, and that all desirable things are <lb/>
            referred to good as to a kind of consum- <lb/>
            mation of their nature. But the ability to <lb/>
            commit crime cannot be referred to the <lb/>
            good; therefore it is not a thing to be <lb/>
            desired. And yet all power is desirable ; <lb/>
            it is clear, then, that ability to do evil is <lb/>
            not power. From all which considerations <lb/>
            appeareth the power of the good, and the <lb/>
            indubitable weakness of the bad, and it is <lb/>
            clear that Plato's judgment was true ; the <lb/>
            wise alone are able to do what they would, <lb/>
            while the wicked follow their own hearts' <lb/>
            lust, but can not accomplish what they <lb/>
            would. For they go on in their wilful- <lb/>
            ness fancying they will attain what they <lb/>
            wish for in the paths of delight; but they <lb/>
            are very far from its attainment, since <lb/>
            shameful deeds lead not to happiness.'</p><pb n="177"/>

          <p>' Thou seest, then, in what foulness. <lb/>
            unrighteous deeds are sunk, with what <lb/>
            splendour righteousness shines. Whereby <lb/>
            it is manifest that goodness never lacks its <lb/>
            reward, nor crime its punishment. For, <lb/>
            verily, in all manner of transactions that <lb/>
            for the sake of which the particular action <lb/>
            is done may justly be accounted the reward <lb/>
            of that action, even as the wreath for the <lb/>
            sake of which the race is run is the reward <lb/>
            offered for running. Now, we have shown <lb/>
            happiness to be that very good for the <lb/>
            sake of which all things are done. Absolute <lb/>
            good, then, is offered as the common prize, <lb/>
            as it were, of all human actions. But, <lb/>
            truly, this is a reward from which it is <lb/>
            impossible to separate the good man, for <lb/>
            one who is without good cannot properly <lb/>
            be called good at all; wherefore righteous <lb/>
            dealing never misses its reward. Rage <lb/>
            the wicked, then, never so violently, the <lb/>
            crown shall not fall from the head of the <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            wise, nor wither. Verily, other men's un- <lb/>
            righteousness cannot pluck from righteous <lb/>
            souls their proper glory. Were the reward <lb/>
            in which the soul of the righteous delighteth <lb/>
            received from without, then might it be <lb/>
            taken away by him who gave it, or some <lb/>
            other; but since it is conferred by his <lb/>
            own righteousness, then only will he lose <lb/>
            his prize when he has ceased to be <lb/>
            righteous. Lastly, since every prize is <lb/>
            desired because it is believed to be good, <lb/>
            who can account him who possesses good <lb/>
            to be without reward ? And what a prize, <lb/>
            the fairest and grandest of all! For re- <lb/>
            member the corollary which I chiefly in- <lb/>
            sisted on a little while back, and reason <lb/>
            thus : Since absolute good is happiness, <lb/>
            'tis clear that all the good must be happy <lb/>
            for the very reason that they are good. <lb/>
            But it was agreed that those who are <lb/>
            happy are gods. So, then, the prize of <lb/>
            the good is one which no time may im- <lb/>
            pair, no man's power lessen, no man's un- <lb/>
            righteousness tarnish; 'tis very Godship. <lb/>
            And this being so, the wise man cannot <lb/>
            doubt that punishment is inseparable from <lb/>
            the bad. For since good and bad, and <note type="footnote"> 12—2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            likewise reward and punishment, are con- <lb/>
            traries, it necessarily follows that, corre- <lb/>
            sponding to all that we see accrue as <lb/>
            reward of the good, there is some penalty <lb/>
            attached as punishment of evil. As, then, <lb/>
            righteousness itself is the reward of the <lb/>
            righteous, so wickedness itself is the <lb/>
            punishment of the unrighteous. Now, no <lb/>
            one who is visited with punishment doubts <lb/>
            that he is visited with evil. Accordingly, <lb/>
            if they were but willing to weigh their own <lb/>
            case, could they think themselves free from <lb/>
            punishment whom wickedness, worst of <lb/>
            all evils, has not only touched, but deeply <lb/>
            tainted ?</p>
          <p>' See, also, from the opposite standpoint <lb/>
            -the standpoint of the good-what a <lb/>
            penalty attends upon the wicked. -Thou <lb/>
            didst learn a little since that whatever is <lb/>
            is one, and that unity itself is good. Ac- <lb/>
            cordingly, by this way of reckoning, what- <lb/>
            ever falls away from goodness ceases to <lb/>
            be; whence it comes to pass that the bad <lb/>
            cease to be what they were, while only <lb/>
            the outward aspect is still left to show <lb/>
            they have been men. Wherefore, by their <lb/>
            perversion to badness, they have lost <lb/>
            their true human nature. Further, since <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            righteousness alone can raise men above <lb/>
            the level of humanity, it must needs be <lb/>
            that unrighteousness degrades below man's <lb/>
            level those whom it has cast out of man's <lb/>
            estate. It results, then, that thou canst <lb/>
            not consider him human whom thou seest <lb/>
            transformed by vice. The violent despoiler <lb/>
            of other men's goods, enflamed with <lb/>
            covetousness, surely resembles a wolf. A <lb/>
            bold and restless spirit, ever wrangling in <lb/>
            law-courts, is like some yelping cur. The <lb/>
            secret schemer, taking pleasure in fraud <lb/>
            and stealth, is own brother to the fox. <lb/>
            The passionate man, phrenzied with rage, <lb/>
            we might believe to be animated with the <lb/>
            soul of a lion. The coward and runaway, <lb/>
            afraid where no fear is, may be likened <lb/>
            to the timid deer. He who is sunk in <lb/>
            ignorance and stupidity lives like a dull <lb/>
            ass. He who is light and inconstant, <lb/>
            never holding long to one thing, is for all <lb/>
            the world like a bird. He who wallows <lb/>
            in foul and unclean lusts is sunk in the <lb/>
            pleasures of a filthy hog. So it comes to <lb/>
            pass that he who by forsaking righteous- <lb/>
            ness ceases to be a man cannot pass into <lb/>
            a Godlike condition, but actually turns <lb/>
            into a brute beast.'</p><pb n="182"/>

          <p>Then said I: ' This is very true. I see <lb/>
            that the vicious, though they keep the <lb/>
            outward form of man, are rightly said to <lb/>
            be changed into beasts in respect of their <lb/>
            spiritual nature; but, inasmuch as their <lb/>
            cruel and polluted minds vent their rage <lb/>
            in the destruction of the good, I would <lb/>
            this license were not permitted to them.'</p>
          <p>' Nor is it,' said she, ' as shall be shown <lb/>
            in the fitting place. Yet if that license <lb/>
            which thou believest to be permitted to <lb/>
            them were taken away, the punishment of <lb/>
            the wicked would be in great part remitted. <lb/>
            For verily, incredible as it may seem to <lb/>
            some, it needs must be that the bad are <lb/>
            more unfortunate when they have accom- <lb/>
            plished their desires than if they are unable <lb/>
            to get them fulfilled. If it is wretched to <lb/>
            will evil, to have been able to accomplish <lb/>
            evil is more wretched; for without the <lb/>
            power the wretched will would fail of <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            effect. Accordingly, those whom thou <lb/>
            seest to will, to be able to accomplish, <lb/>
            and to accomplish crime, must needs be <lb/>
            the victims of a threefold wretchedness, <lb/>
            since each one of these states has its own <lb/>
            measure of wretchedness.'</p>
          <p>' Yes,' said I; ' yet I earnestly wish they <lb/>
            might speedily be quit of this misfortune <lb/>
            by losing the ability to accomplish crime.'</p>
          <p>' They will lose it,' said she, ' sooner <lb/>
            than perchance thou wishest, or they <lb/>
            themselves think likely; since, verily, <lb/>
            within the narrow bounds of our brief life <lb/>
            there is nothing so late in coming that <lb/>
            anyone, least of all an immortal spirit, <lb/>
            should deem it long to wait for. Their <lb/>
            great expectations, the lofty fabric of their <lb/>
            crimes, is oft overthrown by a sudden and <lb/>
            unlooked-for ending, and this but sets a <lb/>
            limit to their misery.. For if wickedness <lb/>
            makes men wretched, he is necessarily <lb/>
            more wretched who is wicked for a longer <lb/>
            time; and were it not that death, at all <lb/>
            events, puts an end to the evil doings <lb/>
            of the wicked, I should account them <lb/>
            wretched to the last degree. Indeed, if <lb/>
            we have formed true conclusions about <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            the ill fortune of wickedness, that wretched- <lb/>
            ness is plainly infinite which is doomed <lb/>
            to be eternal.'</p>
          <p>Then said I: 'A wonderful inference, <lb/>
            and difficult to grant; but I see that it <lb/>
            agrees entirely with our previous con- <lb/>
            clusions.'</p>
          <p>' Thou art right,' said she; I but if any- <lb/>
            one finds it hard to admit the conclusion, <lb/>
            he ought in fairness either to prove some <lb/>
            falsity in the premises, or to show that <lb/>
            the combination of propositions does not <lb/>
            adequately enforce the necessity of the <lb/>
            conclusion; otherwise, if the premises be <lb/>
            granted, nothing whatever can be said <lb/>
            against the inference of the conclusion. <lb/>
            And here is another statement which seems <lb/>
            not less wonderful, but on the premises <lb/>
            assumed is equally necessary.'</p>
          <p>1 What is that ?'</p>
          <p>' The wicked are happier in undergoing <lb/>
            punishment than if no penalty of justice <lb/>
            chasten them. And I am not now mean- <lb/>
            ing what might occur to anyone-that bad <lb/>
            character is amended by retribution, and <lb/>
            is brought into the right path by the terror <lb/>
            of punishment, or that it serves as an <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            example to warn others to avoid transgres- <lb/>
            sion ; but I believe that in another way <lb/>
            the wicked are more unfortunate when <lb/>
            they go unpunished, even though no ac- <lb/>
            count be taken of amendment, and no <lb/>
            regard be paid to example.'</p>
          <p>'Why, what other way is there beside <lb/>
            these ?' said I.</p>
          <p>Then said she: ' Have we not agreed <lb/>
            that the good are happy, and the evil <lb/>
            wretched ?'</p>
          <p>' Yes,' said I.</p>
          <p>' Now, if,' said she, ' to one in affliction <lb/>
            there be given along with his misery some <lb/>
            good thing, is he not happier than one <lb/>
            whose misery is misery pure and simple <lb/>
            without admixture of any good ?'</p>
          <p>' It would seem so.'</p>
          <p>' But if to one thus wretched, one <lb/>
            destitute of all good, some further evil <lb/>
            be added besides those which make him <lb/>
            wretched, is he not to be judged far <lb/>
            more unhappy than he whose ill fortune <lb/>
            is alleviated by some share of good ?'</p>
          <p>' It could scarcely be otherwise.'</p>
          <p>' Surely, then, the wicked, when they <lb/>
            are punished, have a good thing added to <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            them-to wit, the punishment which by <lb/>
            the law of justice is good; and likewise, <lb/>
            when they escape punishment, a new evil <lb/>
            attaches to them in that very freedom <lb/>
            from punishment which thou hast rightly <lb/>
            acknowledged to be an evil in the case of <lb/>
            the unrighteous.'</p>
          <p>' I cannot deny it.'</p>
          <p>' Then, the wicked are far more un- <lb/>
            happy when indulged with an unjust <lb/>
            freedom from punishment than when <lb/>
            punished by a just retribution. Now, it <lb/>
            is manifest that it is just for the wicked <lb/>
            to be punished, and for them to escape <lb/>
            unpunished is unjust.'</p>
          <p>' Why, who would venture to deny it ?'</p>
          <p>' This, too, no one can possibly deny- <lb/>
            that all which is just is good, and, con- <lb/>
            versely, all which is unjust is bad.'</p>
          <p>Then I answered: ' These inferences <lb/>
            do indeed follow from what we lately con- <lb/>
            cluded ; but tell me,' said I, £ dost thou <lb/>
            take no account of the punishment of the <lb/>
            soul after the death of the body ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay, truly,' said she, ' great are <lb/>
            these penalties, some of them inflicted, I <lb/>
            imagine, in the severity of retribution, <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            others in the mercy of purification. But <lb/>
            it is not my present purpose to speak of <lb/>
            these. So far, my aim hath been to make <lb/>
            thee recognise that the power of the bad <lb/>
            which shocked thee so exceedingly is no <lb/>
            power; to make thee see that those of <lb/>
            whose freedom from punishment thou <lb/>
            didst complain are never without the <lb/>
            proper penalties of their unrighteousness; <lb/>
            to teach thee that the license which thou <lb/>
            prayedst might soon come to an end is <lb/>
            not long-enduring; that it would be more <lb/>
            unhappy if it lasted longer, most unhappy <lb/>
            of all if it lasted for ever; thereafter that <lb/>
            the unrighteous are more wretched if un- <lb/>
            justly let go without punishment than if <lb/>
            punished by a just retribution-from which <lb/>
            point of view it follows that the wicked <lb/>
            are afflicted with more severe penalties <lb/>
            just when they are supposed to escape <lb/>
            punishment.'</p>
          <p>Then said I: ' While I follow thy <lb/>
            reasonings, I am deeply impressed with <lb/>
            their truth; but if I turn to the common <lb/>
            convictions of men, I find few who will <lb/>
            even listen to such arguments, let alone <lb/>
            admit them to be credible.'</p><pb n="190"/>
            
          <p>' True,' said she; ' they cannot lift eyes <lb/>
            accustomed to darkness to the light of <lb/>
            clear truth, and are like those birds whose <lb/>
            vision night illumines and day blinds ; for <lb/>
            while they regard, not the order of the <lb/>
            universe, but their own dispositions of <lb/>
            mind, they think the license to commit <lb/>
            crime, and the escape from punishment, <lb/>
            to be fortunate. But mark the ordinance <lb/>
            of eternal law. Hast thou fashioned thy <lb/>
            soul to the likeness of the better, thou <lb/>
            hast no need of a judge to award the <lb/>
            prize-by thine own act hast thou raised <lb/>
            thyself in the scale of excellence; hast <lb/>
            thou perverted thy affections to baser <lb/>
            things, look not for punishment from one <lb/>
            without thee-thine own act hath degraded <lb/>
            thee, and thrust thee down. Even so, if <lb/>
            alternately thou turn thy gaze upon the <lb/>
            vile earth and upon the heavens, though <lb/>
            all without thee stand still, by the mere <lb/>
            laws of sight thou seemest now sunk in <lb/>
            the mire, now soaring among the stars. <lb/>
            But the common herd regards not these <lb/>
            things. What, then ? Shall we go over <lb/>
            to those whom we have shown to be like <lb/>
            brute beasts ? Why, suppose, now, one <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            who had quite lost his sight should like- <lb/>
            wise forget that he had ever possessed the <lb/>
            faculty of vision, and should imagine that <lb/>
            nothing was wanting in him to human <lb/>
            perfection, should we deem those who saw <lb/>
            as well as ever blind? Why, they will <lb/>
            not even assent to this, either-that they <lb/>
            who do wrong are more wretched than <lb/>
            those who suffer wrong, though the proof <lb/>
            of this rests on grounds of reason no less <lb/>
            strong.'</p>
          <p>' Let me hear these same reasons,' <lb/>
            said I.</p>
          <p>' Wouldst thou deny that every wicked <lb/>
            man deserves punishment ?'</p>
          <p>' I would not, certainly.'</p>
          <p>' And that those who are wicked are <lb/>
            unhappy is clear in manifold ways ?'</p>
          <p>'Yes,' I replied.</p>
          <p>' Thou dost. not doubt, then, that those <lb/>
            who deserve punishment are wretched ?'</p>
          <p>' Agreed,' said I.</p>
          <p>' So, then, if thou wert sitting in judg- <lb/>
            ment, on whom wouldst thou decree the <lb/>
            infliction of punishment-on him who <lb/>
            had done the wrong, or on him who had <lb/>
            suffered it ?'</p><pb n="192"/>
            
          <p>'Without doubt, I would compensate <lb/>
            the sufferer at the cost of the doer of the <lb/>
            wrong.'</p>
          <p>'Then, the injurer would seem more <lb/>
            wretched than the injured ?'</p>
          <p>' Yes ; it follows. And so for this and <lb/>
            other reasons resting on the same ground, <lb/>
            inasmuch as baseness of its own nature <lb/>
            makes men wretched, it is plain that a <lb/>
            wrong involves the misery of the doer, <lb/>
            not of the sufferer.'</p>
          <p>' And yet,' says she, ' the practice of <lb/>
            the law-courts is just the opposite : ad- <lb/>
            vocates try to arouse the commiseration <lb/>
            of the judges for those who have endured <lb/>
            some grievous and cruel wrong; whereas <lb/>
            pity is rather due to the criminal, who <lb/>
            ought to be brought to the judgment-seat <lb/>
            by his accusers in a spirit not of anger, <lb/>
            but of compassion and kindness, as a sick <lb/>
            man to the physician, to have the ulcer of <lb/>
            his fault cut away by punishment. Whereby <lb/>
            the business of the advocate would either <lb/>
            wholly come to a standstill, or, did men <lb/>
            prefer to make it serviceable to mankind, <lb/>
            would be restricted to the practice of ac- <lb/>
            cusation. The wicked themselves also, if <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            through some chink or cranny they were <lb/>
            permitted to behold the virtue they have <lb/>
            forsaken, and were to see that by the pains <lb/>
            of punishment they would rid themselves <lb/>
            of the uncleanness of their vices, and win <lb/>
            in exchange the recompense of righteous- <lb/>
            ness, they would no longer think these <lb/>
            sufferings pains; they would refuse the <lb/>
            help of advocates, and would commit <lb/>
            themselves wholly into the hands of their <lb/>
            accusers and judges. Whence it comes <lb/>
            to pass that for the wise no place is left <lb/>
            for hatred; only the most foolish would <lb/>
            hate the good, and to hate the bad is un- <lb/>
            reasonable. For if vicious propensity is, <lb/>
            as it were, a disease of the soul like bodily <lb/>
            sickness, even as we account the sick in <lb/>
            body by no means deserving of hate, but <lb/>
            rather of pity, so, and much more, should <lb/>
            they be pitied whose minds are assailed by <lb/>
            wickedness, which is more frightful than <lb/>
            any sickness.' <note type="footnote"> 13 </note></p><pb n="194"/>

          <p>On this I said : ' I see how there is a <lb/>
            happiness and misery founded on the actual <lb/>
            deserts of the righteous and the wicked. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, I wonder in myself whether <lb/>
            there is not some good and evil in fortune <lb/>
            as the vulgar understand it. Surely, no <lb/>
            1 sensible man would rather be exiled, poor <lb/>
            and disgraced, than dwell prosperously in <lb/>
            his own country, powerful, wealthy, and <lb/>
            high in honour. Indeed, the work of <lb/>
            wisdom is more clear and manifest in its <lb/>
            operation when the happiness of rulers is <lb/>
            somehow passed on to the people around <lb/>
            them, especially considering that the <lb/>
            prison, the law, and the other pains of <lb/>
            legal punishment are properly due only <lb/>
            to mischievous citizens on whose account <lb/>
            they were originally instituted. Accord- <lb/>
            ingly, I do exceedingly marvel why all this <lb/>
            is completely reversed-why the good are <lb/>
            harassed with the penalties due to crime, <note type="footnote"> 13—2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            and the bad carry off the rewards of <lb/>
            virtue; and I long to hear from thee what <lb/>
            reason may be found for so unjust a state <lb/>
            of disorder. For assuredly I should wonder <lb/>
            less if I could believe that all things are <lb/>
            the confused result of chance. But now <lb/>
            my belief in God's governance doth add <lb/>
            amazement to amazement. For, seeing <lb/>
            that He sometimes assigns fair fortune to <lb/>
            the good and harsh fortune to the bad, <lb/>
            and then again deals harshly with the <lb/>
            good, and grants to the bad their hearts' <lb/>
            desire, how does this differ from chance, <lb/>
            unless some reason is discovered for it all ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay; it is not wonderful,' said she, ' if <lb/>

            within its scope the questions of the <lb/>
            essential simplicity of providence, of the <lb/>
            order of fate, of unforeseen chance, of <lb/>
            the Divine knowledge and predestination, <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            and of the freedom of the will. How <lb/>
            heavy is the weight of all this thou canst <lb/>
            judge for thyself. But, inasmuch as to <lb/>
            know these things also is part of the <lb/>
            treatment of thy malady, we will try to <lb/>
            give them some consideration, despite the <lb/>
            restrictions of the narrow limits of our <lb/>
            time. Moreover, thou must for a time <lb/>
            dispense wf h the pleasures of music and <lb/>
            song, if so be that thou findest any delight <lb/>
            therein, whilst I weave together the con- <lb/>
            nected train of reasons in proper order.'</p>
          <p>' As thou wilt,' said I.</p>
          <p>Then, as if making a new beginning, <lb/>
            she thus discoursed: ' The coming into <lb/>
            being of all things, the whole course of <lb/>
            development in things that change, every <lb/>
            sort of thing that moves in any wise, <lb/>
            receives its due cause, order, and form <lb/>
            from the steadfastness of the Divine mind. <lb/>
            This mind, calm in the citadel of its own <lb/>
            essential simplicity, has decreed that the <lb/>
            method of its rule shall be manifold. <lb/>
            Viewed in the very purity of the Divine <lb/>
            intelligence, this method is called provi- <lb/>
            dence; but viewed in regard to those <lb/>
            things which it moves and disposes, it is <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            what the ancients called fate. That these <lb/>
            two are different will easily be clear to <lb/>
            anyone who passes in review their respec- <lb/>
            tive efficacies. Providence is the Divine <lb/>
            reason itself, seated in the Supreme Being, <lb/>
            which disposes all things; fate is the dis- <lb/>
            position inherent in all things which move, <lb/>
            through which providence joins all things <lb/>
            in their proper order. Providence em- <lb/>
            braces all things, however different, how- <lb/>
            ever infinite; fate sets in motion separately <lb/>
            individual things, and assigns to them <lb/>
            severally their position, form, and time.</p>
          <p>' So the unfolding of this temporal order <lb/>
            unified into the foreview of the Divine <lb/>
            mind is providence, while the same unity <lb/>
            broken up and unfolded in time is fate. <lb/>
            And although these are different, yet is <lb/>
            there a dependence between them ; for <lb/>
            the order of destiny issues from the essen- <lb/>
            tial simplicity of providence. For as the <lb/>
            artificer, forming in his mind beforehand <lb/>
            the idea of the thing to be made, carries <lb/>
            out his design, and develops from moment <lb/>
            to moment what he had before seen in a <lb/>
            single instant as a whole, so God in His <lb/>
            providence ordains all things as parts of a <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            single unchanging whole, but carries out <lb/>
            these very ordinances by fate in a time <lb/>
            of manifold unity. So whether fate is <lb/>
            accomplished by Divine spirits as the <lb/>
            ministers of providence, or by a soul, or <lb/>
            by the service of all nature-whether by <lb/>
            the celestial motion of the stars, by the <lb/>
            efficacy of angels, or by the many-sided <lb/>
            cunning of demons-whether by all or by <lb/>
            some of these the destined series is woven, <lb/>
            this, at least, is manifest: that providence <lb/>
            is the fixed and simple form of destined <lb/>
            events, fate their shifting series in order <lb/>
            of time, as by the disposal of the Divine <lb/>
            simplicity they are to take place. Whereby <lb/>
            it is that all things which are under fate <lb/>
            are subjected also to providence, on which <lb/>
            fate itself is dependent; whereas certain <lb/>
            things which are set under providence are <lb/>
            above the chain of fate—viz., those things <lb/>
            which by their nearness to the primal <lb/>
            Divinity are steadfastly fixed, and lie out- <lb/>
            side the order of fate's movements. For <lb/>
            as the innermost of several circles revolving <lb/>
            round the same centre approaches the <lb/>
            simplicity of the midmost point, and is, <lb/>
            as it were, a pivot round which the exterior <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            circles turn, while the outermost, whirled <lb/>
            in ampler orbit, takes in a wider and <lb/>
            wider sweep of space in proportion to its <lb/>
            departure from the indivisible unity of the <lb/>
            centre-while, further, whatever joins and <lb/>
            allies itself to the centre is narrowed to a <lb/>
            like simplicity, and no longer expands <lb/>
            vaguely into space-even so whatsoever <lb/>
            departs widely from primal mind is in- <lb/>
            volved more deeply in the meshes of fate, <lb/>
            and things are free from fate in proportion <lb/>
            as they seek to come nearer to that central <lb/>
            pivot; while if aught cleaves close to <lb/>
            supreme mind in its absolute fixity, this, <lb/>
            too, being free from movement, rises above <lb/>
            fate's necessity. Therefore, as is reason- <lb/>
            ing to pure intelligence, as that which is <lb/>
            generated to that which is, time to eternity, <lb/>
            a circle to its centre, so is the shifting <lb/>
            series of fate to the steadfastness and <lb/>
            simplicity of providence.</p>
          <p>' It is this causal series which moves <lb/>
            heaven and the stars, attempers the ele- <lb/>
            ments to mutual accord, and again in turn <lb/>
            transforms them into new combinations; <lb/>
            this which renews the series of all things <lb/>
            that are born and die through like succes- <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            sions of germ and birth ; it is its operation <lb/>
            which binds the destinies of men by an <lb/>
            indissoluble nexus of causality, and, since <lb/>
            it issues in the beginning from unalterable <lb/>
            providence, these destinies also must of <lb/>
            necessity be immutable. Accordingly, the <lb/>
            world is ruled for the best if this unity <lb/>
            abiding in the Divine mind puts forth an <lb/>
            inflexible order of causes. And this order, <lb/>
            by its intrinsic immutability, restricts things <lb/>
            mutable which otherwise would ebb and <lb/>
            flow at random. And so it happens that, <lb/>
            although to you, who are not altogether <lb/>
            capable of understanding this order, all <lb/>
            things seem confused and disordered, <lb/>
            nevertheless there is everywhere an ap- <lb/>
            pointed limit which guides all things to <lb/>
            good. Verily, nothing can be done for <lb/>
            the sake of evil even by the wicked them- <lb/>
            selves ; for, as we abundantly proved, they <lb/>
            seek good, but are drawn out of the way <lb/>
            by perverse error; far less can this order <lb/>
            which sets out from the supreme centre <lb/>
            of good turn aside anywhither from the <lb/>
            way in which it began.</p>
          <p>' " Yet what confusion," thou wilt say, <lb/>
            " can be more unrighteous than that pros- <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            perity and adversity should indifferently <lb/>
            befall the good, what they like and what <lb/>
            they loathe come alternately to the bad !" <lb/>
            Yes; but have men in real life such <lb/>
            soundness of mind that their judgments <lb/>
            of righteousness and wickedness must <lb/>
            necessarily correspond with facts ? Why, <lb/>
            on this very point their verdicts conflict, <lb/>
            and those whom some deem worthy of <lb/>
            reward, others deem worthy of punishment. <lb/>
            Yet granted there were one who could <lb/>
            rightly distinguish the good and bad, yet <lb/>
            would he be able to look into the soul's <lb/>
            inmost constitution, as it were, if we may <lb/>
            borrow an expression used of the body ? <lb/>
            The marvel here is not unlike that which <lb/>
            astonishes one who does not know why in <lb/>
            health sweet things suit some constitutions, <lb/>
            and bitter others, or why some sick men <lb/>
            are best alleviated by mild remedies, others <lb/>
            by severe. But the physician who dis- <lb/>
            tinguishes the precise conditions and <lb/>
            characteristics of health and sickness does <lb/>
            not marvel. Now, the health of the soul <lb/>
            is nothing but righteousness, and vice is <lb/>
            its sickness. God, the guide and physician <lb/>
            of the mind, it is who preserves the good <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            and banishes the bad. And He looks <lb/>
            forth from the lofty watch-tower of His <lb/>
            providence, perceives what is suited to <lb/>
            each, and assigns what He knows to be <lb/>
            suitable.</p>
          <p>' This, then, is what that extraordinary <lb/>
            mystery of the order of destiny comes to <lb/>
            -that something is done by one who <lb/>
            knows, whereat the ignorant are astonished. <lb/>
            But let us consider a few instances whereby <lb/>
            appears what is the competency of human <lb/>
            reason to fathom the Divine unsearchable- <lb/>
            ness. Here is one whom thou deemest <lb/>
            the perfection of justice and scrupulous <lb/>
            integrity; to all-knowing Providence it <lb/>
            seems far otherwise. We all know our <lb/>
            Lucan's admonition that it was the winning <lb/>
            cause that found favour with the gods, <lb/>
            the beaten cause with Cato. So, shouldst <lb/>
            thou see anything in this world happening <lb/>
            differently from thy expectation, doubt not <lb/>
            but events are rightly ordered; it is in thy <lb/>
            judgment that there is perverse confusion.</p>
          <p>'Grant, however, there be somewhere <lb/>
            found one of so happy a character that <lb/>
            God and man alike agree in their judg- <lb/>
            ments about him ; yet is he somewhat <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            infirm in strength of mind. It may be, if <lb/>
            he fall into adversity, he will cease to <lb/>
            practise that innocency which has failed <lb/>
            to secure his fortune. Therefore, God's <lb/>
            wise dispensation spares him whom ad- <lb/>
            versity might make worse, will not let <lb/>
            him suffer who is ill fitted for endurance. <lb/>
            Another there is perfect in all virtue, so <lb/>
            holy and nigh to God that providence <lb/>
            judges it unlawful that aught untoward <lb/>
            should befall him; nay, doth not even <lb/>
            permit him to be afflicted with bodily <lb/>
            ! disease. As one more excellent than 1* <lb/>
            hath said: <lb/>
            ' " The very body of the holy saint <lb/>
            Is built of purest ether." <lb/>
            Often it happens that the governance is <lb/>
            given to the good that a restraint may be <lb/>
            put upon superfluity of wickedness. To <lb/>
            others providence assigns some mixed lot <lb/>
            suited to their spiritual nature; some it <lb/>
            will plague lest they grow rank through <lb/>
            long prosperity; others it will suffer to be <note type="footnote"> * Parmenides. Boethius seems to forget for <lb/>
            the moment that Philosophy is speaking. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            vexed with sore afflictions to confirm their <lb/>
            virtues by the exercise and practice of <lb/>
            patience. Some fear overmuch what they <lb/>
            have strength to bear; others despise over- <lb/>
            much that to which their strength is un- <lb/>
            equal. All these it brings to the test of <lb/>
            their true self through misfortune. Some <lb/>
            also have bought a name revered to future <lb/>
            ages at the price of a glorious death; <lb/>
            some by invincible constancy under their <lb/>
            sufferings have afforded an example to <lb/>
            others that virtue cannot be overcome by <lb/>
            calamity-all which things, without doubt, <lb/>
            come to pass rightly and in due order, <lb/>
            and to the benefit of those to whom they <lb/>
            are seen to happen.</p>
          <p>' As to the other side of the marvel, that <lb/>
            the bad now meet with affliction, now get <lb/>
            their hearts' desire, this, too, springs from <lb/>
            the same causes. As to the afflictions, of <lb/>
            course no one marvels, because all hold <lb/>
            the wicked to be ill deserving. The truth <lb/>
            is, their punishments both frighten others <lb/>
            from crime, and amend those on whom <lb/>
            they are inflicted; while their prosperity <lb/>
            is a powerful sermon to the good, what <lb/>
            judgments they ought to pass on good <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            fortune of this kind, which often attends <lb/>
            the wicked so assiduously.</p>
          <p>' There is another object which may, I <lb/>
            believe, be attained in such cases: there <lb/>
            is one, perhaps, whose nature is so reck- <lb/>
            less and violent that poverty would drive <lb/>
            him more desperately into crime. His <lb/>
            disorder providence relieves by allowing <lb/>
            him to amass money. Such a one, in the <lb/>
            uneasiness of a conscience stained with <lb/>
            guilt, while he contrasts his character with <lb/>
            his fortune, perchance grows alarmed lest <lb/>
            he should come to mourn the loss of that <lb/>
            whose possession is so pleasant to him. <lb/>
            He will, then, reform his ways, and <lb/>
            through the fear of losing his fortune he <lb/>
            forsakes his iniquity. Some, through a <lb/>
            prosperity unworthily borne, have been. <lb/>
            hurled headlong to ruin; to some the <lb/>
            power of the sword has been committed, <lb/>
            to the end that the good may be tried by <lb/>
            discipline, and the bad punished. For <lb/>
            while there can be no peace between the <lb/>
            righteous and the wicked, neither can the <lb/>
            wicked agree among themselves. How <lb/>
            should they, when each is at variance <lb/>
            with himself, because his vices rend his <note type="footnote"> 14 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            conscience, and ofttimes they do things <lb/>
            which, when they are done, they judge <lb/>
            ought not to have been done. Hence it <lb/>
            is that this supreme providence brings to <lb/>
            pass this notable marvel--that the bad <lb/>
            make the bad good. For some, when <lb/>
            they see the injustice which they them- <lb/>
            selves suffer at the hands of evil-doers, are <lb/>
            inflamed with detestation of the offenders, <lb/>
            and, in the endeavour to be unlike those <lb/>
            whom they hate, return to the ways of <lb/>
            virtue. It is the Divine power alone to <lb/>
            which things evil are also good, in that, <lb/>
            by putting them to suitable use, it bringeth <lb/>
            them in the end to some good issue. For <lb/>
            order in some way or other embraceth all <lb/>
            things, so that even that which has de- <lb/>
            parted from the appointed laws of the <lb/>
            order, nevertheless falleth within an order, <lb/>
            though another order, that nothing in the <lb/>
            realm of providence may be left to hap- <lb/>
            hazard. But <lb/>
            ' " Hard were the task, as a god, to recount all, <lb/>
            nothing omitting." <lb/>
            Nor, truly, is it lawful for man to compass <lb/>
            in thought all the mechanism of the Divine <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            work, or set it forth in speech. Let us be <lb/>
            content to have apprehended this only- <lb/>
            that God, the creator of universal nature, <lb/>
            likewise disposeth all things, and guides <lb/>
            them to good; and while He studies to <lb/>
            preserve in likeness to Himself all that <lb/>
            He has created, He banishes all evil from <lb/>
            the borders of His commonweal through <lb/>
            the links of fatal necessity. Whereby it <lb/>
            comes to pass that, if thou look to dis- <lb/>
            posing providence, thou wilt nowhere find <lb/>
            the evils which are believed so to abound <lb/>
            on earth.</p>
          <p>But I see thou hast long been burdened <lb/>
            with the weight of the subject, and fatigued <lb/>
            with the prolixity of the argument, and <lb/>
            now lookest for some refreshment of sweet <lb/>
            poesy. Listen, then, and may the draught <lb/>
            so restore thee that thou wilt bend thy <lb/>
            mind more resolutely to what remains.' <note type="footnote"> 14—2 </note></p><pb n="212"/>

          <p>Wouldst thou with unclouded mind <lb/>
            View the laws by God designed, <lb/>
            Lift thy steadfast gaze on high <lb/>
            To the starry canopy; <lb/>
            See in rightful league of love <lb/>
            All the constellations move. <lb/>
            Fiery Sol, in full career, <lb/>
            Ne'er obstructs cold Phoebe's sphere ; <lb/>
            When the Bear, at heaven's height, <lb/>
            Wheels his coursers' rapid flight, <lb/>
            Though he sees the starry train <lb/>
            Sinking in the western main, <lb/>
            He repines not, nor desires <lb/>
            In the flood to quench his fires.</p>
          <p>In true sequence, as decreed, <lb/>
            Daily morn and eve succeed; <lb/>
            Vesper brings the shades of night, <lb/>
            Lucifer the morning light. <lb/>
            Love, in alternation due, <lb/>
            Still the cycle doth renew, <lb/>
            And discordant strife is driven <lb/>
            From the starry realm of heaven. <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            Thus, in wondrous amity, <lb/>
            Warring elements agree; <lb/>
            Hot and cold, and moist and dry, <lb/>
            Lay their ancient quarrel by; <lb/>
            High the flickering flame ascends, <lb/>
            Downward earth for ever tends.</p>
          <p>So the year in spring's mild hours <lb/>
            Loads the air with scent of flowers; <lb/>
            Summer paints the golden grain ; <lb/>
            Then, when autumn comes again, <lb/>
            Bright with fruit the orchards glow ; <lb/>
            Winter brings the rain and snow. <lb/>
            Thus the seasons' fixed progression, <lb/>
            Tempered in a due succession, <lb/>
            Nourishes and brings to birth <lb/>
            All that lives and breathes on earth. <lb/>
            Then, soon run life's little day, <lb/>
            All it brought it takes away.</p>
          <p>But One sits and guides the reins, <lb/>
            He who made and all sustains; <lb/>
            King and Lord and Fountain-head, <lb/>
            Judge most holy, Law most dread ; <lb/>
            Now impels and now keeps back, <lb/>
            Holds each waverer in the track. <lb/>
            Else, were once the power withheld <lb/>
            That the circling spheres compelled <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            In their orbits to revolve, <lb/>
            This world's order would dissolve, <lb/>
            And th' harmonious whole would all <lb/>
            In one hideous ruin fall.</p>
          <p>But through this connected frame <lb/>
            Runs one universal aim ; <lb/>
            Towards the Good do all things tend, <lb/>
            Many paths, but one the end. <lb/>
            For naught lasts, unless it turns <lb/>
            Backward in its course, and yearns <lb/>
            To that Source to flow again <lb/>
            Whence its being first was ta'en.</p><pb n="215"/>

          <p>' Dost thou, then, see the consequence <lb/>
            of all that we have said ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay; what consequence ?'</p>
          <p>' That absolutely every fortune is good <lb/>
            fortune.'</p>
          <p>' And how can that be ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' Attend,' said she. ' Since every fortune, <lb/>
            welcome and unwelcome alike, has for its <lb/>
            object the reward or trial of the good, and <lb/>
            the punishing or amending of the bad, <lb/>
            every fortune must be good, since it is <lb/>
            either just or useful.'</p>
          <p>' The reasoning is exceeding true,' said <lb/>
            I, ' the conclusion, so long as I reflect <lb/>
            upon the providence and fate of which <lb/>
            thou hast taught me, based on a strong <lb/>
            foundation. Yet, with thy leave, we will <lb/>
            count it among those which just now thou <lb/>
            didst set down as paradoxical.'</p>
          <p>' And why so ?' said she.</p>
          <p>' Because ordinary speech is apt to <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            assert, and that frequently, that some <lb/>
            men's fortune is bad.'</p>
          <p>' Shall we, then, for awhile approach <lb/>
            more nearly to the language of the vulgar, <lb/>
            that we may not seem to have departed <lb/>
            too far from the usages of men ?'</p>
          <p>' At thy good pleasure,' said I.</p>
          <p>'That which advantageth thou'callest <lb/>
            good, dost thou not ?'</p>
          <p>' Certainly.'</p>
          <p>' And that which either tries or amends <lb/>
            advantageth ?'</p>
          <p>4 Granted.'</p>
          <p>4 Is good, then ?'</p>
          <p>4 Of course.'</p>
          <p>' Well, this is their case who have at- <lb/>
            tained virtue and wage war with adversity, <lb/>
            or turn from vice and lay hold on the <lb/>
            path of virtue.'</p>
          <p>' I cannot deny it.'</p>
          <p>' What of the good fortune which is <lb/>
            given as reward of the good-do the vulgar <lb/>
            adjudge it bad ?'</p>
          <p>' Anything but that; they deem it to <lb/>
            be the best, as indeed it is.'</p>
          <p>' What, then, of that which remains, <lb/>
            which, though it is harsh, puts the restraint <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            of just punishment on the bad - does <lb/>
            popular opinion deem it good ?'</p>
          <p>' Nay; of all that can be imagined, it <lb/>
            is accounted the most miserable.'</p>
          <p>' Observe, then, if, in following popular <lb/>
            opinion, we have not ended in a conclusion <lb/>
            quite paradoxical.'</p>
          <p>' How so ?' said I.</p>
          <p>' Why, it results from our admissions <lb/>
            that of all who have attained, or are <lb/>
            advancing in, or are aiming at virtue, the <lb/>
            fortune is in every case good, while for <lb/>
            those who remain in their wickedness <lb/>
            fortune is always utterly bad.'</p>
          <p>' It is true,' said I; 'yet no one dare <lb/>
            acknowledge it.'</p>
          <p>' Wherefore,' said she, ' the wise man <lb/>
            ought not to take it ill, if ever he is in- <lb/>
            volved in one of fortune's conflicts, any <lb/>
            more than it becomes a brave soldier to <lb/>
            be offended when at any time the trumpet <lb/>
            sounds for battle. The time of trial is <lb/>
            the express opportunity for the one to win <lb/>
            glory, for the other to perfect his wisdom. <lb/>
            Hence, indeed, virtue gets its name, <lb/>
            because, relying on its own efficacy, it <lb/>
            yieldeth not to adversity. And ye who <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            have taken your stand on virtue's steep <lb/>
            ascent, it is not for you to be dissolved <lb/>
            in delights or enfeebled by pleasure; ye <lb/>
            close in conflict—yea, in conflict most <lb/>
            sharp-with all fortune's vicissitudes, lest <lb/>
            ye suffer foul fortune to overwhelm or fair <lb/>
            fortune to corrupt you. Hold the mean <lb/>
            with all your strength. Whatever falls <lb/>
            short of this, or goes beyond, is fraught <lb/>
            with scorn of happiness, and misses the <lb/>
            reward of toil. It rests with you to make <lb/>
            your fortune what you will. Verily, every <lb/>
            harsh-seeming fortune, unless it either dis- <lb/>
            ciplines or amends, is punishment.'</p><pb n="219"/>

          <p>Ten years a tedious warfare raged, <lb/>

          <p>CH. I. Boethius asks if there is really any such <lb/>
            thing as chance. Philosophy answers, in <lb/>
            conformity with Aristotle's definition (Phys., <lb/>
            II. iv.), that chance is merely relative to <lb/>
            human purpose, and that what seems for- <lb/>
            tuitous really depends on a more subtle form <lb/>
            of causation.—CH. II. Has man, then, any <lb/>
            freedom, if the reign of law is thus absolute ? <lb/>
            Freedom of choice, replies Philosophy, is a <lb/>
            necessary attribute of reason. Man has a <lb/>
            measure of freedom, though a less perfect <lb/>
            freedom than divine natures.—CH. III. But <lb/>
            how can man's freedom be reconciled with <lb/>
            God's absolute foreknowledge ? If God's <lb/>
            foreknowledge be certain, it seems to ex- <lb/>
            clude the possibility of man's free will. But <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            if man has no freedom of choice, it follows <lb/>
            that rewards and punishments are unjust as <lb/>
            well as useless; that merit and demerit are <lb/>
            mere names; that God is the cause of men's <lb/>
            wickednesses; that prayer is meaningless.- <lb/>
            CH. IV. The explanation is that man's <lb/>
            reasoning faculties are not adequate to the <lb/>
            apprehension of the ways of God's fore- <lb/>
            knowledge. If we could know, as He knows, <lb/>
            all that is most perplexing in this problem <lb/>
            would be made plain. For knowledge de- <lb/>
            pends not on the nature of the thing known, <lb/>
            but on the faculty of the knower.—CH. V. <lb/>
            Now, where our senses conflict with our <lb/>
            reason, we defer the judgment of the lower <lb/>
            faculty to the judgment of the higher. Our <lb/>
            present perplexity arises from our viewing <lb/>
            God's foreknowledge from the standpoint of <lb/>
            human reason. We must try and rise to the <lb/>
            higher standpoint of God's immediate in- <lb/>
            tuition.—CH. VI. To understand this higher <lb/>
            form of cognition, we must consider God's <lb/>
            nature. God is eternal. Eternity is more <lb/>
            than mere everlasting duration. Accordingly, <lb/>
            His knowledge surveys past and future in <lb/>
            the timelessness of an eternal present. His <lb/>
            foreseeing is seeing. Yet this foreseeing does <lb/>
            not in itself impose necessity, any more than <lb/>
            our seeing things happen makes their hap- <lb/>
            pening necessary. We may, however, if we <lb/>
            please, distinguish two necessities-one abso- <lb/>
            lute, the other conditional on knowledge. In <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            this conditional sense alone do the things <lb/>
            which God foresees necessarily come to pass. <lb/>
            But this kind of necessity affects not the <lb/>
            nature of things. It leaves the reality of <lb/>
            free will unimpaired, and the evils feared do <lb/>
            not ensue. Our responsibility is great, since <lb/>
            all that we do is done in the sight of all- <lb/>
            seeing Providence.</p>

          <p>SHE ceased, and was about to pass <lb/>
            on in her discourse to the ex- <lb/>
            position of other matters, when <lb/>
            I break in and say : ' Excellent is thine <lb/>
            exhortation, and such as well beseemeth <lb/>
            thy high authority; but I am even now <lb/>
            experiencing one of the many difficulties <lb/>
            which, as thou saidst but now, beset the <lb/>
            question of providence. I want to know <lb/>
            whether thou deemest that there is any <lb/>
            such thing as chance at all, and, if so, <lb/>
            what it is.'</p>
          <p>Then she made answer: 'I am anxious <lb/>
            to fulfil my promise completely, and open <lb/>
            to thee a way of return to thy native land. <lb/>
            As for these matters, though very useful <note type="footnote"> 15 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            to know, they are yet a little removed from <lb/>
            the path of our design, and I fear lest <lb/>
            digressions should fatigue thee, and thou <lb/>
            shouldst find thyself unequal to completing <lb/>
            the direct journey to our goal.'</p>
          <p>' Have no fear for that,' said I. ' It is <lb/>
            rest to me to learn, where learning brings <lb/>
            delight so exquisite, especially when thy <lb/>
            argument has been built up on all sides <lb/>
            with undoubted conviction, and no place <lb/>
            is left for uncertainty in what follows.'</p>
          <p>She made answer: 'I will accede to thy <lb/>
            request;' and forthwith she thus began : <lb/>
            ' If chance be defined as a result produced <lb/>
            by random movement without any link of <lb/>
            causal connection, I roundly affirm that <lb/>
            there is no such thing as chance at all, <lb/>
            and consider the word to be altogether <lb/>
            without meaning, except as a symbol of <lb/>
            the thing designated. What place can be <lb/>
            left for random action, when God con- <lb/>
            straineth all things to order? For "ex <lb/>
            nihilo nihil" is sound doctrine which none <lb/>
            of the ancients gainsaid, although they <lb/>
            used it of material substance, not of the <lb/>
            efficient principle; this they laid down as <lb/>
            a kind of basis for all their reasonings <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            concerning nature. Now, if a thing arise <lb/>
            without causes, it will appear to have arisen <lb/>
            from nothing. But if this cannot be, <lb/>
            neither is it possible for there to be chance <lb/>
            in accordance with the definition just <lb/>
            given.'</p>
          <p>'Well,' said I, 'is there, then, nothing <lb/>
            which can properly be called chance or v <lb/>
            accident, or is there something to which <lb/>

          <p>' Thus,' says she : ' Whenever something <lb/>
            is done for the sake of a particular end, <lb/>
            and for certain reasons some other result <lb/>
            than that designed ensues, this is called <lb/>
            chance; for instance, if a man is digging <lb/>
            the earth for tillage, and finds a mass of <lb/>
            buried gold. Now, such a find is regarded <lb/>
            as accidental; yet it is not " ex nihilo," <lb/>
            for it has its proper causes, the unforeseen <lb/>
            and unexpected concurrence of which has <lb/>
            brought the chance about. For had not <lb/>
            the cultivator been digging, had not the <note type="footnote"> 15—2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            man who hid the money buried it in that <lb/>
            precise spot, the gold would not have been <lb/>
            found. These, then, are the reasons why <lb/>
            the find is a chance one, in that it results <lb/>
            from causes which met together and con- <lb/>
            curred, not from any intention on the part <lb/>
            of the discoverer. Since neither he who <lb/>
            buried the gold nor he who worked in <lb/>
            the field intended that the money should <lb/>
            be found, but, as I said, it happened by <lb/>
            coincidence that one dug where the other <lb/>
            buried the treasure. We may, then, define <lb/>
            chance as being an unexpected result flow-. <lb/>
            ing from a concurrence of causes where <lb/>
            the several factors had some definite end. <lb/>
            But the meeting and concurrence of these <lb/>
            causes arises from that inevitable chain of <lb/>
            order which, flowing from the fountain- <lb/>
            head of Providence, disposes all things in <lb/>

          <p>'I am following heedfully,' said I, ' and <lb/>
            I agree that it is as thou sayest. But in <lb/>
            this series of linked causes is there any <lb/>
            freedom left to our will, or does the chain <lb/>
            of fate bind also the very motions of our <lb/>
            souls ?'</p>
          <p>'There is freedom,' said she; 'nor, <lb/>
            indeed, can any creature be rational, unless <lb/>
            he be endowed with free will. For that <lb/>
            which hath the natural use of reason has <lb/>
            the faculty of discriminative judgment, <lb/>
            and of itself distinguishes what is to be <lb/>
            shunned or desired. Now, everyone seeks <lb/>
            what he judges desirable, and avoids what <lb/>
            he thinks should be shunned. Wherefore, <lb/>
            beings endowed with reason possess also <lb/>
            the faculty of free choice and refusal. But <lb/>
            I suppose this faculty not equal alike in <lb/>
            all. The higher Divine essences possess <lb/>
            a clear-sighted judgment, an uncorrupt <lb/>
            will, and an effective power of accomplish- <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            ing their wishes. Human souls must needs <lb/>
            be comparatively free while they abide in <lb/>
            the contemplation of the Divine mind, less <lb/>
            free when they pass into bodily form, and <lb/>
            still less, again, when they are enwrapped <lb/>
            in earthly members. But when they are <lb/>
            given over to vices, and fall from the <lb/>
            possession of their proper reason, then <lb/>
            indeed their condition is utter slavery. <lb/>
            For when they let their gaze fall from the <lb/>
            light of highest truth to the lower world <lb/>
            where darkness reigns, soon ignorance <lb/>
            blinds their vision ; they are disturbed by <lb/>
            baneful affections, by yielding and assent- <lb/>
            ing to which they help to promote the <lb/>
            slavery in which they are involved, and <lb/>
            are in a manner led captive by reason of <lb/>
            their very liberty. Yet He who seeth all <lb/>
            things from eternity beholdeth these things <lb/>
            with the eyes of His providence, and <lb/>
            assigneth to each what is predestined for <lb/>

          <p>Then said I: ' But now I am once <lb/>

          <p>' It seems,' said I, ' too much of a <lb/>
            paradox and a contradiction that God <lb/>
            should know all things, and yet there <lb/>
            should be free will. For if God foresees <lb/>
            everything, and can in no wise be deceived, <lb/>
            that which providence foresees to be about <lb/>
            to happen must necessarily come to pass. <lb/>
            Wherefore, if from eternity He foreknows <lb/>
            not only what men will do, but also their <lb/>
            designs and purposes, there can be no <lb/>
            freedom of the will, seeing that nothing <lb/>
            can be done, nor can any sort of purpose <lb/>
            be entertained, save such as a Divine <lb/>
            providence, incapable of being deceived, <lb/>
            has perceived beforehand. For if the <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            issues can be turned aside to some other <lb/>
            end than that foreseen by providence, <lb/>
            there will not then be any sure foreknow- <lb/>
            ledge of the future, but uncertain con- <lb/>
            jecture instead, and to think this of God <lb/>
            I deem impiety.</p>
          <p>' Moreover, I do not approve the reason- <lb/>
            ing by which some think to solve this <lb/>
            puzzle. For they say that it is not because <lb/>
            God has foreseen the coming of an event <lb/>
            that therefore it is sure to come to pass, <lb/>
            but, conversely, because something is <lb/>
            about to come to pass, it cannot be hidden <lb/>
            from Divine providence; and accordingly <lb/>
            the necessity passes to the opposite side, <lb/>
            and it is not that what is foreseen must <lb/>
            necessarily come to pass, but that what is <lb/>
            about to come to pass must necessarily be <lb/>
            foreseen. But this is just as if the matter <lb/>
            in debate were, which is cause and which <lb/>
            effect — whether foreknowledge of the <lb/>
            future cause of the necessity, or the neces- <lb/>
            sity of the future of the foreknowledge. <lb/>
            But we need not be at the pains of de- <lb/>
            monstrating that, whatsoever be the order <lb/>
            of the causal sequence, the occurrence of <lb/>
            things foreseen is necessary, even though <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            the foreknowledge of future events does <lb/>
            not in itself impose upon them the neces- <lb/>
            sity of their occurrence. For example, if <lb/>
            a man be seated, the supposition of his <lb/>
            being seated is necessarily true; and, con- <lb/>
            versely, if the supposition of his being <lb/>
            seated is true, because he is really seated, <lb/>
            he must necessarily be sitting. So, in <lb/>
            either case, there is some necessity in- <lb/>
            volved—in this latter case, the necessity <lb/>
            of the fact; in the former, of the truth of <lb/>
            the statement. But in both cases the <lb/>
            sitter is not therefore seated because the <lb/>
            opinion is true, but rather the opinion is <lb/>
            true because antecedently he was sitting <lb/>
            as a matter of fact. Thus, though the <lb/>
            cause of the truth of the opinion comes <lb/>
            from the other side,* yet there is a neces- <lb/>
            sity on both sides alike. We can obviously <lb/>
            reason similarly in the case of providence <lb/>
            and the future. Even if future events are <lb/>
            foreseen because they are about to happen, <lb/>
            and do not come to pass because they are <lb/>
            foreseen, still, all the same, there is a <lb/>
            necessity, both that they should be fore- <note type="footnote"> * I.e., the necessity of the truth of the state- <lb/>
            ment from the fact. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            seen by God as about to come to pass, <lb/>
            and that when they are foreseen they <lb/>
            should happen, and this is sufficient for <lb/>
            the destruction of free will. However, it <lb/>
            is preposterous to speak of the occurrence <lb/>
            of events in time as the cause of eternal <lb/>
            foreknowledge. And yet if we believe <lb/>
            that God foresees future events because <lb/>
            they are about to come to pass, what is it <lb/>
            but to think that the occurrence of events <lb/>
            is the cause of His supreme providence ? <lb/>
            Further, just as when I know that anything <lb/>
            is, that thing necessarily is, so when I know <lb/>
            that anything will be, it will necessarily be. <lb/>
            It follows, then, that things foreknown <lb/>
            come to pass inevitably.</p>
          <p>' Lastly, to think of a thing as being <lb/>
            in any way other than what it is, is not <lb/>
            only not knowledge, but it is false opinion <lb/>
            widely different from the truth of know- <lb/>
            ledge. Consequently, if anything is about <lb/>
            to be, and yet its occurrence is not certain <lb/>
            and necessary, how can anyone foreknow <lb/>
            that it will occur ? For just as knowledge <lb/>
            itself is free from all admixture of falsity, <lb/>
            so any conception drawn from knowledge <lb/>
            cannot be other than as it is conceived. <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            For this, indeed, is the cause why know- <lb/>
            ledge is free from falsehood, because of <lb/>
            necessity each thing must correspond <lb/>
            exactly with the knowledge which grasps <lb/>
            its nature. In what way, then, are we to <lb/>
            suppose that God foreknows these un- <lb/>
            certainties as about to come to pass ? <lb/>
            For if He thinks of events which possibly <lb/>
            may not happen at all as inevitably destined <lb/>
            to come to pass, He is deceived; and this <lb/>
            it is not only impious to believe, but even <lb/>
            so much as to express in words. If, on <lb/>
            the other hand, He sees them in the future <lb/>
            as they are in such a sense as to know <lb/>
            that they may equally come to pass or not, <lb/>
            what sort of foreknowledge is this which <lb/>
            comprehends nothing certain nor fixed ? <lb/>
            What better is this than the absurd <lb/>
            vaticination of Teiresias ? <lb/>
            ' " Whate'er I say <lb/>
            Shall either come to pass-or not." <lb/>
            In that case, too, in what would Divine <lb/>
            providence surpass human opinion if it <lb/>
            holds for uncertain things the occurrence <lb/>
            of which is uncertain, even as men do? <lb/>
            But if at that perfectly sure Fountain-head <lb/>
            of all things no shadow of uncertainty can <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            possibly be found, then the occurrence of <lb/>
            those things which He has surely fore- <lb/>
            known as coming is certain. Wherefore <lb/>
            there can be no freedom in human actions <lb/>
            and designs; but the Divine mind, which <lb/>
            foresees all things without possibility of <lb/>
            mistake, ties and binds them down to one <lb/>
            only issue. But this admission once made, <lb/>
            what an upset of human affairs manifestly <lb/>
            ensues ! Vainly are rewards and punish- <lb/>
            ments proposed for the good and bad, <lb/>
            since no free and voluntary motion of the <lb/>
            will has deserved either one or the other ; <lb/>
            nay, the punishment of the wicked and <lb/>
            the reward of the righteous, which is now <lb/>
            esteemed the perfection of justice, will <lb/>
            seem the most flagrant injustice, since <lb/>
            men are determined either way not by <lb/>
            their own proper volition, but by the <lb/>
            necessity of what must surely be. And <lb/>
            therefore neither virtue nor vice is any- <lb/>
            thing, but rather good and ill desert are <lb/>
            confounded together without distinction. <lb/>
            Moreover, seeing that the whole course of <lb/>
            events is deduced from providence, and <lb/>
            nothing is left free to human design, it <lb/>
            comes to pass that our vices also are re- <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            ferred to the Author of all good-a thought <lb/>
            than which none more abominable can <lb/>
            possibly be conceived. Again, no ground <lb/>
            is left for hope or prayer, since how can <lb/>
            we hope for blessings, or pray for mercy, <lb/>
            when every object of desire depends upon <lb/>
            the links of an unalterable chain of causa- <lb/>
            tion ? Gone, then, is the one means of <lb/>
            intercourse between God and man—the <lb/>
            communion of hope and prayer—if it be <lb/>
            true that we ever earn the inestimable <lb/>
            recompense of the Divine favour at the <lb/>
            price of a due humility; for this is the <lb/>
            one way whereby men seem able to hold <lb/>
            communion with God, and are joined to <lb/>
            that unapproachable light by the very act <lb/>
            of supplication, even before they obtain <lb/>
            their petitions. Then, since these things <lb/>
            can scarcely be believed to have any <lb/>
            efficacy, if the necessity of future events <lb/>
            be admitted, what means will there be <lb/>
            whereby we may be brought near and <lb/>
            cleave to Him who is the supreme Head <lb/>
            of all ? Wherefore it needs must be that <lb/>
            the human race, even as thou didst erst- <lb/>

            <title type="sub">IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Then said she: ' This debate about <lb/>
            providence is an old one, and is vigorously <lb/>
            discussed by Cicero in his " Divination "; <lb/>
            thou also hast long and earnestly pondered <lb/>
            the problem, yet no one has had diligence <lb/>
            and perseverance enough to find a solution. <lb/>
            And the reason of this obscurity is that <lb/>
            the movement of human reasoning cannot <lb/>
            cope with the simplicity of the Divine <lb/>
            foreknowledge; for if a conception of its <lb/>
            nature could in any wise be framed, no <lb/>
            shadow of uncertainty would remain. With <lb/>
            a view of making this at last clear and <lb/>
            plain, I will begin by considering the <lb/>
            arguments by which thou art swayed. <lb/>
            First, I inquire into the reasons why thou <lb/>
            art dissatisfied with the solution proposed, <lb/>
            which is to the effect that, seeing the fact <lb/>
            of foreknowledge is not thought the cause <lb/>
            of the necessity of future events, fore- <lb/>
            knowledge is not to be deemed any <lb/>
            hindrance to the freedom of the will. <note type="footnote"> 16—2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            Now, surely the sole ground on which <lb/>
            thou arguest the necessity of the future is <lb/>
            that things which are foreknown cannot <lb/>
            fail to come to pass. But if, as thou wert <lb/>
            ready to acknowledge just now, the fact <lb/>
            of foreknowledge imposes no necessity on <lb/>
            things future, what reason is there for <lb/>
            supposing the results of voluntary action <lb/>
            constrained to a fixed issue? Suppose, <lb/>
            for the sake of argument, and to see what <lb/>
            follows, we assume that there is no fore- <lb/>
            knowledge. Are willed actions, then, tied <lb/>
            down to any necessity in this case ?'</p>
          <p>' Certainly not.'</p>
          <p>'Let us assume foreknowledge again, <lb/>
            but without its involving any actual neces- <lb/>
            sity; the freedom of the will, I imagine, <lb/>
            will remain in complete integrity. But <lb/>
            thou wilt say that, even although the fore- <lb/>
            knowledge is not the necessity of the future <lb/>
            event's occurrence, yet it is a sign that it <lb/>
            will necessarily happen. Granted; but in <lb/>
            this case it is plain that, even if there had <lb/>
            been no foreknowledge, the issues would <lb/>
            have been inevitably certain. For a sign <lb/>
            only indicates something which is, does <lb/>
            not bring to pass that of which it is the <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            sign. We require to show beforehand <lb/>
            that all things, without exception, happen <lb/>
            of necessity in order that a preconception <lb/>
            may be a sign of this necessity. Other- <lb/>
            wise, if there is no such universal necessity, <lb/>
            neither can any preconception be a sign <lb/>
            of a necessity which exists not. Manifestly, <lb/>
            too, a proof established on firm grounds <lb/>
            of reason must be drawn not from signs <lb/>
            and loose general arguments, but from <lb/>
            suitable and necessary causes. But how <lb/>
            can it be that things foreseen should ever <lb/>
            fail to come to pass? Why, this is to <lb/>
            suppose us to believe that the events <lb/>
            which providence foresees to be coming <lb/>
            were not about to happen, instead of our <lb/>
            supposing that, although they should come <lb/>
            to pass, yet there was no necessity involved <lb/>
            in their own nature compelling their oc- <lb/>
            currence. Take an illustration that will <lb/>
            help to convey my meaning. There are <lb/>
            many things which we see taking place <lb/>
            before our eyes — the movements of <lb/>
            charioteers, for instance, in guiding and <lb/>
            turning their cars, and so on. Now, is <lb/>
            any one of these movements compelled <lb/>
            by any necessity ?'</p><pb n="246"/>
            
          <p>' No; certainly not. There would be <lb/>
            no efficacy in skill if all motions took <lb/>
            place perforce.'</p>
          <p>' Then, things which in taking place are <lb/>
            free from any necessity as to their being <lb/>
            in the present must also, before they take <lb/>
            place, be about to happen without neces- <lb/>
            sity. Wherefore there are things which <lb/>
            will come to pass, the occurrence of which <lb/>
            is perfectly free from necessity. At all <lb/>
            events, I imagine that no one will deny <lb/>
            that things now taking place were about <lb/>
            to come to pass before they were actually <lb/>
            happening. Such things, however much <lb/>
            foreknown, are in their occurrence free. <lb/>
            For even as knowledge of things present <lb/>
            imports no necessity into things that are <lb/>
            taking place, so foreknowledge of the <lb/>
            future imports none into things that are <lb/>
            about to come. But this, thou wilt say, <lb/>
            is the very point in dispute-whether any <lb/>
            foreknowing is possible of things whose <lb/>
            occurrence is not necessary. For here <lb/>
            there seems to thee a contradiction, and, <lb/>
            if they are foreseen, their necessity follows; <lb/>
            whereas if there is no necessity, they can <lb/>
            by no means be foreknown ; and thou <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            thinkest that nothing can be grasped as <lb/>
            known unless it is certain, but if things <lb/>
            whose occurrence is uncertain are fore- <lb/>
            known as certain, this is the very mist of <lb/>
            opinion, not the truth of knowledge. For- <lb/>
            to think of things otherwise than as they <lb/>
            are, thou believest to be incompatible with <lb/>
            the soundness of knowledge.</p>
          <p>' Now, the cause of the mistake is this- <lb/>
            that men think that all knowledge is <lb/>
            cognized purely by the nature and efficacy <lb/>
            of the thing known. Whereas the case <lb/>
            is the very reverse : all that is known is <lb/>
            grasped not conformably to its own <lb/>
            efficacy, but rather conformably to the <lb/>
            faculty of the knower. An example will <lb/>
            make this clear : the roundness of a body <lb/>
            is recognised in one way by sight, in <lb/>
            another by touch. Sight looks upon it <lb/>
            from a distance as a whole by a simul- <lb/>
            taneous reflection of rays; touch grasps <lb/>
            the roundness piecemeal, by contact and <lb/>
            attachment to the surface, and by actual <lb/>
            movement round the periphery itself. Man <lb/>
            himself, likewise, is viewed in one way <lb/>
            by Sense, in another by Imagination, in <lb/>
            another way, again, by Thought, in another <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            by pure Intelligence. Sense judges figure <lb/>
            clothed in material substance, Imagination <lb/>
            figure alone without matter. Thought <lb/>
            transcends this again, and by its con- <lb/>
            templation of universals considers the type <lb/>
            itself which is contained in the individual. <lb/>
            The eye of Intelligence is yet more exalted; <lb/>
            for overpassing the sphere of the universal, <lb/>
            it will behold absolute form itself by the <lb/>
            pure force of the mind's vision. Wherein <lb/>
            the main point to be considered is this : <lb/>
            the higher faculty of comprehension em- <lb/>
            braces the lower, while the lower cannot <lb/>
            rise to the higher. For Sense has no <lb/>
            efficacy beyond matter, nor can Imagina- <lb/>
            tion behold universal ideas, nor Thought <lb/>
            embrace pure form; but Intelligence, <lb/>
            looking down, as it were, from its higher <lb/>
            standpoint in its intuition of form, dis- <lb/>
            criminates also the several elements which <lb/>
            underlie it; but it comprehends them in <lb/>
            the same way as it comprehends that form <lb/>
            itself, which could be cognized by no other <lb/>
            than itself. For it cognizes the universal <lb/>
            of Thought, the figure of Imagination, <lb/>
            and the matter of Sense, without employ- <lb/>
            ing Thought, Imagination, or Sense, but <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            surveying all things, so to speak, under <lb/>
            the aspect of pure form by a single flash <lb/>
            of intuition. Thought also, in considering <lb/>
            the universal, embraces images and sense- <lb/>
            impressions without resorting to Imagina- <lb/>
            tion or Sense. For it is Thought which <lb/>
            has thus defined the universal from its <lb/>
            conceptual point of view: " Man is a <lb/>
            two-legged animal endowed with reason." <lb/>
            This is indeed a universal notion, yet no <lb/>
            one is ignorant that the thing is imaginable <lb/>
            and presentable to Sense, because Thought <lb/>
            considers it not by Imagination or Sense, <lb/>
            but by means of rational conception. <lb/>
            Imagination, too, though its faculty of <lb/>
            viewing and forming representations is <lb/>
            founded upon the senses, nevertheless <lb/>
            surveys sense-impressions without calling <lb/>
            in Sense, not in the way of Sense-percep- <lb/>
            tion, but of Imagination. See'st thou, <lb/>
            then, how all things in cognizing use <lb/>
            rather their own faculty than the faculty <lb/>
            of the things which they cognize ? Nor is <lb/>
            this strange; for since every judgment is <lb/>
            the act of the judge, it is necessary that <lb/>
            each should accomplish its task by its <lb/>
            own, not by another's power.'</p><pb n="250"/>

          <p>' Now, although in the case of bodies <lb/>
            endowed with sentiency the qualities of <lb/>
            external objects affect the sense-organs, <lb/>
            and the activity of mind is preceded by <lb/>
            a bodily affection which calls forth the <lb/>
            mind's action upon itself, and stimulates <lb/>
            the forms till that moment lying inactive <lb/>
            within, yet, I say, if in these bodies en- <lb/>
            dowed with sentiency the mind is not <lb/>
            inscribed by mere passive affection, but <lb/>
            of its own efficacy discriminates the im- <lb/>
            pressions furnished to the body, how much <lb/>
            more do intelligences free from all bodily <lb/>
            affections employ in their discrimination <lb/>
            their own mental activities instead of con- <lb/>
            forming to external objects ? So on these <lb/>
            principles various modes of cognition <lb/>
            belong to distinct and different substances. <lb/>
            For to creatures void of motive power- <lb/>

            cling to rocks and grow there-belongs <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            Sense alone, void of all other modes of <lb/>
            gaining knowledge; to beasts endowed <lb/>
            with movement, in whom some capacity <lb/>
            of seeking and shunning seems to have <lb/>
            arisen, Imagination also. Thought per- <lb/>
            tains only to the human race, as Intelli- <lb/>
            gence to Divinity alone ; hence it follows <lb/>
            that that form of knowledge exceeds the <lb/>
            rest which of its own nature cognizes not <lb/>
            only its proper object, but the objects of <lb/>
            the other forms of knowledge also. But <lb/>
            what if Sense and Imagination were to <lb/>
            gainsay Thought, and declare that universal <lb/>
            which Thought deems itself to behold to <lb/>
            be nothing? For the object of Sense <lb/>
            and Imagination cannot be universal; so <lb/>
            that either the judgment of Reason is true <lb/>
            and there is no sense-object, or, since they <lb/>
            know full well that many objects are pre- <lb/>
            sented to Sense and Imagination, the con- <lb/>
            ception of Reason, which looks on that <lb/>
            which is perceived by Sense and particular <lb/>
            as if it were a something "universal," is <lb/>
            empty of content. Suppose, further, that <lb/>
            Reason maintains in reply that it does <lb/>
            indeed contemplate the object of both <lb/>
            Sense and Imagination under the form of <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            universality, while Sense and Imagination <lb/>
            cannot aspire to the knowledge of the <lb/>
            universal, since their cognizance cannot <lb/>
            go beyond bodily figures, and that in the <lb/>
            cognition of reality we ought rather to <lb/>
            trust the stronger and more perfect faculty <lb/>
            of judgment. In a dispute of this sort, <lb/>
            should not we, in whom is planted the <lb/>
            faculty of reasoning as well as of imagining <lb/>
            and perceiving, espouse the cause of <lb/>
            Reason ?</p>
          <p>' In like manner is it that human reason <lb/>
            thinks that Divine Intelligence cannot see <lb/>
            the future except after the fashion in which <lb/>
            its own knowledge is obtained. For thy <lb/>
            contention is, if events do not appear to <lb/>
            involve certain and necessary issues, they <lb/>
            cannot be foreseen as certainly about to <lb/>
            come to pass. There is, then, no fore- <lb/>
            knowledge of such events ; or, if we can <lb/>
            ever bring ourselves to believe that there <lb/>
            is, there can be nothing which does not <lb/>
            happen of necessity. If, however, we could <lb/>
            have some part in the judgment of the <lb/>
            Divine mind, even as we participate in <lb/>
            Reason, we should think it perfectly just <lb/>
            that human Reason should submit itself <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            to the Divine mind, no less than we judged <lb/>
            that Imagination and Sense ought to yield <lb/>
            to Reason. Wherefore let us soar, if we <lb/>
            can, to the heights of that Supreme In <lb/>
            telligence; for there Reason will see what <lb/>
            in itself it cannot look upon; and that is <lb/>
            in what way things whose occurrence is <lb/>
            not certain may yet be seen in a sure and <lb/>
            definite foreknowledge; and that this fore- <lb/>
            knowledge is not conjecture, but rather <lb/>
            knowledge in its supreme simplicity, free <lb/>
            of all limits and restrictions.'</p>

          <p>' Since, then, as we lately proved, every- <lb/>
            thing that is known is cognized not in <lb/>
            accordance with its own nature, but in <lb/>
            accordance with the nature of the faculty <lb/>
            that comprehends it, let us now contem- <lb/>
            plate, as far as lawful, the character of the <lb/>
            Divine essence, that we may be able to <lb/>
            understand also the nature of its know- <lb/>
            ledge.</p>
          <p>' God is eternal; in this judgment all <lb/>
            rational beings agree. Let us, then, con- <lb/>
            sider what eternity is. For this word <lb/>
            carries with it a revelation alike of the <lb/>
            Divine nature and of the Divine know- <lb/>
            ledge. Now, eternity is the possession of <lb/>
            endless life whole and perfect at a single <lb/>
            moment. What this is becomes more <lb/>
            clear and manifest from a comparison with <lb/>
            things temporal. For whatever lives in <lb/>
            time is a present proceeding from the past <lb/>
            to the future, and there is nothing set in <note type="footnote"> i7 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            time which can embrace the whole space <lb/>
            of its life together. To-morrow's state it <lb/>
            grasps not yet, while it has already lost <lb/>
            yesterday's; nay, even in the life of to-day <lb/>
            ye live no longer than one brief transitory <lb/>
            moment. Whatever, therefore, is subject <lb/>
            to the condition of time, although, as <lb/>
            Aristotle deemed of the world, it never <lb/>
            have either beginning or end, and its life <lb/>
            be stretched to the whole extent of time's <lb/>
            infinity, it yet is not such as rightly to be <lb/>
            thought eternal. For it does not include <lb/>
            and embrace the whole space of infinite <lb/>
            life at once, but has no present hold on <lb/>
            things to come, not yet accomplished. <lb/>
            Accordingly, that which includes and <lb/>
            possesses the whole fulness of unending <lb/>
            life at once, from which nothing future <lb/>
            is absent, from which nothing past has <lb/>
            escaped, this is rightly called eternal; this <lb/>
            must of necessity be ever present to itself <lb/>
            in full self-possession, and hold the infinity <lb/>
            of movable time in an abiding present. <lb/>
            Wherefore they deem not rightly who <lb/>
            imagine that on Plato's principles the <lb/>
            created world is made co-eternal with the <lb/>
            Creator, because they are told that he <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            believed the world to have had no begin- <lb/>
            ning in time,* and to be destined never <lb/>
            to come to an end. For it is one thing <lb/>
            for existence to be endlessly prolonged, <lb/>
            which was what Plato ascribed to the <lb/>
            world, another for the whole of an endless <lb/>
            life to be embraced in the present, which <lb/>
            is manifestly a property peculiar to the <lb/>
            Divine mind. Nor need God appear earlier <lb/>
            in mere duration of time to created things, <lb/>
            but only prior in the unique simplicity of <lb/>
            His nature. For the infinite progression <lb/>
            of things in time copies this immediate <lb/>
            existence in the present of the changeless <lb/>
            life, and when it cannot succeed in equal- <lb/>
            ling it, declines from movelessness into <lb/>
            motion, and falls away from the simplicity <lb/>
            of a perpetual present to the infinite dura- <lb/>
            tion of the future and the past; and since <lb/>
            it cannot possess the whole fulness of its <lb/>
            life together, for the very reason that in a <lb/>
            manner it never ceases to be, it seems, up <note type="footnote"> * Plato expressly states the opposite in the <lb/>
            ' Timæus ' (28B), though possibly there the ac- <lb/>
            count of the beginning of the world in time is <lb/>
            to be understood figuratively, not literally. See <lb/>
            Jowett, vol. iii., pp. 448, 449 (3rd edit.). </note> <note type="footnote"> 17—2 </note> <lb/>

            to a certain point, to rival that which it <lb/>
            cannot complete and express by attaching <lb/>
            itself indifferently to any present moment <lb/>
            of time, however swift and brief; and since <lb/>
            this bears some resemblance to that ever- <lb/>
            abiding present, it bestows on everything <lb/>
            to which it is assigned the semblance of <lb/>
            existence. But since it cannot abide, it <lb/>
            hurries along the infinite path of time, and <lb/>
            the result has been that it continues by <lb/>
            ceaseless movement the life the complete- <lb/>
            ness of which it could not embrace while <lb/>
            it stood still. So, if we are minded to <lb/>
            give things their right names, we shall <lb/>
            follow Plato in saying that God indeed is <lb/>
            eternal, but the world everlasting.</p>
          <p>' Since, then, every mode of judgment <lb/>
            comprehends its objects conformably to <lb/>
            its own nature, and since God abides for <lb/>
            ever in an eternal present, His knowledge, <lb/>
            also transcending all movement of time, <lb/>
            dwells in the simplicity of its own change- <lb/>
            less present, and, embracing the whole <lb/>
            infinite sweep of the past and of the future, <lb/>
            contemplates all that falls within its simple <lb/>
            cognition as if it were now taking place. <lb/>
            And therefore, if thou wilt carefully con- <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            sider that immediate presentment whereby <lb/>
            it discriminates all things, thou wilt more <lb/>
            rightly deem it not foreknowledge as of <lb/>
            something future, but knowledge of a <lb/>
            moment that never passes. For this cause <lb/>
            the name chosen to describe it is not pre- <lb/>
            vision, but providence, because, since <lb/>
            utterly removed in nature from things <lb/>
            mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all <lb/>
            things as from some lofty height. Why, <lb/>
            then, dost thou insist that the things which <lb/>
            are surveyed by the Divine eye are involved <lb/>
            in necessity, whereas clearly men impose <lb/>
            no necessity on things which they see? <lb/>
            Does the act of vision add any necessity <lb/>
            to the things which thou seest before thy <lb/>
            eyes ?'</p>
          <p>' Assuredly not.'</p>
          <p>' And yet, if we may without unfitness <lb/>
            compare God's present and man's, just as <lb/>
            ye see certain things in this your temporary <lb/>
            present, so does He see all things in His <lb/>
            eternal present. Wherefore this Divine <lb/>
            anticipation changes not the natures and <lb/>
            properties of things, and it beholds things <lb/>
            present before it, just as they will hereafter <lb/>
            come to pass in time. Nor does it con- <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            found things in its judgment, but in the <lb/>
            one mental view distinguishes alike what <lb/>
            will come necessarily and what without <lb/>
            necessity. For even as ye, when at one <lb/>
            and the same time ye see a man walking <lb/>
            on the earth and the sun rising in the <lb/>
            sky, distinguish between the two, though <lb/>
            one glance embraces both, and judge the <lb/>
            former voluntary, the latter necessary <lb/>
            action: so also the Divine vision in its <lb/>
            universal range of view does in no wise <lb/>
            confuse the characters of the things which <lb/>
            are present to its regard, though future in <lb/>
            respect of time. Whence it follows that <lb/>
            when it perceives that something will come <lb/>
            into existence, and yet is perfectly aware <lb/>
            that this is unbound by any necessity, its <lb/>
            apprehension is not opinion, but rather <lb/>
            knowledge based on truth. And if to this <lb/>
            thou sayest that what God sees to be about <lb/>
            to come to pass cannot fail to come to <lb/>
            pass, and that what cannot fail to come <lb/>
            to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie <lb/>
            me down to this word necessity, I will <lb/>
            acknowledge that thou affirmest a most <lb/>
            solid truth, but one which scarcely anyone <lb/>
            can approach to who has not made the <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            Divine his special study. For my answer <lb/>
            would be that the same future event is <lb/>
            necessary from the standpoint of Divine <lb/>
            knowledge, but when considered in its <lb/>
            own nature it seems absolutely free and <lb/>
            unfettered. So, then, there are two neces- <lb/>
            sities—one simple, as that men are neces- <lb/>
            sarily mortal; the other conditioned, as <lb/>
            that, if you know that someone is walking, <lb/>
            he must necessarily be walking. For that <lb/>
            which is known cannot indeed be other- <lb/>
            wise than as it is known to be, and yet <lb/>
            this fact by no means carries with it that <lb/>
            other simple necessity. For the former <lb/>
            necessity is not imposed by the thing's <lb/>
            own proper nature, but by the addition of <lb/>
            a condition. No necessity compels one <lb/>
            who is voluntarily walking to go forward, <lb/>
            although it is necessary for him to go <lb/>
            forward at the moment of walking. In <lb/>
            the same way, then, if Providence sees <lb/>
            anything as present, that must necessarily <lb/>
            be, though it is bound by no necessity of <lb/>
            nature. Now, God views as present those <lb/>
            coming events which happen of free will. <lb/>
            These, accordingly, from the standpoint <lb/>
            of the Divine vision are made necessary <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            conditionally on the Divine cognizance; <lb/>
            viewed, however, in themselves, they desist <lb/>
            not from the absolute freedom naturally <lb/>
            theirs. Accordingly, without doubt, all <lb/>
            things will come to pass which God fore- <lb/>
            knows as about to happen, but of these <lb/>
            certain proceed of free will; and though <lb/>
            these happen, yet by the fact of their <lb/>
            existence they do not lose their proper <lb/>
            nature, in virtue of which before they <lb/>
            happened it was really possible that they <lb/>
            might not have come to pass.</p>
          <p>' What difference, then, does the denial <lb/>
            of necessity make, since, through their <lb/>
            being conditioned by Divine knowledge, <lb/>
            they come to pass as if they were in all <lb/>
            respects under the compulsion of neces- <lb/>
            sity ? This difference, surely, which we saw <lb/>
            in the case of the instances I formerly <lb/>
            took, the sun's rising and the man's walk- <lb/>
            ing ; which at the moment of their occur- <lb/>
            rence could not but be taking place, and <lb/>
            yet one of them before it took place was <lb/>
            necessarily obliged to be, while the other <lb/>
            was not so at all. So likewise the things <lb/>
            which to God are present without doubt <lb/>
            exist, but some of them come from the <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            necessity of things, others from the power <lb/>
            of the agent. Quite rightly, then, have <lb/>
            we said that these things are necessary if <lb/>
            viewed from the standpoint of the Divine <lb/>
            knowledge; but if they are considered in <lb/>
            themselves, they are free from the bonds <lb/>
            of necessity, even as everything which is <lb/>
            accessible to sense, regarded from the <lb/>
            standpoint of Thought, is universal, but <lb/>
            viewed in its own nature particular. "But," <lb/>
            thou wilt say, " if it is in my power to <lb/>
            change my purpose, I shall make void <lb/>
            providence, since I shall perchance change <lb/>
            something which comes within its fore- <lb/>
            knowledge." My answer is : Thou canst <lb/>
            indeed turn aside thy purpose; but since <lb/>
            the truth of providence is ever at hand to <lb/>
            see that thou canst, and whether thou dost, <lb/>
            and whither thou turnest thyself, thou <lb/>
            canst not avoid the Divine foreknowledge, <lb/>
            even as thou canst not escape the sight of <lb/>
            a present spectator, although of thy free <lb/>
            will thou turn thyself to various actions. <lb/>
            Wilt thou, then, say : " Shall the Divine <lb/>
            knowledge be changed at my discretion, <lb/>
            so that, when I will this or that, providence <lb/>
            changes its knowledge correspondingly ?"</p><pb n="266"/>
            
          <p>' Surely not.'</p>
          <p>'True, for the Divine vision anticipates <lb/>
            all that is coming, and transforms and <lb/>
            reduces it to the form of its own present <lb/>
            knowledge, and varies not, as thou deemest, <lb/>
            in its foreknowledge, alternating to this or <lb/>
            that, but in a single flash it forestalls and <lb/>
            includes thy mutations without altering. <lb/>
            And this ever-present comprehension and <lb/>
            survey of all things God has received, not <lb/>
            from the issue of future events, but from <lb/>
            the simplicity of His own nature. Hereby <lb/>
            also is resolved the objection which a little <lb/>
            while ago gave thee offence-that our <lb/>
            doings in the future were spoken of as if <lb/>
            supplying the cause of God's knowledge. <lb/>
            For this faculty of knowledge, embracing <lb/>
            all things in its immediate cognizance, has <lb/>
            itself fixed the bounds of all things, yet <lb/>
            itself owes nothing to what comes after.</p>
          <p>'And all this being so, the freedom of <lb/>
            man's will stands unshaken, and laws are <lb/>
            not unrighteous, since their rewards and <lb/>
            punishments are held forth to wills un- <lb/>
            bound by any necessity. God, who fore- <lb/>
            knoweth all things, still looks down from <lb/>
            above, and the ever-present eternity of <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            His vision concurs with the future character <lb/>
            of all our acts, and dispenseth to the good <lb/>
            rewards, to the bad punishments. Our <lb/>
            hopes and prayers also are not fixed on <lb/>
            God in vain, and when they are rightly <lb/>
            directed cannot fail of effect. Therefore, <lb/>
            withstand vice, practise virtue, lift up your <lb/>
            souls to right hopes, offer humble prayers <lb/>
            to Heaven. Great is the necessity of <lb/>
            righteousness laid upon you if ye will not <lb/>
            hide it from yourselves, seeing that all <lb/>
            your actions are done before the eyes of <lb/>
            a Judge who seeth all things.'</p>

          <p>WITHIN a short time of writing ' The Con- <lb/>
            solation of Philosophy,' Boethius died by <lb/>
            a cruel death. As to the manner of his <lb/>
            death there is some uncertainty. Accord- <lb/>
            ing to one account, he was cut down by <lb/>
            the swords of the soldiers before the very <lb/>
            judgment-seat of Theodoric; according <lb/>
            to another, a cord was first fastened round <lb/>
            his forehead, and tightened till his eyes <lb/>
            started'; he was then killed with a club. <note type="footnote"> Elliot Stock, Paternoster Rozu, London. </note></p>
