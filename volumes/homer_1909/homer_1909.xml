          </head>
          <p>THE city of TROY was the metropolis of Troas, a country or. the <lb/>
            shores of the Hellespont, watered by the rivers Satnois and <lb/>
            Rhodius on the south and north, and Scamander and Simois in <lb/>
            the middle part.</p>
          <p>How long this city flourished is unknown, but it seems certain <lb/>
            that it arrived at a high degree of wealth and power. Its first <lb/>
            king is said to have been Teucer, and its last Priam, who, by <lb/>
            his wife Hecuba, had nineteen children.</p>
          <p>The second son of Priam, Paris or Alexander, was, on account <lb/>
            of a dream of his mother, denoting that lie should set fire to <lb/>
            Troy, brought up in obscurity as a shepherd. In this condition <lb/>
            he is said to have decided the contest among the three goddesses <lb/>
            for the prize of beauty. Afterwards, discovering his origin, and <lb/>
            being acknowledged by his father, he made a voyage to Greece, <lb/>
            where, being entertained by Menelaus, king of Sparta, he be­ <lb/>
            came enamoured of his queen, Helen, the most beautiful woman <lb/>
            of her age, and fled with her to Troy, where she was received <lb/>
            into the family of Priam as a daughter-in-law.</p>
          <p>But Menelaus was less disposed to be satisfied with his loss, <lb/>
            than Paris and Priam with their gain, and prevailed on the most <lb/>
            eminent leaders and princes of Greece to join with him in an ex­ <lb/>
            pedition to Troy to recover his wife by force of arms. Of the <lb/>
            troops collected for the expedition, which is said to have been <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            two years in preparation, Agamemnon, brother of Menelaus, <lb/>
            and king of Mycenæ and a large portion of the Peloponnesus, <lb/>
            was chosen commander-in-chief. The other most remarkable <lb/>
            leaders were Achilles, from Phthiotis in Thessaly; Ajax, son of <lb/>
            Telamon, from Salamis; Ajax, son of Oileus, from Locri; <lb/>
            Ulysses, from Ithaca; Diomed from Argos ; and Nestor from <lb/>
            Pylos. There were many others of inferior note.</p>
          <p>When the Grecian host, which filled twelve hundred such <lb/>
            vessels as were then in use, arrived on the coast of Troas, they <lb/>
            proceeded, it appears, to lay siege to the city of Troy. But the <lb/>
            Trojans, headed by Hector, the son of Priam, with AEneas, a <lb/>
            Trojan chief, Sarpedon king of Lycia, Pandarus of Zeleia, <lb/>
            Pylæmenes of Paphlagonia, and other auxiliaries, made so reso­ <lb/>
            lute and vigorous a resistance, that the siege or blockade was <lb/>
            protracted for ten years. It is supposed by Thucydides,l however, <lb/>
            that the whole of this period was not occupied in attacks on the <lb/>
            town, but that the Greeks, when the provisions which they brought <lb/>
            with them were exhausted, applied themselves, for subsistence, <lb/>
            to the cultivation of the neighbouring land, and to predatory ex­ <lb/>
            cursions, leaving before the walls of Troy only just a sufficient <lb/>
            number to keep up the form of a siege. Had their whole force, <lb/>
            under the command of such able leaders, maintained continuous <lb/>
            assaults on the city, it is not likely that the inhabitants, however <lb/>
            resolute or skilful, would have succeeded in delaying the capture <lb/>
            of it for so long a period.</p>
          <p>It was in the tenth year of the siege that discord arose between <lb/>
            Agamemnon and Achilles, from the following cause. A pesti. <lb/>
            lence spread through the Grecian army, and Calchas, the chief <lb/>
            augur of the Greeks, being consulted respecting the origin of it, <lb/>
            declared that it proceeded from Apollo, whose priest Chryses, <lb/>
            having come to the camp to offer ransom for his daughter, (who <lb/>
            had been taken prisoner by Achilles at the capture of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring city of Lyrnessus, and had been assigned, in the distri. <lb/>
            bution of the spoil, to Agamemnon,) had been dismissed with <lb/>
            a contumelious refusal by Agamemnon, and had in consequence <lb/>
            called down the anger of Apollo on the Grecian army. Calchas <lb/>
            foretold that the pestilence would not cease till Apollo should be <lb/>
            appeased by the surrender of the captive to her father; and Aga* <note type="footnote"> 1 B. i. c. 11</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            memnon at length consented to part with her, but declared that, <lb/>
            as he yielded her up for the public good, he must be indemnified <lb/>
            by some equivalent; for that he, the commander-in-chief, must <lb/>
            not be the only one of the leaders left without a due share of the <lb/>
            spoil. Unless such equivalent were awarded him, he threatened <lb/>
            that he would seize, by force, the portion of some one of the other <lb/>
            chiefs. As no offer of indemnification was made, he carried his <lb/>
            threat into execution, and seized upon Briseis, another female <lb/>
            captive, who had been assigned to Achilles. Achilles, deeply <lb/>
            offended, retired in wrath to his ships, and refused to take any <lb/>
            farther part in the siege. By his absence, the Greeks were so <lb/>
            weakened and dispirited that Hector and his troops had the ad. <lb/>
            vantage over them in several encounters, and spread among them <lb/>
            great slaughter and dismay.</p>
          <p>An embassy was sent to Achilles, offering him valuable pre. <lb/>
            sents, and the restoration of Briseïs ; but he refused to lend his <lb/>
            countrymen any assistance until Hector was actually setting fire <lb/>
            to the ships, when he allowed his friend Patroclus to lead his <lb/>
            troops to the rescue. Patroclus encountered Hector, by whom <lb/>
            he was killed and despoiled of the armour of Achilles, which lie <lb/>
            had assumed on taking the field. Achilles was seized with grief <lb/>
            and rage at the loss of his friend, and, as soon as new armour <lb/>
            was made for him, returned to the field of battle and slew Hector, <lb/>
            after whose death the Trojans were no longer in a condition to <lb/>
            offer any effectual resistance to the besiegers. Troy was taken <lb/>
            by the Greeks, according to the chronology which we adopt, in <lb/>
            the year 1184 before the commencement of the Christian era.</p>
          <p>It is this tale that Homer has chosen to tell in that form <lb/>
            of composition which we call an epic poem. He commences with <lb/>
            the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles in the tenth year of the <lb/>
            war, rushing, as Horace says, in medias res, and giving his <lb/>
            reader to understand, in the course of his narration, what events <lb/>
            had preceded the point of time from which he starts. At what <lb/>
            period Homer lived, after the termination of the war which he <lb/>
            relates, is utterly uncertain. Eratosthenes, the keeper of the <lb/>
            Alexandrian library in the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, and <lb/>
            Crates, a grammarian contemporary with Aristarchus, place him <lb/>
            in the first century after the capture of Troy; Aristotle and <lb/>
            Aristarchus about a hundred and forty years after it; Philo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            chorus, the Athenian antiquary, forty years later; Apollodorus, <lb/>
            the Athenian chronologist, a pupil of Aristarchus, two hundred <lb/>
            and forty years after the Trojan war; the Arundelian marble two <lb/>
            hundred and seventy-seven; Herodotus, four hundred years <lb/>
            after it. Most modem men of learning, on taking everything <lb/>
            into consideration, adopt a date somewhat earlier than that of <lb/>
            Herodotus, and think that Homer flourished about three hun­ <lb/>
            dred years after the Trojan era, or about 850 B.C.</p>
          <p>But inquirers respecting Homer have been stopped at the <lb/>
            threshold of their investigations by a party, of whom Frederic Au. <lb/>
            gustus Wolf is the Hector, who have requested us to believe that <lb/>
            no Homer, such as we have been accustomed to contemplate, ever <lb/>
            lived at all; and that if there ever was a Homer, who had any <lb/>
            concern in telling the history of the Trojan war, he was but a <lb/>
            collector and arranger of other men's productions ; for, as it is <lb/>
            possible to conceive his name compounded of <foreign xml:lang="grc">όμου̃</foreign>, " together," <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅρω</foreign>, " to fit," it is very natural and proper, they say, to con­ <lb/>
            sider that he was but a " fitter together" of songs that other <lb/>
            people had sung. But the representations of this party, though <lb/>
            they had some effect a while ago, have ceased to be regarded <lb/>
            with much attention by the learned and sensible part of mankind; <lb/>
            who think it unlikely that such a production as the Iliad, of simi­ <lb/>
            lar spirit, style, and consistence throughout, should have been <lb/>
            the offspring of many minds, rather than of one. They consider <lb/>
            that as, when they see a fine statue, of exquisite shape and sym­ <lb/>
            metry, they are not apt to imagine that the different parts of it <lb/>
            are the workmanship of different hands, but rather that one <lb/>
            sculptor fashioned and finished the entire, so, when they read <lb/>
            the Iliad or Odyssey, and find every part of it of a similar cha­ <lb/>
            racter, and each contributing to form a harmonious whole, they <lb/>
            are not inclined to suppose its unity the result of the imaginations <lb/>
            cf several poets, but that of the single imagination of one. They <lb/>
            reflect that, as the world has never produced many Shakspeares, <lb/>
            or Miltons, or Sponsors, at the same time, it is not probable that <lb/>
            it produced many nearly contemporary Homers. They cannot <lb/>
            deem it likely that Greece owes its two great epic poems to a <lb/>
            number of verse-makers, whose very names are unrecorded; <lb/>
            they cannot believe that the Homeric fire, glowing with a <lb/>
            heat that no succeeding poet has equalled in its large inten­ <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            sity, burned on many poetic altars, but rather that it was con­ <lb/>
            secrated on one, and maintained by one inspired priest of Apollo <lb/>
            and the Muses. They cannot credit that Thucydides, Hero­ <lb/>
            dotus, Aristotle, Longinus, Cicero, Ovid, Horace, and all the <lb/>
            great minds of antiquity, were wrong in believing that Homer, <lb/>
            whom the greatest poets worshipped as their master, whose <lb/>
            distant footsteps they adored as unapproachable, and from <lb/>
            whom they were humbly content to draw such inspiration as <lb/>
            they were capable of receiving, was one individual, and that a <lb/>
            " few modern German critics, of intellects utterly inferior to the <lb/>
            great ancients whom we reverence, are right in admonishing us <lb/>
            that we must distribute him into several.</p>
          <p>We shall therefore consider that the Homer of antiquity was <lb/>
            a real personage; and we should be glad to learn some par­ <lb/>
            ticulars of his life. But when we look about for them, we find <lb/>
            none on which we can depend. We have a life of him attributed <lb/>
            to Herodotus; but it has long ceased to be regarded as genuine; <lb/>
            and the short account of him ascribed to Plutarch is held in no <lb/>
            higher estimation. Both are supposed to be the compilations of <lb/>
            mere grammarians. The Life imputed to Herodotus differs in <lb/>
            chronology from Herodotus's history, placing Homer nearly two <lb/>
            centuries and a half earlier, and might for that reason, if for no <lb/>
            other, be regarded as spurious.</p>
          <p>The truth is, that, between the termination of the siege of <lb/>
            Troy, and the date of the first Olympiad, B.C. 766, there occurs <lb/>
            a dark interval, of apparently about four hundred years, of the <lb/>
            events of which we have scarcely any knowledge. The return of <lb/>
            the Heraclidæ, or Dorian invasion of the Peloponnesus, is said to <lb/>
            have taken place eighty years after the fall of Troy, and the <lb/>
            commencement of the emigration of the Ionians into Asia, about <lb/>
            one hundred and forty-six after it; but of no other occurrences <lb/>
            during that period is the chronology at all settled.</p>
          <p>But we find Homer often called Mæonides and Melesigenes <lb/>
            and it is in the fictitious lives of him that we must search for the <lb/>
            origin of those names. Whilst we are investigating these points, <lb/>
            we may, perhaps, look a little farther, and see what account is <lb/>
            to be found of Homer's life and fortunes. Of the place of his <lb/>
            birth, none of the Greeks themselves pretended to any certain <lb/>
            knowledge. Seven eminent cities claimed the honour of it, <note type="footnote"> b</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="x"/>
            according to the old line given in Aulus Gellius from the <unclear>Giek</unclear>, <lb/>
            Smyrna, Rhodos, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, Athenœ; <lb/>
            but their claims found none to decide them. According to the <lb/>
            life ascribed to Herodotus, however, it is said that he was born at <lb/>
            Smyrna, and that his mother's name was Critheis, a native of <lb/>
            Cumæ, daughter of Melanopus. Who was his father, the writer <lb/>
            cannot tell us, for Homer was illegitimate. Critheis, being <lb/>
            found with child by some person unknown, was sent away by <lb/>
            Cleanax, under whose care she had been left by her father, to <lb/>
            Smyrna, under the protection of a man named Ismenias. Soon <lb/>
            after, she was delivered of Homer, on the bank of the Meles, a <lb/>
            river near Smyrna, from whence he was called Melesigenes. <lb/>
            Some said that Meles, the god of the river, was his father; <lb/>
            others that his father's name was Mæon, and hence he is called <lb/>
            Mæonides; though others, again, say that this name merely de <lb/>
            notes him to have been a native of Mæonia, the old name of <lb/>
            Lydia.</p>
          <p>When his mother was delivered of her son, she left Ismenias, <lb/>
            and became acquainted with one Phemius, who had a school in <lb/>
            Smyrna, and who made her an offer of marriage, engaging to <lb/>
            adopt and educate her son. This offer she accepted, and she and <lb/>
            her husband lived till Homer was grown up, when they both died <lb/>
            about the same time, and Homer took charge of the school, which <lb/>
            he conducted with so much success, that he gained the admiration <lb/>
            not only of the inhabitants, but also of the strangers whom <lb/>
            the trade carried on there, especially in corn, attracted to the <lb/>
            city. Amongst these was Mentes, master of a vessel from Leu­ <lb/>
            cadia, a man of some knowledge and intelligence, who prevailed <lb/>
            on Homer to relinquish his school, and travel with him, offering <lb/>
            to pay his expenses and allow him a salary, and observing that <lb/>
            it was proper that he should see with his own eyes, while he was <lb/>
            still young, the countries and cities which he might hereafter <lb/>
            describe. With Mentes he visited Spain and Italy, and <lb/>
            touched, on the way back, at Ithaca, where, having previously <lb/>
            suffered from a defluxion in his eyes, he became much worse, and <lb/>
            was left by Mentes, who was called away to Leucadia, under <lb/>
            medical care, with a friend of his named Mentor, from whom <lb/>
            he experienced great hospitality and kindness, and learned the <lb/>
            principal incidents in the life of Ulysses. When Mentes re­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            turned, he accompanied him to Colophon, where, if not previously <lb/>
            at Ithaca, he became entirely blind.</p>
          <p>Whether he was deserted by Mentes, or how he became sepa­ <lb/>
            rated from him, does not appear; but, finding himself in great <lb/>
            poverty, he resolved on going back to Smyrna, where he might <lb/>
            hope for some support from those who knew him, and for some <lb/>
            opportunity to display or cultivate his poetical abilities. But, <lb/>
            being disappointed in his expectations, he set out for Cumæ, and <lb/>
            was entertained on his way by one Tychius, an armourer or <lb/>
            leather-dresser, at Neon Teichos ; and the inhabitants of the place, <lb/>
            says the biographer, still point out the spot where Homer sat <lb/>
            and recited his verses, and pay it great honour.</p>
          <p>He proceeded, however, after a time, to Cumæ, and being <lb/>
            favourably received, and delighting the people with the recital <lb/>
            of his poetry, he offered, if they would allow him a public main­ <lb/>
            tenance, to do his utmost to make their city famous. His offer <lb/>
            was taken into consideration in the public council, and the ma­ <lb/>
            jority seemed favourable to the request; but one man observed, <lb/>
            that if they resolved to maintain <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂμηροι</foreign>, they would gather about <lb/>
            them a great number of useless people, whence, says the bio­ <lb/>
            grapher, the poet, who had been previously called <unclear>Melssigenes</unclear>, <lb/>
            first received the name of Homer, for the people of Cumæ call <lb/>
            blind men <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂμηροι</foreign>. The remark had such effect, that the main­ <lb/>
            tenance was refused, and the poet could not forbear uttering a <lb/>
            wish that Cumæ might never find a poet to give it renown.</p>
          <p>From Cumæ he went to Phocæa, where one Thestorides, ano­ <lb/>
            ther master of a school, offered him a maintenance if he would <lb/>
            communicate his verses to him. As Homer's necessities obliged <lb/>
            him to comply with this proposal, Thestorides, as soon as he had <lb/>
            made himself master of a sufficient number of the verses, went <lb/>
            off to Chios, where he <unclear>gained</unclear> subsistence and credit by repeating <lb/>
            them, until some people from Chios brought word to Homer of <lb/>
            what he was doing; when Homer determined to pursue and <lb/>
            expose him. Having made his way to Erythræ, he prevailed on <lb/>
            some seamen to carry him over to the island, where the first <lb/>
            person that he encountered was a shepherd named Glaucus, by <lb/>
            whose dogs he had nearly been worried, but who entertained <lb/>
            him kindly, and conducted him to his master, who, finding him <lb/>
            a man of knowledge, induced him to stay in his house, and un­ <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            dertake the education of his children. Thestorides was 'soon <lb/>
            driven from the island, and Homer removed to the town of Chios, <lb/>
            in which he raised a school of poetry, acquired a tolerable for­ <lb/>
            tune, married, and had two daughters, one of whom died young, <lb/>
            and the other married a Chian.</p>
          <p>He now proceeded with his poems, and inserted in them, says <lb/>
            the biographer, the names of those to whom he had been most <lb/>
            indebted; as Mentor, whom he makes the companion of Ulysses <lb/>
            in the Odyssey; and Phoenix, whom he represents as an eminent <lb/>
            minstrel to delight the suitors. He has also introduced the name <lb/>
            of Mentes both in the Iliad and Odyssey, and that of Tychius <lb/>
            in the Iliad as the maker of Ajax's shield.</p>
          <p>Resolving to visit Athens, also, he inserted something compli­ <lb/>
            mentary to the Athenians. On his way to Athens, the vessel <lb/>
            in which he sailed made a circuit to Samoa, where he remained <lb/>
            the following winter; for, being recognized by a Samian who had <lb/>
            known him in Chios, he was introduced to some of the richer <lb/>
            inhabitants, and well entertained, reciting his poetry at their <lb/>
            houses, and at the public festivals. In- the spring he again <lb/>
            set out for Athens, but the ship, which seems to have been <lb/>
            doomed to deviations, found its way to Ios, one of the Cyclades, <lb/>
            where he fell ill, and died.</p>
          <p>Such is an abstract of the earliest attempt that has reached us <lb/>
            at a life of Homer. We find no ground for its statements, and <lb/>
            should suppose that they may have been the mere fictions of a <lb/>
            grammarian ; yet there may have been traditions prevailing at <lb/>
            the time when the writer lived, to afford them some support; <lb/>
            and the writer himself, de mortuis nil nisi bonum, may have been <lb/>
            an anxious inquirer, desirous to advance nothing for which he <lb/>
            could not find a basis. He was evidently, however, a man of no <lb/>
            vigour or comprehension of mind. He has inserted in his per­ <lb/>
            formance, as Homer's, verses which it is wonderful that he could <lb/>
            have supposed the author of the Iliad to have written.</p>
          <p>That Homer was born at or near Smyrna seems to have been <lb/>
            the general belief. Cicero, in his oration for Archias,2 appears <lb/>
            to consider the claim of Smyrna to be called his birth-place be­ <lb/>
            yond those of Colophon, Chios, or Salamis. " The people of <lb/>
            Smyrna," says Strabo,3 " were firmly convinced that he was bona <note type="footnote"> a 0.8. </note> <note type="footnote"> 3 B. xiv.</note> <lb/>

            in their city, and erected a temple to Homer, with a portico at­ <lb/>
            tached to it, which they called Homereion, a name which they <lb/>
            also gave to one of their coins; and some have said that they <lb/>
            burnt Zoilus alive for having tried to lower Homer in their esti. <lb/>
            mation." The Chians, indeed, paid him similar honours, and <lb/>
            spoke of a family among them called the Homeridæ, descend­ <lb/>
            ants of Homer ; appealing also to the end of the Hymn to the <lb/>
            Delian Apollo, which Thucydides4 cited as genuine, but which <lb/>
            every scholar now regards as posterior to Homer's age. The fol­ <lb/>
            lowing is a literal translation of the passage : " Farewell, all ye <lb/>
            virgins; and remember me hereafter, whenever any one of men <lb/>
            upon the earth, any hapless stranger, may come hither and in­ <lb/>
            quire of you, ' Who is, in your opinion, the sweetest of the min­ <lb/>
            strels that dwell here, and with which of them are you most <lb/>
            charmed P' then do you all answer, with the utmost cheerfulness, <lb/>
            ' A blind man, and he dwells in rocky Chios.' " But this only <lb/>
            intimates that Homer lived in Chios, not that he was born there.</p>
          <p>Some have said that he visited Egypt, and one Hephæstion, <lb/>
            as recorded by Photius, says that he found at Memphis, in the <lb/>
            Temple of Vulcan, two poems on the war of Troy, and the ,,-an. <lb/>
            derings of Ulysses, which Phantasia, daughter of Nicarchus, had <lb/>
            written and deposited there, and of which Homer contrived to <lb/>
            get copies from one of the sacred scribes named Phanites, and <lb/>
            composed from them his Iliad and Odyssey. But this Egyptian <lb/>
            story, with Greek names, is doubtless a mere fabrication. Yet <lb/>
            that Homer may have travelled into Egypt is not impossible; <lb/>
            though the notion that he did so has perhaps arisen from the <lb/>
            mention which he makes of Egypt and the Nile in the Odyssey.</p>
          <p>If we can imagine, says Pope,5 that there is any foundation <lb/>
            of truth in what is offered to us as Homer's biography, we may <lb/>
            gather from it " that he shewed a great thirst after knowledge, <lb/>
            Dy undertaking such long and numerous travels; that he mani­ <lb/>
            fested an unexampled vigour of mind, by being able to write <lb/>
            with more fire under the disadvantages of blindness, and the <lb/>
            utmost poverty, than any poet after him in better circumstances ; <lb/>
            and that he had an unlimited sense of fume, the attendant ot <lb/>
            noble spirits, which prompted him to engage in new travels, both <lb/>
            under these disadvantages, and the additional burden of old age." <note type="footnote"> 4 B. ii. c. 104. </note><note type="footnote">5 Essay on Homer, prefixed to the Iliad.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            absolutely necessary for us to believe that the art of writing <lb/>
            was wholly unknown among the Greeks three hundred years <lb/>
            after the Trojan War. Herodotus, in whose time the art of <lb/>
            writing was widely diffused, was born, it is supposed, about 484 <lb/>
            B. c., or about four hundred years after Homer, if we suppose <lb/>
            Homer to have flourished about the time which is given in the <lb/>
            Arundelian marble, or three hundred years after the Trojan <lb/>
            War, about which time Herodotus himself says that Homer flou­ <lb/>
            rished ; and Herodotus had been preceded by Cadmus of Mile­ <lb/>
            tus, who is supposed to have flourished about B.C. 540, and who <lb/>
            is universally called the first Greek writer of history, while Cad­ <lb/>
            mus had perhaps been preceded, some few years, by Pherecydes <lb/>
            of Scyros, who is said to have been the first that wrote Greek <lb/>
            prose, and is generally allowed to have been the teacher of Py­ <lb/>
            thagoras, who was born, according to Bentley and others, B.C. <lb/>
            608. If we suppose Pythagoras to have commenced his studies <lb/>
            under Pherecydes at thirty years of age, he would have begun <lb/>
            B.C. 578. We thus arrive at an earlier date than that at which <lb/>
            Amasis, as Wolf says, first opened Egypt to Greek traders ; (for <lb/>
            Amasis came to the throne B.C. 669;) or within three hundred <lb/>
            years of the time at which Homer is generally supposed to have <lb/>
            lived by those who allow him to have lived at all; within two <lb/>
            hundred, if we adopt the opinion of those who think that he <lb/>
            lived five hundred years after the Trojan War. 14 But we will <lb/>
            adhere to the chronology of Herodotus, and suppose that we <lb/>
            are arrived within three hundred years of Homer's time. Phere­ <lb/>
            cydes and Cadmus of Miletus wrote at this period, and, as they <lb/>
            wrote, must have had some material on which to write. If they <lb/>
            had not papyrus, they might have had skins or parchment, for <lb/>
            Herodotus expressly says that the lonians of Asia Minor used <lb/>
            skins before they had the papyrus, and that after they adopted <lb/>
            the papyrus, they continued to call the rolls or books formed <lb/>
            of it skins, from the material which they had previously used <lb/>
            when papyrus was scarce with them. Why, then, may they <lb/>
            not have used skins for writing, as far back as the time <lb/>
            when we suppose the Iliad and Odyssey to have been corn. <lb/>
            posed, and why may not those poems have been written upon <lb/>
            skins ? Wolf observes that it is uncertain when skins came <note type="footnote"> 14 See Archdeacon Williams's "Homerus," p. 6. </note><note type="footnote">15 B. v c. 68.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            into use; but we are quite as much at liberty to believe that <lb/>
            they were in use three hundred years before the time of Pytha­ <lb/>
            goras as he is to insinuate that they were not.</p>
          <p>At what time Cadmus and his colony brought letters from Phœ­ <lb/>
            nicia into Greece, (for that Phœnicians did bring them is attested <lb/>
            by the voice of all antiquity,) it is impossible exactly to determine; <lb/>
            but it is generally supposed to have been not less than three <lb/>
            hundred years before the Trojan war, about the same time that <lb/>
            Moses is considered to have written the Pentateuch. If such <lb/>
            was the case, there was abundance of time for the knowledge of <lb/>
            letters and writing to spread among the Greeks and their colo­ <lb/>
            nies before Homer wrote. The Asiatic Ionians, too, among <lb/>
            whom we suppose Homer to have lived, preceded the other Greeks, <lb/>
            as appears from Herodotus,16 in acquiring the art of writing.</p>
          <p>From the fact that the laws of Lycurgus were not written, we <lb/>
            are not to infer that the art of writing was unknown in Greece <lb/>
            in his time ; for the reason why they were not written is said to <lb/>
            have been that he wished them to be inscribed only in the hearts <lb/>
            and minds of his countrymen. Writing, too, may have been <lb/>
            little used at Sparta at that time, as indeed it always was, but it <lb/>
            may have been well known in other parts of Greece. Lycurgus <lb/>
            is also said, by Aristotle 17and Plutarch,18 and the account is not <lb/>
            incredible, to have met during his travels in Asia Minor, with <lb/>
            the poems of Homer in the custody of Creophylus, who was <lb/>
            himself an epic poet, and, as he found that there was not only <lb/>
            entertainment, but political and other instruction to be derived <lb/>
            from them, is reported to have collected and transcribed them, <lb/>
            with the intention, says Plutarch, of bringing them into Greece : <lb/>
            for rumours of their excellence were then spreading abroad, and <lb/>
            some few of the learned possessed portions of them. Whether <lb/>
            he actually brought them into Greece, Plutarch does not say, but <lb/>
            observes that he was the first who did much to make them <lb/>
            known in that country. But Aristotle states positively that he <lb/>
            brought them with him to Lacedæmon.</p>
          <p>The tradition, which seems to have generally prevailed, that <lb/>
            Phemius, the nstructor of Homer, Thestorides with whom <note type="footnote"> 16 B. v. c. 68. </note><note type="footnote">17 Apud Heraclid. Polit. frg. ii. ed. Schneidewin. Mure, Hist, of Lang. and Lit. of Greece, B. ii. c. 3, § 2. <lb/>

             <pb n="xviii"/>
            Homer was connected, and Homer himself, were schoolmasters, <lb/>
            is a strong intimation that the art of writing was believed to have <lb/>
            been known in his time; for, without it, what can be supposed <lb/>
            to have been taught in a school P Homer, indeed, is said to have <lb/>
            had a school after he was blind; but it is called a school of <lb/>
            poetry, in which he may have given lectures, and others may <lb/>
            have written from his dictation or under his direction.</p>
          <p>The arguments which Wolf extracts from the Iliad and <lb/>
            Odyssey themselves, against the use of writing at the time that <lb/>
            they were produced, can hardly be considered of any greater <lb/>
            weight than those which he brings from external sources. If <lb/>
            the chiefs that were going to fight with Hector did not write <lb/>
            their names on their lots, it is surely no . proof that they could <lb/>
            not write, or, if they could not, that no Greek of that day could <lb/>
            write. Charlemagne is said to have been unable to write his <lb/>
            own name, but there were plenty of his contemporaries that could <lb/>
            write theirs. Even if the Grecian leaders could write, it may have <lb/>
            been an old custom, in casting lots, to make a private mark on <lb/>
            each lot, and they may but have adhered to the custom. It is <lb/>
            very unsatisfactory to argue that because men, whom we see <lb/>
            only through the mist of antiquity, did not do a certain thing, <lb/>
            they therefore could not do it.</p>
          <p>The passage relating to Bellerophon is of still less effect; for <lb/>
            it is there said that Prœtus had " written many deadly things," <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γράψας θυμοφθόρα πολλὰ</foreign>,) as the words are generally interpreted ; <lb/>
            but the full signification of the phrase, as Mr. Barker, in his <lb/>
            edition of Lempriere, has properly observed, seems to be, that <lb/>
            Proetus had written to Iobates many mind-corrupting things, <lb/>
            many things intended to prejudice the mind of Iobates against <lb/>
            Bellerophon, and induce him to put the youth to death. These <lb/>
            things could hardly have been expressed by a few symbols, and <lb/>
            therefore it can be no great presumption to suppose, with Bishop <lb/>
            Thirlwall,18 that Homer meant that they were expressed in <lb/>
            alphabetic writing.</p>
          <p>To lay any stress upon the passage from the Odyssey, in which <lb/>
            an owner of a ship is said to have had no list of his cargo, would <lb/>
            be utterly ridiculous. In the (Economics of Xenophon, Socrates <note type="footnote"> 18 Hist, of Greece, voL i. c. 6, sub fin.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            speaks of a master of a large Phœnician ship, who knew where <lb/>
            all the numerous articles in it were deposited, and could name <lb/>
            the place of each when he was out of sight of them, yet is not <lb/>
            said to have had any written list; and we might as well argue <lb/>
            from this passage of Xenophon, that writing was unknown to the <lb/>
            Phœnicians in the time of Socrates, as from the passage of the <lb/>
            Odyssey that it was unknown to the Greeks.</p>
          <p>Even Bentley, who expressed an opinion similar to that of <lb/>
            Wolf respecting the want of unity in the Iliad and Odyssey, did <lb/>
            not deny that those poems were written by Homer. " Homer," <lb/>
            he says, " wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by <lb/>
            himself. * * * These loose songs were not collected together <lb/>
            in the form of an epic poem till about Pisistratus' time, about <lb/>
            five hundred years later."19 Whether this notion was conceived <lb/>
            in Bentley's own mind, or suggested to him from some other <lb/>
            source, may be doubtful; for Charles Perrault, in his parallel <lb/>
            between the Ancients and Moderns, published in 1692, had thrown <lb/>
            out conjectures of that nature. The theory was then advocated, <lb/>
            in 1728, by Giambattista Vico, who asserted that the formation <lb/>
            of the Iliad and Odyssey into regular poems was the work of <lb/>
            Pisistratus and his coadjutors. Wood, in his Essay on Homer, <lb/>
            published in 1770, started the question whether the poems of <lb/>
            Homer were originally written or not; and Wolf, excited by the <lb/>
            suggestion, advocated that pretentious theory, at variance with <lb/>
            all antiquity, of which we have already endeavoured to estimate <lb/>
            the value.</p>
          <p>Wolf, we have seen, places much dependance on a passage of <lb/>
            Josephus, which affirms that the poems were not committed to <lb/>
            writing till a later period. But " much reliance," as a writer in <lb/>
            the Quarterly Review 20 has observed, " cannot fairly be placed on <lb/>
            the authority of Josephus, writing in a controversial tract in <lb/>
            which his avowed object is to exalt the antiquity of his own <lb/>
            national records, and to depress those of other countries ; nor <lb/>
            are those who have most deeply studied the writings of Josephus. <lb/>
            the most inclined to think favourably of his general accuracy. <lb/>
            But besides this single passage of Josephus," adds the Be­ <lb/>
            viewer, "which, after all, does not go much farther than the <note type="footnote"> 19 Letter to F. H. [Francis Hare], D.D., by Phileleutherus Lipsiensis. </note><note type="footnote"> 20 VoL xliv. p. 126.</note> <lb/>

            common story about Pisistratus, not even a grammarian [among <lb/>
            the Greeks], although here and there one may appear to have <lb/>
            made some advances towards the hypothesis of Wolf, explicitly <lb/>
            denies that the poems were originally composed as a whole ; the <lb/>
            prevailing, indeed almost the universal opinion, asserted that <lb/>
            the Pisistratid compilation was a reconstruction of poems, the <lb/>
            parts of which time and accident had scattered asunder, not <lb/>
            their first design and formation as consecutive and harmonious <lb/>
            poetical histories."</p>
          <p>That poems of such a nature, exhibiting such a connexion <lb/>
            and dependence of parts, and such a variety of characters, each <lb/>
            appearing qualis ab incepto ; keeping the principal character in <lb/>
            view, as Clarke says, a capite ad concern, from the exordium to <lb/>
            the peroration ; relating such a variety of incidents, of which no <lb/>
            one clashes with another, but all tend to one certain catastrophe, <lb/>
            and so many deaths of combatants of which no two are exactly <lb/>
            similar; displaying, too, such a uniformity of style, adorned with <lb/>
            such a variety of poetical similes, all of great excellence, such as <lb/>
            Virgil and Milton were contented if they could but approach, <lb/>
            were transmitted from the acre of Homer to that of Pisistratus, <lb/>
            in no other vehicle than that of the memory of rhapsodists, is a <lb/>
            hypothesis which we know not how any man ordinarily qualified <lb/>
            to judge of probabilities can bring himself to entertain. We <lb/>
            are aware that there have been many instances of extraordinary <lb/>
            memory, but we cannot convince ourselves that there ever ex­ <lb/>
            isted a succession of men to communicate such poems, in the <lb/>
            state in which we have them, from generation to generation <lb/>
            through a long series of years. We have all heard of the man, <lb/>
            mentioned in Mrs. <unclear>Piozz</unclear>;'s Letters, who could repeat the Jeru­ <lb/>
            salem Delivered from one end to another, forwards or back­ <lb/>
            wards, without mistake; and the Quarterly lieview 2l furnishes <lb/>
            us a similar, or even more remarkable instance, of a man in <lb/>
            Scotland who could repeat the whole Bible from beginning <lb/>
            to end, and give any verse required from any part of it, the <lb/>
            merest sand rope of proper names not excepted. But the ap­ <lb/>
            pearances of such men in the world are " few and far between," <note type="footnote"> 21 Vol. xliv. p. 144.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            and we cannot imagine that a succession of men ever existed of <lb/>
            such powers of memory as to hand down the poems of Homer <lb/>
            century after century, without some writing to which they could <lb/>
            refer for aid. It is easier to suppose, as Bishop Thirlwall says, <lb/>
            that the poems were written at first, than that they were written <lb/>
            at a subsequent period.</p>
          <p>What we conclude from all we have considered, then, is, that <lb/>
            Homer was not a creature of the imagination, but, as all anti­ <lb/>
            quity believed, a real person, who lived about three hundred <lb/>
            years after the Trojan war; that of the particulars of his life <lb/>
            nothing is certainly known, but that it is probable there was a <lb/>
            basis for the traditions that he was poor, blind for a time, and a <lb/>
            wanderer, and that, if he was not born at Smyrna, he at least <lb/>
            visited it, as well as Chios and Colophon; that he composed the <lb/>
            Iliad and Odyssey, perhaps in detached parts, but doubtless <lb/>
            connected them at last into consistent wholes; that the art of <lb/>
            writing was known, if not in Greece, at least in Asia Minor, in <lb/>
            his time, though it may have been confined to very few, and <lb/>
            that those great poems were committed to writing, either by <lb/>
            himself or under his superintendence ; that the rhapsodists sang <lb/>
            them in detached portions, in earlier times as in later, even in <lb/>
            the days of Socrates, long after copies of them had been multi. <lb/>
            plied; that their excellence became gradually known, and that <lb/>
            Lycurgus, whom Cicero' makes even contemporary with Homer, <lb/>
            may have brought them to Sparta, or, if not, may at least have <lb/>
            aided in disseminating a knowledge of them through Greece; <lb/>
            and that Pisistratus, probably assisted by some of the great <lb/>
            geniuses of his day, may have striven, as Cicero tells us,2 to <lb/>
            repair the damage that time had produced in them, and restore <lb/>
            them to the state in which he conceived the illustrious author to <lb/>
            have left them.</p>
          <p>Let it be observed that no great poetical genius, no man fit to <lb/>
            have a seat near the throne of Homer, no Byron, or Goethe, or <lb/>
            Moore, has been in danger of being misled by the theory, as it <lb/>
            is called, of Wolf; a theory started and upheld at first mostly by <lb/>
            men of the standing of Kuster, Burman, and Wasse, who, to <lb/>
            borrow Pope'is illustration, will never see how the parts of a <lb/>
            great poem consist with one another and with the whole, till a <note type="footnote"> 1 Tusc. Quæst, v. a.. </note><note type="footnote">2 Do Orat. iii. 34.</note> <lb/>

            flea shall contemplate the structure of a human body, or, in the <lb/>
            words of the same author, before whose uncreating word light <lb/>
            dies. If Wolfs hypothesis has since been patronized by men of <lb/>
            a somewhat higher character, it has been patronized by them, as <lb/>
            the general sense of mankind is beginning to declare, only to <lb/>
            their discredit. We shall still have our Homer entire, and any <lb/>
            attempts to distribute him into parts, or make him evaporate <lb/>
            into a myth, will, we may fairly prophesy, prove as futile as the <lb/>
            late fanciful project of dividing the plays of Shakspeare between <lb/>
            Raleigh and Bacon.</p>
          <p>Some remarks on the Odyssey in particular will be offered in <lb/>
            the next volume.</p>
          <p>Against the version of Pope, which is here once more re­ <lb/>
            printed, much criticism, and animadversions of various sorts, <lb/>
            have at times. been directed. But all the objections that have <lb/>
            been made to it are little more than a repetition of Bentley's <lb/>
            remark that "it is not Homer."</p>
          <p>That it is not a literal translation of Homer, rendering every <lb/>
            phrase in words exactly correspondent, is well known; but it is <lb/>
            what the English world has been well content to accept instead <lb/>
            of a literal translation.</p>
          <p>Pope, as is now well understood, was not a great Greek scholar, <lb/>
            notwithstanding Lord Bathurst's statement to Dr. Blair, that, <lb/>
            when he was executing part of the Iliad at that nobleman's <lb/>
            house, he would repeal at breakfast the Greek lines which he <lb/>
            had previously been translating, accompanied with his own ver­ <lb/>
            sion. Much stress has been laid upon this anecdote by those <lb/>
            who wish to make the most of Pope's knowledge of Greek ; but <lb/>
            it will not prove it to have been very deep; for a man may <lb/>
            repeat a few Greek lines with but a very imperfect conception of <lb/>
            their meaning.</p>
          <p>But if Pope had not the Greek of a Bentley or a Person, he had <lb/>
            that which was of far more importance to a translator of Homer <lb/>
            than a greater knowledge of Greek would have been. He had <lb/>
            great acuteness and penetration, and was able to see far better <lb/>
            into Homer's meaning than many who had far more knowledge <lb/>
            of Homer's language; and when he had made himself master of <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiii"/>
            Homer's matter, he could express it in his own language with a <lb/>
            fire and energy that a mere scholar would attempt in vain: <lb/>
            Sudet multum frustraque laboret, <lb/>
            Ausus idem.</p>
          <p>He doubtless did not always compass the sense with equal suc­ <lb/>
            cess ; he sometimes perverts and sometimes exaggerates ; but <unclear/> <lb/>
            his misrepresentations are chiefly in minor matters; Homer's <lb/>
            great thoughts and noble passages are in general rendered with <lb/>
            all the fidelity and exactness that a great poet would desire.</p>
          <p>In how much esteem Pope's version, with all its faults, is <lb/>
            held by the English public, is shown by the fortune of all sub­ <lb/>
            sequent attempts that have been made to represent Homer in <lb/>
            English with greater accuracy. Of these, the chief are Cowper's <lb/>
            and Sotheby's. Cowper, though he had no superabundance <lb/>
            of Greek, had enough to render Homer faithfully; but he is <lb/>
            guilty, alas ! of that from which every translator of the mighty <lb/>
            Grecian should be free ; his blank verse is tame and unenergetic ; <lb/>
            he has occasional warmth, but no ardour; he has not even che. <lb/>
            rished the fire with which his master supplied him. Sotheby <lb/>
            has succeeded better, though he ventured on the hazardous ex­ <lb/>
            periment of encountering Pope in the heroic couplet; but he <lb/>
            has only encountered, he has not rivalled; his verses are smooth, <lb/>
            and show a scholar's fidelity to the sense, but want <lb/>
            " The high majestic march and energy divine."</p>
          <p>His version is to Pope's what Pitt's Virgil is to Dryden's ; more <lb/>
            true to the original, but less pleasing to the reader.</p>
          <p>After the fate of these efforts, it is futile to decry Pope's <lb/>
            translation as mere " splendid varnish." The public allow that <lb/>
            there is varnish, but have found out that there is excellent <lb/>
            stuff, whether Homer's or Pope's, below the varnish. They <lb/>
            still regard Pope as the English Homer; and all rival perform­ <lb/>
            ances, except Sotheby's and Cowper's, have found favour <lb/>
            neither with the learned nor the unlearned, neither with those <lb/>
            who pretend to judge quid distent œra lupinis, nor with those <lb/>
            who " give up the reins of their imagination into their author's <lb/>

          <p>HOMER is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention <lb/>
            of any writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly <lb/>
            contested with him, and others may have their pretensions as to <lb/>
            particular excellencies; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. <lb/>
            Nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest <lb/>
            of poets, who most excelled in that which is the very foundation <lb/>
            of poetry. It is the invention that in different degrees distin­ <lb/>
            guishes all great geniuses: the utmost stretch of human study, <lb/>
            learning, and industry, which masters everything besides, can <lb/>
            never attain to this. It furnishes Art with all her materials, and <lb/>
            without it, Judgment itself can at best but steal wisely : for Art <lb/>
            is only like a prudent steward, that lives on managing the riches <lb/>
            of Nature. Whatever praises may be given to works of judgment, <lb/>
            there is not even a single beauty in them but is owing to the in­ <lb/>
            vention : as in the most regular gardens, however Art may carry <lb/>
            the greatest appearance, there is not a plant or flower but is the <lb/>
            gift of Nature. The first can only reduce the beauties of the <lb/>
            latter into a more obvious figure, which the common eye may <lb/>
            better take in, and is therefore more entertained with them. And <lb/>
            perhaps the reason why most critics are inclined to prefer a ju­ <lb/>
            dicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one, is, because <lb/>
            they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations <lb/>
            through an uniform and bounded walk of art, than to comprehend <lb/>
            the vast and various extent of nature.</p>
          <p>Our author's work is a wild paradise, where if we cannot see <lb/>
            all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only <lb/>
            because the number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a <lb/>
            copious nursery, which contains the seeds and first productions <lb/>
            of every kind, out of which those who followed him have but <lb/>
            selected, some particular plants, each according to his fancy, to <lb/>
            cultivate and beautify. If some things are too luxuriant, it is <lb/>
            owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are not arrived <lb/>
            to perfection or maturity, it is only because they are over-run <lb/>
            and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.</p>
          <p>It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attri­ <lb/>
            bute that unequalled fire and rapture, which is so forcible in <note type="footnote"> c</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            Homer, that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself <lb/>
            while he reads him. What he writes is of the most animated <lb/>
            nature imaginable; everything moves, everything lives, and is <lb/>
            put in action. If a council be called, or a battle fought, you are <lb/>
            not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third <lb/>
            person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the <lb/>
            poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another <lb/>
            to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles that of the <lb/>
            army he describes,</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_80_fig1.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it. <lb/>
            It is, however, remarkable that his faney, which is every where <lb/>
            vigorous, is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his <lb/>
            poem in its fullest splendour; it grows in the progress both upon <lb/>
            himself and others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by <lb/>
            its own rapidity. Exact disposition, just thought, correct elocu­ <lb/>
            tion, polished numbers, may have been found in a thousand; but <lb/>
            this poetical fire, this vivida vis animi, in a very few. Even in <lb/>
            works where all those are imperfect or neglected, this can over­ <lb/>
            power criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove. <lb/>
            Nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it <lb/>
            brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own <lb/>
            splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned as <lb/>
            through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, <lb/>
            but every where equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius, it <lb/>
            bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: in Milton, <lb/>
            it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the <lb/>
            force of art: in Shakspeare, it strikes before we are aware, like <lb/>
            an accidental fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, <lb/>
            it burns every where clearly, and every where irresistibly.</p>
          <p>I shall here endeavour to shew, how this vast invention exerts <lb/>
            itself in a manner superior to that of any poet, through all the <lb/>
            main constituent parts of his work, as it is the great and peculiar <lb/>
            characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors.</p>
          <p>This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, <lb/>
            in the violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It <lb/>
            seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and <lb/>
            the whole compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections ; <lb/>
            all the inward passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his <lb/>
            characters ; and all the outward forms and images of things for <lb/>
            his descriptions ; but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate <lb/>
            in, he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination, and <lb/>
            created a world for himself in the invention ofable. That which <lb/>
            Aristotle calls the soul of poetry, was first breathed into it by <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvii"/>
            Homer. I shall begin with considering him in this part, as it is <lb/>
            naturally the first; and I speak of it both as it means the design <lb/>
            of a poem, and as it is taken for fiction.</p>
          <p>Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and <lb/>
            the marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions <lb/>
            as, though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course <lb/>
            of nature; or of such as, though they did, become fables by the <lb/>
            additional episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is <lb/>
            the main story of an Epic poem, the return of Ulysses, the settle­ <lb/>
            ment of the Trojans in Italy, or the like. That of the Iliad, is <lb/>
            the anger of Achilles, the most short and single subject that ever <lb/>
            was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with a vaster <lb/>
            variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater <lb/>
            number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, <lb/>
            than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of <lb/>
            the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is hurried on <lb/>
            with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration employs <lb/>
            not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a genius, <lb/>
            aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a <lb/>
            greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer's <lb/>
            poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. <lb/>
            The other Epic poets have used the same practice, but generally <lb/>
            carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy <lb/>
            the unity of action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable <lb/>
            length of time. Nor is it only in the main design that they have <lb/>
            been unable to add to his invention, but they have followed him in <lb/>
            every episode and part of story. If he has given a regular cata. <lb/>
            logue of an army, they all draw up their forces in the same order. <lb/>
            If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil has the same for <lb/>
            Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them) destroys the unity <lb/>
            of his action for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit the <lb/>
            shades, the Æneas of Virgil, and Scipio of Silius, are sent after <lb/>
            him. If be be detained from his return by the allurements of <lb/>
            Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If <lb/>
            Achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through <lb/>
            half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself just as long, on the <lb/>
            like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, <lb/>
            Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has not <lb/>
            only observed this close imitation of Homer, but, where he had <lb/>
            not led the way, supplied the want from other Greek authors. <lb/>
            Thus the story of Smon and the taking of Troy was copied (says <lb/>
            Macrobius) almost word for word from Pisander, as the loves of <lb/>
            Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea and Jason in <lb/>
            Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.</p>
          <p>To proceed to the allegorical fable. If we reflect upon those <lb/>
            innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical <lb/>
             <pb n="xxviii"/>
            philosophy, which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped <lb/>
            up in his allegories, what a new and ample scene of wonder may <lb/>
            this consideration afford us P How fertile will that imagination <lb/>
            appear, which was able to clothe all the properties of elements, <lb/>
            the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms and <lb/>
            persons; and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the <lb/>
            nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in which no <lb/>
            succeeding poets could dispute with Homer ; and whatever com­ <lb/>
            mendations nave been allowed them on this head, are by no means <lb/>
            for their invention in having enlarged the circle, but for their <lb/>
            judgment in having contracted it. For when the mode of learning <lb/>
            changed in following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer <lb/>
            manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets <lb/>
            to lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And per­ <lb/>
            haps it was no unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was <lb/>
            not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention, <lb/>
            as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a <lb/>
            poem.</p>
          <p>The marvellousfable includes whatever is supernatural, and <lb/>
            especially the machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first <lb/>
            who introduced the deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the <lb/>
            religion of Greece, he seems the first who brought them into a <lb/>
            system of machinery for poetry, and such a one as makes its <lb/>
            greatest importance and dignity. For we find those authors who <lb/>
            have been offended at the literal notion of the gods, constantly <lb/>
            laying their accusation against Homer as the undoubted inventor <lb/>
            of it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines <lb/>
            in a philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the <lb/>
            poetic, that mankind have been ever since contented to follow <lb/>
            them: none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond <lb/>
            the limits he has set: every attempt of this nature has proved <lb/>
            unsuccessful; and after all the various changes of times and re­ <lb/>
            ligions, his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry.</p>
          <p>We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we <lb/>
            shall find no author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and <lb/>
            surprising a variety, or given us such lively and affecting im­ <lb/>
            pressions of them. Every one has something so singularly his <lb/>
            own, that no painter could have distinguished them more by their <lb/>
            features, than the poet has by their manners. Nothing can be <lb/>
            more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different <lb/>
            legrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of courage is <lb/>
            wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the Iliad. <lb/>
            rhat of Achilles is furious and untractable; that of Diomed <lb/>
            forward, yet listening to advice and subject to command ; that <lb/>
            of Ajax is heavy, and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigi­ <lb/>
            lant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire <lb/>
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tender­ <lb/>
            ness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier, <lb/>
            in Sarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious <lb/>
            and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality <lb/>
            which constitutes the main of each character, but even in the <lb/>
            under-parts of it, to which he takes care to give a tincture of that <lb/>
            principal one. For example, the main characters of Ulysses and <lb/>
            Nestor consist in wisdom ; and they are distinct in this, that the <lb/>
            wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural, open, <lb/>
            and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage ; and <lb/>
            this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference <lb/>
            of his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, <lb/>
            the other upon experience. It would be endless to produce in­ <lb/>
            stances of these kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from <lb/>
            striking us in this open manner; they lie in a great degree hidden <lb/>
            and undistinguished, and where they are marked most evidently, <lb/>
            affect us not in proportion to those of Homer. His characters of <lb/>
            valour are much aliKe ; even that of Turnus seems no way pecu­ <lb/>
            liar, but as it is in a superior degree; and we see nothing that <lb/>
            differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, <lb/>
            Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of <lb/>
            Statius's heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; <lb/>
            the same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, <lb/>
            Tydeus, Hippomedon, &amp;c. They have a parity of character, <lb/>
            which makes them seem brothers of one family. I believe when <lb/>
            the reader is led into this track of reflection, if he will pursue it <lb/>
            through the Epic and Tragic writers, he will be convinced how <lb/>
            infinitely superior in this point the invention of Homer was to <lb/>
            that of all others.</p>
          <p>The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the <lb/>
            characters, being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree <lb/>
            with the manners of those who utter them. As there is more <lb/>
            variety of characters in the Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in <lb/>
            any other poem. Every thing in it has manners (as Aristotle <lb/>
            expresses it); that is, every thing is acted or spoken. It is <lb/>
            hardly credible in a work of such length, how small a number of <lb/>
            lines are employed in narration. In Virgil, the dramatic part is <lb/>
            less in proportion to the narrative; and the speeches often con­ <lb/>
            sist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally <lb/>
            just in any person's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of <lb/>
            his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches <lb/>
            escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We <lb/>
            oftener think of the author himself when we read Virgil than <lb/>
            when we are engaged in Homer: all which are the effects of a <lb/>
            colder invention, that interests us less in the action described: <lb/>
            Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.</p><pb n="xxx"/>
            
          <p>If in the next place we take a view of the sentiments, the same <lb/>
            presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his <lb/>
            thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part <lb/>
            Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove <lb/>
            the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that <lb/>
            that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture: <lb/>
            Duport, in his Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable <lb/>
            instances of this sort. And it is with justice an excellent modern <lb/>
            writer allows, that if Virgil has not so many thoughts that are <lb/>
            low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble; <lb/>
            and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing <lb/>
            sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.</p>
          <p>If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall <lb/>
            find the invention still predominant. To what else can we as­ <lb/>
            cribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort, where we <lb/>
            see each circumstance of art and individual of nature summoned <lb/>
            together, by the extent and fecundity of his imagination; to <lb/>
            which all things, in their various views, presented themselves in <lb/>
            an instant, and had their impressions taken off to perfection, at a <lb/>
            heat P Nay, he not only gives us the full prospects of things, but <lb/>
            several unexpected peculiarities and side-views, unobserved by <lb/>
            any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as the de­ <lb/>
            scriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the Iliad, <lb/>
            and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no one <lb/>
            bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that <lb/>
            no two heroes are wounded in the same manner; and such a <lb/>
            profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in <lb/>
            greatness, horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near <lb/>
            the number of images and descriptions in any Epic poet; though <lb/>
            every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him : <lb/>
            and it is evident of Virgil especially, that he has scarce any com­ <lb/>
            parisons which are not drawn from his master.</p>
          <p>If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright <lb/>
            imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms <lb/>
            of it. We acknowledge him the father of poetical diction, the <lb/>
            first who taught that language of the gods to men. His expres­ <lb/>
            sion is like the colouring of some great masters, which discovers <lb/>
            itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is <lb/>
            indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched <lb/>
            with the greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say, he was the <lb/>
            only poet who had found out living words ; there are in him more <lb/>
            daring figures and metaphors than in any good author what <lb/>
            ever. An arrow is impatient to be on the wing, a weapon thirst. <lb/>
            to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like. Yet his expression <lb/>
            is never too big for the sense, but justly great in proportion to it. <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction, which <lb/>
            rises with it, and forms itself about it; and in the same degree <lb/>
            that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter ; as that. <lb/>
            is more strong, this will become more perspicuous : like glass in <lb/>
            the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a <lb/>
            greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and <lb/>
            the heat more intense.</p>
          <p>To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to <lb/>
            have affected the compound epithets. This was a sort of com­ <lb/>
            position peculiarly proper to poetry, not only as it heightened the <lb/>
            diction, but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater <lb/>
            sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in some measure to <lb/>
            thicken the images. On this last consideration I cannot but <lb/>
            attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention; since (as <lb/>
            he has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures <lb/>
            of the persons or things to which they are joined. We see the <lb/>
            motion of Hector's plumes in the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κορυϑαίολος</foreign>, the land­ <lb/>
            scape of mount Neritus in that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰνοσίφυλλος</foreign>, and so of others; <lb/>
            which particular images could not have been insisted upon so <lb/>
            long as to express them in a description (though but of a single <lb/>
            line), without diverting the reader too much from the principal <lb/>
            action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these <lb/>
            epithets is a short description.</p>
          <p>Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible <lb/>
            what a share of praise is due to his invention in that. He was <lb/>
            not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one <lb/>
            part of Greece, but searched through its differing dialects with <lb/>
            this particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers : he <lb/>
            considered these as they bad a greater mixture of vowels or con­ <lb/>
            sonants, and accordingly employed them as the verse required <lb/>
            either a greater smoothness or strength. What he most affected <lb/>
            was the Ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness from its never <lb/>
            using contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diph­ <lb/>
            thongs into two syllables ; so as to make the words open them­ <lb/>
            selves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency. With this he <lb/>
            mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler <lb/>
            Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent; and <lb/>
            completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of <lb/>
            poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his sense, <lb/>
            were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his <lb/>
            rapture, and even to give a farther representation of his notions, <lb/>
            in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. <lb/>
            Out of all these he has derived that harmony, which makes us <lb/>
            confess he had not only the richest head, but the finest ear, in <lb/>
            the world. This is so great a truth, that whoever will but con­ <lb/>
            sult the tune of his verses, even without understanding them <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxii"/>
            (with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the <lb/>
            case of Italian operas), will find more sweetness, variety, and <lb/>
            majesty of sound than in any other language or poetry. The <lb/>
            beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but <lb/>
            faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just to ascribe it to <lb/>
            the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed, the Greek has some ad­ <lb/>
            vantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn <lb/>
            and cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no <lb/>
            other language. Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the <lb/>
            utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to <lb/>
            whatsoever graces it was capable of; and in particular never <lb/>
            failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement <lb/>
            with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been so frequently <lb/>
            celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is, that <lb/>
            fewer critics have understood one language than the other. Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's <lb/>
            beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of Words, <lb/>
            and others will be taken notice of in the course of my notes. It <lb/>
            suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow with <lb/>
            so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care <lb/>
            than to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated; and at the same <lb/>
            time with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken <lb/>
            and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a <lb/>
            plentiful river, always in motion, and always full; while we are <lb/>
            borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most <lb/>
            smooth imaginable.</p>
          <p>Thus, on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what princi­ <lb/>
            pally strikes us is his invention. It is that which forms the cha­ <lb/>
            racter of each part of his work ; and accordingly we find it to <lb/>
            have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other ; <lb/>
            his manners more lively and strongly marked, his speeches more <lb/>
            affecting and transported, his sentiments more warm and sublime, <lb/>
            his images and descriptions more full and animated, his expres­ <lb/>
            sion more raised and daring, and his numbers more rapid and <lb/>
            various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil with regard to <lb/>
            any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his character. <lb/>
            Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of <lb/>
            comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular pas­ <lb/>
            sages in them, and forming a judgment from thence of their <lb/>
            merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge of <lb/>
            the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it <lb/>
            is in that we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree <lb/>
            in that we are to admire him. No author or man ever excelled <lb/>
            all the world in more than one faculty, and as Homer has done <lb/>
            this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that we are to <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiii"/>
            think Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a more emi. <lb/>
            nent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer <lb/>
            possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had <lb/>
            more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to <lb/>
            have less in comparison with one another. Homer was the <lb/>
            greater genius, Virgil the better artist. In one we most admire <lb/>
            the man, in the other the work. Homer hurries and transports <lb/>
            us with a commanding impetuosity, Virgil leads us with an attrac­ <lb/>
            tive majesty: Homer scatters with a generous profusion, Virgil <lb/>
            bestows with a careful magnificence: Homer, like the Nile, pours <lb/>
            out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a river in <lb/>
            its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold <lb/>
            their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they <lb/>
            celebrate: Homer, boundless and irresistible as Achilles, bears <lb/>
            all before him, and shines more and more as the tumult in­ <lb/>
            creases ; Virgil, calmly daring like AEneas, appears undisturbed <lb/>
            in the midst of the action, disposes all about him, and conquers <lb/>
            with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines, <lb/>
            Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus, <lb/>
            scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens ; Virgil, like the <lb/>
            same power in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying <lb/>
            plans for empires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.</p>
          <p>But, after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues ; they <lb/>
            naturally border on some imperfection ; and it is often hard to <lb/>
            distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. <lb/>
            As prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great <lb/>
            judgment decline to coldness ; and as magnanimity may run up <lb/>
            to profusion or extravagance, so may a great invention to redun­ <lb/>
            dancy or wildness. If we look upon Homer in this view, we <lb/>
            shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so <lb/>
            noble a cause as the excess of this faculty.</p>
          <p>Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, <lb/>
            upon which so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all <lb/>
            the bounds of probability. Perhaps it may be with great and <lb/>
            superior souls as with gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves <lb/>
            with unusual strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due <lb/>
            proportion of parts, to become miracles in the whole; and, like <lb/>
            the old heroes of that make, commit something near extravagance, <lb/>
            amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances. Thus <lb/>
            Homer has his speaking horses, and Virgil his myrtles distilling <lb/>
            blood ; where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy <lb/>
            intervention of a deity to save the probability.</p>
          <p>It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have <lb/>
            been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The <lb/>
            force of faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiv"/>
            to confine itself to tnat single circumstance upon which the corn <lb/>
            parison is grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional <lb/>
            images, which, however, are so managed as not to overpower the <lb/>
            main one. His similes are like pictures, where the principal figure <lb/>
            has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original, but is <lb/>
            also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects. The same <lb/>
            will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons <lb/>
            together in one breath, when his fancy suggested to him at once <lb/>
            so many various and correspondent images. The reader will easily <lb/>
            extend this observation to more objections of the same kind.</p>
          <p>If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a <lb/>
            defect or narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming <lb/>
            defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from <lb/>
            the nature of the times he lived in. Such are his grosser repre­ <lb/>
            sentations of the gods, and the vicious and imperfect manners of <lb/>
            his heroes; but I must here speak a word of the latter, as it is a <lb/>
            point generally carried into extremes, both by the censurers and <lb/>
            defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality to antiquity, <lb/>
            to think with Madame Dacier, * " that those times and manners <lb/>
            are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to <lb/>
            ours," Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify <lb/>
            the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, <lb/>
            joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned through <lb/>
            the world ; when no mercy was shewn but for the sake of <lb/>
            lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their <lb/>
            wives and daughters made slaves and concubines P On the other <lb/>
            side, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are <lb/>
            shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we <lb/>
            sometimes see the heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure <lb/>
            in taking a view of that simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of <lb/>
            succeeding ages; in beholding monarchs without their guards, <lb/>
            princes tending their flocks, and princesses drawing water from <lb/>
            the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect that we <lb/>
            are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and <lb/>
            those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in <lb/>
            the perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted <lb/>
            with nations and people that are now no more; that they are <lb/>
            stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest an. <lb/>
            tiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising <lb/>
            vision of things nowhere else to be found, the only true mirror <lb/>
            of that ancient world. By this means alone their greatest ob­ <lb/>
            stacles will vanish; and what usually creates their dislike, will <lb/>
            become a satisfaction.</p>
          <p>This consideration may farther serve to answer for the constant <note type="footnote"> * Preface to her Homer.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxv"/>
            ase of the same epitheta to his gods and heroes, such as the far­ <lb/>
            darting Phœbus, the blue-eyed Pallas, the swift-footedAcilles, &amp;c., <lb/>
            which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated. <lb/>
            Those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then <lb/>
            believed to belong to them, and had contracted a weight and ve­ <lb/>
            neration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were <lb/>
            used: they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter <lb/>
            of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an <lb/>
            irreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. <lb/>
            Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, <lb/>
            and repeated as such; for the Greeks, having no names derived <lb/>
            from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction of <lb/>
            each person ; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of <lb/>
            birth, profession, or the like : as Alexander, the son of Philip, He­ <lb/>
            rodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &amp;c. Homer there­ <lb/>
            fore, complying with the custom of his country, used such dis­ <lb/>
            tinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And indeed we <lb/>
            have something parallel to these in modern times, such as the <lb/>
            names of Harold Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Long­ <lb/>
            shanks, Edward the Black Prince, &amp;c. If yet this be thought to <lb/>
            account better for the propriety than for the repetition, I shall add <lb/>
            a farther conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the world into its different <lb/>
            ages, has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one, <lb/>
            of heroes distinct from other men, a divine race, who fought at <lb/>
            Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of <lb/>
            Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.* Now among the divine <lb/>
            honours which were paid them, they might have this also in <lb/>
            common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solem­ <lb/>
            nity of an epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by its <lb/>
            celebrating their families, actions, or qualities.</p>
          <p>What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such <lb/>
            as hardly deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they <lb/>
            occur in the course of the work. Many have been occasioned <lb/>
            by an injudicious endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the <lb/>
            same, as if one should think to raise the superstructure by un­ <lb/>
            dermining the foundation: one would imagine by the wholo <lb/>
            course of their parallels, tnat these critics never so much as heard <lb/>
            of Homer's having written first; a consideration which whoever <lb/>
            compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye. Some <lb/>
            accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise him <lb/>
            in the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral of the <lb/>
            Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which might <lb/>
            set the Odyssey above the Æneis ; as that the hero is a wiser <note type="footnote"> * Hesiod. lib. i. ver. 155, &amp;c.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvi"/>
            man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his country <lb/>
            than that of the other: or else they blame him for not doing what <lb/>
            he never designed ; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect <lb/>
            a prince as AEneas, when the very moral of his poem required a <lb/>
            contrary character; it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison <lb/>
            of Homer and Virgil. Others select those particular passages of <lb/>
            Homer, which are not so laboured as some that Virgil drew out <lb/>
            of them : this is the whole management of Scaliger in his Poetics. <lb/>
            Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions, <lb/>
            sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener from <lb/>
            an ignorance of the graces of the original; and then triumph in <lb/>
            the awkwardness of their own translations : this is the conduct of <lb/>
            Perault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretend­ <lb/>
            ing to a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit <lb/>
            of Homer, and that of his work ; but when they come to assign <lb/>
            the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon <lb/>
            the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of those that <lb/>
            followed: and in pursuance of this principle, they make those <lb/>
            accidents (such as the contention of the cities, &amp;c.) to be the <lb/>
            causes of his fame, which were in reality the consequences of his <lb/>
            merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or any great <lb/>
            author, whose general character will infallibly raise many casual <lb/>
            additions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de <lb/>
            la Motte ; who yet confesses upon the whole, that in whatever <lb/>
            age Homer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his <lb/>
            nation, and that he may be said in this sense to be the master <lb/>
            even of those who surpassed him.</p>
          <p>In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title <lb/>
            to the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which <lb/>
            is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled <lb/>
            by his followers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler <lb/>
            judgment may commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the <lb/>
            eyes of one sort of critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry <lb/>
            the loudest and most universal applauses, which holds the heart <lb/>
            of a reader under the strongest enchantment. Homer not only <lb/>
            appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of <lb/>
            other arts in this, that he has swallowed up the honour of those <lb/>
            who succeeded him. What he has done admitted no increase, it <lb/>
            only left room for contraction or regulation. He showed all the <lb/>
            stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in some of his <lb/>
            flights, it was but because he attempted every thing. A work of <lb/>
            this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from the most <lb/>
            vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces <lb/>
            the finest fruit; nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and <lb/>
            profit join to make it valuable; and they who find the justest <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxvii"/>
            faults, have only said, that a few branches (which run luxuriant <lb/>
            through a richness of nature) might be lopped into form to give <lb/>
            it a more regular appearance.</p>
          <p>Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, <lb/>
            it remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the <lb/>
            chief characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of <lb/>
            the poem, such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no trans­ <lb/>
            lator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As <lb/>
            it also breaks out in every particular image, description, and <lb/>
            simile; whoever lessens or too much softens those, takes off from <lb/>
            this chief character. It is the first grand duty of an interpreter <lb/>
            to give his author entire and unmanned; and for the rest, the <lb/>
            diction and versification only are his proper province ; since these <lb/>
            must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.</p>
          <p>It should then be considered what methods may afford some <lb/>
            equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the Greek. <lb/>
            It is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent <lb/>
            original in a superior language: but it is a great mistake to <lb/>
            imagine (as many have done) that a rash paraphrase can make <lb/>
            amends for this general defect: which is no less in danger to lose <lb/>
            the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern manners <lb/>
            of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there is often <lb/>
            a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version <lb/>
            almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but those <lb/>
            which are necessary for transfusing the spirit of the original, and <lb/>
            supporting the poetical style of the translation : and I will venture <lb/>
            to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by <lb/>
            a servile dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in <lb/>
            ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their <lb/>
            author. It is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what <lb/>
            a translator should principally regard, as it is most likely to <lb/>
            expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way to be con­ <lb/>
            tent with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any parti­ <lb/>
            cular place. It is a great secret in writing to know when to be <lb/>
            plain, and when poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer <lb/>
            will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps. <lb/>
            Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we <lb/>
            can ; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be de­ <lb/>
            terred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of <lb/>
            a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to <lb/>
            have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his <lb/>
            style: some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a <lb/>
            proud confidence of the sublime; others sunk into flatness in a <lb/>
            cold and timorous notion of simplicity. Methinks I see these <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxviii"/>
            different followers of Homer, some sweating and straining after <lb/>
            him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain signs of false mettle); <lb/>
            others slowly and servilely creeping in his tram, while the poet <lb/>
            himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal <lb/>
            majesty before them. However, of the two extremes one could <lb/>
            sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity : no author is to be envied <lb/>
            for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style, <lb/>
            which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and the <lb/>
            rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and dig­ <lb/>
            nified simplicity, as well as a bald and sordid one, which differ <lb/>
            as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of <lb/>
            a sloven : it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be <lb/>
            dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and <lb/>
            rusticity.</p>
          <p>This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection <lb/>
            as in the Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all <lb/>
            respect to the inspired writings, that the divine Spirit made use <lb/>
            of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men <lb/>
            at that time, and in that part of the world; and as Homer is the <lb/>
            author nearest to those, his style must of course bear a greater <lb/>
            resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer. <lb/>
            This consideration (together with what has been observed of the <lb/>
            parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks, induce a translator <lb/>
            on the one hand to give into several of those general phrases and <lb/>
            manners of expression, which have attained a veneration even in <lb/>
            our language from being used in the Old Testament; as, on the <lb/>
            other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the Divinity, <lb/>
            and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.</p>
          <p>For a farther preservation of this air of simplicity, a parti­ <lb/>
            cular care should be taken to express with all plainness those <lb/>
            moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous <lb/>
            in this poet. They have something venerable, and, as 1 may say, <lb/>
            oracular, in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which <lb/>
            they are delivered: a grace which would be utterly lost by en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious (that is, <lb/>
            a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the mixture of some Græcisms and old words after the <lb/>
            manner of Milton, if done without too much affectation, might <lb/>
            not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work, which <lb/>
            most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast. <lb/>
            But certainly the use of modern terms of war and government, <lb/>
            such as platoon, campaign junto, or the like (into which some of <lb/>
            his translators have fallen), cannot be allowable ; those only ex­ <lb/>
            cepted, without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any <lb/>
            living language.</p><pb n="xxxix"/>
            
          <p>There are two peculiarities in Homer's diction which arc a sort <lb/>
            of marks, or moles, by which every common eye distinguishes him <lb/>
            at first sight: those who are not his greatest admirers look upon <lb/>
            them as defects, and those who are, seem pleased with them as <lb/>
            beauties. I speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. <lb/>
            Many of the former cannot be done literally into English without <lb/>
            destroying the purity of our language. I believe such should be <lb/>
            retained as slide easily of themselves into an English compound, <lb/>
            without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composi­ <lb/>
            tion : as well as those which have received a sanction from the <lb/>
            authority of our best poets, and are become familiar through <lb/>
            their use of them ; such as the cloud-compelling Jove, &amp;c, As <lb/>
            for the rest, whenever they can be as fully and significantly ex­ <lb/>
            pressed in a single word as in a compound one, the course to be <lb/>
            taken is obvious.</p>
          <p>Some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image <lb/>
            by one or two words, may have justice done them by circumlo­ <lb/>
            cution ; as the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰνοίφυλλος</foreign>, to a mountain, would appear <lb/>
            little or ridiculous translated literally leaf-shaking, but affords a <lb/>
            majestic idea in the periphrasis: The lofty mountain shakes his <lb/>
            waving woods. Others that admit of differing significations, may <lb/>
            receive an advantage by a judicious variation according to the <lb/>
            occasions on which they are introduced. For example, the epithet <lb/>
            of Apollo, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲκηβόλος</foreign>, or far-shooting, is capable of two explica­ <lb/>
            tions ; one literal in respect of the darts and bow, the ensigns of <lb/>
            that god; the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the <lb/>
            sun: therefore in such places where Apollo is represented as a <lb/>
            god in person, I would use the former interpretation, and where <lb/>
            the effects of the sun are described, I would make choice of the <lb/>
            latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to avoid that per­ <lb/>
            petual repetition of the same epithets which we find in Homer, <lb/>
            and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already <lb/>
            shewn) to the ear of- those times, is by no means so to ours: but <lb/>
            one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they de­ <lb/>
            rive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are <lb/>
            employed ; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once <lb/>
            shew his fancy and his judgment.</p>
          <p>As for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three <lb/>
            sorts ; of whole narrations and speeches; of single sentences, and <lb/>
            of one verse or hemistich. I hope it is not impossible to have such <lb/>
            a regard to these, as neither to lose so known a mark of the <lb/>
            author on the one hand, nor to offend the reader too much on the <lb/>
            other. The repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where <lb/>
            the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter <lb/>
            his words; as in the messages from gods to men, or from higher <lb/>
            powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial <lb/>
             <pb n="xl"/>
            of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, <lb/>
            oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the best rule is to <lb/>
            be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions <lb/>
            are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one may <lb/>
            vary the expression, but it is a question whether a professed <lb/>
            translator be authorised to omit any; if they be tedious, the <lb/>
            author is to answer for it.</p>
          <p>It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has <lb/>
            been said) is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and <lb/>
            varying it on every new subject. This is indeed one of the most <lb/>
            exquisite beauties of poetry, and attainable by very few: I know <lb/>
            only of Homer eminent for it in the Greek, and Virgil in Latin. <lb/>
            I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance, when <lb/>
            a writer is warm, and fully possessed of his image : however, it <lb/>
            may reasonably be believed they designed this, in whose verse it <lb/>
            so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others. Few <lb/>
            readers have the ear to be judges of it, but those who have, will <lb/>
            see I have endeavoured at this beauty.</p>
          <p>Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of <lb/>
            doing justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but <lb/>
            that which one may entertain without much vanity, of giving a <lb/>
            more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse <lb/>
            has yet done. We have only those of Chapman, Hobbes, and <lb/>
            Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable <lb/>
            length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any para­ <lb/>
            phrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent in. <lb/>
            terpolations of four or six lines, and I remember one in the thir. <lb/>
            teenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty <lb/>
            verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, <lb/>
            that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in <lb/>
            other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He <lb/>
            appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new mean­ <lb/>
            ings out of his author, insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming <lb/>
            preface, a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in Homer; and <lb/>
            perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end. <lb/>
            His expression is involved in fustian; a fault for which he was <lb/>
            remarkable in his original writings, as in the tragedy of Bussy <lb/>
            d'Amboise, &amp;c. In a word, the nature of the man may account <lb/>
            for his whole performance; for he appears from his preface and <lb/>
            remarks to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in <lb/>
            poetry. His own boast of having finished half the Iliad in less <lb/>
            than fifteen weeks, shews with what negligence his version was <lb/>
            performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and which very <lb/>
            much contributed to cover his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that <lb/>
            animates his translation, which is something like what one might <lb/>
             <pb n="xli"/>
            imagine Homer himself would have writ before he arrived to <lb/>
            years of discretion.</p>
          <p>Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in <lb/>
            general; but for particulars and circumstances, he continually lops <lb/>
            them, and often omits the most beautiful. As for its being es­ <lb/>
            teemed a close translation, I doubt not many have been led into <lb/>
            that error by the shortness of it. which proceeds not from his <lb/>
            following the original line by line, but from the contractions <lb/>
            above mentioned. He sometimes omits whole similes and sen. <lb/>
            tences, and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no <lb/>
            writer of his learning could have fallen, but through carelessness. <lb/>
            His poetry, as well as Ogilby's, is too mean for criticism.</p>
          <p>It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did <lb/>
            not live to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, <lb/>
            and a small part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places <lb/>
            not truly interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it <lb/>
            ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to <lb/>
            write in. He seems to have had too much regard to Chapman, <lb/>
            whose words he sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed <lb/>
            him in passages where he wanders from the original. However, <lb/>
            had he translated the whole work, I would no more have attempted <lb/>
            Homer after him than Virgil, his version of whom (notwith. <lb/>
            standing some human errors) is the most noble and spirited <lb/>
            translation I know in any language. But the fate of great <lb/>
            geniuses is like that of great ministers; though they are confess. <lb/>
            edly the first in the commonwealth of letters, they must be <lb/>
            envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it.</p>
          <p>That which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any <lb/>
            one who translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that <lb/>
            spirit and fire which makes his chief character: in particular places, <lb/>
            where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and <lb/>
            most poetical, as most agreeing with that character; to copy him <lb/>
            in all the variations of his style, and the different modulations of <lb/>
            his numbers; to preserve, in the more active or descriptive <lb/>
            parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more sedate or narra­ <lb/>
            tive, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness and <lb/>
            perspicuity ; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity: not to <lb/>
            neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor some­ <lb/>
            times the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound <lb/>
            any rites or customs of antiquity : perhaps, too, he ought to con­ <lb/>
            clude the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been <lb/>
            done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the <lb/>
            sense or poetry. What I would farther recommend to him, is <lb/>
            to study his author rather from his own text, than from any <lb/>
            Commentaries, how learned soever, or whatever figure they may <note type="footnote"> d</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xlii"/>
            make in the estimation of the world; to consider him attentively <lb/>
            in comparison with Virgil above all the ancients, and with <lb/>
            Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the Archbishop of <lb/>
            Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit <lb/>
            and turn of our author, and Bossu's admirable treatise of the <lb/>
            Epic Poem the jus test notion of his design and conduct. But <lb/>
            after all, with whatever judgment and study a man may pro­ <lb/>
            ceed, or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work, <lb/>
            he must hope to please but a few ; those only who have at once <lb/>
            a taste of poetry, and competent learning. For to satisfy such <lb/>
            as want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a <lb/>
            mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern, and a <lb/>
            pedant nothing that is not Greek.</p>
          <p>What I have done is submitted to the public, from whose <lb/>
            opinions I am prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so <lb/>
            little as our best poets, who are most sensible of the weight of <lb/>
            this task. As for the worst, whatever they shall please to say, <lb/>
            they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men, but <lb/>
            none as they are malignant writers. I was guided in this <lb/>
            translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by <lb/>
            persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old ob­ <lb/>
            servation be true, that the strongest antipathy in the world <lb/>
            is that of fools to men of wit. Mr. Addison was the firstt <lb/>
            whose advice determined me to undertake this task; who was <lb/>
            pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as I <lb/>
            cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir Richard <lb/>
            Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the <lb/>
            public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with <lb/>
            which he always serves his friend. The humanity and frankness <lb/>
            of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never knew wanting on any <lb/>
            occasion. I must also acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the <lb/>
            many friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Con­ <lb/>
            greve, who had led me the way in translating some parts of <lb/>
            Homer.* I must add the names of Mr. Rowe and Dr. Parnell, <lb/>
            though I shall take a farther opportunity of doing justice to the <lb/>
            last, whose good-nature (to give it a great panegyric) is no less <lb/>
            extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is <lb/>
            not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affec­ <lb/>
            tion. But what can I say of the honour so many of the great <lb/>
            have done me, while the first names of the age appear as my <lb/>
            subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments <lb/>
            of learning, as my chief encouragers P Among these it is a par­ <note type="footnote"> * The words " as I wish, for the sake of the world, he had prevented <lb/>

            ticular pleasure to me to find, that my highest obligations are to <lb/>
            such who have done most honour to the name of poet: That his <lb/>
            grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased I should <lb/>
            undertake the author to whom he has given (in his excellent <lb/>
            Essay) so complete a praise : <lb/>
            Read Homer once, and you can read no more ; <lb/>
            For all books else appear so mean, so poor, <lb/>
            Verse will seem prose; but still persist to read <lb/>
            And Homer will be all the books you need : <lb/>
            That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me, of <lb/>
            whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite <lb/>
            arts is more owing to his generosity or his example : That such a <lb/>
            genius as my Lord Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the <lb/>
            great scenes of business, than in all the useful and entertaining <lb/>
            parts of learning, has not refused to be the critic of these sheets, <lb/>
            and the patron of their writer: and that the noble author* of the <lb/>
            tragedy of Heroic Love has continued his partiality to me, from <lb/>
            my writing Pastorals, to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot <lb/>
            deny myself the pride of confessing, that I have had the advan­ <lb/>
            tage not only of their advice for the conduct in general, but <lb/>
            their correction of several particulars of this translation.</p>
          <p>I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished <lb/>
            by the Earl of Carnarvon, but it is almost absurd to particularize <lb/>
            any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a con­ <lb/>
            tinued series of them. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary <lb/>
            of state, will pardon my desire of having it known that he was <lb/>
            pleased to promote this affair The particular zeal of Mr. Har­ <lb/>
            court (the son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave me a proof <lb/>
            how much I am honoured in a share of his friendship. I must <lb/>
            attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends, <lb/>
            to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the <lb/>
            privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can <lb/>
            no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.</p>
          <p>In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. <lb/>
            He would have thought himself happy to have met the same <lb/>
            favour at Athens, that has been shown me by its learned rival, <lb/>
            the university of Oxford. And I can hardly envy him those pom­ <lb/>
            pous honours he received after death, when I reflect on the en­ <lb/>
            jovment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy friendships, <lb/>
            which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is the more <lb/>
            to be acknowledged, as it is shewn to one whose pen has never <lb/>
            gratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of <note type="footnote"> * George Granville, Lord Lansdowne. </note> <note type="footnote"> d 2</note> <lb/>

            particular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never <lb/>
            repent of an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour <lb/>
            and friendship of so many persons of merit; and in which I hope <lb/>
            to pass. some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a <lb/>
            circle of follies, after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others, <lb/>

          <p>In the war of Troy; the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring <lb/>
            towns, and taking from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and <lb/>
            Briseïs, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles. Chryses, <lb/>

            king being obliged to send back his captive, enters into a furious contest <lb/>
            with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute <lb/>
            command of the army, he seizes on Briseis in revenge. Achilles in <lb/>
            discontent withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; <lb/>
            and complaining to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sen­ <lb/>
            sible of the wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. <lb/>
            Jupiter granting her suit, incenses Juno, between whom the debate runs <lb/>

            Atrides still with deep resentment raged. <lb/>
            To wait his will two sacred heralds stood, <lb n="420"/>

          <p>Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful vision to <lb/>
            Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle; in order to <lb/>
            make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The general, who <lb/>
            is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but <lb/>
            fears the army was discouraged by his absence and the late plague, as <lb/>
            well as by length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by <lb/>
            a stratagem. He first communicates his design to the princes in coun­ <lb/>
            cil, that he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should <lb/>
            put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced. Then he assembles <lb/>
            the whole host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unani­ <lb/>
            mously agree to it, and run to prepare the ships. They are detained by <lb/>
            the management of Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. <lb/>
            The assembly is recalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at <lb/>
            length the advice of Nestor followed, which was to make a general <lb/>
            muster of the troops, and to divide them into their several nations, be­ <lb/>
            fore they proceeded to battle. This gives occasion to the poet to enu­ <lb/>
            merate all the forces of the Greeks and Trojans, in a large catalogue.</p>
          <p>The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The <lb/>
            scene lies in the Grecian camp and upon the sea-shore ; toward the end <lb/>
            it removes to Troy.</p>
          <p>Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye, <lb/>
            Stretch in the tents the Grecian leaders lie, <lb/>
            Th' immortal slumber'd on their thrones above; <lb/>
            All but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove. <lb/>
            To honour Thetis' son he bends his care, <lb n="5"/>
            And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war: <lb/>
            Pope but it was by his awkward performance of the part of Ganymede, for <lb/>
            the gods were not so unfeeling as to laugh at his lameness. <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight, <lb/>
            And thus commands the vision of the night:</p>
          <p>' Fly hence, deluding Dream! and, light as air, <lb/>
            ‘ To Agamemnon's ample tent repair. <lb n="10"/>
            ‘ Bid him in arms draw forth th' embattled train, <lb/>
            ‘ Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain. <lb/>
            ‘ Declare, e'en now 'tis given him to destroy <lb/>
            I The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.1 <lb/>
            ‘ For now no more the gods with fate contend, . <lb n="15"/>
            ‘ At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end. <lb/>
            ‘ Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall, <lb/>
            ‘ And nodding Ilion waits th' impending fall.'</p>
          <p>Swift as the word the vain illusion fled, <lb/>
            Descends, and hovers o'er Atrides' head; <lb n="20"/>
            Cloth'd in the figure of the Pylian sage, <lb/>
            Renown'd for wisdom, and revered for age ; <lb/>
            Around his temples spreads his golden wing, <lb/>
            And thus the flatt’ring dream deceives the king:</p>
          <p>‘ Canst thou, with all a monarch's cares oppress'd <lb n="25"/>
            ‘ Oh Atreus' sonI canst thou indulge thy rest P <lb/>
            ‘ Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides, <lb/>
            ‘ Directs in council, and in war presides, <lb/>
            ‘ To whom its safety a whole people owes, <lb/>
            ‘ To waste long nights in indolent repose. <lb n="30"/>
            ‘ Monarch awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear, <lb/>
            ‘ Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care. <lb/>
            ‘ In just array draw forth th' embattled train, <lb/>
            ‘ Lead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain; <lb/>
            ‘ E'en now, 0 king! 'tis given thee to destroy <lb n="35"/>
            ‘ The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy. <lb/>
            ‘ For now no more the gods with fate contend, <lb/>
            At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end. <note type="footnote"> 1 It appears from Aristotle, Poet. c. 26, that Homer was accused of im­ <lb/>
            piety for making Jupiter the author of a lie in this passage. * * * But <lb/>
            Macrcbius, de Somn. Scip. I. 7, takes off this imputation entirely, and will <lb/>
            not allow there was any lie in the case. “ Agamemnon," says he, “ was <lb/>
            ordered by the dream to lead out all the forces of the Greeks; now Achilles <lb/>
            and his forces not being summoned to the assembly with the rest, that <lb/>
            neglect absolved Jupiter from his promise." * * * Mr. Dacier takes <lb/>
            notice of a passage in the Scripture exactly parallel to this, where God is <lb/>
            represented making use of the malignity of his creatures to accomplish his <lb/>
            judgments. It is in 2 Chron. xviii. 19—21. " And the Lord said, who <lb/>
            will persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilcad ? And <lb/>
            there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will per­ <lb/>
            suade him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith ? And he said, I will <lb/>
            go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And <lb/>
            c said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also. Go forth and do so.”</note> <pb n="-"/>

            A thousand schemes the monarch's mind employ; <lb n="45"/>
            Elate in thought, he sacks untaken Troy: <lb/>
            Vain as he was, and to the future blind; <lb/>
            Nor saw what Jove and secret fate design'd; <lb/>
            What mighty toils to either host remain, <lb/>
            What scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain ! <lb n="50"/>
            Eager he rises, and in fancy hears <lb/>

            Around him next the regal mantle threw, <lb/>
            Th' embroider'd sandals on his feet were tied; <lb n="55"/>
            The starry falchion glitter'd at his side: <lb/>
            And last his arm the massy sceptre loads, <lb/>
            Unstained, immortal, and the gift of gods.</p>
          <p>Now rosy morn ascends the court of Jove, <lb/>

            In his black ship the Pylian prince he found; <lb n="65"/>
            There calls a senate of the peers around: <lb/>

          <p>He spoke, and sat; when Nestor rising said, <lb/>
            (Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd:) <lb n="100"/>
            ‘ Princes of Greece, your faithful cars incline, <lb/>
            ‘ Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine; <lb/>

            The sceptred rulers lead; the following host, <lb/>
            Pour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast. <lb n="110"/>
            As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees <lb/>
            Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees, <lb/>
            Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms <lb/>
            With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms ; <lb/>
            Dusky they spread, a close-embodied crowd, <lb n="115"/>
            And o'er the vale descends the living cloud. <lb/>
            So, from the tents and ships, a lengthening train <lb/>

            Fame flies before, the messenger of Jove, <lb/>
            And shining soars, and claps her wings above. <lb/>
            Nine sacred heralds now proclaiming loud <lb/>

            One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame: <lb/>
            His mountain-shoulders half his breast o'erspread; <lb n="265"/>
            Thin hairs bestrew'd his long mis-shapen head. <lb/>
            Spleen to mankind his envious heart possess'd, <lb/>

            Long had he liv'd the scorn of every Greek ; <lb/>

            Sharp was his voice; which, in the shrillest tone, <lb/>

            compose the picture of a pernicious creature of wit; the chief of which are <lb/>
            a desire of promoting laughter at any rate, and a contempt of his superiors. <lb/>
            And he sums up the whole very strongly, by saying, that Thersites hated <lb/>
            Achilles and Ulysses; in which, as Plutarch has remarked in his treatise <lb/>
            of envy and hatred, he makes it the utmost completion of an ill character <lb/>
            to bear a malevolence to the best men. What is farther observable is, that <lb/>
            Thersites is never heard of after this, his first appearance: such a scanda­ <lb/>
            lous character is to be taken no more notice of, than just to shew that it is <lb/>
            despised. The same conduct is observed with regard to the most deformed <lb/>
            and most beautiful person of the poem : for Nireus is thus mentioned once, <lb/>
            and no more throughout the Iliad. He places a worthless beauty and an <lb/>
            ill-natured wit upon the same footing, and shews that the gifts of the bod <lb/>

            may be observed, that however fabulous the other parts of Homer's poem <lb/>
            may be, according to the nature of Epic poetry, this account of the people, <lb/>
            inces, and countries, is purely historical, founded on the real transactions <lb/>
            of those times, and by far the most valuable piece of history and geography <lb/>
            left us concerning the state of Greece in that early period. Greece was <lb/>
            then divided into several Dynasties, which our author has enumerated <lb/>
            und their respective princes; and his division was looked upon so exact, <lb/>
            that we are told of many controversies concerning the boundaries of Gre­ <lb/>
            cian cities, which have been decided upon the authority of this piece. Eus-</note> <pb n="49"/>
             <note type="margin">B. II.]</note> <lb/>
            cathius has collected together the following instances. The city of Calydon <lb/>
            was adjudged to the Ætolians notwithstanding the pretensions of Æolia, <lb/>
            because Homer had ranked it among the towns belonging to the former. <lb/>
            Sestos was given to those of Abydos, upon the plea that he had said the <lb/>
            Abydonians were possessors of Sestos, Abydos, and Arisbe. When the Mile­ <lb/>
            sians and people of Priene disputed their claim to Mycale, a verse of Homer <lb/>
            carried it in favour of the Milesians. And the Athenians were put in pos­ <lb/>
            session of Salamis by another which was cited by Solon, or (as some think) <lb/>
            interpolated by him for that purpose. Nay, in so high estimation has the <lb/>
            catalogue been held, that (as Porphyry has written) there have been laws in <lb/>
            some nations for the youth to learn it by heart, and particularly Cerdias, <lb/>
            (whom Cuperus de Apophth. Homer, takes to be Cercydus, a lawgiver <lb/>
            of the Megalopolitans,) made it one to his countrymen.</p>
          <p>But if we consider the catalogue purely as poetical, it will not want its <lb/>
            beauties in that light. Rapin, who was none of the most superstitious <lb/>
            admirers of our author, reckons it among those parts which had particularly <lb/>
            charmed him. We may observe first, what an air of probability is spread <lb/>
            over the whole poem by the particularizing of every nation and people con­ <lb/>
            cerned in this war. Secondly, what an entertaining scene he presents te <lb/>
            us, of so many countries drawn in their liveliest and most natural colours, <lb/>
            while we wander along with him amidst a beautiful variety of towns, <lb/>
            navens. forests, vineyards, groves, mountains, and rivers; and are per­ <lb/>
            petually amused with his observations on the different soils, products, <lb/>
            situations, or prospects. Thirdly, what a noble review he passes before <lb/>
            us of so mighty an army, drawn out in order, troop by troop; which, had <lb/>
            the number only been told in the gross, bad never filled the reader with so <lb/>
            great a notion of the importance of the action. Fourthly, the description <lb/>
            of the differing arms and manner of fighting of the soldiers, and the <lb/>
            various attitudes he has given to the commanders: of these leaders, the <lb/>
            greatest part are either the immediate sons of gods, or the descendants of <lb/>
            gods; and how great an idea must we have of a war, to the waging of <lb/>
            which so many demi-gods and heroes are assembled! Fifthly, the several <lb/>
            artful compliments he paid by this means to his own country in general, <lb/>
            and many of his contemporaries in particular, by a celebration of the gene­ <lb/>
            alogies, ancient seats, and dominions of the great men of his time. Sixthly, <lb/>
            the agreeable mixture of narrations from passages of history or fables, <lb/>
            with which he amuses and relieves us at proper intervals. And lastly, the <lb/>
            admirable judgment wherewith he introduces this whole catalogue, just at <lb/>
            a time when the posture of affairs in the army rendered such a review of <lb/>
            absolute necessity to the Greeks; and in a pause of action, while each Wall <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>The armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon beta een <lb/>
            Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for the determina. <lb/>
            tion of the war. Iris is sent to call Helena to behold the fight. She <lb/>
            leads her to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his counsellors, <lb/>
            observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom Helen <lb/>
            gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either part take <lb/>
            the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues, <lb/>
            wherein Paris being overcome, is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, <lb/>
            and transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls, <lb/>
            and brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Gre­ <lb/>
            cians, demands the restoration of Helen, and the performance of the <lb/>
            articles.</p>
          <p>The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The <lb/>
            scene is sometimes in the field before Troy, and sometimes in Troy <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>THUS by their leader's care each martial band <lb/>
            Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land. <lb/>
            With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar, <lb/>
            Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war : <note type="footnote"> 1 Of all the books of the Iliad, there is scarce any more pleasing than <lb/>
            the third. It may be divided into five parts, each of which has a beauty <lb/>
            different from the other. The first contains what passed between the two <lb/>
            armies, and the proposal of the combat between Paris and Menelaus : the <lb/>
            attention and suspense of these mighty hosts, which were just upon the <lb/>
            point of joining battle, and the lofty manner of offering and accepting <lb/>
            this important and unexpected challenge, have something in them wonder­ <lb/>
            fully pompous, and of an amusing solemnity. The second part, which <lb/>
            describes the behaviour of Helena in this juncture, her conference with the <lb/>
            old king and his counsellors, with the review of the heroes from the battle­ <lb/>
            ments, is an episode entirely of another sort, which excels in the natural <lb/>
            and pathetic. The third consists of the ceremonies of the oath on both <lb/>
            sides, and the preliminaries to the combat; with the beautiful retreat <lb/>
            of Priam, who, in the tenderness of a parent, withdraws from the sight of <lb/>
            the duel. These particulars detain the reader in expectation, and heighten <lb/>
            his impatience for the fight itself. The fourth is the description of the <lb/>
            duel, an exact piece of painting, where we see every attitude, motion, and <lb/>
            action of the combatants particularly and distinctly, and which concludes <lb/>
            with a surprising propriety, in the rescue of Paris by Venus. The machine <lb/>
            of that goddess, which makes the fifth part, and whose end is to reconcile <lb/>
            Paris and Helena, is admirable in every circumstance; the remonstrance</note> <pb n="51"/>
             <note type="margin">B. III.]</note> <lb/>
            So when inclement winters vex the plain <lb n="5"/>
            With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain, <lb/>
            To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly, <lb/>
            With noise, and order, through the mid-way sky; <lb/>
            To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring, <lb/>
            And all the war descends upon the wing. <lb n="10"/>
            But silent, breathing rage, resolv'd, and skill'd <lb/>
            By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field, <lb/>
            Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around <lb/>
            Darkening arises from the labour'd ground. <lb/>
            Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds <lb n="15"/>
            A night of vapours round the mountain-heads, <lb/>
            Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade, <lb/>
            To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade ; <lb/>
            While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey, <lb/>
            Lost and confus'd amidst the thickened day: <lb n="20"/>
            So, wrapt in gathering dust, the Grecian train, <lb/>
            A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.</p>
          <p>Now front to front the hostile armies stand, <lb/>
            Eager of fight, and only wait command: <lb/>
            When, to the van, before the sons of fame <lb n="25"/>
            Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came <lb/>
            In form a god ! the panther's speckled hide <lb/>
            Flow'd o'er his armour with an easy pride ; <lb/>
            His bended bow across his shoulders flung, <lb/>
            His sword beside him negligently hung; <note type="footnote"> she holds with the goddess, the reluctance with which she obeys her, the <lb/>
            reproaches she casts upon Paris, and the flattery and courtship with which <lb/>
            he so soon wins her over to him. Helen (the main cause of this war) was <lb/>
            not to be made an odious character; she is drawn by this great master with <lb/>
            the finest strokes, as a frail, but not as an abandoned creature. She has per­ <lb/>
            petual struggles of virtue on one side, and softnesses which overcome them <lb/>
            on the other. Our author has been remarkably careful to tell us this; <lb/>
            whenever he but slightly names her in the foregoing part of his work, she <lb/>
            is represented at the same time as repentant; and it is thus we see her at <lb/>
            large at her first appearance in the present book; which is one of the <lb/>
            shortest of the whole Iliad, but in recompense has beauties almost in every <lb/>
            line, and most of them so obvious, that to acknowledge them we need only <lb/>
            to read them. Pope. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The picture here given of Paris's air and dress, is exactly correspond­ <lb/>
            ent to his character; you see him endeavouring to mix the fine gentleman <lb/>
            with the warrior; and this idea of him Homer takes care to keep up, by <lb/>
            describing him not without the same regard, when he is arming to en. <lb/>
            counter Menelaus afterwards in a close fight, as he shows here where he is <lb/>
            but preluding and flourishing in the gaiety of his heart. And when he <lb/>
            tells us, in that place, that he was in danger of being strangled by the strap <lb/>
            of his helmet, he takes notice that it was embroidered. Pope.</note> <lb n="30"/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace, <lb/>
            And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.</p>
          <p>As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain, <lb/>
            He boldly stalk'a, the foremost on the plain, <lb/>
            Him Menelaus, lov'd of Mars, espies, <lb n="35"/>
            With heart elated, and with joyful eyes : <lb/>
            So joys a lion, if the branching deer <lb/>
            Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear ; <lb/>
            In vain the youths oppose, the mastiffs bay, <lb/>
            The lordly savage rends the panting prey. <lb n="40"/>
            Thus, fond of vengeance, with a furious bound, <lb/>
            In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground <lb/>
            From his high chariot: him, approaching near, <lb/>
            The beauteous champion views with marks of fear, <lb/>
            Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind <lb n="45"/>
            And shuns the fate he well deserved to find. <lb/>
            As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees <lb/>
            Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees ; <lb/>
            Trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright, <lb/>
            And, all confus'd, precipitates his flight:<lb n="50"/>
            So from the king the shining warrior flies, <lb/>
            And plung'd amid the thickest Trojans lies.</p>
          <p>As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,3 <lb/>
            He thus upbraids him with a generous heat: <lb/>
            ' Unhappy Paris ! but to women brave! <lb n="55"/>
            ' So fairly form'd, and only to deceive! <lb/>
            'Oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw'st the light, <lb/>
            ' Or died at least before thy nuptial rite ! <lb/>
            A better fate, than vainly thus to boast, <lb/>
            'And fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host. <lb n="60"/>
            ' Gods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see <lb/>
            ' Their fears of danger undeceived in thee ! <lb/>
            ' Thy figure promis d with a martial air, <lb/>
            ' But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair. <note type="footnote"> 3 This is the first place of the poem where Hector makes a figure, and if <lb/>
            he is not the chief hero of the Iliad, he is at least the most amiable. <lb/>
            He has no other blemish than that he fights in an unjust cause, which <lb/>
            Homer has been careful to tell us he would not do, if his opinion <lb/>
            were followed. But since he cannot prevail, the affection he bears to his <lb/>
            parents and kindred, and his desire of defending them, incites him to do <lb/>
            his utmost for their safety. It may be added, that Homer having so many <lb/>
            Greeks to celebrate, makes them shine in their turns, and singly in their <lb/>
            several books, one succeeding in the absence of another: whereas Hector <lb/>
            appears in every battle the life and soul of his party, and the constant <lb/>
            bulwark against every enemy: he stands against Agamemnonis magna­ <lb/>
            nimity, Diomed's bravery, Ajax's strength, and Achilles' fury. Pope. </note> <pb n="53"/>

            Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.</p>

            Eludes the death, and disappoints his foe: <lb/>
            But fierce Atrides' wav'd his sword, and struck <lb n="445"/>
            Full on his casque; the crested helmet shook ; <lb/>
            The brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand, <lb/>
            Broke short: the fragments glitter'd on the sand <lb/>
            The raging warrior to the spacious skies <lb/>
            Rais'd his upbraiding voice, and angry eyes : <lb n="450"/>
            ‛Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust P <lb/>
            ‛And is it thus the gods assist the just P <lb/>
            ‛When crimes provoke us, heaven success denies: <lb/>
            ‛The dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies.’ <lb/>
            Furious he said, and toward the Grecian crews <lb n="455"/>
            (Seiz'd by the crest) th' unhappy warrior drew; <lb/>
            Struggling he followed, while th’ embroider'd thong, <lb/>
            That tied his helmet, dragg'd the chief along. <lb/>
            Then had his ruin crown'd Atrides' joy, <lb/>
            But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy: <lb n="460"/>
            Unseen she came, and burst the golden band; <lb/>
            And left an empty helmet in his hand. <lb/>
            The casque, enraged, amidst the Greeks he threw; <lb/>
            The Greeks with smiles the polish'd trophy view. <lb/>
            Then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart, <lb n="465"/>
            In thirst of vengeance, at his rival's heart, <lb/>
            The queen of Love her favour'd champion shrouds <lb/>
            (For gods can all things) in a veil of clouds. <lb/>
            Rais’d from the field the panting youth she led, <lb/>
            And gently laid him on the bridal bed, <lb n="470"/>
            With pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews, <lb/>
            And all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews.</p>
          <p>Meantime the brightest of the female kind, <lb/>
            The matchless Helen, o'er the walls reclin'd: <lb/>
            To her, beset with Trojan beauties, came, <lb n="475"/>
            In borrow'd form, the laughter-loving dame. <lb/>
            (She seem'd an ancient maid, well skill'd to cull <lb/>
            The snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool.) <lb/>
            The goddess softly shook her silken vest <lb/>
            That shed perfumes, and whisp'ring thus address'd: <lb n="480"/>

          <p>She spoke, and Helen's secret soul was mov'd; <lb/>
            She scorn'd the champion, but the man she lov'd. <lb/>
            Fair Venus, neck, her eyes that sparkled fire, <lb/>
            And breast, reveal'd the queen of soft desire. <lb n="490"/>
            Struck with her presence, straight the lively red <lb/>
            Forsook her cheek; and trembling thus she said: <lb/>

            The maids officious round their mistress wait: <lb/>
            Then all, dispersing, various tasks attend ; <lb/>
            The queen and goddess to the prince ascend. <lb/>
            Full m her Paris' sight the queen of love <lb/>
            Had placed the beauteous progeny of Jove ; <lb n="530"/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            Where, as he view'd her charms, she turn'd away <lb/>
            Her glowing eyes, and thus began to say:</p>

            ‛ Late fled the field, and yet survives his fame P <lb/>
            Oh hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword <lb n="535"/>
            Of that brave man whom once I call'd my lord! <lb/>
            The boaster Paris oft desired the day <lb/>
            With Sparta's king to meet in single fray: <lb/>

            ‛Provoke Atrides, and renew the fight: <lb n="540"/>

            ‛Shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field.'</p>
          <p>The Prince replies : ‛Ah cease, divinely fair, <lb/>

            ‛We yet may vanquish in a happier hour: <lb/>
            ‛There want not gods to favour us above; <lb/>

            ‛ My forc'd, my willing, heavenly prize I bore, <lb/>

            Thus having spoke, th' enamour'd Phrygian boy <lb n="555"/>
            Rush'd to the bed, impatient for the joy. <lb/>
            Him Helen follow'd slow with bashful charms, <lb/>
            And clasp'd the blooming hero in her arms.</p>
          <p>While these to love's delicious rapture yield, <lb/>
            The stern Atrides rages round the field: <lb n="560"/>
            So some fell lion whom the woods obey, <lb/>
            Roars through the desert, and demands his prey. <lb/>
            Paris he seeks, impatient to destroy, <lb/>
            But seeks in vain along the troops of Troy ; <lb/>
            Even those had yielded to a foe so brave <lb n="565"/>
            The recreant warrior, hateful as the grave. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>The Gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they ogre <lb/>
            upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the <lb/>
            truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who<lb/>
            wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the mean time some of the Tro­ <lb/>
            jan troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the <lb/>
            parts of a good general; be reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, <lb/>
            some by praises, and others by reproofs. Nestor is particularly cele­ <lb/>
            brated for his military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers <lb/>
            are slain on both sides.</p>
          <p>The same day continues through this, as through the last book; as it does <lb/>
            also through the two following, and almost to the end of the seventh <lb/>
            book. The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.</p>
          <p>AND now Olympus' shining gates unfold; <lb/>
            The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold: <lb/>
            Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine, <lb/>
            The golden goblet crowns with purple wine : <lb/>
            While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ <lb n="5"/>
            Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.</p>
          <p>When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia's spleen, <lb/>
            Thus wak'd the fury of his partial queen: <lb/>
            ‛Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid, <lb/>
            ‛Imperial Juno, and the martial maid: <lb n="10"/>
            ‛But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far, <lb/>
            ‛The tame spectators of his deeds of war. <lb/>
            ‛Not thus fair Venus helps her favour'd knight, <lb/>
            ‛The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight, <lb/>
            ‛Each danger wards, and, constant in her care, <lb n="15"/>
            ‛Saves in the moment of the last despair. <lb/>
            ‛Her act has rescued Paris' forfeit life, <lb/>
            ‛Though great Atrides gain'd the glorious strife. <lb/>
            ‛Then say, ye powers ! what signal issue waits <lb/>

            ‛Shall heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare, <lb/>

            ‛Yet, would the gods for human good provide, <lb/>
            ‛Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride, <lb/>
            ‛Still Priam's walls in peaceful honours grow, <lb n="25"/>
            ‛And through his gates the crowding nations flow.’</p>
          <p>Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged, <lb/>
            And queen of war, in close consult engaged: <lb/>
            Apart they sit, their deep designs employ, <lb/>
            And meditate the future woes of Troy. <lb n="30"/>
            Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast, <lb/>
            The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd; <lb/>
            But Juno, impotent of passion, broke <lb/>
            Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke :</p>
          <p>‛Shall then, 0 tyrant of th' ethereal reign! <lb n="35"/>
            ‛My schemes, my labours, and my hopes, be vain? <lb/>

            ‛To spread the war, I flew from shore to shore; <lb/>

          <p>The sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies, <lb n="45"/>
            Sighs from his inmost soul, and thus replies: <lb/>
            ‛Oh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate <lb/>

            ‛What high offence has fir'd the wife of Jove P <lb/>

          <p>At this the goddess roll'd her radiant eyes, <lb/>
            Then on the Thunderer fix'd them, and replies: <lb/>
            ‛Three towns are Juno’son the Grecian plains, <lb n="75"/>
            ‛More dear than all th' extended earth contains, <lb/>

            As the red comet, from Saturnius sent <lb/>

          <p>Such, and so thick, th' embattled squadrons stood, <lb/>

            A shady light was shot from glimmering shields, <lb/>

            The nymph, descending from the hills of Ide, <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OBSERVATIONS ON HOMER'S BATTLES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IT may be necessary, at the opening of Homer's battles, to give some <lb/>
            explanatory observations upon them. When we reflect that no less than <lb/>
            the compass of twelve books is taken up in these, we shall have reason to <lb/>
            wonder by what method the author could prevent descriptions of such a <lb/>
            length from being tedious. It is not enough to say, that though the sub­ <lb/>
            ject itself be the same, the actions are always different; that we have now <lb/>
            distinct combats, now promiscuous fights, now single duels, now general <lb/>
            engagements; or that the scenes are perpetually varied; we are now in <lb/>
            the fields, now at the fortification of the Greeks, now at the ships, now at <lb/>
            the gates of Troy, now at the river Scamander : but we must look farther <lb/>
            into the art of the poet to find the reasons of this astonishing variety.</p>
          <p>We first observe that diversity in the deaths of his warriors, which be <lb/>
            has supplied by the vastest fertility of invention. These he distinguishes <lb/>
            several ways : sometimes by the characters of the men, their age, office, <lb/>
            profession, nation, family, Sec. One is a blooming youth, whose father dis­ <lb/>
            suaded him from the war; one is a priest, whose piety could not save him ; <lb/>
            one is a sportsman, whom Diana taught in vain ; one is the native of a far <lb/>
            distant country, who is never to return; one is descended from a noble line, <lb/>
            which ends in his death; one is made remarkable by his boasting ; another <lb/>
            by his beseeching; and another, who is distinguished no way else, is <lb/>
            marked by his habit, and the singularity of his armour.</p>
          <p>Sometimes lie varies these by the several postures in which his heroes are <lb/>
            represented either fighting or falling. Some of these are so exceedingly <lb/>
            exact, that one may guess, from the very position of the combatant, where­ <lb/>
            abouts the wound will light: others so very peculiar and uncommon, that <lb/>
            they could only be the effect of an imagination which had searched through <lb/>
            all the ideas of nature. Such is that picture of Mydon in the fifth book, <lb/>
            whose arm being numbed by a blow on the elbow, drops the reins, that <lb/>
            trail on the ground; and then being suddenly struck on the temples, falls <lb/>
            headlong from the chariot, in a soft and deep place, where he sinks up to <lb/>
            the shoulders in the sands, and continues a while fixed by the weight of <lb/>
            his armour, with his legs quivering in the air, till he is trampled down by <lb/>
            his horses.</p><pb n="81"/>
            
          <p>Another cause of this variety is the difference of the wounds that are <lb/>
            given in the Iliad : they are by no means like the wounds described by <lb/>
            most other poets, which are commonly made in the self-same obvious places ; <lb/>
            the heart and head serve for all those in general who understand no ana­ <lb/>
            tomy, and sometimes, for variety, they kill men by wounds that are no <lb/>
            where mortal but in their poems. As the whole human body is the subject <lb/>
            of these, so nothing is more necessary to him who would describe them <lb/>
            well, than a thorough knowledge of its structure, even though the poet is <lb/>
            not professedly to write of them as an anatomist; in the same manner as <lb/>
            an exact skill in anatomy is necessary to those painters that would excel <lb/>
            in drawing the naked body, though they are not to make every muscle as <lb/>
            visible as in a book of chirurgery. It appears from so many passages in <lb/>
            Homer, that he was perfectly master of this science, that it would be need­ <lb/>
            less to cite any in particular.</p>
          <p>It may be necessary to take notice of some customs of antiquity relating <lb/>
            to the arms and art military of those times, which are proper to be known, <lb/>
            in order to form a right notion of our author's descriptions of war.</p>
          <p>That Homer copied the manners and customs of the age he wrote of, <lb/>
            rather than of that he lived in, has been observed in some instances. As <lb/>
            that he nowhere represents cavalry or trumpets to have been used in the <lb/>
            Trojan wars, though they apparently were in his own time. It is not there­ <lb/>
            fore imposible but there may be found in his works some deficiencies in the <lb/>
            art of war, which are not to be imputed to his ignorance, but to his <lb/>
            judgment.</p>
          <p>Horses had not been brought into Greece long before the siege of Troy. <lb/>
            They were originally eastern animals, and if we find at that very period so <lb/>
            great a number of them reckoned up in the wars of the Israelites, it is the <lb/>
            less a wonder, considering they came from Asia. The practice of riding <lb/>
            them was so little known in Greece a few years before, that they looked <lb/>
            upon the Centaurs who first used it, as monsters compounded of men and <lb/>
            horses. Nestor, in the first Iliad, says he had seen these Centaurs in his <lb/>
            youth, and Polypoetes in the second is said to have been born on the day that <lb/>
            hisfather expelled them from Pelion to the deserts of Æthica. They had no <lb/>
            other use of horses than to draw their chariots in battle, so that whenever <lb/>
            Homer speaks of fighting from a horse, taming a horse, or the like, it is <lb/>
            constantly to be understood of fighting from a chariot, or taming horses to <lb/>
            that service. This was a piece of decorum in the poet; for in his own <lb/>
            time they were arrived to such a perfection in horsemanship, that in the <lb/>
            fifteenth Iliad, ver. 822, we have a simile taken from an extraordinary feat <lb/>
            of activity, where one man manages four horses at once, and leaps from <lb/>
            the back of one to another at full speed.</p>
          <p>If we consider in what high esteem among warriors these noble animals <lb/>
            must have been at their first coming into Greece, we shall the less wonder <lb/>
            at the frequent occasions Homer has taken to describe and celebrate them. <lb/>
            It is not so strange to find them set almost upon a level with men, at the <lb/>
            time when a horse in the prizes was of equal value with a captive.</p>
          <p>The chariots were in all probability very low. For we frequently find <lb/>
            in the Iliad, that a person who stands erect on a chariot is killed, (and <lb/>
            sometimes by a stroke on the head,) by a foot soldier with a sword. This <lb/>
            may farther appear from the case ard readiness with which they alight or <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            mount on every occasion, to facilitate which, the chariots were made open <lb/>
            behind. That the wheels were but small, may be guessed from a custom <lb/>
            they had of taking them off and setting them on, as they were laid by, or <lb/>
            made use of. Hebe in the fifth book puts on the wheels of Juno's chariot <lb/>
            when she calls for it in haste : and it seems to be with allusion to the same <lb/>
            practice that it is said in Exodus, ch. xiv., The Lord took off their chariot- <lb/>
            wheels, so that they drove them heavily. The sides were also low; for who­ <lb/>
            ever is killed in his chariot throughout the poem, constantly falls to the <lb/>
            ground, as having nothing to support him. That the whole machine was <lb/>
            very small and light, is evident from a passage in the tenth Iliad, where <lb/>
            Diomed debates whether he shall draw the chariot of Rhesus out of the <lb/>
            way, or carry it on his shoulders to a place of safety. All the particulars <lb/>
            agree with the representations of the chariots on the most ancient Greek <lb/>
            coins; where the tops of them reached not so high as the backs of the <lb/>
            horses; the wheels are yet lower, and the heroes who stand in them are <lb/>
            seen from the knee upwards.</p>
          <p>There were generally two persons in each chariot, one of whom was <lb/>
            wholly employed in guiding the horses. They used indifferently, two, <lb/>
            three, or four horses: from whence it happens, that sometimes when a <lb/>
            horse is killed, the hero continues the fight with the two or more that re­ <lb/>
            main; and at other times a warrior retreats upon the loss of one ; not that <lb/>
            he had less courage than the other, but that be has fewer horses.</p>
          <p>Their swords were all broad cutting swords, for we find they never stab <lb/>
            but with their spears. The spears were used two ways, either to push with, <lb/>
            or to cast from them, like the missive javelins. It seems surprising, that <lb/>
            a man should throw a dart or spear with such force, as to pierce through <lb/>
            both sides of the armour and the body (as is often described in Homer) : <lb/>
            tor if the strength of the men was gigantic, the armour must have been <lb/>
            strong in proportion. Some solution might be given for this, if we ima­ <lb/>
            gined the armour was generally brass, and the weapons pointed with iron ; <lb/>
            and if we could fancy that Homer called the spears and swords brazen, in <lb/>
            the same manner that he calls the reins of a bridle ivory, only from the or­ <lb/>
            naments about them. But there are passages where the point of the spear <lb/>
            is expressly said to be of brass, as in the description of that of Hector in <lb/>
            Iliad vi. Pausanias (Laconicis) takes it for granted, that the arms, as well <lb/>
            offensive as defensive, were brass. He says the spear of Achilles was kept <lb/>
            in his time in the temple of Minerva, the top and point of which were <lb/>
            of brass; and the sword of Meriones, in that of .Esculapius among the <lb/>
            Nicomedians, was entirely of the same metal. But be it as it will, there <lb/>
            are examples even at this day of such a prodigious force in casting darts, as <lb/>
            almost exceeds credibility. The Turks and Arabs will pierce through <lb/>
            thick planks with darts of hardened wood; which can only be attributed <lb/>
            to their being bred (as the ancients were) to that exercise, and to the <lb/>
            strength and agility acquired by a constant practice of it.</p>
          <p>We may ascribe to the same cause their power of casting stones of a vast <lb/>
            weight, which appears a common practice in these battles. It is an error <lb/>
            to imagine this to be only a fictitious embellishment of the poet, which was <lb/>
            one of the exercises of war among the ancient Greeks and Orientals. St. <lb/>
            Jerome tells us, it was an old custom in Palestine, and in use in his own <lb/>
            time, to have round stones of a great weight kept in the castles and vil­ <lb/>
            ages, for the youth to try their strength with</p><pb n="83"/>

          <p>Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day's battle. Pan­ <lb/>
            darus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables <lb/>
            him to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending <lb/>
            with any of the former, excepting Venus. Æneas joins Pandarus to <lb/>
            oppose him, Pandarus is killed, and Æneas in great danger but for the <lb/>
            assistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, <lb/>
            wounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, <lb/>
            and, at length, carries off Æneas to Troy, where he is healed in the <lb/>
            temple of Pergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to <lb/>
            make a stand. In the mean time Æneas is restored to the field, and <lb/>
            they overthrow several of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain <lb/>
            by Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter in­ <lb/>
            cites Diomed to go against that god; he wounds him, and sends him <lb/>
            groaning to heaven.</p>
          <p>The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as in <lb/>
            the former.</p>
          <p>BUT Pallas now Tydides' soul inspires, <lb/>
            Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires, <lb/>
            Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise, <lb/>
            And crown her hero with distinguish'd praise. <lb/>
            High on his helm celestial lightnings play, <lb n="5"/>
            His beamy shield emits a living ray ; <lb/>
            Th' unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies, <lb/>
            Like the red star that fires th' autumnal skies, <lb/>
            When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight, <lb/>
            And bath'd in Ocean shoots a keener light. <lb n="10"/>
            Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow'd, <lb/>
            Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd: <lb/>
            Onward she drives him, furious to engage, <lb/>
            Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.</p>
          <p>The sons of Dares first the combat sought, <lb n="15"/>
            A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault; <lb/>
            In Vulcan's fane the father's days were led; <lb/>
            The sons to toils of glorious battle bred; <lb/>
            These, singled from their troops, the fight maintain; <lb/>
            These from their steeds, Tydides on the plain. <lb n="20"/>
            Fierce for renown the brother chiefs draw near, <lb/>
            And first bold Phegeus casts his sounding spear, <lb/>
            Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course, <lb/>
            And spent in empty air its erring force. <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain, <lb n="25"/>
            But picrc'd his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain. <lb/>
            Sciz d with unusual fear, Idæus fled, <lb/>
            Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead ; <lb/>
            And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid, <lb/>
            He too had sunk to death's eternal shade ; <lb n="30"/>
            But in a smoky cloud the god of fire <lb/>
            Preserv'd the son, in pity to the sire. <lb/>
            The steeds and chariot, to the navy led, <lb/>
            Increas'd the spoils of gallant Diomed.</p>
          <p>Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew <lb n="35"/>
            Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view ; <lb/>
            When by the blood-stain'd hand Minerva press'd <lb/>
            The good of battles, and this speech address'd :</p>
          <p>‘ Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall. <lb/>
            ‘Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall! <lb n="40"/>
            ‘Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide; <lb/>
            ‘And whose the conquest mighty Jove decide: <lb/>
            ' While we from interdicted fields retire, <lb/>
            ' Nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire.</p>
          <p>Her words allay th' impetuous warrior's heat, <lb n="45"/>
            The god of arms and martial maid retreat; <lb/>
            Remov'd from light, on Xanthus' flowery bounds <lb/>
            They sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.</p>
          <p>Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue, <lb/>
            And some bold chieftain every leader slew: <lb n="50"/>
            First Odius falls and bites the bloody sand, <lb/>
            His death ennobled by Atrides' hand ; <lb/>
            As he to flight his wheeling car address'd, <lb/>
            The speedy javelin drove from back to breast. <lb/>
            In dust the mighty Halizonian lay, <lb n="55"/>
            His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.</p>
          <p>Thy fate was next, 0 Phæstus ! doomd to feel <lb/>
            The great Idomeneus' pretended steel; <lb/>
            Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy) <lb/>
            From fruitful Tarné1 to the fields of Troy. <lb n="60"/>
            The Cretan javelin reach'd him from afar, <lb/>
            And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car; <lb/>
            Back from the car he tumbles to the ground, <lb/>
            And everlasting shades his eyes surround.</p>
          <p>Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase, <lb n="65"/>
            In woods and wilds to wound the savage race; <lb/>
            Diana taught him all her sylvan arts, <lb/>
            To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts ; <note type="footnote"> 1 A town of Lydia. </note> <pb n="85"/>
             <note type="margin">B. V.]</note> <lb/>
            But vaimv here Diana's arts he tries, <lb/>
            The fatal lance arrests him as he flies ; <lb n="70"/>
            From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent, <lb/>
            Through his broad back and heaving bosom went: <lb/>
            Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound, <lb/>
            His brazen armour rings against the ground.</p>
          <p>Next artful Phereclus untimely fell; <lb n="75"/>
            Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell. <lb/>
            Thy father's skill, 0 Phereclus, was thine, <lb/>
            The graceful fabric and the fair design ; <lb/>
            For, lov'd by Pallas. Pallas did impart <lb/>
            To him the shipwright's and the builder's art, <lb n="80"/>
            Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose, <lb/>
            The fatal cause of all his country's woes ; <lb/>
            But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown, <lb/>
            Nor saw his country's peril, nor his own. <lb/>
            The hapless artist, while confus'd he fled, <lb n="85"/>
            The spear of Merion mingled with the dead. <lb/>
            Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast, <lb/>
            Between the bladder and the bone it past; <lb/>
            Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries, <lb/>
            And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes. <lb n="90"/>
            </p>
          <p>From Meges* force the swift Pedæus fled, <lb/>
            Antenor's offspring from a foreign bed; <lb/>
            Whose generous spouse, Theano, heavenly fair, <lb/>
            Nurs'd the young stranger with a mother's care. <lb/>
            How vain those cares ! when Meges in the rear <lb n="95"/>
            Full in his nape infix'd the fatal spear ; <lb/>
            Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides, <lb/>
            And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.</p>
          <p>Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine, <lb/>
            Sprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line, <lb n="100"/>
            Who near ador'd Scamander made abode, <lb/>
            Priest of the stream, and honour'd as a god. <lb/>
            On him, amidst the flying numbers found, <lb/>
            Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound ; <lb/>
            On his broad shoulder fell the forceful brand, <lb n="105"/>
            Thence glancing downward lopp'd his holy hand, <lb/>
            Which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand. <lb/>
            Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death <lb/>

          <p>Thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engag'd, <lb n="110"/>
            In every quarter fierce Tydides rag'a, <lb/>
            Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train, <lb/>
            Rapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain ; <lb/>
            Now here, now there, he darts from place to place, <lb/>
            Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face. <lb n="115"/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong <lb/>
            Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along ; <lb/>
            Through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds, <lb/>
            O'erwhelms the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds ; <lb/>
            The yellow harvests of the ripen'd year, <lb n="120"/>
            And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear! <lb/>
            While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain, <lb/>
            And all the labours of mankind are vain.</p>
          <p>So rag'd Tydides, boundless in his ire, <lb/>
            Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire. <lb n="125"/>
            With grief the leader 2 of the Lycian band <lb/>
            Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand : <lb/>
            His bended bow against the chief he drew; <lb/>
            Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew, <lb/>
            Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore, <lb n="130"/>
            Deep in his shoulder pierc'd, and drank the gore; <lb/>
            The rushing stream his brazen armour dy'd, <lb/>
            While the proud archer thus exulting cried :</p>
          <p>' Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds! <lb/>
            ‘ Lo ! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds. <lb n="135"/>
            ‘ Not long the deathful dart he can sustain ; <lb/>
            ‘ Or Phœbus urg'd me to these fields in vain.</p>
          <p>So spoke he, boastful; but the winged dart <lb/>
            Stopp d short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art. <lb/>
            The wounded chief, behind his car retir'd, <lb n="140"/>
            The helping hand of Sthenelus requir'd ; <lb/>
            Swift from his seat he leap'd upon the ground, <lb/>
            And tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound; <lb/>
            When thus the king his guardian power addressed, <lb/>
            The purple current wandering o'er his vest: <lb n="145"/>
            </p>
          <p>‘ 0 progeny of Jove ! unconquer'd maid ! <lb/>
            ‘ If e'er my godlike sire deserved thy aid, <lb/>

            Heaps fall on heaps ; he bathes with blood the ground, <lb n="180"/>

            Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies ; <lb/>
            A sudden cloud comes swimming o'er his eyes. <lb/>
            There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway'd, <lb/>
            Oppress’d had sunk to death's eternal shade ; <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love <lb n="385"/>
            She bore Anchises in th' Idæan grove, <lb/>
            His danger views with anguish and despair, <lb/>
            And guards her offspring with a mother's care. <lb/>
            About her much-lov'd son her arms she throws, <lb/>
            Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows <lb n="390"/>
            Screened from the foe behind her shining veil, <lb/>
            The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail: <lb/>
            Safe through the rushing horse, and feather’d flight <lb/>
            Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.</p>
          <p>Nor Sthenelus, with unassisting hands, <lb n="395"/>
            Remain'd unheedful of his lord's commands : <lb/>
            His panting steeds, removed from out the war, <lb/>
            He fix'd with straiten'd traces to the car. <lb/>
            Next, rushing to the Dardan spoil, detains <lb/>
            The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes : <lb n="400"/>
            These, in proud triumph to the fleet convey'd, <lb/>
            No longer now a Trojan lord obey'd. <lb/>
            That charge to bold Deipylus he gave, <lb/>
            (Whom most he lov'd, as brave men love the brave,) <lb/>
            Then. mounting on his car, resum'd the rein, <lb n="405"/>
            And follow'd where Tydides swept the plain.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile (his conquest ravish'd from his eyes) <lb/>
            The raging chief in chase of Venus flies: <lb/>
            No goddess she commission'd to the field, <lb/>
            Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield, <lb n="410"/>
            Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall, <lb/>
            While flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall; <lb/>
            He knew soft combats suit the tender dame, <lb/>
            New to the field, and still a foe to fame. <lb/>
            Thro' breaking ranks his furious course he bends, <lb n="415"/>
            And at the goddess his broad lance extends; <lb/>
            Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove, <lb/>
            Th' ambrosial veil, which all the Graces wove: <lb/>
            Her snowy hand the razing steel profaned, <lb/>
            And the transparent skin with crimson stain'd. <lb n="420"/>
            From the clear vein a stream immortal flow'd, <lb/>
            Such stream as issues from a wounded god; <lb/>
            Pure emanation ! uncorrupted flood; <lb/>
            Unlike our gross, diseas’d, terrestrial blood: <lb/>
            (For not the bread of man their life sustains, <lb n="425"/>
            Nor wine's inflaming juice supplies their veins.) <lb/>
            With tender shrieks the goddess fill'd the place, <lb/>
            And dropp'd her offspring from her weak embrace. <lb/>
            Him Phœbus took : he casts a cloud around <lb/>

          <p>Tydides thus. The goddess, seiz'd with dread, <lb/>
            Confus'd, distracted, from the conflict fled. <lb n="440"/>
            To aid her, swift the winged Iris flew, <lb/>
            Wrapt in a mist above the warring crew. <lb/>
            The queen of love with faded charms she found, <lb/>
            Pale was her cheek, and livid look'd the wound. <lb/>
            To Mars, who Fiat remote, they bent their way; <lb n="445"/>
            Far on the left, with clouds involv'd he lay; <lb/>
            Beside him stood his lance, distain'd with gore, <lb/>
            And, rein'd with gold, his foaming steeds before: <lb/>
            Low at his knee, she begg'd, with streaming eyes, <lb/>
            Her brother's car, to mount the distant skies, <lb n="450"/>
            And shew'd the wound by fierce Tydides given, <lb/>
            A mortal man, who dares encounter heaven. <lb/>
            Stern Mars attentive'hears the queen complain, <lb/>
            And to her hand commits the golden rein: <lb/>
            She mounts the seat, oppress'a with silent woe, <lb n="455"/>
            Driven by the goddess of the painted bow. <lb/>
            The lash resounds, the rapid chariot flies, <lb/>
            And in a moment scales the lofty skies. <lb/>
            There stopp'd the car, and there the coursers stood, <lb/>
            Fed by fair Iris with ambrosial food. <lb n="460"/>
            Before her mother, Love's bright queen appears, <lb/>

            And fearless dar'd the threat'ning god of day; <lb/>
            Already in his hopes he saw him kill'd, <lb/>
            Though screen'd behind Apollo's mighty shield. <lb/>
            Thrice, rushing furious, at the chief he struck; <lb/>
            His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook: <lb n="530"/>
            He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud, <lb/>
            A more than mortal voice was heard aloud:</p>
          <p>‘0 son of Tydeus, cease ! be wise, and see <lb/>
            ‘How vast the difference of the gods and thee ; <lb/>
            ‘Distance immense ! between the powers that shine <lb n="535"/>

            ‘A short liv'd reptile in the dust of earth.'</p>
          <p>So spoke the god who darts celestial fires ; <lb/>
            He dreads his fury, and some steps retires. <lb n="540"/>
            Then Phœbus bore the chief of Venus' race <lb/>
            To Troy's high fane, and to his holy place; <lb/>
            Latona there and Phœbe heal'd the wound; <lb/>
            With vigour arm'd him, and with glory crown'd <lb/>

            A phantom rais d, the same in shape and show <lb/>

            ‘Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer, <lb/>
            ‘And long to meet this mighty man ye fear ; <lb n="590"/>
            ‘While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave <lb/>

            Soon as from fight the blue-ey'd maid retires, <lb n="625"/>
            Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires. <lb/>
            And now the god, from forth his sacred fane, <lb/>

            A live, unharm'd, with all his peers around, <lb/>

            Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day <lb/>
            No pause of words admits, no dull delay ; <lb/>
            Fierce discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims, <lb/>
            Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field's in flames.</p>

            Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound ; <lb n="715"/>
            He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground: <lb/>
            Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there <lb/>

            Where Hector march'd, the god of battles shin'd, <lb n="730"/>

          <p>Tydides paus'd amidst his full career; <lb/>
            Then first the hero's manly breast knew fear. <lb/>
            As when some simple swain his cot forsakes, <lb/>

            Confus'd he stops, a length of country past, <lb/>
            Eyes the rough waves, and, tir'd, returns at last: <lb/>
            Amaz'd no less the great Tydides stands ; <lb n="740"/>
            He stay'd, and, turning, thus address'd his bands:</p>

            ‘Retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow; <lb/>

          <p>Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew; <lb n="750"/>
            And first, two leaders valiant Hector slew : <lb/>
            His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found, <lb/>
            In every art of glorious war renown'd: <lb/>
            In the same car the chiefs to combat ride, <lb/>
            And fought united, and united died. <lb n="755"/>
            Struck at the sight, the mighty Ajax glows <lb/>
            With thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes. <lb/>
            His massy spear, with matchless fury sent, <lb/>
            Through Amphius' belt and heaving belly went: <lb/>
            Amphius Apæsus'7 happy soil possess'd, <lb n="760"/>
            With herds abounding, and with treasure bless'd; <lb/>
            But fate resistless from his country led <lb/>
            The chief, to perish at his people’s head. <lb/>
            Shook with his fall, his brazen armour rung, <lb/>
            And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung ; <lb n="765"/>
            Around his head an iron tempest ram'd; <lb/>
            A wood of spears his ample shield sustain'd; <lb/>
            Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press'd, <lb/>
            And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast: <lb/>
            He could no more; the showering darts denied <lb n="770"/>
            To spoil his glittering arms, and plum pride. <lb/>
            Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields, <lb/>
            With bristling lances, and compacted shields ; <lb/>
            Till, in the steely circle straiten'd round, <lb/>
            Forc'd he gives way, and sternly quits the ground. <lb n="775"/>

          <p>Swift at the scourge th' ethereal coursers fly, <lb/>

            Heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers, <lb/>
            Heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours ; <lb/>
            Commission'd in alternate watch they stand, <lb n="930"/>

            O'er all the gods, superior and alone. <lb/>
            There with her snowy hand the queen restrains <lb n="940"/>
            The fiery steeds, and thus to Jove complains:</p>
          <p>‘ 0 sire ! can no resentment touch thy soul P <lb/>

          <p>The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the chief <lb/>
            augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to <lb/>
            appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the <lb/>
            temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. <lb/>
            The battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed <lb/>
            have an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the friendship and hospitality past between their ancestors, they <lb/>
            make exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of <lb/>
            Helenus, prevailed upon Paris to return to the battle, and taken a tender <lb/>
            leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.</p>
          <p>The scene is first in the field of battle, between the river Simoïs and <lb/>

          <p>Now heaven forsakes the fight; th' immortals yield <lb/>

            Each noble matron, and illustrious dame. <lb/>
            The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went, <lb/>
            Where treasur’d odours breath'd a costly scent. <lb/>
            There lay the vestures of no vulgar art, <lb n="360"/>
            Sidonian maids embroidered every part, <lb/>
            Whom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore, <lb/>
            With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore. <lb/>
            Here as the queen revolv'd with careful eyes <lb/>
            The various textures and the various dyes, <lb n="365"/>
            She chose a veil that shone superior far, <lb/>
            And glow'd refulgent as the morning star. <lb/>
            Herself with this the long procession leads; <lb/>
            The train majestically slow proceeds. <lb/>
            Soon as to Ilion’s topmost tower they come, <lb n="370"/>
            And awful reach the high Palladian dome, <lb/>
            Antenor's consort, fair Theano, waits <lb/>
            As Pallas' priestess, and unbars the gates. <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            With hands uplifted, and imploring eyes, <lb/>
            They fill the dome with supplicating cries. <lb n="375"/>
            The priestess then the shining veil displays, <lb/>
            Placed on Minerva's knees, and thus she prays :</p>
          <p>‘ Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid, <lb/>
            ‘ Troy's strong defence, unconquer'd Pallas, aid ! <lb/>
            ‘ Break thou Tydides' spear, and let him fall <lb n="380"/>
            ' Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall. <lb/>
            ‘ So twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke, <lb/>
            Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke. <lb/>
            ' But thou, aton'd by penitence and prayer, <lb/>
            ' Ourselves, our infants, and our city spare !' <lb n="385"/>
            So prayed the priestess in her holy fane ; <lb/>
            So vow'd the matrons, but they vow'd in vain.</p>
          <p>While these appear before the power with prayers, <lb/>
            Hector to Paris' lofty dome repairs. <lb/>
            Himself the mansion rais'd, from every part <lb n="390"/>
            Assembling architects of matchless art. <lb/>
            Near Priam's court and Hector's palace stands <lb/>
            The pompous structure, and the town commands. <lb/>
            A spear the hero bore of wondrous strength, <lb/>
            Of full ten cubits was the lance's length ; <lb n="395"/>
            The steely point with golden ringlets join'd, <lb/>
            Before him orandish’d, at each motion shin'd. <lb/>
            Thus entering, in the glittering rooms he found <lb/>
            His brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round, <lb/>
            His eyes delighting with their splendid show, <lb n="400"/>
            Bright'ning the shield, and polishing the bow. <lb/>
            Beside him Helen with her virgins stands, <lb/>
            Guides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.</p>
          <p>Him thus inactive, with an ardent look <lb/>
            The prince beheld, and high resenting spoke: <lb n="405"/>

            With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair, <lb/>

          <p>Thus having spoke, th' illustrious chief of Troy <lb/>
            Streteh'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy. <note type="footnote"> 13 A fountain in Messenia. </note> <lb n="595"/>

            The babe clung crying to his nurse'is breast, <lb/>
            Scar'd at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest. <lb/>
            With secret pleasure each fond parent smil'd, <lb/>
            And Hector hasted to relieve his child; <lb/>
            The glittering terrors from his brows unbound, <lb n="600"/>
            And placed the beaming helmet on the ground. <lb/>
            Then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air, <lb/>
            Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:</p>
          <p>' 0 thou! whose glory fills th' ethereal throne, <lb/>
            And all ye deathless powers! protect my son! <lb n="605"/>
            Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown, <lb/>
            To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown, <lb/>
            ' Against his country's foes the war to wage, <lb/>
            ' And rise the Hector of the future age ! <lb/>
            ' So when, triumphant from successful toils, <lb n="610"/>
            ' Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils, <lb/>
            'Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim, <lb/>
            ' And say, This chief transcends his father's fame: <lb/>
            ' While pleas'd, amidst the general shouts of Troy, <lb/>
            ' His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy.' <lb n="615"/>
            </p>
          <p>He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms <lb/>
            Restor'd the pleasing burden to her arms ; <lb/>
            Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid, <lb/>
            Hushed to repose, and with a smile survey'd. <lb/>
            The troubled pleasure soon chastis'd by fear, <lb n="620"/>
            She mingled with the smile a tender tear. <lb/>
            The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd, <lb/>
            And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:</p>
          <p>' Andromache! my soul's far better part, <lb/>
            ' Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart P <lb n="625"/>
            ' No hostile hand can antedate my doom, <lb/>
            ' Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb. <lb/>
            'Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth, <lb/>
            And such the hard condition of our birth. <lb/>
            ' No force can then resist, no flight can save; <lb n="630"/>
            ' All sink alike, the fearful and the brave. <lb/>
            No more-but hasten to thy tasks at home, <lb/>
            ' There guide the spindle, and direct the loom: <lb/>
            ' Me glory summons to the martial scene, <lb/>
            ' The field of combat is the sphere for men. <lb n="635"/>
            'Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim, <lb/>
            ' The first in danger as the first in fame.'</p>
          <p>Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes <lb/>
            His towery helmet, black with shading plumes. <lb/>
            His princess parts with a prophetic sigh, <lb n="640"/>
            Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye, <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            That stream'd at every look: then, moving slow, <lb/>
            Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe. <lb/>
            There, while her tears deplored the godlike man, <lb/>
            Through all her train the soft infection ran; <lb n="645"/>
            The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed, <lb/>
            And mourn the living Hector as the dead.</p>
          <p>But now, no longer deaf to honour's call, <lb/>
            Forth issues Paris from the palace wall. <lb/>
            In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray, <lb n="650"/>
            Swift through the town the warrior bends his way. <lb/>
            The wanton courser thus, with reins unbound, <lb/>
            Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground ; <lb/>
            Pamper'd and proud he seeks the wonted tides, <lb/>
            And laves, in height of blood, his shining sides : <lb n="655"/>
            His head now freed he tosses to the skies; <lb/>
            His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies ; <lb/>
            He snuffs the females in the distant plain, <lb/>
            And springs, exulting, to his fields again. <lb/>
            With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay, <lb n="660"/>
            In arms refulgent as the god of day, <lb/>
            The son of Priam, glorying in his might, <lb/>
            Rush'd forth with Hector to the fields of fight.</p>
          <p>And now the warriors passing on the way, <lb/>
            The graceful Paris first excused his stay. <lb n="665"/>
            To whom the noble Hector thus replied: <lb/>
            ' 0 chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied! <lb/>
            ' Thy power in war with justice none contest; <lb/>
            ' Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess'd. <lb/>
            'What pity, sloth should seize a soul so brave, <lb n="670"/>
            ‘ Or godlike Paris live a woman's slave ! <lb/>
            ' My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say, <lb/>
            ' And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector, Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her descend <lb/>
            from Olympus, joins her near the Scæan gate. They agree to put off the <lb/>
            general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge the <lb/>
            Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the challenge, <lb/>
            the lot is cast, and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after several attacks, <lb/>
            are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a council, Antenor pro­ <lb/>
            poses the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which Paris will not con­ <lb/>
            sent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam sends a herald to <lb/>
            make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning the dead, the last of <lb/>
            which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the funerals arc per­ <lb/>
            formed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor, erect a fortification <lb/>
            to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with towers, and defended by a <lb/>
            ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his jealousy at this work, but is <lb/>
            pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both armies pass the night in <lb/>
            feasting, but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans with thundei and other <lb/>
            signs of his wrath.</p>
          <p>The three-and-twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax; the <lb/>
            next day the truce is agreed: another is taken up in the funeral rites of <lb/>
            the slain; and one more in building the fortification before the ships; <lb/>
            so that somewhat above three days is employed in this book. The scene <lb/>
            lies wholly in the field.</p>
          <p>So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state, <lb/>
            Then rush'd impetuous through the Scæan gate. <lb/>
            Him Paris follow'd to the dire alarms; <lb/>
            Both breathing slaughter, both resolv'd in arms. <lb/>
            As when to sailors labouring through the main, <lb n="5"/>
            That long had heav'd the weary oar in vain, <lb/>
            Jove bids at length th' expected gales arise; <lb/>
            The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies : <lb/>
            So welcome these to Troy's desiring train: <lb/>
            The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again. <lb n="10"/>
            </p>
          <p>Bold Paris first the work of death begun <lb/>
            On great Menestheus, Areithous' son; <lb/>
            Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace, <lb/>
            The pleasing Arnè was his native place. <lb/>
            Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below; <lb n="15"/>
            Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow <lb/>
            Full on his neck, from Hector's weighty hand; <lb/>
            And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land. <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphinous bleeds, <lb/>
            Fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds ; <lb n="20"/>
            Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound <lb/>
            Drop the cold useless members on the ground.</p>
          <p>When now Minerva saw her Argives slain, <lb/>
            From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain <lb/>
            Fierce she descends: Apollo mark'a her flight, <lb n="25"/>
            Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height: <lb/>
            Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade ; <lb/>
            When thus Apollo to the blue ey'd maid :</p>
          <p>' What cause, 0 daughter of almighty Jove! <lb/>
            ' Thus wings thy progress from the realms above ? <lb n="30"/>
            ' Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way, <lb/>
            ' To give to Greece the long-divided day ? <lb/>
            ‘ Too much has Troy already felt thy hate, <lb/>
            ' Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate: <lb/>
            ' This day the business of the field suspend; <lb n="35"/>
            ' War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend; <lb/>
            ' Since vengeful goddesses confederate join <lb/>
            ‘ To raze her walls, though built by hands divine.'</p>
          <p>To whom the progeny of Jove replies : <lb/>
            ' I left for this the council of the skies : <lb n="40"/>
            ' But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear, <lb/>
            What art shall calm the furious sons of war ?'</p>
          <p>To her the god: ' Great Hector's soul incite <lb/>
            'To dare the boldest Greek to single fight, <lb/>
            'Till Greece, provok'd, from all her numbers shew <lb n="45"/>
            'A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe.'</p>
          <p>At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew ; <lb/>
            Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew : <lb/>
            Hector inspired he sought: to him address'd, <lb/>
            Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast: <lb n="50"/>
            ' 0 son of Priam! let thy faithful ear <lb/>
            ' Receive my words; thy friend and brother hear ! <lb/>
            Go forth persuasive, and awhile engage <lb/>
            The warring nations to suspend their rage ; <lb/>
            ' Then dare the boldest of the hostile train <lb n="55"/>
            To mortal combat on the listed plain, <lb/>
            ' For not this day shall end thy glorious date ; <lb/>
            ' The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.'</p>
          <p>He said: the warrior heard the word with joy; <lb/>
            Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy, <lb n="60"/>
            Held by the midst athwart. On either hand <lb/>
            The squadrons part; th' expecting Trojans stand. <lb/>
            Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear; <lb/>
            They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war. <pb n="127"/>
             <note type="margin">B. VII.]</note> <lb/>
            Th' Athenian maid, and glorious god of day, <lb n="65"/>
            With silent joy the settling hosts survey: <lb/>
            In form of vultures, on the beech's height <lb/>
            They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.</p>
          <p>The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields, <lb/>
            Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields. <lb n="70"/>
            As when a general darkness veils the main, <lb/>
            (Soft Zephyr curling the wide watery plain,) <lb/>
            The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps, <lb/>
            And a still horror saddens all the deeps : <lb/>
            Thus in thick orders settling wide around. <lb n="75"/>
            At length composed they sit, and shade the ground. <lb/>
            Great Hector first amidst both armies broke <lb/>
            The solemn snence, and their powers bespoke:</p>
          <p>Hear all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands, <lb/>
            ' What my soul prompts, and what some god commands. <lb n="80"/>
            Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose, <lb/>
            ' O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes ; <lb/>
            ' War with a fiercer tide once more returns, <lb/>
            ' Till Dion falls, or till yon navy burns. <lb/>
            'You then, 0 princes of the Greeks ! appear; <lb n="85"/>
            ' 'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear: <lb/>
            ' From all your troops select the boldest knight, <lb/>
            'And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight. <lb/>
            ' Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain, <lb/>
            ' Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain; <lb n="90"/>
            ' But let my body, to my friends return'd, <lb/>
            'By Trojan hands, and Trojan flames be burn'd. <lb/>
            ' And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust, <lb/>
            ' Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust; <lb/>
            ' If mine the glory to despoil the foe; <lb n="95"/>

            ' Thus shall he say, A valiant Greek lies there, <lb/>
            ' By Hector slain, the mighty man of war. <lb/>
            ' The stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name, <lb/>

          <p>This fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard, <lb n="105"/>
            Blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd. <lb/>
            Stern Menelaus first the silence broke, <lb/>
            And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:</p>
          <p>' Women of Greece! Oh scandal of your race, <lb/>
            ' Whose coward souls your manly forms disgrace, <lb n="110"/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            ' How great the shame, when every age shall know <lb/>
            ' That not a Grecian met this noble foe ! <lb/>
            'Go then, resolve to earth from whence ye grew, <lb/>
            ' A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew ! <lb/>

            ' Myself will dare the danger of the day. <lb/>
            ' 'Tis man's bold task the generous strife to try, <lb/>
            ' But in the hands of God is victory.'</p>
          <p>These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd, <lb/>
            His manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd: <lb n="120"/>
            That day, Atrides! a superior hand <lb/>
            Had stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand; <lb/>
            But all at once, thy fury to compose, <lb/>
            The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose : <lb/>
            E'en he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd <lb n="125"/>
            Thy daring hand, and this advice address'd : <lb/>
            'Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run, <lb/>
            ' And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun ? <lb/>
            ' Griev'd though thou art, forbear the rash design; <lb/>

          <p>He said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind; <lb/>
            He stoop'd to reason, and his rage resigned, <lb n="140"/>

          <p>He, from whose lips divine persuasion flows, <lb/>
            Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose. <lb/>
            Thus to the kings he spoke : ' What grief, what shame, <lb n="145"/>

          <p>The lots produc'd, each hero signs his own ; <lb/>
            Then in the general's helm the fates are thrown. <lb/>
            The people pray with lifted eyes and hands, <lb/>
            And vows like these ascend from all the bands: <lb/>
            ' Grant thou, Almighty ! in whose hand is fate, <lb n="215"/>
            ' A worthy champion for the Grecian state. <lb/>
            ' This task let Ajax or Tydides prove, <lb/>

          <p>Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspir'd, <lb/>
            Leap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desir'd. <lb n="220"/>
            This from the right to left the herald bears, <lb/>
            Held out in order to the Grecian peers ; <lb/>
            Each to his rival yields the mark unknown, <lb/>
            Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own ; <lb/>
            Surveys th' inscription with rejoicing eyes, <lb n="225"/>
            Then casts before him, and with transport cries:</p>
          <p>' Warriors ! I claim the lot, and arm with joy; <lb/>
            ' Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy. <lb/>
            'Now, while my brightest arms my limbs invest, <lb/>
            ' To Saturn's son be all your vows address'd : <lb n="230"/>
            ' But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear, <lb/>

            ' Said I in secret P No, your vows declare, <lb/>
            ' In such a voice as fills the earth and air. <lb/>
            ' Lives there a chief, whom Ajax ought to dread, <lb n="235"/>
            ' Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred ? <lb/>
            ‘ From warlike Salamis I drew my birth, <lb/>
            ' And, born to combats, fear no force of earth.</p>
          <p>He said. The troops with elevated eyes, <lb/>

            ' 0 father of mankind, superior lord! <lb/>

            ' Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away <lb n="245"/>
            The praise and conquest of this doubtful day ; <lb/>
            'Or if illustrious Hector be thy care, <lb/>
            'That both may claim it, and that both may share.' <pb n="131"/>
             <note type="margin">B. VII.]</note> <lb/>
            Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on ; <lb/>
            Sheath'd in bright steel the giant warrior shone: <lb n="250"/>
            He moves to combat with majestic pace ; <lb/>
            So stalks in arms the grizly god of Thrace, <lb/>
            When Jove to punish faithless men prepares, <lb/>
            And gives whole nations to the waste of wars. <lb/>
            Thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god; <lb n="255"/>
            Grimly he smil'd : earth trembled as he strode : <lb/>
            His massy javelin quivering in his hand, <lb/>
            He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band. <lb/>
            Through every Argive heart new transport ran ; <lb/>
            All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man. <lb n="260"/>
            E'en Hector paus'd; and, with new doubt oppress'd, <lb/>
            Felt his great heart suspended in his breast: <lb/>
            'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear; <lb/>
            Himself had challeng'd, and the foe drew near.</p>
          <p>Stem Telamon behind his ample shield, <lb n="265"/>
            As from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field. <lb/>
            Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast <lb/>
            Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last. <lb/>
            (The work of Tychius, who in Hylé dwell'd, <lb/>
            And all in arts of armoury excell'd.) <lb n="270"/>
            This Ajax bore before his manly breast, <lb/>
            And, threatening, thus his adverse chief addressed:</p>
          <p>' Hector! approach my arm, and singly know <lb/>
            ' What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe. <lb/>
            Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are <lb n="275"/>
            ' Not void of soul, and not unskill'd in war : <lb/>
            'Let him, inactive on the sea-beat shore, <lb/>
            ' Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more; <lb/>
            ' Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast. <lb/>
            ' And sends thee one, a sample of her host. <lb n="280"/>
            ' Such as I am, I come to prove thy might; <lb/>
            ' No morebe sudden, and begin the fight.'</p>
          <p>' O son of Telamon, thy country's pride !' <lb/>
            (To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied,) <lb/>
            ' Me, as a boy or woman, would'st thou fright, <lb n="285"/>
            ' New to the field, and trembling at the fight P <lb/>
            ' Thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms, <lb/>
            ' To combat born, and bred amidst alarms: <lb/>
            ' I know to shift my ground, remount the car, <lb/>
            ' Turn, charge, and answer every call of war: <lb n="290"/>
            ' To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield, <lb/>
            ' And bear thick battle on my sounding shield <lb/>
            ' But open be our fight, and bold each blow; <lb/>
            ' I steal no conquest from a noble foe.'</p><pb n="132"/>
            
          <p>He said, and, rising high above the field, <lb n="295"/>
            Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield. <lb/>
            Full on the brass descending from above <lb/>
            Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove, <lb/>
            Till in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw ; <lb/>
            Through Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew; <lb n="300"/>
            His corslet enters, and his garment rends, <lb/>
            And, glancing downwards, near his flank descends. <lb/>
            The wary Trojan shrinks, and, bending low <lb/>
            Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow. <lb/>
            From their bor'd shields the chiefs their javelins drew, <lb n="305"/>
            Then close impetuous, and the charge renew: <lb/>
            Fierce as the mountain lions bathed in blood, <lb/>
            Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood. <lb/>
            At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends; <lb/>
            The blunted point against the buckler bends. <lb n="310"/>
            But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near, <lb/>
            Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear ; <lb/>
            It reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd ; <lb/>
            Spouts the black gore, and dims the shining shield. <lb/>
            Yet ceas'd not Hector thus; but, stooping down, <lb n="315"/>
            In his strong hand upheav'd a flinty stone, <lb/>
            Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends; <lb/>
            Full on the brazen boss the stone descends ; <lb/>
            The hollow brass resounded with the shock. <lb/>
            Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock, <lb n="320"/>
            Applied each nerve, and, swinging round on high, <lb/>
            With force tempestuous let the ruin fly : <lb/>
            The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke; <lb/>
            His slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke; <lb/>
            Great Hector falls extended on the field, <lb n="325"/>
            His bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield : <lb/>
            Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might <lb/>
            Confirmed his sinews, and restored to fight. <lb/>
            And now both heroes their broad faulchions drew; <lb/>
            In flaming circles round their heads they flew; <lb n="330"/>
            But then by heralds' voice the word was given, <lb/>
            The sacred ministers of earth and heaven : <lb/>
            Divine Talthybius whom the Greeks employ, <lb/>
            And sage Idæus on the part of Troy, <lb/>
            Between the swords their peaceful sceptres reared ; <lb n="335"/>
            And first Idaeus' awful voice was heard:</p>
          <p>' Forbear, my sons ! your farther force to prove, <lb/>
            ' Both dear to men, and both belov'd of Jove. <lb/>

            ' The goddess parts you: be the night obey'd.'</p>

            ' Let him, who first provoke our chiefs to fight, <lb n="345"/>

            ' With strength of body, and with worth of mind! <lb/>

            ' Since then the night extends her gloomy shade, <lb/>
            ' And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd. <lb/>
            ' Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends, <lb/>
            ' And joy the nations whom thy arm defends; <lb/>

            The baldrick studded, and the sheath enchas'd, <lb/>
            He gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow'd <lb/>
            A radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd. <lb/>

          <p>But Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed, <lb/>

            A steer for sacrifice the king design'd, <lb n="380"/>

            A senate void of order, as of choice, <lb/>
            Their hearts were fearful, and confus'd their voice. <lb/>
            Antenor rising, thus demands their ear: <lb/>
            ' Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear! <lb/>
            ' 'Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires, <lb n="420"/>
            ' And I but move what every god requires: <lb/>
            ' Let Sparta's treasures be this hour restor'd, <lb/>
            ' And Argive Helen own her ancient lord. <lb/>
            ' The ties of faith, the sworn alliance broke, <lb/>
            ' Our impious battles the just gods provoke. <lb n="425"/>
            , As this advice ye practise, or reject, <lb/>
            ' So hope success, or dread the dire effect.'</p>
          <p>The senior spoke, and sat. To whom replied <lb/>
            The graceful husband of the Spartan bride: <lb/>
            ' Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years, <lb n="430"/>
            ' But sound ungrateful in a warrior's ears: <lb/>
            ‘ Old man, if void of fallacy or art <lb/>
            ' Thy words express the purpose of thy heart, <pb n="135"/>
             <note type="margin">B. VII.]</note> <lb/>
            ' Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given; <lb/>
            ' But wisdom has its date, assign'd by heaven. <lb n="435"/>
            ' Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name ! <lb/>
            ' Their treasures I'll restore, but not the dame ; <lb/>
            ' My treasures, too, for peace I will resign ; <lb/>
            ' But be this bright possession ever mine.'</p>
          <p>'Twas then, the growing discord to compose, <lb n="440"/>
            Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose : <lb/>
            His godlike aspect deep attention drew : <lb/>
            He paus'd, and these pacific words ensue :</p>
          <p>' Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands ! <lb/>
            ' Now take refreshment as the hour demands ; <lb n="445"/>
            ' Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night, <lb/>
            ' Till the new sun restores the cheerful light: <lb/>
            ' Then shall our herald, to th' Atrides sent, <lb/>
            ' Before their ships proclaim my son's intent. <lb/>
            ' Next let a truce be ask'd, that Troy may burn <lb n="450"/>
            ' Her slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn ; <lb/>
            ' That done, once more the fate of war be tried, <lb/>
            ' And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide !'</p>
          <p>The monarch spoke : the warriors snatch'd with haste <lb/>
            (Each at his post in arms) a short repast. <lb n="455"/>
            Soon as the rosy morn had wak'd the day, <lb/>
            To the black ships Idæus bent his way ; <lb/>
            There, to the sons of Mars, in council found, <lb/>
            He rais'd his voice: the hosts stood listening round:</p>
          <p>' Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give car! <lb n="460"/>
            ' The words of Troy, and Troy's great monarch, hear. <lb/>
            ' Pleas'd may ye hear (so heav'n succeed my prayers !) <lb/>
            ' What Paris, author of the war, declares. <lb/>
            ' The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore <lb/>
            ' (0 had he perish'd ere they touch'd our shore!) <lb n="465"/>
            ' He proffers injur'd Greece; with large increase <lb/>
            ' Of added Trojan wealth, to buy the peace. <lb/>
            ' But, to restore the beauteous bride again, <lb/>
            ' This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain. <lb/>
            ' Next, 0 ye chiefs ! we ask a truce to burn <lb n="470"/>
            ' Our slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn. <lb/>
            ' That done, once more the fate of war be tried, <lb/>
            ' And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide !'</p>
          <p>The Greeks give ear, but none the silence broke <lb/>
            At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke : <lb n="475"/>
            ' 0 take not, friends ! defrauded of your fame, <lb/>
            ' Their proffer'd wealth, nor e'en the Spartan dame. <lb/>
            ' Let conquest make them ours : fate shakes their wall, <lb/>
            ' And Troy already totters to her fall.'</p><pb n="136"/>
            
          <p>Th' admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name, <lb n="480"/>
            With general shouts return'd him loud acclaim. <lb/>
            Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace : <lb/>
            ' Herald! in him thou hear'st the voice of Greece. <lb/>
            ' For what remains, let funeral flames be fed <lb/>
            ' With heroes' corps: I war not with the dead : <lb n="485"/>
            ' Go, search your slaughter'd chiefs on yonder plain, <lb/>
            ' And gratify the manes of the slain. <lb/>
            ' Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!' <lb/>
            He said, and rear'd his sceptre to the sky.</p>
          <p>To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay <lb n="490"/>
            To wait th' event, the herald bent his way. <lb/>
            He came, and, standing in the midst, explain'd <lb/>
            The peace rejected, but the truce obtain d. <lb/>
            Straight to their several cares the Trojans move ; <lb/>
            Some search the plain, some fell the sounding grove: <lb n="495"/>
            Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore, <lb/>
            Hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore. <lb/>
            And now from forth the chambers of the main, <lb/>
            To shed his sacred light on earth again, <lb/>
            Arose the golden chariot of the day, <lb n="500"/>
            And tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray. <lb/>
            In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train <lb/>
            Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain. <lb/>
            Scarce could the friend his slaughtered friend explore, <lb/>
            With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore. <lb n="505"/>
            The wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed, <lb/>
            And, laid along their cars, deplor'd the dead. <lb/>
            Sage Priam check'd their grief: with silent haste <lb/>
            The bodies decent on the piles were placed: <lb/>
            With melting hearts the cold remains they bum'd; <lb n="510"/>
            And sadly slow to sacred Troy return'd. <lb/>
            Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed, <lb/>
            And decent on the pile dispose the dead; <lb/>
            The cold remains consume with equal care ; <lb/>
            And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair. <lb n="515"/>
            Now, ere the morn had streak'd with redd'ning light <lb/>
            The doubtful confines of the day and night; <lb/>
            About the dying flames the Greeks appeared, <lb/>
            And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd. <lb/>
            Then, to secure the camp and naval powers, <lb n="520"/>
            They rais'd embattl'd walls with lofty towers : <lb/>
            From space to space were ample gates around, <lb/>
            For passing chariots ; and a trench profound, <lb/>
            Of large extent: and deep in earth below <lb/>
            Strong piles infix'd stood adverse to the foe. <lb n="525"/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">B. VII.]</note> So toil'd the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above, <lb/>
            In shining circle round their father Jove, <lb/>
            Amaz'd beheld the wondrous works of man: <lb/>
            Then lie whose trident shakes the earth began:</p>
          <p>' What mortals henceforth shall our power adore, <lb n="530"/>
            ' Our fanes frequent, our oracles implore, <lb/>
            ' If the proud Grecians thus successful boast <lb/>
            ' Their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast P <lb/>
            ' See the long walls extending to the main, <lb/>
            ' No god consulted, and no victim slain ! <lb n="535"/>
            ' Their fame shall fill the world's remotest ends; <lb/>
            ' Wide as the mom her golden beam extends. <lb/>
            ' While old Laömedon's divine abodes, <lb/>
            ' Those radiant structures rais'd by labouring gods, <lb/>
            ' Shall, raz'd and lost, in long oblivion sleep. <lb n="540"/>
            Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.</p>
          <p>Th' almighty Thunderer with a frown replies, <lb/>
            That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies: <lb/>
            ' Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make <lb/>
            ' The solid earth's eternal basis shake! <lb n="545"/>
            ' What cause of fear from mortal works could move <lb/>
            ' The meanest subject of our realms above P <lb/>
            ' Where'er the sun's refulgent rays are cast, <lb/>
            ' Thy power is honour'd, and thy fame shall last. <lb/>
            ' But yon proud work no future age shall view, <lb n="550"/>
            ' No trace remain where once the glory grew. <lb/>
            ' The sapp'd foundations by thy force shall fall, <lb/>
            ' And, whelm'd beneath thy waves, drop the huge wail : <lb/>
            ' Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore; <lb/>
            ' The ruin vanish'd, and the name no more.' <lb n="555"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus they in heaven: while o'er the Grecian train <lb/>
            The rolling sun descending to the main <lb/>
            Beheld the finished work. Their bulls they slew; <lb/>
            Black from the tents the savoury vapours flew. <lb/>
            And now the fleet, arriv'd from Lemnos' strands, <lb n="560"/>
            With Bacchus' blessings cheer'd the generous bands. <lb/>
            Of fragrant wines the rich Eunæus1 sent <lb/>
            A thousand measures to the royal tent: <lb/>
            (Eunæus, whom Hypsipyle of yore <lb/>
            To Jason, shepherd of his people, bore). <lb n="565"/>
            The rest they purchas'd at their proper cost, <lb/>
            And well the plenteous freight supplied the host: <lb/>
            Each, in exchange, proportion'd treasures gave : <lb/>

            But Jove averse the signs of wrath display'd, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the <lb/>
            pains of Tartarus, if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of <lb/>
            him that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels. The armies join <lb/>
            battle ; Jupiter on mount Ida weighs in his balances the fates of both, <lb/>
            and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings. Nestor alone <lb/>
            continues in the field in great danger; Diomed relieves him ; whose ex­ <lb/>
            ploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno endeavours <lb/>
            to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in vain. The <lb/>
            acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and carried off. <lb/>
            Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are restrained by <lb/>
            Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the battle. Hector <lb/>
            continues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to their fortifications be­ <lb/>
            fore the ships,) and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the camp, <lb/>
            to prevent the enemy from reimbarking and escaping by flight. They <lb/>
            kindle fires through all the field, and pass the night under arms.</p>
          <p>The time of seven-and-twenty days is employed from the opening of the <lb/>
            poem to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestial <lb/>
            machines) lies in the field toward the sea-shore.</p>
          <p>AURORA now, fair daughter of the dawn, <lb/>
            Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn: <lb/>
            When Jove conven'd the senate of the skies. <lb/>
            Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise. <lb/>
            The sire of gods his awful silence broke; <lb n="5"/>
            The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:</p>
          <p>' Celestial states, immortal gods! give car, <lb/>

            Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield; <lb/>
            Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven, <lb/>
            Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven: <lb/>
            ' Or far, oh far from steep Olympus thrown, <lb n="15"/>
            ' Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan, <lb/>
            ' With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors, <lb/>
            ' And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors; <lb/>
            As deep beneath tii' infernal centre hurl'd, <lb/>

            ' Let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes ; <lb/>

            ' League all your forces then, ye powers above, <lb/>
            ' Join all, and try th' omnipotence of Jove: <lb/>
            ' Let down our golden everlasting chain, <lb n="25"/>

            ' Ye strive in vain ! if I but stretch this hand, <lb/>

            ' I fix the chain to great Olympus' height, <lb/>
            ' And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight! <lb/>
            ' For such I reign, unbounded and above ; <lb/>
            ' And such are men and gods, compar'd to Jove.'</p>
          <p>Th' Almighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply ; <lb n="35"/>
            A reverent horror silenced all the sky; <lb/>
            Trembling they stood before their sovereign's look; <lb/>
            At length his best belov'd, the power of wisdom, spoke :</p>
          <p>' Oh first and greatest! God, by gods ador'd ! <lb/>
            ' We own thy might, our father and our lord ! <lb n="40"/>
            ' But ah! permit to pity human state: <lb/>
            ' If not to help, at least lament their fate. <lb/>
            ' From fields forbidden we submiss refrain, <lb/>
            ' W ith arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain ; <lb/>
            ' Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move, <lb n="45"/>
            ' Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove.'</p>
          <p>The cloud-compelling god her suit approv'd, <lb/>
            And smiled superior on his best-belov'd. <lb/>
            Then call'd his coursers, and his chariot took ; <lb/>
            The stedfast firmament beneath them shook : <lb n="50"/>
            Rapt by th' ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd; <lb/>
            Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold. <lb/>
            Of heaven's undrossy gold the god's array, <lb/>
            Refulgent, flash'd intolerable day. <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly <lb n="55"/>
            Between th' extended earth and starry sky. <lb/>
            But when to Ida's topmost height he came, <lb/>
            (Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game.) <lb/>
            Where, o'er her pointed summits proudly rais'd, <lb/>
            His fane breath'a odours, and his altar blaz'd: <lb n="60"/>
            There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire <lb/>
            Of gods and men releas'd the steeds of fire: <lb/>
            Blue ambient mists th' immortal steeds embraced; <lb/>
            High on the cloudy point his seat he plac'd; <lb/>
            Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys, <lb n="65"/>
            The town, and tents, and navigable seas.</p>
          <p>Now had the Grecians snatch'd a short repast, <lb/>
            And buckled on their shining arms with haste. <lb/>
            Troy rous'd as soon ; for on this dreadful day <lb/>
            The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay. <lb n="70"/>
            The gates unfolding pour forth all their train ; <lb/>
            Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain: <lb/>
            Men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground <lb/>
            The tumult thickens, and the skies resound. <lb/>
            And now with shouts the shocking armies clos'd, <lb n="75"/>
            To lances lances, shields to shields oppos'd; <lb/>
            Host against host with shadowy legions drew, <lb/>
            The sounding darts in iron tempests flew ; <lb/>
            Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries, <lb/>
            Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise; <lb n="80"/>
            With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed, <lb/>
            And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide. <lb/>
            Long as the morning beams, increasing bright, <lb/>
            O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light, <lb/>
            Commutual death the fate of war confounds, <lb n="85"/>
            Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds. <lb/>
            But when the sun the height of heaven ascends, <lb/>
            The sire of gods his golden scales suspends, <lb/>

            Press'd with its load, the Grecian balance lies <lb/>
            Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies. <lb/>
            Then Jove from Ida's top his horrors spreads ; <lb/>
            The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads ; <lb/>
            Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls; <lb n="95"/>
            Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls. <lb/>
            Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire, <lb/>
            The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire. <lb/>
            Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear, <lb/>

            Nor he, the king of men, th' alarm sustain’d ; <lb/>
            Nestor alone amidst the storm remain'd. <lb/>
            Unwilling he remain'd, for Paris' dart <lb/>
            Had pierc'd his courser in a mortal part; <lb/>
            Fix'd in the forehead where the springing mane <lb n="105"/>
            Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain; <lb/>
            Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear, <lb/>
            Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air. <lb/>
            Scarce had his faulchion cut the reins, and freed <lb/>
            Th' incumbent chariot from the dying steed, <lb n="110"/>
            When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war, <lb/>
            Pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car. <lb/>
            That day had stretched beneath his matchless hand <lb/>
            The hoary monarch of the Pylian band, <lb/>
            But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd <lb n="115"/>
            He rush'd, and on Ulysses call'd aloud :</p>

          <p>His fruitless words are lost unheard in air ; <lb/>
            Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there. <lb/>
            But bold Tydides to the rescue goes, <lb n="125"/>
            A single warrior 'midst a host of foes ; <lb/>
            Before the coursers with a sudden spring <lb/>
            He leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king:</p>

            ‘ The thirsty fury of my flying spear.'</p>
          <p>Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill'd in war, <lb/>

            Hector they face; unknowing how to fear, <lb/>
            Fierce he drove on: Tydides whirl'd his spear. <lb n="150"/>
            The spear with erring haste mistook its way, <lb/>
            But plung'd in Eniopeus' bosom lay. <lb/>
            His opening hand in death forsakes the rein; <lb/>
            The steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain. <lb/>
            Great Hector sorrows for his servant kill'd, <lb n="155"/>

            Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall <lb n="160"/>
            Enclos'd had bled : but Jove with awful sound <lb/>
            Roll’d the big thunder o'er the vast profound: <lb/>
            Full in Tydides' face the lightning flew ; <lb/>

            At Hector's breast, and sings along the skies : <lb/>
            He miss'd the mark ; but pierced Gorgythio's heart <lb/>
            And drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart. <lb/>

            Another shaft the raging archer drew: <lb n="375"/>
            That other shaft with erring fury flew, <lb/>
            (From Hector Phœbus turn'd the flying wound,) <lb/>
            Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground : <lb/>
            Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore, <lb/>

            Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms <lb/>
            The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms. <lb/>
            Hector with grief his charioteer beheld <lb/>

            Then bids Cebriones direct the rein, <lb n="385"/>

            Dreadful lie shouts : from earth a stone lie took, <lb/>

            The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow, <lb/>
            And his numb ’d hand dismiss'd his useless bow. <lb/>
            He fell; but Ajax his broad shield display’d, <lb/>

            Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels ; <lb n="410"/>
            Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew; <lb/>
            Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew. <lb/>
            When, flying, they had pass'd the trench profound, <lb/>
            And many a chief lay gasping on the ground; <lb/>
            Before the ships a desperate stand they made, <lb n="415"/>
            And fir'd the troops, and call'd the gods to aid. <lb/>
            Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came; <lb/>
            His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame <lb/>
            That wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood, <lb/>
            Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god! <lb n="420"/>
            Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey'd; <lb/>

          <p>Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit <lb/>
            the siege, and return to their country. Diomede opposes this, and Nestor <lb/>
            seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard <lb/>
            to be strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures <pb n="155"/>
             <note type="margin">B. IX.]</note> <lb/>
            were to be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, <lb/>
            and Nestor farther prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in <lb/>
            order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice <lb/>
            of, who are accompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very <lb/>
            moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, <lb/>
            who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The ambassadors return <lb/>
            unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake themselves to sleep.</p>
          <p>This book, and the next following, take up the space of oi.e night, which <lb/>
            is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene lies on <lb/>
            the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.</p>
          <p>THUS joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night; <lb/>
            While Fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight, <lb/>
            And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part, <lb/>
            Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart. <lb/>
            As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth, <lb n="5"/>
            A double tempest of the west and north <lb/>
            Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore, <lb/>
            Heaps waves on waves, and bids th' Ægean roar; <lb/>
            This way and that the boiling deeps are tossed; <lb/>
            Such various passions urged the troubled host. <lb n="10"/>
            Great Agamemnon griev d above the rest; <lb/>
            Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast; <lb/>
            Himself his orders to the heralds bears, <lb/>
            To bid to council all the Grecian peers, <lb/>
            But bid in whispers :1 these surround their chief, <lb n="15"/>
            In solemn sadness and majestic grief <lb/>
            The king amidst the mournful circle rose ; <lb/>
            Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows: <lb/>
            So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head, <lb/>
            In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed. <lb n="20"/>
            With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd; <lb/>
            Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:</p>
          <p>‘Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care,2 <lb/>
            ‘Fellows in arms, and princes of the war! <lb/>
            ‘Of partial Jove too justly we complain, <lb n="25"/>
            And heavenly oracles believed in vain. <lb/>
            ‘A safe return was promised to our toils, a <lb/>
            ‘With conquest honour'd, and enrich'd with spoils: <lb/>
            ‘Now shameful flight alone can save the host, <lb/>
            ‘ Our wealth, our people, and our glory, lost. <note type="footnote"> 1Either that the enemy might not bear the summons, or lest his own <lb/>

            alarmed still more. Cowper. 2 See Book ii. ver. 139. 3 Agamemnon <lb/>
            alludes to the extraordinary sign exhibited to them by Jupiter, while they <lb/>
            sacrificed to him at Aulis, and which Calchas interpreted as a divine in­ <lb/>

            his griefs and distresses ? The truth is, this whole accusation of Diomede <lb/>
            is only a feint to serve the designs of Agamemnon; for being desirous to <lb/>
            persuade the Greeks against their departure, he effects that design by this <lb/>
            counterfeited anger and licence of speech; and seeming to resent that <lb/>
            Agamemnon should be capable of imagining that the army would return <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of Aga­ <lb/>
            memnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that <lb/>
            night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving <lb/>
            all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and <lb/>
            Diomede, are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call a <lb/>
            council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemy's camp, to <lb/>
            learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomede undertakes <lb/>
            this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his compa­ <lb/>
            nion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on <lb/>
            a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are inform­ <lb/>
            ed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and particularly <lb/>
            of Rhesus, and the Thracians, who were lately arrived.. They pass on <lb/>
            with succ es; kill Rhesus with several of his officers, and seize the famous <pb n="175"/>
             <note type="margin">B. X.] <lb/>
            </note>horses of that prince, with which they return in triumph to the <lb/>
            camp. <lb/>
            The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.</p>
          <p>ALL night the chiefs before their vessels lay, <lb/>
            And lost in sleep the labours of the day: <lb/>
            All but the king; with various thoughts oppressed, <lb/>
            His country's cares larolling in his breast. <lb/>
            As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power <lb n="5"/>
            Foretells the rattling hail, or weighty shower, <lb/>
            Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore, <lb/>
            Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar; <lb/>
            By fits one flash succeeds as one expires, <lb/>
            And heaven flames thick with momentary fires: <lb n="10"/>
            So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast, <lb/>
            Sighs following sighs his inward fears confessed. <lb/>
            Now, o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys <lb/>
            From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze; <lb/>
            Hears in the passing wind their music blow, <lb n="15"/>
            And marks distinct the voices of the foe. <lb/>
            Now, looking backwards to the fleet and coast, <lb/>
            Anxious he sorrows for th' endanger'd host. <lb/>
            He rends his hairs, in sacrifice to Jove,' <lb/>
            And sues to him that ever lives above: <lb n="20"/>
            Inly he groans; while glory and despair <lb/>
            Divide his heart, and wage a doubtful war.</p>
          <p>A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves ; <lb/>
            To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves, <lb/>
            With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate <lb n="25"/>
            What yet remains to save th' afflicted state. <lb/>
            He rose, and first he cast his mantle round, <lb/>
            Next on his feet the shining sandals bound; <lb/>
            A lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd ; <lb/>
            His warlike hand a pointed javelin held. <lb n="30"/>
            Meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes, <lb/>
            Alike denied the gift of soft repose, <lb/>
            Laments for Greece; that in his cause before <lb/>
            So much had suffer'd, and must suffer more. <lb/>
            A leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread; <lb n="35"/>
            A brazen helmet glitter'd on his head: <lb/>
            Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went <lb/>
            To wake Atrides in the royal tent. <lb/>
            Already wak'd, Atrides he descried <lb/>
            His armour buckling at his vessel's side. <note type="footnote"> 1 Homer intends no more by this, than that Agamemnon tore his hat <lb/>

            Without his tent, bold Diomed they found, <lb n="170"/>

            Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field, <lb/>
            His head reclining on his bossy shield: <lb/>

            Of hounds, and men ; they start, they gaze around ; <lb/>
            Watch every side, and turn to every sound. <lb/>

            Dolon his name, Eumedes' only boy: <lb/>
            (Five girls beside the reverend herald told:) <lb/>
            Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold: <lb/>
            Not bless'd bv nature with the charms of face, <lb n="375"/>
            But swift of foot, and matchless in the race. <lb/>
            ' Hector!' (he said) ' my courage bids me meet <lb/>
            ' This high achievement, and explore the fleet: <lb/>
            ' But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies, <lb/>
            ' And swear to grant me the demanded prize ; <lb n="380"/>
            ' Th' immortal coursers, and the glittering car <lb/>
            ' That bear Pelides through the ranks of war. <lb/>
            ' Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go, <lb/>
            ' Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know, <lb/>
            ' E'en to the royal tent pursue my way, <lb n="385"/>
            ' And all their councils, all their aims, betray.'</p>
          <p>The chief then heav'd the golden sceptre high, <lb/>
            Attesting thus the monarch of the sky : <lb/>
            ' Be witness, thou! immortal lord of all! <lb/>
            ' Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall: <lb n="390"/>
            ' By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne, <lb/>
            ' And him alone th' immortal steeds adorn.'</p>
          <p>Thus Hector swore : the gods were call'd in vain; <lb/>
            But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain: <lb/>
            Across his back the bended bow he flung, <lb n="395"/>
            A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung, <lb/>
            A ferret's downy fur his helmet lin'd, <lb/>
            And in his hand a pointed javelin shin'd. <lb/>
            Then (never to return) he sought the shore, <lb/>
            And trod the path his feet must tread no more. <lb n="400"/>
            Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng, <lb/>
            (Still bending forward as he cours'd along,) <lb/>
            When, on the hollow way, th' approaching tread <lb/>
            Ulysses mark'd, and thus to Diomed:</p><pb n="184"/>
            
          <p>' 0 friend ! I hear some step of hostile feet, <lb n="405"/>
            ' Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet; <lb/>
            ' Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main; <lb/>
            ' Or nightly pillager that strips the slain. <lb/>
            ' Yet let him pass, and win a little space; <lb/>
            ' Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace. <lb n="410"/>
            ' But if, too swift of foot, he flies before, <lb/>
            ' Confine his course along the fleet and shore, <lb/>
            'Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ, <lb/>
            ' And intercept his hop'd return to Troy.'</p>
          <p>With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head, <lb n="415"/>
            (As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead: <lb/>
            Along the path the spy unwary flew: <lb/>
            Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue. <lb/>
            So distant they, and such the space between, <lb/>
            As when two teams of mules divide the green, <lb n="420"/>
            (To whom the hind like shares of land allows,) <lb/>
            When now new furrows part th' approaching ploughs. <lb/>
            Now Dolon listening heard them as they pass 'd; <lb/>
            Hector, (he thought,) had sent, and check'd his haste: <lb/>
            Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw, <lb n="425"/>
            No voice succeeding, he perceiv'd the foe. <lb/>
            As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind, <lb/>
            Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind, <lb/>
            Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way, <lb/>
            And from the herd still turn the flying prey : <lb n="430"/>
            So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew; <lb/>
            So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue. <lb/>
            Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls, <lb/>
            And mingles with the guards that watch the walls : <lb/>
            When brave Tydides stopp'd: a generous thought <lb n="435"/>
            (Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought, <lb/>
            Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance, <lb/>
            And snatch the glory from his lifted lance. <lb/>
            Then thus aloud: ' Whoever thou art, remain ; <lb/>
            ' This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.' <lb n="440"/>
            He said, and high in air the weapon cast, <lb/>
            Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd: <lb/>
            Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood <lb/>
            The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood; <lb/>
            A sudden palsy seiz'd his turning head; <lb n="445"/>
            His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled: <lb/>
            The panting warriors seize him, as he stands, <lb/>
            And, with unmanly tears, his life demands :</p>
          <p>' O spare my youth, and, for the breath I owe, <lb/>
            ' Large gifts of price my father shall bestow: <pb n="185"/>
             <note type="margin">B. X.]</note> <lb n="450"/>
            ' Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told, <lb/>
            ' And steel well-temper'd, and refulgent gold.'</p>
          <p>To whom Ulysses made this wise reply : <lb/>
            ' Whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die. <lb/>
            ' What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight, <lb n="455"/>
            ' To roam the silent fields in dead of night P <lb/>
            ' Cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find, <lb/>
            ' By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind ? <lb/>
            ' Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led <lb/>
            ' Through heaps of carnage to despoil the dead ?' <lb n="460"/>
            </p>
          <p>Then thus pale Dolon with a fearful look : <lb/>
            (Still as he spoke his limbs with horror shook:) <lb/>
            ' Hither I came, by Hector's words deceiv'd : <lb/>
            ' Much did he promise, rashly I believ'd: <lb/>
            ' No less a bribe than great Achilles' car, <lb n="465"/>
            ' And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war, <lb/>
            ' Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make ;5 <lb/>
            ' To learn what counsels, what resolves, you take: <lb/>
            ' If now, subdued, you fix your hopes on flight, <lb/>
            ' And, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night ?' <lb n="470"/>
            </p>
          <p>' Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,' <lb/>
            (Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies;) <lb/>
            ' Far other rulers those proud steeds demand, <lb/>
            ' And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand ; <lb/>
            ' E'en great Achilles scarce their rage can tame, <lb n="475"/>
            ' Achilles sprung from an immortal dame. <lb/>
            ' But say, be faithful, and the truth recite: <lb/>
            ' Where lies encamp'd the Trojan chief to-night P <lb/>
            ' Where stand his coursers P in what quarter sleep <lb/>
            ' Their other princes P tell what watch they keep. <lb n="480"/>
            ' Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are ; <lb/>
            ' Or here to combat, from their city far, <lb/>
            ' Or back to Ilion's walls transfer the war P'</p>
          <p>Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes' son: <lb/>
            ' What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own. <lb n="485"/>
            ' Hector, the peers assembling in his tent, <lb/>
            ' A council holds at Ilus' monument. <lb/>
            ' No certain guards the nightly watch partake: <lb/>
            ' Where'er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake: <lb/>
            'Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep: <lb n="490"/>
            ' Safe in their cares, th' auxiliar forces sleep, <lb/>
            ' Whose wives and infants, from the danger far, <lb/>
            ' Discharge their souls of half the fears of war.' <lb/>
            ' Then sleep these aids among the Trojan train,' <lb/>

          <p>To whom the spy: ' Their powers they thus dispose ; <lb/>
            ' The Pæons, dreadful with their bended bows, <lb/>
            ' The Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host, <lb/>

            ' Not distant far, lie higher on the land <lb n="500"/>
            ' The Lycian, Mysian, and Mæonian band, <lb/>
            ' And Phrygia's horse, by Thymbra's ancient wall; <lb/>
            ' The Thracians utmost, and apart from all. <lb/>
            ' These Troy but lately to her succour won, <lb/>
            ' Led on by Rhesus, great Eioneus' son: <lb/>
            ' I saw his coursers in proud triumph go, <lb/>

            ' Rich silver plates his shining car infold; <lb/>

            ' The truth or falsehood of the news I tell.' <lb n="515"/>
            </p>
          <p>To this Tydides, with a gloomy frown: <lb/>
            ' Think not to live, though all the truth be shewn; <lb/>
            ' Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife <lb/>
            ' To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life ? <lb/>
            ' Or that again our camps thou may'st explore P <lb n="520"/>
            ' No-once a traitor, thou be tray'st no more.'</p>
          <p>Sternly he spoke, and, as the wretch prepared <lb/>
            With humble blandishment to stroke his beard, <lb/>
            Like lightning swift the wrathful faulchion flew, <lb/>
            Divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two ; <lb n="525"/>
            One instant snatch'd his trembling soul to hell, <lb/>
            The head, yet speaking, mutter'd as it fell. <lb/>
            The furry helmet from his brow they tear, <lb/>
            The wolf's grey hide, th' unbended bow and spear ; <lb/>
            These great Ulysses lifting to the skies, <lb n="530"/>
            To favouring Pallas dedicates the prize :</p>
          <p>' Great queen of arms ! receive this hostile spoil, <lb/>

            This said, the spoils, with dropping gore defac'd, <lb/>
            High on a spreading tamarisk he plac'd; <lb/>
            Then heap'd with reeds and gather'd boughs the plain, <lb/>
            To guide their footsteps to the place again.</p>
          <p>Through the still night they cross the devious fields, <lb n="540"/>
            Slippery with blood, o'er arms and h ps of shields. <pb n="187"/>
             <note type="margin">B. X.]</note> <lb/>
            Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay, <lb/>
            And eas'd in sleep the labours of the day. <lb/>
            Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band: <lb/>
            The horses yok'd beside each warrior stand; <lb n="545"/>
            Their arms in order on the ground reclin'd, <lb/>
            Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shir.'d ; <lb/>
            Amidst, lay Rhesus, stretch'd in sleep profound, <lb/>
            And the white steeds behind his chariot bound. <lb/>
            The welcome sight Ulysses first descries, <lb n="550"/>
            And points to Diomed the tempting prize : <lb/>
            ' The man, the coursers, and the car behold! <lb/>
            ' Describ'd by Dolon with the arms of gold. <lb/>
            ' Now, brave Tydides! now thy courage try, <lb/>
            ' Approach the chariot, and the steeds untie ; <lb n="555"/>
            'Or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds, <lb/>
            ' Urge thou the slaughter, while I seize the steeds.'</p>
          <p>Pallas (this said) her hero's bosom warms, <lb/>
            Breath'd in his heart, and strung his nervous arms ; <lb/>
            Where'er he pass'd, a purple stream pursued; <lb n="560"/>
            His thirsty faulchion, fat with hostile blood, <lb/>
            Bath'd all his footsteps, dy'd the fields with gore, <lb/>
            And a low groan remurmur'd through the shore. <lb/>
            So the grim lion, from his nightly den, <lb/>
            O'erleaps the fences, and invades the pen; <lb n="565"/>
            On sheep or goats, resistless in his way, <lb/>
            He falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey. <lb/>
            Nor stopp'd the fury of his vengeful hand, <lb/>
            Till twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band. <lb/>
            Ulysses following as his partner slew, <lb n="570"/>
            Back by the foot each slaughter'd warrior drew ; <lb/>
            The milk-white coursers studious to convey <lb/>
            Safe to the ships, he wisely clear'd the way ; <lb/>
            Lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred, <lb/>
            Should start and tremble at the heaps of dead. <lb n="575"/>
            Now twelve despatch'd, the monarch last they found; <lb/>
            Tydides' faulchion fix'd him to the ground. <lb/>
            J ust then a dreadful dream Minerva sent; <lb/>
            A warlike form appear'd before his tent, <lb/>
            Whose visionary steel his bosom tore: <lb n="580"/>
            So dream'd the monarch, and awak'd no more.</p>
          <p>Ulysses now the snowy steeds detains, <lb/>
            And leads them fasten'd by the silver reins; <lb/>
            These, with his bow unbent, he lash'd along; <lb/>
            'The scourge, forgot, on Rhesus' chariot hung.) <lb/>
            Then gave his friend the signal to retire; <lb/>
            But him new dangers, new achievements, fire: <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            Doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade <lb/>
            To send more heroes to th' infernal shade, <lb/>
            Drag off the car where Rhesus' armour lay, <lb n="590"/>
            Or heave with manly force, and lift away. <lb/>
            While unresolv'd the son of Tydeus stands, <lb/>
            Pallas appears, and thus her chief commands :</p>
          <p>' Enough, my son ; from farther slaughter cease, <lb/>
            ' Regard thy safety, and depart in peace ; <lb n="595"/>
            ' Haste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy, <lb/>
            ' Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy.'</p>
          <p>The voice divine confess'd the martial maid; <lb/>
            In haste he mounted, and her word obey'd ; <lb/>
            The coursers fly before Ulysses' bow, <lb n="600"/>
            Swift as the wind, and white as winter snow.</p>
          <p>Not unobserv'd they pass'd : the god of light <lb/>
            Had watch'd his Troy, and mark'd Minerva's flight, <lb/>
            Saw Tydeus' son with heavenly succour bless'd, <lb/>
            And vengeful anger fill'd his sacred breast. <lb n="605"/>
            Swift to the Trojan camp descends the power, <lb/>
            And wakes Hippocoön in the morning hour, <lb/>
            (On Rhesus' side accustom'd to attend, <lb/>
            A faithful kinsman and instructive friend.) <lb/>
            He rose, and saw the field deform'd with blood, <lb n="610"/>
            An empty space where late the coursers stood, <lb/>
            The yet warm Thracians panting on the coast; <lb/>
            For each he wept. but for his Rhesus most. <lb/>
            Now, while on Rhesus' name he calls in vain, <lb/>
            The gathering tumult spreads o'er all the plain; <lb n="615"/>
            On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright, <lb/>
            And wondering view the slaughter of the night.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the chiefs arriving at the shade <lb/>
            Where late the spoils of Hector's spy were laid, <lb/>
            Ulysses stopp'd; to bim Tydides bore <lb n="620"/>
            The trophy, dropping yet with Dolon's gore: <lb/>
            Then mounts again; again their nimble feet <lb/>
            The coursers ply, and thunder towards the fleet.</p>
          <p>Old Nestor first perceiv'd th' approaching sound, <lb/>
            Bespeaking thus the Grecian peers around: <lb n="625"/>
            'Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear, <lb/>

          <p>Scarce had he spoke, when lo ! the chiefs appear, <lb/>
            And spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear: <lb/>
            With words of friendship and extended hands <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector <lb/>
            prepares the Trojans to receive them: while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, <lb/>
            give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him; and Hector <lb/>
            is commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the <lb/>
            engagement, till the king should be wounded and retire from the field. <lb/>
            lie then makes a great slaughter of the enemy; Ulysses and Diomede put <lb/>
            a stop to him for a time; but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is obliged <lb/>
            to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans, wounded. <lb/>
            and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him. Hector <lb/>
            comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes and rallies <lb/>
            the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the army, <lb/>
            pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in <lb/>
            Nestor's chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship) <lb/>
            sends Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that <lb/>
            manner. Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the <lb/>
            accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he <lb/>
            had remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles<lb/>
            fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it clad in <lb/>
            Achilles' armour. Patroclus in his return meets Eurypylus also wounded, <lb/>
            and assists in that distress.</p>
          <p>This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem; and the <lb/>
            same day, with its various actions and adventures, is extended through <lb/>
            the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and <lb/>
            part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the monu­ <lb/>
            ment of Ilus.</p>
          <p>THE saffron morn, with early blushes spread, <lb/>
            Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed ; <lb/>
            With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, <lb/>
            And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light: <lb/>
            When baleful Eris, sent by Jove's command, <lb n="5"/>
            The torch of discord blazing in her hand, <lb/>
            Through the red skies her bloody sign extends, <lb/>
            And, wrapp'd in tempests, o'er the fleet descends. <lb/>
            High on Ulysses' bark her horrid stand <lb/>
            She took, and thunder'd through the seas and land. <lb n="10"/>
            E'en Ajax and Achilles heard the sound, <lb/>
            Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound. <lb/>
            Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng <lb/>
            With horror sounds the loud Orthiau song:1 <note type="footnote"> 1 This is a kind of Odaic song, invented and sung on perpose to fire </note> <pb n="-"/>

          <p>The king of men his hardy host inspires <lb/>
            With loud command, with great example fires: <lb n="20"/>
            Himself first rose, himself before the rest <lb/>
            His mighty limbs in radiant armour dress'd. <lb/>
            And first he cas'd his manly legs around <lb/>
            In shining greaves, with silver buckles bound: <lb/>
            The beaming cuirass next adorn'd his breast, <lb n="25"/>
            The same which once King Cinyras possess'd: <lb/>
            (The fame of Greece and her assembled host <lb/>

            A radiant baldrick, o'er his shoulder tied, <lb/>
            Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side ; <lb n="40"/>
            Gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encas'd <lb/>
            The shining blade, and golden hangers grac'd. <lb/>
            His buckler's mighty orb was next displayed, <lb/>

            Ten zones of brass its ample brim surround, <lb n="45"/>
            And twice ten bosses the bright convex crown'd; <lb/>
            Tremendous Gorgon frown'd upon its field, <lb/>
            And circling terrors fill th' expressive shield: <lb/>
            Within its concave hung a silver thong, <lb/>

            With nodding horse-hair formidably graced ; <lb/>

            That blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.</p>

            High o er the chief they clash'd their arms in air, <lb/>

          <p>Close to the limits of the trench and mound, <lb/>

            To second these, in close array combined, <lb n="65"/>
            The squadrons spread their sable wings behind. <lb/>
            Now snouts and tumults wake the tardy sun, <lb/>
            As with the light the warriors' toils begun ; <lb/>
            E'en Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill'd <lb/>
            Red drops of blood o'er all the fatal field; <lb n="70"/>
            The woes of men unwilling to survey, <lb/>
            And all the slaughters that must stain the day.</p>
          <p>Near Ilus' tomb in order ranged around, <lb/>
            The Trojan lines possess'd the rising ground. <lb/>
            There wise Polydamas and Hector stood; <lb n="75"/>
            Æneas, honour d as a guardian god; <lb/>
            Bold Polybus, Agenor the divine; <lb/>
            The brother-warriors of Antenor's line; <lb/>
            With youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face, <lb/>
            And fair proportions, match'd th' ethereal race. <lb n="80"/>
            Great Hector, coverd with his spacious shield, <lb/>
            Plies all the troops, and orders all the field. <lb/>
            As the red star now shews his sanguine fires, <lb/>
            Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires ; <lb/>
            Thus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man, <lb n="85"/>
            Plung'd in the rear, or blazing in the van; <lb/>
            While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies, <lb/>
            Flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies. <lb/>
            As sweating reapers in some wealthy field, <lb/>

            So Greece and Troy the field of war divide, <lb/>
            And falling ranks are strew'd on every side. <lb/>
            None stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight; <lb n="95"/>
            But horse to horse and man to man they fight. <lb/>
            Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey; <lb/>
            Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day. <lb/>
            Discord with joy the scene of death descries, <lb/>
            And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes : <lb n="100"/>
            Discord alone, of all th' immortal train, <lb/>
            Swells the red horrors of this direful plain: <lb/>
            The gods in peace their golden mansions fill, <lb/>
            Ranged in bright order on th' Olympian hill; <lb/>
            But general murmurs told their griefs above, <lb n="105"/>
            And each accus'd the partial will of Jove. <lb/>
            Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone, <lb/>
            Th' eternal monarch, on his awful throne, <lb/>
            Wrapp'd in the blaze of boundless glory sat: <lb/>
            And, fix'd, fulfill'd the just decrees of fate. <lb n="110"/>
            On earth he turn'd his all-considering eyes, <lb/>
            And mark'd the spot where Ilion's towers arise; <lb/>
            The sea with ships, the field with armies spread, <lb/>
            The victor's rage, the dying, and the dead.</p>
          <p>Thus while the morning beams increasing bright <lb n="115"/>
            O'er heaven's pure azure spread the glowing light, <lb/>
            Commutual death the fate of war confounds, <lb/>
            Each adverse battle gor'd with equal wounds. <lb/>
            But now (what time in some sequester'd vale <lb/>
            The weary woodman spreads his sparing meal, <lb n="120"/>
            When his tir'd arms refuse the axe to rear, <lb/>
            And claim a respite from the sylvan war; <lb/>
            But not till half the prostrate forests lay <lb/>

            Then, nor till then, the Greeks' impulsive might <lb n="125"/>
            Pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light. <lb/>
            Great Agamemnon then the slaughter led, <lb/>
            And slew Bienor at his people's head; <lb/>
            Whose squire Oïleus, with a sudden spring, <lb/>
            Leap'd from the chariot to revenge his king, <lb n="130"/>
            But in his front he felt the fatal wound, <lb/>
            Which pierc'd his brain, and stretched him on the ground: <lb/>
            Atrides spoil'd, and left them on the plain: <lb/>
            Vain was their youth, their glittering armour vain : <lb/>
            Now soil'd with dust, and naked to the sky, <lb n="135"/>
            Their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.</p>

            Far other task, than when they went to keep, <lb/>
            On Ida's tops, their father's fleecy sheep! <lb/>
            These on the mountains once Achilles found, <lb/>
            And captive led, with pliant osiers bound; <lb/>

            But now to perish by Atrides' sword: <lb/>
            Pierc'd in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds: <lb/>
            Cleft through the head, his brother's fate succeeds. <lb/>
            Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls, <lb/>
            And, stripp'd, their features to his mind recalls. <lb n="150"/>
            The Trojans see the youths untimely die, <lb/>
            But helpless tremble for themselves, and fly. <lb/>
            So when a lion, ranging o'er the lawns, <lb/>
            Finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns, <lb/>
            Their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws, <lb n="155"/>
            And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws ; <lb/>
            The frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay, <lb/>
            But swift through rustling thickets bursts her way ; <lb/>
            All drowned in sweat the panting mother flies. <lb/>
            And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes. <lb n="160"/>

            Atrides mark'd, as these their safety sought, <lb n="165"/>
            And slew the children for the father's fault; <lb/>
            Their headstrong horse unable to restrain, <lb/>
            They shook with fear, and dropp'd the silken rein; <lb/>
            Then in their chariot on their knees they fall, <lb/>
            And thus with lifted hands for mercy call: <lb n="170"/>

            The distanced army wonders at his deeds. <lb n="200"/>
            As when the winds with raging flames conspire, <lb/>
            And o'er the forests roll the flood of fire, <lb/>
            In blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall, <lb/>
            And one refulgent ruin levels all: <lb/>
            Before Atrides' rage so sinks the foe, <lb n="205"/>
            Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low. <lb/>
            The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword; <lb/>
            And many a car, now lighten'd of its lord, <lb/>
            Wide o'er the fields with guideless fury rolls, <lb/>
            Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls : <lb n="210"/>
            While his keen faulchion drinks the warriors' lives ; <lb/>
            More grateful now to vultures than their wives !</p>
          <p>Perhaps great Hector then had found his fate, <lb/>
            But Jove and Destiny prolong'd his date. <lb/>
            Safe from the darts, the care of heaven, he stood, <lb n="215"/>
            Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.</p>
          <p>Now past the tomb where ancient Bus lay, <lb/>

            Where the wild figs th' adjoining summit crown, <lb/>
            That path they take, and speed to reach the town. <lb n="220"/>
            As swift Atrides with loud shouts pursued, <lb/>
            Hot with his toil, and bath'd in hostile blood. <lb/>
            Now near the beech-tree, and the Scæan gates, <lb/>
            The hero halts, and his associates waits. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, on every side, around the plain, <lb n="225"/>
            Dispersed, disorder'a, fly the Trojan train. <lb/>
            So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd <lb/>
            The lion's roaring through the midnight shade : <lb/>
            On heaps they tumble with successless haste : <lb/>
            The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last: <lb n="230"/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            Not with less fury stem Atrides flew, <lb/>
            Still pressed the rout, and still the hindmost slew; <lb/>
            Hurl d from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd, <lb/>
            And rage, and death, and carnage, load the field.</p>
          <p>Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall; <lb n="235"/>
            Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall. <lb/>
            But Jove, descending, shook th' Idæan hills, <lb/>
            And down their summits pour'd a hundred rills: <lb/>

          <p>Ye sacred nine, celestial Muses ! tell, <lb/>
            Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell ? <lb/>
            The great Iphidamas, the bold and young: <lb/>
            From sage Antenor and Theano sprung; <lb/>
            Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred, <lb n="285"/>
            And nurs'd in Thrace, where snowy flocks are fed. <lb/>
            Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest, <lb/>
            And early honour warm his generous breast, <lb/>
            When the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms <lb/>

            But, call'd by glory to the wars of Troy, <lb/>
            He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy; <lb/>
            From his lov'd bride departs with melting eyes, <lb/>
            And swift to aid his dearer country flies. <lb/>
            With twelve black ships he reach'd Percope's 6 strand, <lb n="295"/>
            Thence took the long laborious march by land. <lb/>
            Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs, <lb/>
            Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings. <lb/>
            Atrides first discharg'd the missive spear; <lb/>
            The Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air. <lb n="300"/>
            Then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart, <lb/>
            With all his strength the youth directs his dart: <lb/>
            But tile broad belt, with plates of silver bound, <lb/>
            The point rebated, and repell'd the wound. <lb/>
            Encumber'd with the dart,'Atrides stands, <lb n="305"/>
            Till, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands. <lb/>
            At once his weighty sword discharg'd a wound <lb/>
            Full on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground. <lb/>

          <p>Coon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh: <lb/>
            Tears at the sight came starting from his eye, <lb/>
            While piere'd with grief the much-lov'd youth he view'd, <lb/>
            And the pale features now deform'd with blood. <lb/>
            Then with his spear, unseen, his time he took, <lb n="325"/>
            Aim'd at the king, and near his elbow struck. <lb/>
            The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part, <lb/>
            And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart. <lb/>
            Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear <lb/>

            Atrides, marking an unguarded part, <lb n="335"/>
            Transfixed the warrior with his brazen dart; <lb/>
            Prone on his brother's bleeding breast he lay <lb/>

          <p>The vengeful victor rages round the fields, <lb/>

          <p>No sooner Hector saw the king retir'd, <lb n="365"/>
            But thus his Trojans and his aids he fir'd: <lb/>

          <p>With words like these the fiery chief alarms <lb n="375"/>
            His fainting host, and every bosom warms. <lb/>
            As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear <lb/>
            The brindled lion, or the tusky bear, <lb/>
            With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart, <lb/>
            And springs the foremost with his lifted dart: <lb n="380"/>
            So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare : <lb/>
            Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war. <lb/>
            On the black body of the foes he pours ; <lb/>
            As from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers. <lb/>
            A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps, <lb n="385"/>
            Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps. <lb/>
            Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd, <lb/>
            Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground P <lb/>

            Now to the skies the foaming billows rears, <lb/>

            Now the last ruin the whole host appals; <lb/>
            Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls ; <lb/>
            But wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth, <lb n="405"/>

          <p>' No martial toil I shun, no danger fear; <lb/>

            'And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain.'</p>
          <p>He sigh'd; but, sighing, rais'd his vengeful steel, <lb n="415"/>
            And from his car the proud Thymbræus fell: <lb/>
            Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord, <lb/>
            His death ennobled by Ulysses' sword. <lb/>
            There slain, they left them in eternal night; <lb/>
            Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight. <lb n="420"/>

            Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds. <lb/>

            In deep prophetic arts their father skill'd, <lb/>
            Had warn'd his children from the Trojan field; <lb/>
            Fate urged them on; the father warn'd in vain, <lb/>
            They rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain ! <lb n="430"/>
            Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms ; <lb/>
            The stern Tydides strips their shining arms. <lb/>
            Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies, <lb/>
            And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize. <lb/>
            Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight, <lb n="435"/>
            And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight. <lb/>
            By Tydeus' lance Agastrophus was slain, <lb/>
            The far-fam'd hero of Pæonian strain ;9 <lb/>
            Wing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly, <lb/>
            His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh; <lb n="440"/>
            Through broken orders, swifter than the wind, <lb/>
            He fled, but, flying, left his life behind. <lb/>
            This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes <lb/>
            Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies; <lb/>
            Shouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend, <lb n="445"/>
            And moving armies on his march attend. <lb/>

            The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud :</p>

            'And oft that partial power has lent his aid. <lb/>
            'Thou shalt not long the death deserv'd withstand, <lb/>
            ' If any god assist Tydides' hand. <lb n="470"/>
            'Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day, <lb/>
            ' Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay.'</p>
          <p>Him, while he triumph'd, Paris eyed from far, <lb/>
            (The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war): <lb/>
            Around the fields his feather'd shafts he sent, <lb n="475"/>
            From ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument; <lb/>
            Behind the column placed, he bent his bow, <lb/>
            And wing'd an arrow at th' unwary foe : <lb/>
            Just as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest <lb/>
            To seize, and draw the corslet from his breast, <lb n="480"/>
            The bow-string twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain, <lb/>
            But pierc'd his foot, and nail'd it to the plain. <lb/>
            The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring, <lb/>
            Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king:</p>
          <p>, He bleeds!' (he cries) ' some god has sped my dart; <lb n="485"/>
            'Would the same god had fix'd it in his heart! <lb/>
            'So Troy, reliev'd from that wide-wasting hand, <lb/>
            'Should breathe from slaughter, and in combat stand, <lb/>
            'Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear, <lb/>
            ' As scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear. , <lb n="490"/>
            </p>
          <p>He dauntless thus: 'Thou conqueroi of the fair, <lb/>
            'Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair ; <lb/>
            'Vain archer ! trusting to the distant dart, <lb/>
            'Unskill'd in arms to act a manly part! <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            ‘ Thou hast but done what boys or women can ; <lb n="495"/>
            ‘ Such hands may wound, but not incense a man. <lb/>
            ‘ Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave, <lb/>
            ‘ A coward's weapon never hurts the brave. <lb/>
            ‘ Not so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel: <lb/>
            ‘ Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel. <lb n="500"/>
            ‘Where this but lights, some noble life expires, <lb/>
            ‘Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires, <lb/>
            ‘ Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air, <lb/>
            ‘ And leaves such objects as distract the fair.'</p>
          <p>Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart, <lb n="505"/>
            Before him steps, and bending draws the dart: <lb/>
            Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds : <lb/>
            Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.</p>
          <p>Now on the field Ulysses stands alone, <lb/>
            The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on: <lb n="510"/>
            But stands collected in himself and whole, <lb/>
            And questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:</p>
          <p>‘ What farther subterfuge, what hopes remain? <lb/>
            ‘ What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain P <lb/>
            ‘ What danger, singly if I stand the ground, <lb n="515"/>
            ‘ My friends all scatter'd, all the foes around ? <lb/>
            ‘ Yet wherefore doubtful P let this truth suffice : <lb/>
            ‘ The brave meets danger, and the coward flies; <lb/>
            ‘ To die, or conquer, proves a hero's heart; <lb/>
            ‘ And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part.‛ <lb n="520"/>
            </p>
          <p>Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast, <lb/>
            Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd ; <lb/>
            These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose : <lb/>
            And round him deep the steely circle grows. <lb/>
            So fares a boar, whom all the troop surrounds <lb n="525"/>
            Of shouting huntsmen, and of clamorous hounds; <lb/>
            He grinds his ivory tusks ; he foams with ire ; <lb/>
            His sanguine eyeballs glare with living fire; <lb/>
            By these, by those, on every part is plied; <lb/>
            And the red slaughter spreads on every side. <lb n="530"/>
            Pierc'd through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell; <lb/>
            Next Ennomus and Thoön sunk to hell; <lb/>
            Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust, <lb/>
            Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust. <lb/>
            Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near; <lb n="535"/>
            Ulysses reach’d him with the fatal spear; <lb/>
            But to his aid his brother Socus flies, <lb/>
            Socus, the brave, the generous, and the wise: <lb/>
            Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:</p>
          <p>‘ 0 great Ulysses, much-enduring man! <pb n="203"/>
             <note type="margin">B. XI.]</note> <lb n="540"/>
            ‘ Not deeper skill’d in every martial slight, <lb/>
            ‘ Than worn to toils, and active in the fight! <lb/>
            ‘ This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace, <lb/>
            ‘ And end at once the great Hippasian race, <lb/>
            ‘ Or thou beneath this lance must press the field.' <lb n="545"/>
            He said, and forceful pierc'd his spacious shield; <lb/>
            Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown, <lb/>
            Plough’d half his side, and bar'd it to the bone. <lb/>
            By Pallas’ care, the spear, though deep infix’d, <lb/>
            Stopp’d short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd, <lb n="550"/>
            </p>
          <p>The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew, <lb/>
            Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):</p>
          <p>‘ Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace! <lb/>
            ‘ Fate calls thee hence, and finish'd is thy race. <lb/>
            ‘ No longer check my conquests on the foe: <lb n="555"/>
            ‘ But, pierc'd by this, to endless darkness go, <lb/>
            ‘ And add one spectre to the realms below!'</p>
          <p>He spoke, while Socus, seiz'd with sudden fright, <lb/>
            Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight, <lb/>
            Between his shoulders pierc'd the following dart, <lb n="560"/>
            And held its passage through the panting heart. <lb/>
            Wide in his breast appeared the grizzly wound; <lb/>
            He falls : his armour rings against the ground. <lb/>
            Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain: <lb/>
            ‘Fam'd son of Hippasus !there press the plain; <lb n="565"/>
            ‘There ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate: <lb/>
            ‘ Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date. <lb/>
            ‘ Ah wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose, <lb/>
            ‘Thy dying eyes no tender mother close, <lb/>
            ‘But hungry birds shall tear those balls away, <lb n="570"/>
            ‘ And hovering vultures scream around their prey <lb/>
            ‘ Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom, <lb/>
            ‘With solemn funerals, and a lasting tomb.'</p>
          <p>Then, raging with intolerable smart, <lb/>
            He writhes his body, and extracts the dart, <lb n="575"/>
            The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued, <lb/>
            And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood. <lb/>
            Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade ; <lb/>
            Forc'd he recedes, and loudly calls for aid. <lb/>
            Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears ; <lb n="580"/>
            The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears ; <lb/>
            Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried, <lb/>
            Who shares his labours, and defends his side: <lb/>
            ‘ 0 friend ! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear; <lb/>
            ‘ Distress'd he seems, and no assistance near: <lb n="585"/>
            ‘ Strong as he is, yet, one oppos'd to all, <lb/>
            ‘ Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall. <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            ‘ Greece, robb'd of him. must bid her host despair, <lb/>
            ‘ And feel a loss not ages can repair.'</p>
          <p>Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends , <lb n="590"/>
            Great Ajax like the god of war, attends. <lb/>
            The prudent chief in sore distress they found, <lb/>
            With bands of furious Trojans compass'd round, <lb/>
            As when some huntsman, with a flying spear, <lb/>
            From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer; <lb n="595"/>
            Down his cleft side while fresh the blood distils, <lb/>
            He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills: <lb/>
            Till, life's warm vapour issuing through the wound, <lb/>
            Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround; <lb/>
            Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade, <lb n="600"/>
            The lion rushes through the woodland shade ; <lb/>
            The wolves, though hungry, scour dispers'd away ; <lb/>
            The lordly savage vindicates his prey. <lb/>
            Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains, <lb/>
            A single warrior, half a host sustains : <lb n="605"/>
            But soon as Ajax heaves his tower-like shield. <lb/>
            The scatter'd crowds fly frighted o'er the field : <lb/>
            Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays, <lb/>
            And, sav'd from numbers, to his car conveys.</p>
          <p>Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew ; <lb n="610"/>
            And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew: <lb/>
            On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound, <lb/>
            And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground. <lb/>
            As when a torrent, swelled with wintry rains, <lb/>
            Pours from the mountains o'er the delug'd plains, <lb n="615"/>
            And pines and oaks, from their foundation torn, <lb/>
            A country's ruins! to the seas are borne: <lb/>
            Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng; <lb/>
            Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.</p>
          <p>But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far, . <lb n="620"/>
            Rag'd on the left, and rul'd the tide of war: <lb/>
            Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain, <lb/>
            And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain. <lb/>
            There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose <lb/>
            The warrior's fury ; there the battle glows; <lb n="625"/>
            There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height, <lb/>
            His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight. <lb/>
            The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around, <lb/>
            Had pierc'd Machaon with a distant wound: <lb/>
            In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd, <lb n="630"/>
            And trembling Greece for her physician fear'd. <lb/>
            To Nestor then Idomeneus begun: <lb/>
            ' Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son I <pb n="205"/>
             <note type="margin">B. XI.]</note> <lb/>
            Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away, <lb/>
            ‘ And great Machaon to the ships convey. <lb n="635"/>
            ‘ A wise physician, skill'd our wounds to heal, <lb/>
            ‘ Is more than armies to the public weal.'</p>
          <p>Old Nestor mounts the seat. Beside him rode <lb/>
            The wounded offspring of the healing god. <lb/>
            He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet <lb n="640"/>
            Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.</p>
          <p>But now Cebriones, from Hector's car, <lb/>
            Survey'd the various fortune of the war. <lb/>
            ‘ While here' (he cried) ‘ the flying Greeks are slain <lb/>
            ‘ Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain. <lb n="645"/>
            ‘ Before great Ajax, see the mingled throng <lb/>
            ‘ Of men and chariots driven in heaps along! <lb/>
            ‘ I know him well, distinguished o'er the field <lb/>
            ‘ By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield. <lb/>
            ‘ Thither, 0 Hector, thither urge thy steeds, <lb n="650"/>
            ‘ There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds ; <lb/>
            ‘ There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite, <lb/>
            ‘And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.’</p>
          <p>Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds ; <lb/>
            Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds ; <lb n="655"/>
            Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields, <lb/>
            O’er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields. <lb/>
            The horses' hoofs are bath'd in heroes' gore, <lb/>
            And, dashing, purple all the car before: <lb/>
            The groaning axle sable drops distils, <lb n="660"/>
            And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels. <lb/>
            Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight, <lb/>
            Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light: <lb/>
            (By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone, <lb/>
            The ranks lie scatter'd, and the troops o’erthrown.) <lb n="665"/>
            Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate, <lb/>
            And fears that arm whose force he felt so late. <lb/>
            But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part, <lb/>
            Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart; <lb/>
            Confus'd, unnerv'd in Hector's presence grown, <lb n="670"/>
            Amaz'd he stood, with terrors not his own. <lb/>
            O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw, <lb/>
            And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew. <lb/>
            Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains, <lb/>
            Beset with watchful dogs and shouting swains, <lb n="675"/>
            Repuls'd by numbers from the nightly stalls, <lb/>
            Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls, <lb/>
            Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires ; <lb/>
            Then sourly slow th' indignant beast retires. <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd, <lb n="680"/>
            While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.</p>
          <p>As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued, <lb/>
            In some wide field by troops of boys pursued, <lb/>
            Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain, <lb/>
            Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain; <lb n="685"/>
            Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound; <lb/>
            The patient animal maintains his ground ; <lb/>
            Scarce from the field with all their efforts chas'd, <lb/>
            And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last. <lb/>
            On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung, <lb n="690"/>
            The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung; <lb/>
            Confiding now in bulky strength he stands, <lb/>
            Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands ; <lb/>
            Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly, <lb/>
            And threats his followers with retorted eye. <lb n="695"/>
            Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers, <lb/>
            While hissing darts descend in iron showers: <lb/>
            In his broad buckler many a weapon stood, <lb/>
            Its surface bristled with a quivering wood; <lb/>
            And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain, <lb n="700"/>
            Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain. <lb/>
            But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts, <lb/>
            And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts; <lb/>
            Whose eager javelin launched against the foe, <lb/>
            Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow ; <lb n="705"/>
            From his torn liver the red current flow'd, <lb/>
            And his slack knees desert their dying load. <lb/>
            The victor rushing to despoil the dead, <lb/>
            From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled: <lb/>
            Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood, <lb n="710"/>
            Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood. <lb/>
            Back to the lines the wounded Greek retir'd, <lb/>
            Yet thus, retreating, his associates fir'd: <lb/>
            ‘What god, 0 Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd P <lb/>
            ‘ Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid. <lb n="715"/>
            ‘ This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage, <lb/>
            ‘ And this the last brave battle he shall wage: <lb/>
            ‘Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave <lb/>
            ‘The warrior rescue, and your country save.'</p>
          <p>Thus urg'd the chief; a generous troop appears, <lb n="720"/>
            Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears, <lb/>
            To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand <lb/>
            With pious care, great Ajax joins the band: <lb/>
            Each takes new courage at the hero's sight ; <lb n="725"/>
            The hero rallies and renews the fight, <pb n="207"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">B. XI.]</note>Thus raged ooth armies like conflicting fires, <lb/>
            While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires : <lb/>
            His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore, <lb/>
            The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore. <lb/>
            That hour, Achilles, from the topmost height <lb n="730"/>
            Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight; <lb/>
            His feasted eyes beheld around the plain <lb/>
            The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain. <lb/>
            His friend Machaon singled from the rest, <lb/>
            A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast. <lb n="735"/>
            Straight to Menœtius’ much-lov'd son he sent; <lb/>
            Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent: <lb/>

            Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd; <lb n="755"/>
            The chiefs descending from their car he found; <lb/>
            The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound. <lb/>
            The warriors, standing on the breezy shore, <lb/>
            To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore, <lb/>
            Here paus’d a moment, while the gentle gale <lb n="760"/>
            Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale; <lb/>
            Then to consult on farther methods went, <lb/>
            And took their seats beneath the shady tent. <lb/>
            The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares, <lb/>
            Arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs; <lb n="765"/>
            (Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave, <lb/>
            Greece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom, gave;) <lb/>
            A table first with azure feet she placed; <lb/>
            Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced: <lb/>
            Honey new pressed, the sacred flower of wheat, <lb n="770"/>

            A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings, <lb/>
            From eldest times : embossed with studs of gold, <lb/>
            Two feet support it, and four handles hold; <lb n="775"/>
            On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink, <lb/>
            In sculpturd gold, two turtles seem to drink : <lb/>
            A massy weight, yet heav'd with ease by him, <lb/>
            When the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim. <lb/>
            Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine <lb n="780"/>
            Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine ; <lb/>
            With goat's-milk cheese a flavorous taste bestows, <lb/>
            And last with flour the smiling surface strews. <lb/>
            This for the wounded prince the dame prepares; <lb/>
            The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares : <lb n="785"/>
            Salubrious draughts the warrior's thirst allay, <lb/>

            force them ; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas ad­ <lb/>
            vises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The Trojans <lb/>
            follow his counsel, and having divided their army into five bodies of foot, <lb/>
            begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his <lb/>
            talons, which appeared on the left band of the Trojans, Polydamas en­ <lb/>
            deavours to withdraw them again. This Hector opposes, and continues <lb/>
            the attack; in which, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first <lb/>
            breach in the wall: Hector also, casting a stone of a vast size, forces <lb/>
            open one of the gates, and enters at the head of his troops, who victo­ <lb/>
            riously pursue the Grecians even to their ships.</p>
          <p>WHILE thus the hero's pious cares attend <lb/>
            The cure and safety of his wounded friend, <lb/>
            Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage, <lb/>

            And what surviv'd of Greece to Greece return'd ; <lb/>
            Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore, <lb n="15"/>
            Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store; <lb/>
            Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills, <lb/>
            Caresus roaring down the stony hills, <lb/>
            Æsepus, Granicus, with mingled force, <lb/>
            And thus foaming from his fruitful source; <lb n="20"/>
            And gully Simois, rolling to the main <lb/>
            Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain: <lb/>
            These, turn'd by Phœbus from their wonted ways, <lb/>
            Deluged the rampire nine continual days ; <lb/>
            The weight of waters saps the yielding wall, <lb n="25"/>
            And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall. <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours, <lb/>
            And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.</p>
          <p>The god of ocean, marching stern before, <lb/>
            With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore, <lb n="30"/>
            Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves, <lb/>
            And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves. <lb/>
            Now, smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the food, <lb/>
            No fragment tells where once the wonder stood; <lb/>
            In their old bounds the rivers roll again, <lb n="35"/>
            Shine 'twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.</p>
          <p>But this the gods in later times perform; <lb/>
            As yet the bulwark stood, and brav'd the storm ! <lb/>
            The strokes yet echoed of contending powers; <lb/>
            War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers. <lb n="40"/>
            Smote by the arm of Jove, and dire dismay, <lb/>
            Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay ; <lb/>
            Hector's approach in every wind they hear, <lb/>
            And Hector's fury every moment fear. <lb/>
            He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng, <lb n="45"/>
            Mingled the troops, and drove the field along. <lb/>
            So, 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands, <lb/>
            Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands; <lb/>
            Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form, <lb/>
            And hissing javelins rain an iron storm ; <lb n="50"/>
            His powers untam'd their bold assault defy, <lb/>
            And, where he turns, the rout disperse, or die: <lb/>
            He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all, <lb/>
            And, if he falls, his courage makes him fall. <lb/>
            With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows; <lb/>
            Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows. <lb n="55"/>
            The panting steeds impatient fury breathe, <lb/>
            But snort and tremble at the gulf beneath; <lb/>
            Just on the brink, they neigh, and paw the ground, <lb/>
            And the turf trembles, and the skies resound. <lb/>
            Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep, <lb n="60"/>
            Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep; <lb/>
            The bottom bare, (a formidable show!) <lb/>
            And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below. <lb/>
            The foot alone this strong defence could force, <lb/>
            And try the pass impervious to the horse. <lb n="65"/>
            This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave, <lb/>
            Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour.'</p>
          <p>This counsel pleas'd: the godlike Hector sprung <lb/>
            Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung. <lb/>
            The chiefs example follow'd by his train, <lb n="95"/>
            Each quits his car, and issues on the plain. <lb/>
            By orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd, <lb/>
            Compel the coursers to their ranks behind. <lb/>
            The forces part in five distinguish'd bands, <lb/>
            And all obey their several chiefs' commands, <lb n="100"/>
            The best and bravest in the first conspire, <lb/>
            Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire : <lb/>
            Great Hector glorious in the van of these, <lb/>
            Polydamas, and brave Cebriones. <lb/>
            Before the next the graceful Paris shines, <lb n="105"/>
            And bold Alcathoiis, and Agenor joins. <lb/>
            The sons of Priam with the third appear, <lb/>
            Deïphobus, and Helenus the seer; <lb/>
            In arms with these the mighty Asius stood, <lb/>
            Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood, <lb n="110"/>
            And whom Arisba's yellow coursers bore, <lb/>
            The coursers fed on Selle's winding shore. <lb/>
            Antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide, <lb/>
            And great AEneas, born on fountful Ide. <lb/>
            Divine Sarpedon the last band obey'd, <lb n="115"/>
            Whom Glaucus and Asteropæus aid; <lb/>
            Next him, the bravest at their army's head, <lb/>
            But he more brave than all the hosts he led. <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            Now, with compacted shields, in close array, <lb/>
            The moving legions speed their headlong way: <lb n="120"/>
            Already in their hopes they fire the fleet, <lb/>
            And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.</p>
          <p>While every Trojan thus, and every aid, <lb/>
            Th* advice of wise Polydamas obey'd; <lb/>
            Asius alone, confiding in his car, <lb n="125"/>
            His vaunted coursers urg'd to meet the war. <lb/>
            Unhappy hero! and advis'd in vain! <lb/>
            Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain ; <lb/>
            No more those coursers with triumphant joy <lb/>
            Restore their master to the gates of Troy! <lb n="130"/>
            Black death attends behind the Grecian wall, <lb/>
            And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall! <lb/>
            Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain <lb/>
            The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain; <lb/>
            Swift through the wall their horse and chariots past, <lb n="135"/>
            The gates half-open'd to receive the lat. <lb/>
            Thither, exulting in his force, he flies ; <lb/>
            His following host with clamours rend the sides : <lb/>
            To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main, <lb/>
            Such their proud hopes, but all their hopes were vain! <lb n="140"/>
            </p>
          <p>To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend, <lb/>
            Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend; <lb/>
            This Polypœtes, great Perithous' heir, <lb/>
            And that Leonteus, like the god of war. <lb/>
            As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise ; <lb n="145"/>
            Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies : <lb/>
            Whose spreading arms, with leafy honours crown'd, <lb/>
            Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground; <lb/>
            High on the hills appears their stately form, <lb/>
            And their deep roots for ever brave the storm. <lb n="150"/>
            So graceful these, and so the shock they stand <lb/>
            Of raging Asius, and his furious band. <lb/>
            Orestes, Acamas, in front appear, <lb/>
            And CEnomaus and Thoön close the rear. <lb/>
            In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields, <lb n="155"/>
            In vain around them beat their hollow shields; <lb/>
            The fearless brothers on the Grecians call, <lb/>
            To guard their navies, and defend their wall. <lb/>
            E'en when they saw Troy's sable troops impend, <lb/>
            And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend, <lb n="160"/>
            Forth from the portals rush'd th' intrepid pair, <lb/>
            Oppos'd their breasts, and stood themselves the war. <lb/>
            So two wild boars spring furious from their den, <lb/>
            Rous'd with the cries of dogs, and voice of men; <pb n="217"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            Oil every side the crackling trees they tear, <lb n="165"/>
            And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare <lb/>
            They gnash their tusks, with fire their eyeballs roll, <lb/>
            Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul. <lb/>
            Around their heads the whistling javelins sung ; <lb/>
            With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung : <lb n="170"/>
            Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers <lb/>
            Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers : <lb/>
            To save their fleet, the last efforts they try, <lb/>
            A nd stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.</p>
          <p>As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings <lb n="175"/>
            he dreary winter on his frozen wings ; <lb/>
            Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow <lb/>
            I Descend, and whiten all the fields below : <lb/>
            So fast the darts on either army pour, <lb/>
            So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower; <lb n="180"/>
            Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields, <lb/>
            And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.</p>
          <p>With shame repuls'd, with grief and fury driven, <lb/>
            The frantic Asius thus accuses heaven : <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> In powers immortal who shall now believe ? <lb n="185"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive ? <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> What man can doubt but Troy's victorious power <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour ? <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒Το</foreign> guard the entrance of their common hive, <lb n="190"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> Darkening the rock, while, with unwearied wings, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> They strike th' assailants, and infix their stings; <lb/>
            A race determin'd, that to death contend: <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> So fierce, these Greeks their last retreat defend. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates, <lb n="195"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> Repel an army, and defraud the fates P'</p>
          <p>These empty accents mingled with the wind, <lb/>
            Nor mov'd great Jove's unalterable mind; <lb/>
            To godlike Hector and his matchless might <lb/>
            Was ow'd the glory of the destin'd fight. <lb n="200"/>
            Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried, <lb/>
            And all the gates sustain'd an equal tide; <lb/>
            Through the long walls the stony showers were heard, <lb/>
            The blaze of flames, the flash of arms, appeared. <lb/>
            The spirit of a god my breast inspire, <lb n="205"/>
            To raise each act to life, and sing with fire ! <lb/>
            While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war, <lb/>
            Secure of death, confiding in aespair ; <lb/>
            And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay, <lb/>
            With unassisting arms deplor'd the day. <lb n="210"/>
            </p><pb n="218"/>
            
          <p>E'en yet the dauntless them maintain <lb/>
            The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain <lb/>
            First Damasus, by PolypoBtes' steel <lb/>
            Pierc'd through his helmet'a brazen vizor, fell; <lb/>
            The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore ; <lb n="215"/>
            The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more! <lb/>
            Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath: <lb/>
            Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death; <lb/>
            First through the belt Hippomachus he gor'd, <lb/>
            Then sudden wav'd his unresisted sword; <lb n="220"/>
            Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke, <lb/>
            The faulchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke; <lb/>
            Iämenus, Orestes, Menon, bled; <lb/>
            And round him rose a monument of dead.</p>
          <p>Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew <lb n="225"/>
            Bold Hector and Polydamas pursue ; <lb/>
            Fierce with impatience on the works to fall, <lb/>
            And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall. <lb/>
            These on the farther bank now stood and gaz'd, <lb/>
            By heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amaz'd: <lb n="230"/>
            A signal omen stopp'd the passing host, <lb/>
            Their martial fury in their wonder lost. <lb/>
            Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies, <lb/>
            A bleeding serpent of enormous size <lb/>
            His talons truss'd; alive, and curling round, <lb n="235"/>
            He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound; <lb/>
            Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey, <lb/>
            In airy circles wings his painful way, <lb/>
            Floats on the winds, and rends the heavens with cries ; <lb/>
            Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies: <lb n="240"/>
            They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd, <lb/>
            And Jove's portent with beating hearts behold. <lb/>
            Then first Polydamas the silence broke, <lb/>
            Long weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke:</p>
          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear, <lb n="245"/>

            Calls on his host; his host obey the call; <lb/>
            With ardour follow where their leader flies: <lb/>
            Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies. <lb/>
            Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide, <lb/>
            And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide: <lb n="300"/>
            He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay, <lb/>

            Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid. <lb/>
            Close to the works their rigid siege they laid. <lb/>
            In vain the mounds and massy beams defend, <lb/>
            While these they undermine, and those they rend; <lb/>
            Upheave the piles that prop the solid wall; <lb/>
            And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall. <lb/>

          <p>Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers ; <lb/>
            And now the stones descend in heavier showers. <lb n="330"/>
            As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms, <lb/>
            And opes his cloudy magazine of storms ; <lb/>
            In winter's bleak uncomfortable reign, <lb/>
            A snowy inundation hides the plain ; <lb/>
            He stilUs the winds, and bids the skies to sleep ; <lb n="335"/>
            Then pours the silent tempest, thick and deep : <lb/>
            And first the mountain tops are cover'd o'er, <lb/>
            Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore ; <lb/>
            Bent with the weight the nodding woods are seen, <lb/>
            And one bright waste hides all the works of men: <lb n="340"/>
            The circling seas alone absorbing all, <lb/>
            Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall. <lb/>
            So from each side increas'd the stony rain, <lb/>
            And the white ruin rises o'er the plain.</p>
          <p>Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend <lb n="345"/>
            To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend; <lb/>
            Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield, <lb/>

            In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar, <lb/>
            And bears aloft his ample shield in air; <lb/>
            Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd, <lb/>
            Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold: <lb/>
            And wliile two pointed javelins arm his hands, <lb n="355"/>
            Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.</p>
          <p>So press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow, <lb/>
            Descends a lion on the flocks below: <lb/>
            So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain, <lb/>
            In sullen majesty, and stern disdain : <lb n="360"/>
            In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar, <lb/>
            And shepherds gall him with an iron war; <lb/>
            Regardless, furious, he pursues his way ; <lb/>
            He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.</p>
          <p>Resolv'd alike, divine Sarpedon glows <lb n="365"/>
            With generous rage that drives him on the foes. <lb/>
            He views the towers, and meditates their fall; <lb/>
            To sure destruction dooms th' aspiring wail: <lb/>
            Then, casting on his friend an ardent look, <lb/>
            Fir'd with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke : <lb n="370"/>

          <p>He said : his words the listening chief inspire <lb/>
            With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire ; <lb/>
            The troops pursue their leaders with delight, <lb/>
            Rush to the foe, and claim the promis'd fight. <lb n="400"/>
            Menestheus from on high the storm beheld, <lb/>
            Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field; <lb/>
            Around the walls he gaz'd, to view from far <lb/>
            What aid appeared t' avert th' approaching war, <lb/>
            And saw where Teucer with th* Ajaces stood, <lb n="405"/>
            Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood. <lb/>
            In vain he calls ; the din of helms and shields <lb/>
            Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields; <lb/>
            The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound, <lb n="409"/>
            Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.</p>
          <p>Then thus to Thoös :— <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒Η</foreign>ence with speed,' (he said,) <lb/>
            ' And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid; <lb/>

          <p>Swift as the word, the herald speeds along <lb/>
            The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng ; <lb/>
            And finds the heroes, bath'd in sweat and gore, <lb/>

          <p>Straight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care, <lb n="435"/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">̒</foreign> That done, expect me to complete the day—' <lb/>
            Then, with his seven-fold shield, he strode away. <lb/>
            With equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore, <lb/>
            Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.</p>
          <p>High on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers, <lb n="445"/>
            Like some black tempest gathering round the towers ; <lb/>
            The Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite, <lb/>
            Prepared to labour in th' unequal fight; <lb/>
            The war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise; <lb/>
            Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies. <lb n="450"/>
            Fierce Ajax first th' advancing host invades, <lb/>
            And sends the brave Epicles to the shades, <lb/>
            Sarpedon's friend; across the warrior's way, <lb/>
            Rent from the walls a rocky fragment lay; <lb/>
            In modern ages not the strongest swain <lb n="455"/>
            Could heave th' unwieldy burthen from the plain. <lb/>
            He pois'd, and swung it round; then toss'd on high; <lb/>
            It flew with force, and labour'd up the sky: <lb/>
            Full on the Lycian's helmet thundering down, <lb/>
            The ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown. <lb n="460"/>
            As skilful divers from some airy steep <lb/>
            Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep, <lb/>
            So falls Epicles; then in groans expires, <lb/>
            And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.</p>
          <p>While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew, <lb n="465"/>
            From Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew; <lb/>
            The bearded shaft the destin'd passage found; <lb/>
            And on his naked arm inflicts a wound. <lb/>
            The chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast <lb/>
            Might stop the progress of his warlike host, <lb n="470"/>
            Conceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height, <lb/>
            Retir'd reluctant from th' unfinished fight. <lb/>
            Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld <lb/>
            Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field: <lb/>
            His beating breast with generous ardour glows, <lb n="475"/>
            He springs to fight, and flies upon the foes. <lb/>
            Alcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel: <lb/>
            Deep in his breast he plung'd the pointed steel; <lb/>
            Then, from the yawning wound with fury tore <lb/>
            The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore : <lb n="480"/>
            Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound, <lb/>
            His brazen armour rings against the ground.</p>
          <p>Swift to the battlement the victor1 flies, <lb/>
            Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies ; <lb/>
            It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield : <lb n="485"/>
            The rolling ruins smoke along the field. <note type="footnote"> 1 Sarpedon. </note> <lb/>

            A mighty breach appears : the walls lie bare, <lb/>
            And, like a deluge, rushes in the war. <lb/>
            At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow, <lb/>
            And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe : <lb n="490"/>
            Fix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood, <lb/>
            And through his buckler drove the trembling wood; <lb/>
            But Jove was present in the dire debate, <lb/>
            To shield his offspring, and avert his fate. <lb/>
            The prince gave back, not meditating flight, <lb n="495"/>
            But urging vengeance and severer fight; <lb/>
            Then, rais'd with hope, and fir'd with glory's charms, <lb/>
            His fainting squadrons to new fury warms: <lb/>
            '0 where, ye Lycians ! is the strength you boast P <lb/>
            ' Your former fame, and ancient virtue lost! <lb n="500"/>
            ' The breach lies open, but your chief in vain <lb/>
            ' Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain : <lb/>

          <p>This just rebuke inflam'd the Lycian crew, <lb n="505"/>
            They join, they thicken, and th' assault renew : <lb/>
            Unmov'd th' embodied Greeks their fury dare, <lb/>
            And fix'd support the weight of all the war! <lb/>
            Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers, <lb/>
            Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers. <lb n="510"/>
            As on the confines of adjoining grounds, <lb/>
            Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds ; <lb/>
            They tug, they sweat: but neither gain, nor yield, <lb/>
            One foot, one inch, of the contended field : <lb/>
            Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall: <lb n="515"/>
            Nor these can keep, nor those can win, the wall. <lb/>
            Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound, <lb/>
            Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound ; <lb/>
            The. copious slaughter covers all the shore, <lb/>
            And the high ramparts drop with human gore. <lb n="520"/>

          <p>As when two scales are charg'd with doubtful loads, <lb/>
            From side to side the trembling balance nods, <lb/>
            (While some laborious matron, just and poor, <lb/>

            So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might, <lb/>
            With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight. <lb/>
            Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies, <lb/>
            And fires his host with loud repeated cries: <lb n="530"/>
            ' Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands, <lb/>
            Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands! <pb n="225"/>

            They hear, they run, and, gathering at his call, <lb/>
            Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall: <lb/>
            Around the works a wood of glittering spears <lb n="535"/>
            Shoots up, and all the rising host appears. <lb/>
            A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw, <lb/>
            Pointed above, and rough and gross below: <lb/>
            Not two strong men tIi' enormous weight could raise, <lb/>
            Such men as live in these degenerate days. <lb n="540"/>
            Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear <lb/>
            The snowy fleece, he toss'd and shook in air: <lb/>
            For Jove upheld, and lightened of its load <lb/>
            Th* unwieldy rock, the labour of a god. <lb/>
            Thus arm'd, before the folded gates lie came, <lb n="545"/>
            Of massy substance, and stupendous frame; <lb/>
            With iron bars and brazen hinges strong, <lb/>
            On lofty beams of solid timber hung : <lb/>
            Then thundering through the planks, with forceful sway, <lb/>
            Drives the sharp rock: the solid beams give way ; <lb n="550"/>
            The folds are shattered; from the crackling door <lb/>
            Lead the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar. <lb/>
            N ow, rushing in, the furious chief appears, <lb/>
            Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears : <lb/>
            A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came, <lb n="555"/>
            And from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame. <lb/>
            He moves a god, resistless in his course, <lb/>
            And seems a match for more than mortal force. <lb/>
            Then, pouring after, through the gaping space, <lb/>
            A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place; <lb n="560"/>
            The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly: <lb/>
            The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.</p>

            who had retired to their vessels. The Ajaxes form their troops into a <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>

            close phalanx, and put a stop to Ilector and the Trojans. Several deeds <lb/>
            of valour are performed ; Meriones, losing his spear in the encounter, re­ <lb/>
            pairs to seek another at the tent of Idomeneus: this occasions a conver­ <lb/>
            sation between these two warriors, who return together to the battle. Ido­ <lb/>
            meneus signalizes his cournge above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, <lb/>
            and Alcathous: Deiphobus and AEneas march against him, and at length <lb/>
            Idomeneus retires. Menelaus wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The <lb/>
            Trojans are repulsed in the left wing. Hector still keeps his ground <lb/>
            against the Ajaxes, till, being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, <lb/>
            Polydamas advises to call a council of war: Hector approves his advice, <lb/>
            but goes first to rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, <lb/>
            meets Ajax again, and renews the attack.</p>
          <p>The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the <lb/>

          <p>WHEN now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast <lb/>
            Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host, <lb/>
            He left them to the fates, in bloody fray <lb/>
            To toil and struggle through the well-fought day. <lb/>
            Then turned to Thracia from the field of fight, <lb n="5"/>

            No aid, he deems, to either host is given, <lb n="15"/>

            Fierce as he pass'd, the lofty mountains nod, <lb/>
            The forests shake; earth trembled as he trod, <lb n="30"/>

            From realm to realm three ample strides he took, <lb/>

          <p>He said, and rous'd the soul in every breast; <lb/>
            Urged with desire of fame, beyond the rest, <lb/>
            Forth march'd Deïphobus; but marching held, <lb/>
            Before his wary steps, his ample shield. <lb/>
            Bold Merion aim'd a stroke, nor aim'd it wide ; <lb n="215"/>
            The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide ; <lb/>
            But pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand, <lb/>
            The point broke short, and sparkled in the sand. <lb/>
            The Trojan warrior, touched with timely fear, <lb/>
            On the rais'd orb to distance bore the spear: <lb n="220"/>
            The Greek retreating mourn'd his frustrate blow, <lb/>
            And curs'd the treacherous lance that spar'd a foe; <lb/>
            Then to the ships with surly speed he went, <lb/>
            To seek a surer javelin in his tent.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows, <lb n="225"/>
            The tumult thickens, and the clamour grow . <lb/>
            By Teucer's arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds, <lb/>
            The son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds. <lb/>
            Ere yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led, <lb/>
            In fair Pedseus' verdant pastures bred, <lb n="230"/>
            The youth had dwelt; remote from war's alarms, <lb/>
            And bless'd in bright Medesicaste's arms: <lb/>
            (This nymph, the fruit of Priam's ravish'd joy, <lb/>
            Allied the warrior to the house of Troy.) <lb/>
            To Troy, when glory call'd his arms, he came: <lb n="235"/>
            And match'd the bravest of her chiefs in fame: <lb/>
            With Priam's sons, a guardian of the throne, <lb/>
            He liv'd, belov'd and honour'd as his own. <lb/>
            Him Teucer pierc'd between the throat and car: <lb/>
            He groans beneath the Telamonian spear. <lb n="240"/>
            As from some far-seen mountain's airy crown. <lb/>
            Subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down, <lb/>
            And soils its verdant tresses on the ground: <lb/>
            So falls the youth; his arms the fall resound. <lb/>
            Then, Teucer rushing to despoil the dead, <lb n="245"/>
            From Hector's hand a shining javelin fled: <lb/>
            He saw, And shunn'd the death; the forceful dart <lb/>
            Sung on, and pierc'd Amphimachus's heart, <lb/>
            Cteatus son, of Neptune's forceful line ; <lb/>
            Vain was his courage, and his race divine! <lb n="250"/>
            Prostrate he falls; his clanging arms resound, <lb/>
            And his broad buckler thunders on the ground. <lb/>

            To seize his beamy helm the victor flies, <lb/>
            And just had fasten'd on the dazzling prize, <lb/>
            When Ajax' manly arm a javelin flung ; <lb n="255"/>
            Full on the shield s round boss the weapon rung; <lb/>
            He felt the shock, nor more was doom'a to feel, <lb/>
            Secure in mail, and sheath'd in shining steel. <lb/>
            Repuls'd he yields; the victor Greeks obtain <lb/>
            The spoils contested, and bear off the slain. <lb n="260"/>
            Between the leaders of th' Athenian line, <lb/>
            (Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,) <lb/>
            Deplor'd Amphimachus, sad object! lies ; <lb/>
            Imbrius remains the fierce Ajaces' prize. <lb/>
            As two grim lions bear across the lawn, <lb n="265"/>

            In their fell jaws high lifting through the wood, <lb/>

            Toss'd like a ball. and whirl'd in air away, <lb/>
            At Hector's feet the gory visage lay.</p>

            And breathes destruction to the Trojan bands. <lb/>
            Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet, <lb/>
            He finds the lanee-fam'd Idomen of Crete; <lb/>
            His pensive brow the generous care express'd <lb/>

            Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld <lb n="420"/>
            Rush like a fiery torrent round the field, <lb/>
            Their force embodied in a tide they pour; <lb/>
            The rising combat sounds along the shore : <lb/>
            As warring winds, in Sirius' sultry reign, <lb/>
            From different quarters sweep the sandy plain ; <lb n="425"/>

            Met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken'd heaven. <lb/>
            All dreadful glar'd the iron face of war, <lb n="430"/>
            Bristled with upright spears, that flash'd afar; <lb/>
            Dire was the gleam of breast-plates, helms, and shields, <lb/>

            While Neptune, rising from his azure main, <lb/>
            Warr'd on the king of heaven with stern disdain, <lb/>

            Proud of himself, and of th' imagin'd bride, <lb n="465"/>

            The wary Cretan, as his foe drew near, <lb/>
            Full on his throat discharg'd the forceful spear: <lb n="490"/>
            Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide, <lb/>
            And, glitter'd, extant, at the farther side. <lb/>
            As when the mountain oak, or poplar tall, <lb/>
            Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral, <lb/>
            Groans to the oft-heav'd axe, with many a wound, <lb n="495"/>
            Then spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground: <lb/>
            So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day, <lb/>
            And stretch'd before his much-lov'd coursers lay. <lb/>
            He grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore, <lb/>
            And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore. <lb n="500"/>
            Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear, <lb/>

            Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood <lb/>
            Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood. <lb/>
            But CEnomas receiv'd the Cretan's stroke; <lb n="640"/>
            The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke; <lb/>
            It ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound, <lb/>
            And roll'd the smoking entrails to the ground. <lb/>
            Stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath, <lb/>

            Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near, <lb/>
            And on his loaded arm discharged his spear. <lb/>
            He drops the weight, disabled with the pain; <lb n="670"/>
            The hollow helmet rings against the plain. <lb/>
            Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey, <lb/>

            The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends. <lb/>
            His wounded brother good Polites tends; <lb n="675"/>
            Around his waist his pious arms he threw, <lb/>
            And from the rage of combat gently drew : <lb/>

            Bold Aphareus by great Æneas bled; <lb/>
            As tow'rd the chief he turn'd his daring head,<lb n="685"/>
            He pierc'd his throat; the bending head, depressed <lb/>

            His shield revers'd o'er the fall'n warrior lies; <lb/>
            And everlasting slumber seals his eyes. <lb/>
            Antilochus, as Thoon turn' l him round,<lb n="690"/>

            Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound. <lb/>
            Bending he fell. and, doubled to the ground, <lb n="720"/>

            High towering in the front, the warrior came. <lb/>
            First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown; <lb/>
            The lance far distant by the winds was blown. <lb/>
            Nor pierc'd Pisander through Atrides' shield; <lb/>
            Pisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.<lb n="760"/>
            Not so discouraged, to the future blind, <lb/>
            Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind; <lb/>
            Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord <lb/>
            Like lightning brandish'd his far-beaming sword. <lb/>
            His left arm high oppos'd the shining shield;<lb n="765"/>
            His right, beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held; <lb/>
            (An olive's cloudy grain the handle made, <lb/>
            Distinct with studs ; and brazen was the blade ;) <lb/>
            This on the helm discharged a noble blow; <lb/>
            The plume dropped nodding to the plain below,<lb n="770"/>
            Shorn from the crest. Atrides wav'd his steel; <lb/>
            Deep through his front the weighty faulchion fell; <lb/>
            The crashing bones before its force gave way; <lb/>
            In dust and blood the groaning hero lay ; <lb/>
            Force'd from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,<lb n="775"/>
            The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore. <lb/>
            The fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled, <lb/>
            Tore off his arms, and loud exulting said:</p>

            Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side; <lb/>
            They ceas'd; and thus the chief of Troy replied :</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the increasing <lb/>
            clamour of the war, and hastens to Agamemnon : on his way he meets <lb/>
            that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the extremity <lb/>
            of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night, <lb/>
            which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that, <lb/>
            wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army <lb/>
            with their presence; which advice is pursued. Juno seeing the parti­ <lb/>
            ality of Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to overreach him; she <lb/>
            sets off her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchants <lb/>
            him) obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to <lb/>
            the god of Sleep, and with some difficulty persuades him to seal the eves <lb/>
            of Jupiter; this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first <lb/>
            sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid <lb/>
            asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the <lb/>
            Greeks; Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax, <lb/>
            and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed ; till the Trojans, <lb/>
            much distressed, are obliged to give way; the lesser Ajax signalizes him­ <lb/>
            self in a particular manner.</p>
          <p>BUT nor the genial feast, nor flowing bowl, <lb/>
            Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul ;1 <lb/>
            His startled ears th' increasing cries attend; <lb/>
            Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:</p>
          <p>‘ What new alarms, divine Machaon, say,<lb n="5"/>
            ‘ What mix'd events attend this mighty day P <lb/>
            ‘ Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet, <lb/>
            ‘ And now come full, and thicken to the fleet! <lb/>
            ‘ Here, with the cordial draught dispel thy care, <lb/>
            ‘Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare, <lb/>
            ‘ Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore, <lb/>
            ‘ While I th' adventures of the day explore.'</p>
          <p>He said : and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield, <lb/>
            (His valiant offspring,) hasten'd to the field; <lb/>
            (That day, the son his father's buckler bore;) <lb/>
            Then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door <lb/>
            Soon as the prospect open'd to his view, <lb/>
            His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew ; <lb/>
            Dire disarray ! the tumult of the fight, <lb/>
            The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.<note type="footnote"> 1 At the end of the eleventh book we left Nestor at the table with Ma. <lb/>

            As when old Ocean's silent surface sleeps, <lb/>
            The waves just heaving on the purple deeps; <lb/>
            While yet th' expected tempest hangs on high, <lb/>
            Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky, <lb/>

            Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away. <lb/>
            While wavering counsels thus his mind engage, <lb/>
            Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage; <lb/>
            To join the host, or to the general haste; <lb/>
            Debating long, he fixes on the last :<lb n="30"/>
            Yet, as he moves, the fight his bosom warms ; <lb/>
            The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms ; <lb/>
            The gleaming faulchions flash, the javelins fly; <lb/>
            Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.</p>
          <p>Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,<lb n="35"/>
            By tardy steps ascending from the fleet; <lb/>
            The king of men, Ulysses the divine, <lb/>
            And who to Tydeus owes his noble line. <lb/>
            (Their ships at distance from the battle stand, <lb/>
            In lines advanc'd along the shelving strand;<lb n="40"/>
            Whose bay the fleet unable to contain <lb/>
            At length, beside the margin of the main, <lb/>

            Supported on their spears they took their way,<lb n="45"/>
            Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day. <lb/>
            Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast, <lb/>
            Whom thus the general of the host address'd:</p>
          <p>‘ O grace and glory of th' Achaian name ! <lb/>
            ‘ What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame ?<lb n="50"/>
            ‘ Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill'd, <lb/>

          <p>Gerenian Nestor then: ‘ So Fate has will'd; <lb/>

            ‘ Not he that thunders from th' aerial bower, <lb/>

            And own the terrors of th' almighty hand! <lb/>
            So lies great Hector prostrate on the shore ; <lb/>
            His slackened hand deserts the lance it bore; <lb/>
            His following shield the fallen chief o'erspread ; <lb/>
            Beneath his helmet dropped his fainting head; <lb n="490"/>
            His load of armour, sinking to the ground, <lb/>
            Clanks on the field: a dead and hollow sound. <lb/>
            Loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain ; <lb/>
            Greece sees, in hope, Troy's great defender slain: <lb/>
            All spring to seize him: storms of arrows fly; <lb n="495"/>
            And thicker javelins intercept the sky. <lb/>
            In vain an iron tempest hisses round: <lb/>
            He lies protected and without a wound. <lb/>
            Polydamas, Agenor the divine, <lb/>
            The pious warrior of Anchises' line, <lb n="500"/>
            And each bold leader of the Lysian band, <lb/>
            With covering shields (a friendly circle) stand. <lb/>
            His mournful followers, with assistant care, <lb/>
            The groaning hero to his chariot bear; <lb/>
            His foaming coursers, swifter than the. wind <lb n="505"/>
            Speed to the town, and leave the war behind.</p>
          <p>When now they touch'd the mead's enamell'd side, <lb/>
            Where gentle Xanthus rolls his easy tide, <lb/>
            With watery drops the chief they sprinkle round, <lb/>
            Placed on the margin of the flowery ground. <lb n="510"/>
            Rais’d on his knees, he now ejects the gore; <lb/>
            Now faints anew, low sinking on the shore: <lb/>
            By fits he breathes, half views the fleeting skies, <lb/>
            And seals again, by fits, his swimming eyes.</p>
          <p>Soon as the Greeks the chief's retreat beheld, <lb n="515"/>
            With double fury each invades the field. <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            Oïlean Ajax first his javelin sped, <lb/>
            Pierced by whose point the son of Enops bled; <lb/>
            (Satnius the brave, whom beauteous Neïs bore <lb/>
            Amidst her flocks, on Satnio's silver shore.) <lb n="520"/>
            Struck through the belly's rim, the warrior lies <lb/>
            Supine, and shades eternal veil his eyes. <lb/>
            An arduous battle rose around the dead; <lb/>
            By turns the Greeks, by turns the Trojans, bled.</p>
          <p>Fir'd with revenge, Polydamas drew near, <lb n="525"/>
            And at Prothoenor shook the trembling spear: <lb/>
            The driving javelin through his shoulder thrust, <lb/>
            lie sinks to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.</p>
          <p>‘ Lo ! thus' (the victor cnes) ' we rule the field, <lb/>
            ‘ And thus their arms the race of Panthus wield: <lb n="530"/>
            ‘ From this unerring hand there flies no dart, <lb/>
            ‘ But bathes its point within a Grecian heart. <lb/>
            ‘ Propp'd on that spear to which thou ow'st thy fall, <lb/>
            ‘ Go, guide thy darksome steps to Pluto's dreary hall.'</p>
          <p>He said, and sorrow touched each Argive breast ; <lb n="535"/>
            The soul of Ajax bum'd above the rest. <lb/>
            As by his side the groaning warrior fell, <lb/>
            At the fierce foe he lanced his piercing steel; <lb/>
            The foe, reclining, shunn'd the fiying death ; <lb/>
            But Fate, Archilochus, demands thy breath; <lb n="540"/>
            Thy lofty birth no succour could impart, <lb/>
            The wings of death o'ertook thee on the dart: <lb/>
            Swift to perform heaven's fatal will it fled, <lb/>
            Full on the juncture of the neck and head, <lb/>
            And took the joint, and cut the nerves in twain ; <lb n="545"/>
            The drooping head first tumbled to the plain : <lb/>
            So just the stroke, that yet the body stood <lb/>
            Erect, then roll'd along the sands in blood.</p>
          <p>‘ Here, proud Polydamas, here turn thy eyes!' <lb/>
            (The towering Ajax loud-insulting cries:) <lb n="550"/>
            ‘ Say, is this chief, extended on the plain, <lb/>
            ‘ A worthy vengeance for Prothœnor slain P <lb/>

          <p>He spake, and smil'd severe, for well he knew <lb/>
            The bleeding youth: Troy sadden'd at the view. <lb/>
            But furious Acamas avenged his cause; <lb/>

            ‘ A victim ow'd to my brave brother's death. <lb/>
            ‘Not unappeas'd he enters Pluto's gate, <lb/>
            ‘Who leaves a brother to revenge his fate.'</p>
          <p>Heart-piercing anguish struck the Grecian host, <lb/>
            But touch'd the breast of bold Peneleus most: <lb n="570"/>
            At the proud boaster he directs his course; <lb/>
            The boaster flies, and shuns superior force. <lb/>
            But young Ilioneus received the spear; <lb/>
            Ilioneus, his father's only care: <lb/>
            (Phorbas the rich, of all the Trojan train <lb n="575"/>
            Whom Hermes lov'd, and taught the arts of gain:) <lb/>
            Full in his eye the weapon chanc'd to fall, <lb/>
            And from the fibres scoop'd the rooted ball, <lb/>
            Drove through the neck, and hurl'd him to the plain : <lb/>

            Swift his broad faulchion fierce Peneleus spread, <lb/>
            And from the spouting shoulders struck his head ; <lb/>
            To earth at once the head and helmet fly : <lb/>
            The lance, yet sticking through the bleeding eye, <lb/>
            The victor seiz'd; and as aloft he shook <lb n="585"/>
            The gory visage, thus insulting spoke:</p>
          <p>‘ Trojans! your great Ilioneus behold! <lb/>
            ‘ Haste, to his father let the tale be told. <lb/>
            ‘ Let his high roofs resound with frantic woe, <lb/>

            The Trojans hear, they tremble, and they fly : <lb/>

          <p>Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector in <lb/>
            a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks; he is highly incensed <lb/>
            at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions; she is <lb/>
            then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of the <lb/>
            gods, attempts with extraordinary address to incense them against Ju­ <lb/>
            piter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he is <lb/>
            ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo obey <lb/>
            the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle, to <lb/>
            which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo rein­ <lb/>
            spires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle marches be­ <lb/>
            fore him with his ægis, and turns the fortune of the fight. He breaks <lb/>
            down great part of the Grecian wall; the Trojans rush in, and attempt <lb/>
            to fire the first line of the fleet, but are yet repelled by the greater Ajax <lb/>
            with a prodigious slaughter.</p>
          <p>Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound, <lb/>
            And many a chief lay gasping on the ground; <lb/>
            Then stopped and panted, where the chariots lie; <lb/>
            Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, awaken'd from his dream of love, <lb n="5"/>
            On Ida's summit sat imperial Jove; <lb/>
            Round the wide fields he cast a careful view, <lb/>
            There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue ; <lb/>
            These proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain ; <lb/>
            And, midst the war, the monarch of the main. <pb n="265"/>

            Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies, <lb/>
            (His sad associates round with weeping eyes,) <lb/>
            Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath, <lb/>
            His senses wandering to the verge of death. <lb/>
            The god beheld him with a pitying look, <lb n="15"/>
            And thus, incens'd, to fraudful Juno spoke :</p>
          <p>‘0 thou, still adverse to th' eternal will, <lb/>

            ‘From the vast concave of the spangled sky, <lb/>

            ‘And all the raging gods oppos'd in vain ?<lb/>
            ‘Headlong I hurl'd them from th’ Olympian hall, <lb/>
            ‘Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall. <lb/>
            ‘For godlike Hercules these deeds were done, <lb/>
            ‘Nor seem'd the vengeance worthy such a son ;1 <lb n="30"/>

          <p>The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn'd, <lb/>

            ‘ Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield, <lb/>

            On his brave head a crested helm he placed, <lb/>

            And thus inflam'd him, pointing to the dead;</p>
          <p>' Lo, Melanippus! lo where Dolops lies ; <lb/>
            ‘ And is it thus our royal kinsman dies P <lb n="655"/>
            ‘ O'ermatch'd he falls ; to two at once a prey, <lb/>
            ‘ And lo, they bear the bloody arms away! <lb/>
            ‘ Come on-a distant war no longer wage, <lb/>
            ‘ But hand to hand thy country's foes engage: <lb/>
            ‘ Till Greece at once, and all her glory, end; <lb n="660"/>
            ‘ Or Ilion from her towery height descend, <lb/>
            ‘ Heav'd from the lowest stone ; and bury all <lb/>

          <p>Hector (this said) rush'd forward on the foes : <lb/>
            With equal ardour Melanippus glows : <lb n="665"/>
            Then Ajax thus; ‘ 0 Greeks ! respect your fame, <lb/>
            ‘Respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame : <lb/>
            ‘ Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire, <lb/>
            ‘ And catch from breast to breast the noble fire. <lb/>
            ‘ On valour's side the odds of combat lie, <lb n="670"/>
            ‘ The brave live glorious, or lamented die ; <lb/>
            ‘ The wretch that trembles in the field of fame, <lb/>
            ‘ Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.'</p>
          <p>His generous sense he not in vain imparts ; <lb/>
            It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts. <lb n="675"/>
            They join, they throng, they thicken at his call, <lb/>
            And flank the navy with a brazen wall; <lb/>
            Shields touching shields, in order blaze above, <lb/>
            And stop the Trojans, though impell'd by Jove. <lb/>
            The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause, <lb n="680"/>
            Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause. <lb/>
            ‘ Is there* (he said) ‘ in arms a youth like you, <lb/>
            ‘ So strong to fight, so active to pursue ? <lb/>
            ‘ Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed ?<lb/>
            ‘ Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed.’ <lb n="685"/>
            </p>
          <p>He said, and backwards to the lines retir'd ; <lb/>
            Forth rush'd the youth, with martial fury fir'd, <lb/>
            Beyond the foremost ranks ; his lance he threw <lb/>
            And round the black battalions cast his view. <lb/>
            The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear, <lb n="690"/>
            While the swift javelin hiss'd along in air. <lb/>
            Advancing Melanippus met the dart <lb/>
            With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart: <lb/>
            Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound, <lb/>
            And his broad buckler rings against the ground. <lb n="695"/>
            The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize ; <lb/>
            Thus on a roe the well-breath'd beagle flies, <lb/>
            And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart <lb/>
            The distant hunter sent into his heart. <lb/>
            Observing Hector to the rescue flew; <lb n="700"/>
            Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew : <lb/>
            So when a savage, ranging o'er the plain, <lb/>
            Has torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd swain; <lb/>
            While, conscious of the deed, he glares around, <lb/>
            And hears the gathering multitude resound, <lb n="705"/>
            Timely he flies the yet untasted food, <lb/>
            And gains the friendly shelter of the wood. <lb/>
            So fears the youth ; all Troy with shouts pursue, <lb/>
            While stones and darts in mingled tempests flew ; <pb n="281"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            But, entered in the Grecian ranks, he turns <lb n="710"/>
            His manly breast, and with new fury burns.</p>
          <p>Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove, <lb/>
            Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove : <lb/>
            The sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer, <lb/>
            The Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair; <lb n="715"/>
            But lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands, <lb/>
            Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands <lb/>
            On Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,. <lb/>
            To view the navy blazing to the skies ; <lb/>
            Then, nor till then, the scale of war shah turn, <lb n="720"/>
            The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn. <lb/>
            These fates revolv'd in his almighty mind, <lb/>
            He raises Hector to the work design'd, <lb/>
            Bids him with more than mortal fury glow, <lb/>
            And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe. <lb n="725"/>
            So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call, <lb/>
            Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall. <lb/>
            Not with more rage a conflagration rolls, <lb/>
            Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles. <lb/>
            He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow <lb n="730"/>
            Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow: <lb/>
            The radiant helmet on his temple burns, <lb/>
            Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns: <lb/>
            For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown, <lb/>
            And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one. <lb n="735"/>
            Unhappy glories! for his fate was near, <lb/>
            Due to stem Pallas, and Pelides' spear: <lb/>
            Yet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay, <lb/>
            And gave what Fate allow'd, the honours of a day !</p>
          <p>Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes <lb n="740"/>
            Burn at each foe, and single every prize ; <lb/>
            Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight, <lb/>
            He points his ardour, and exerts his might. <lb/>
            The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower, <lb/>
            On all sides batter'd, yet resists his power: <lb n="745"/>
            So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main, <lb/>
            By winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain; <lb/>
            Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow <lb/>
            And sees the watery mountains break below. <lb/>
            Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall <lb n="750"/>
            Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all; <lb/>
            Bursts as a wave that from the clouds impends, <lb/>
            And swell'd with tempests on the ship descends ; <lb/>
            White are the decks with foam ; the winds aloud <lb/>
            Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud: <lb n="755"/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            Pale. trembling, tir'd, the sailors freeze with fears; <lb/>
            And instant death on every wave appears. <lb/>
            So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet, <lb/>
            The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.</p>
          <p>As when a lion rushing from his den, <lb n="760"/>
            Amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen, <lb/>
            (Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed, <lb/>
            At large expatiate o'er the ranker mead;) <lb/>
            Leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes: <lb/>
            The trembling herdsman far to distance flies : <lb n="765"/>
            Some lordly bull (the rest dispers'd and fled) <lb/>
            He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead. <lb/>
            Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew <lb/>
            All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew. <lb/>
            Mycenean Periphes, a mighty name, <lb n="770"/>
            In wisdom great, in arms well-known to fame: <lb/>
            The minister of stern Eurystheus' ire, <lb/>
            Against Alcides ; Copreus was his sire : <lb/>
            The son redeem'd the honours of the race, <lb/>
            A son as generous as the sire was base; <lb n="775"/>
            O'er all his country's youth conspicuous far <lb/>
            In every virtue, or of peace or war: <lb/>
            But doom'd to Hector s stronger force to yield! <lb/>
            Against the margin of his ample shield <lb/>
            He struck his hasty foot: his heels upsprung; <lb n="780"/>
            Supine he fell, his brazen helmet rung. <lb/>
            On the fall'n chief th' invading Trojan press'd, <lb/>
            And plung'd the pointed javelin in his breast. <lb/>
            His circling friends, who strove to guard too late <lb/>
            Th' unhappy hero, fled, or shar'd his fate. <lb n="785"/>
            </p>
          <p>Chas'd from the foremost line, the Grecian train <lb/>
            Now man the next, receding tow'rd the main: <lb/>
            Wedg'd in one body at the tents they stand, <lb/>
            Wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band. <lb/>
            Now manly shame forbids tli' inglorious flight; <lb n="790"/>
            Now fear itself confines them to the fight: <lb/>
            Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most <lb/>
            (The sage preserver of the Grecian host) <lb/>
            Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores; <lb/>
            And by their parents, by themselves, implores: <lb n="795"/>
            </p>
          <p>' O friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame <lb/>
            ‘ With mutual honour, and with mutual shame ! <lb/>
            ‘ Think of your hopes, your fortunes ; all the care <lb/>
            ‘ Your wives, your infants, and your parents, share : <lb/>
            ‘ Think of each living father's reverend head; <lb n="800"/>
            ‘ Think of each ancestor with glory dead; <pb n="283"/>

            ‘ Absent, by me they speak, by me they sue; <lb/>
            ‘ They ask their safety and their fame from you t <lb/>
            ' The gods their fates on this one action lay, <lb/>
            ‘ And all are lost if you desert the day.' <lb n="805"/>
            </p>
          <p>He spoke, and round him breath'd heroic fires ; <lb/>
            Minerva seconds what the sage inspires. <lb/>
            The mist of darkness Jove around them threw <lb/>
            She cleared, restoring all the war to view: <lb/>
            A sudden ray shot beaming o'er the plain, <lb n="810"/>
            And shew'd the shores, the navy, and the main. <lb/>
            Hector they saw, and all who fly or fight, <lb/>
            The scene wide opening to the blaze of light. <lb/>
            First of the field, great Ajax strikes their eyes, <lb/>
            His port majestic, and his ample size: <lb n="815"/>
            A ponderous mace, with studs of iron crown'd, <lb/>
            Full twenty cubits long, he swings around. <lb/>
            Nor fights like others fix'd to certain stands, <lb/>
            But looks a moving tower above the bands ; <lb/>
            High on the decks, with vast gigantic stride, <lb n="820"/>
            The godlike hero stalks from side to side. <lb/>
            So when a horseman from the watery mead <lb/>
            (Skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed) <lb/>
            Drives four fair coursers, practis'd to obey, <lb/>
            To some great city through the public way ; <lb n="825"/>
            Safe in his art, as side by side they run, <lb/>
            He shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one ; <lb/>
            And now to this, and now to that he flies ; <lb/>
            Admiring numbers follow with their eyes. <lb/>
            From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew, <lb n="830"/>
            No less the wonder of the warring crew. <lb/>
            As furious, Hector thunder'd threats aloud, <lb/>
            And rush'd enrag'd before the Trojan crowd ; <lb/>
            Then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores <lb/>
            Lay ranked contiguous on the bending shores. <lb n="835"/>
            So the strong eagle from his airy height, <lb/>
            Who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight, <lb/>
            Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food, <lb/>
            And stooping darkens with his wings the flood. <lb/>
            Jove leads him on with his almighty hand, <lb n="840"/>
            And breathes fierce spirits in his following band. <lb/>
            The warring nations meet, the battle roars, <lb/>
            Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores. <lb/>
            Thou would'st have thought, so furious was their fire, <lb/>
            Nor force could tame them, and no toil could tire; <lb n="845"/>
            As if new vigour from new fights they won, <lb/>
            And the long battle was but then begun. <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            Greece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war, <lb/>
            Secure of death, confiding in despair ; <lb/>
            Troy in proud hopes already view'd the main <lb n="850"/>
            Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain : <lb/>
            Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair, <lb/>
            And each contends, as his were all the war.</p>
          <p>'Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand <lb/>
            First seiz'd a ship on that contested strand ; <lb n="855"/>
            The same which dead Protesilaüs bore, <lb/>
            The first that touch'd th* unhappy Trojan shore. <lb/>
            For this in arms the warring nations stood, <lb/>
            And bath'd their generous breasts with mutual blood. <lb/>
            No room to poise the lance, or bend the bow; <lb n="860"/>
            But hand to hand, and man to man they grow: <lb/>
            Wounded, they wound ; and seek each other's hearts <lb/>
            With faulchions, axes, swords, and shorten'd darts. <lb/>
            The faulchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound, <lb/>
            Swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground: <lb n="865"/>
            With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed, <lb/>
            And slaughter'a heroes swell the dreadful tide.</p>
          <p>Still raging Hector with his ample hand <lb/>
            Grasps the high stern, and gives his loud command :</p>
          <p>‘ Haste, bring the flames ! the toil of ten long years <lb n="870"/>
            ‘ Is finish'd; and the day desir'd appears! <lb/>
            ‘ This happy day with acclamations greet, <lb/>
            ‘ Bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet. <lb/>
            ‘ The coward counsels of a timorous throng <lb/>
            ‘ Of reverend dotards, check'd our glory long: <lb n="875"/>
            ‘ Too long Jove lull'd us with lethargic charms, <lb/>
            ‘ But now in peals of thunder calls to arms ; <lb/>
            ‘ In this great day he crowns our full desires, <lb/>
            ‘ Wakes all our force, and seconds all our fires.'</p>
          <p>He spoke. The warriors, at his fierce command, <lb n="880"/>
            Pour a new deluge on the Grecian band. <lb/>
            E'en Ajax paus'd, (so thick the javelins fly,) <lb/>
            Stepp'd back, and doubted or to live, or die. <lb/>
            Yet where the oars are placed, he stands to wait <lb/>
            What chief approaching dares attempt his fate : <lb n="885"/>
            E'en to the last his naval charge defends, <lb/>
            Now shakes his spear, now lifts, and now pretends ; <lb/>
            E'en yet, the Greeks with piercing shouts inspires, <lb/>
            Amidst attacks, and deaths, and darts, and fires :</p>
          <p>‘ O friends! O heroes! names for ever dear, <lb n="890"/>
            ‘ Once sons of Mars, and thunderbolts of war! <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book) <lb/>
            entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks with <lb/>
            Achilles' troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time <lb/>
            charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without farther <lb/>
            pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers of <lb/>
            Achilles are described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his <lb/>
            friend, after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The <lb/>
            Trojans, at the sight of Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for <lb/>
            that hero, arc cast into the utmost consternation: he beats them off <lb/>
            from the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter <lb/>
            was averse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are <lb/>

          <p>But, mindful of the Gods, Achilles went <lb/>
            To the rich coffer in his shady tent: <lb/>
            There lay on heaps his various garments roll'd, <lb n="270"/>

            (The presents of the silver-footed dame;) <lb/>
            From thence he took a bowl of antique frame, <lb/>

            His eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Great Jove consents to half the chief's request, <lb/>

            Back to his tent the stern Achilles flies,<lb n="310"/>
            And waits the combat with impatient eyes.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the troops, beneath Patroclus' care, <lb/>
            Invade the Trojans, and commence the war. <lb/>

            All rise in arms, and with a general cry <lb/>

            Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,<lb n="320"/>
            So loud their clamours, and so keen their arms ; <lb/>
            Their rising rage Patroclus' breath inspires, <lb/>
            Who thus inflames them with heroic fires :</p>
          <p>‘ Oh warriors, partners of Achilles' praise! <lb/>
            ‘ Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days :<lb n="325"/>
            ‘ Your godlike master let your acts proclaim, <lb/>

            ‘ And humble the proud monarch whom you save.'</p>
          <p>Joyful they heard, and, kindling as he spoke,<lb n="330"/>
            Flew to the fleet, involv'd in fire and smoke. <lb/>
            From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound, <lb/>
            The hollow ships return a deeper sound. <lb/>
            The war stood still, and all around them gaz'd, <lb/>
            When great Achilles' shining armour blaz'd:<lb n="335"/>
            Troy saw, and thought the dread Achilles nigh; <lb/>
            At once they see, they tremble, and they By.</p>
          <p>Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew, <lb/>
            Where the war raged, and where the tumult grew. <lb/>
            Close to the stern of that fam'd ship, which bore<lb n="340"/>
            Unbless'd Protesilaus to Ilion's shore, <lb/>
            The great Pæonian, bold Pyræchmes, stood, <lb/>
            Who led his bands from Axius’3 winding flood: <lb/>
            His shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound ; <lb/>
            The groaning warrior pants upon the ground.<lb n="345"/>
            His troops, that see their country's glory slain, <lb/>
            Fly diverse, scatter'd o'er the distant plain. <lb/>
            Patroclus' arm forbids the spreading fires, <lb/>
            And from the half-burn'd ship proud Troy retires, <lb/>
            Clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies,<lb n="350"/>
            In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies; <lb/>
            Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends, <lb/>
            And loud acclaim the starry region rends. <lb/>
            So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head, <lb/>
            O'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread:<lb n="355"/>
            Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray, <lb/>
            Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day: <lb/>
            The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise, <lb/>
            And streams, and vales, and forests strike the eyes ; <lb/>
            The smiling scene wide opens to the sight,<lb n="360"/>

          <p>But Troy repulsed, and scattered o'er the plains, <lb/>
            Forc'd from the navy, yet the fight maintains. <lb/>
            Now every Greek some hostile hero slew, <lb/>
            But still the foremost bold Patroclus flew:<lb n="365"/>
            As Areïlycus had turn'd him round, <lb/>
            Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound; <lb/>
            The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown, <lb/>
            The thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone : <lb/>
            Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas, was thy chance,<lb n="370"/>
            Thy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lancet <lb/>
            Phylides’5 dart, as Amphiclus drew nigh, <lb/>
            His blow prevented, and transpierc'd his thigh, <lb/>
            Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away; <lb/>
            In darkness and in death the warrior lay.<lb n="375"/>
            </p>
          <p>In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand, <lb/>
            And two bold brothers of the Lycian band: <lb/>
            By great Antilochus, Antymnius dies, <lb/>
            Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies. <lb/>
            Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother's wound,<lb n="380"/>
            Defends the breathless carcass on the ground <lb/>
            Furious he flies, his murderer to engage, <lb/>
            But godlike Thrasymed prevents his rage: <lb/>
            Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow; <lb/>
            His arm falls spouting on the dust below :<lb n="385"/>
            He sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er, <lb/>
            And vents his soul, effus'd with gushing gore.</p>
          <p>Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed, <lb/>
            Sarpedon s friends, Amisodarus' seed ;6 <lb/>
            Amisodarus, who, by Furies led,<lb n="390"/>

            Skill'd in the dart in vain, his sons expire, <lb/>
            And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.</p>
          <p>Stopp'd in the tumult Cleobulus lies, <lb/>
            Beneath Oïleus’ arm, a living prize;<lb n="395"/>
            A living prize not long the Trojan stood: <lb/>
            The thirsty faulchion drank his reeking blood; <lb/>
            Plung'd in his throat the smoking weapon lies : <lb/>
            Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.</p>
          <p>Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,<lb n="400"/>
            Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came; <lb/>
            In vain their javelins at each other flew; <lb/>
            Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew : <lb/>

            The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped <lb/>

            The head, divided by a stroke so just, <lb/>
            Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.</p>
          <p>O'ertaken Acamas by Merion bleeds,<lb n="410"/>
            Pierc'd through the shoulders as he mounts his steeds : <lb/>
            Back from the car he tumbles to the ground; <lb/>
            His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.</p>
          <p>Next Erymas was doomed his fate to feel: <lb/>
            His open'd mouth receiv'd the Cretan steel;<lb n="415"/>
            Beneath the brain the point a passage tore, <lb/>
            Crash'd the thin bones, and ground the teeth in gore. <lb/>
            His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood; <lb/>
            He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.</p>
          <p>As when the flocks neglected by the swain<lb n="420"/>
            (Or kids, or lambs) lie scatter'd o'er the plain, <lb/>
            A troop of wolves th' unguarded charge survey, <lb/>
            And rend the trembling, unresisting prey: <lb/>
            Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came: <lb/>
            Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.<lb n="425"/>
            </p>
          <p>But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim'd, <lb/>
            Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flam'd: <lb/>
            The Trojan chief, experienc'd in the field, <lb/>
            O'er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield, <lb/>
            Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,<lb n="430"/>
            And on his buckler caught the ringing shower. <lb/>
            He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise, <lb/>
            Yet stops, and turns, and saves his lov'd allies.</p>
          <p>As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms, <lb/>

            Dark o'er the fields th'ascending vapour flies, <lb/>
            And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies: <lb/>
            So from the ships, along the dusky lain, <lb/>
            Dire Fright and Terror drove the Trojan train. <lb/>
            E'en Hector fled; through heaps of disarray<lb n="440"/>
            The fiery coursers forc'd their lord away : <lb/>
            While far behind his Trojans fall confus'd, <lb/>
            Wedg’d in the trench, in one vast carnage bruis'd. <lb/>
            Chariots on chariots roll; the clashing spokes <lb/>

            In vain they labour up the steepv mound ; <lb/>

            Fierce on the rear, with shouts, Patroclus flies; <lb/>
            Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies ; <lb/>
            Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;<lb n="450"/>

            Where horse, and arms, and chariots, lie o'erthrown, <lb/>
            And bleeding heroes under axles groan. <lb/>
            No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew ; <lb/>
            From bank to bank th' immortal coursers flew, <lb/>
            High-bounding o'er the fosse : the whirling car<lb n="460"/>
            Smokes through the ranks, overtakes the flying war, <lb/>
            And thunders after Hector; Hector flies, <lb/>
            Patroclus shakes his lance ; but fate denies. <lb/>
            Not with less noise, with less impetuous force, <lb/>
            The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,<lb n="465"/>
            Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours, <lb/>
            And earth is laden with incessant showers ; <lb/>

            From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,<lb/>

          <p>And now the chief (the foremost troops repell'd) <lb/>
            Back to the ships his destined progress held, <lb/>
            Bore down half Troy in his resistless way, <lb/>
            And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.7 <lb/>
            Between the space where silver Simois flows,<lb/>

            ‘ What words are these P 0 sovereign of the skies! <lb/>
            ‘ Short is the date prescribed to mortal man; <lb/>

            ‘ Before proud Ilion must resign their breath! <lb/>

            Then, touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd <lb/>
            A shower of blood o er all the fatal field ;<lb n="560"/>

          <p>Now met in arms, the combatants appear, <lb/>
            Each heav'd the shield, and the the lifted spear;<lb n="565"/>
            From strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled, <lb/>
            And pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed; <lb/>
            The nerves umbrac'd no more his bulk sustain; <lb/>
            He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain. <lb/>
            Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw;<lb n="570"/>
            The first aloof with erring fury flew, <lb/>
            The next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed, <lb/>
            The generous Pedasus, of Theban breed, <lb/>
            Fix'd in the shoulder-joint; he reel'd around, <lb/>
            Roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.<lb n="575"/>
            His sudden fall th' entangled harness broke ; <lb/>
            Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook : <lb/>
            When bold Automedon, to disengage <lb/>

            The car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.</p>
          <p>The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance, <lb/>
            And first Sarpedon whirl'd his mighty lance,<pb n="299"/>

            Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course, <lb/>
            And spent in empty air its dying force. <lb/>
            Not so Patroclus' never-erring dart; <lb/>
            Aim'd at his breast, it pierced the mortal part, <lb/>
            Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.<lb n="590"/>
            Then, as the mountain oak, or poplar tall, <lb/>
            Or pine, (fit mast for some great admiral,) <lb/>
            Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound <lb/>
            It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground; <lb/>
            Thus fell the king; and, laid on earth supine,<lb n="595"/>
            Before his chariot stretched his form divine: <lb/>
            He grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore, <lb/>
            And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore. <lb/>
            So lies a bull beneath the lion's paws, <lb/>
            While the grim savage grinds with foaming jaws<lb n="600"/>
            The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood; <lb/>
            Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.</p>
          <p>Then to the leader of the Lycian band <lb/>
            The dying chief addressed his last command : <lb/>
            ‘ Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare<lb n="605"/>
            ‘ The glorious dangers of destructive war, <lb/>

            ‘ Then as a friend, and as a warrior, fight; <lb/>
            ‘ Defend my body, conquer in my right; <lb/>
            ‘ That, taught by great examples, all may try<lb n="615"/>
            ‘ Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.'</p>
          <p>He ceas'd; the fates suppress'd his labouring breath, <lb/>
            And his eyes darkened with the shades of death. <lb/>
            Th’ insulting victor with disdain bestrode <lb/>
            The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod ;<lb n="620"/>
            Then drew the weapon from his panting heart, <lb/>
            The reeking fibres clinging to the dart; <lb/>
            From the wide wound gush’d out a stream of blood, <lb/>
            And the soul issued in the purple flood. <lb/>
            His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,<lb n="625"/>
            Unguided now, their mighty master slain. <lb/>
            All-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief, <lb/>
            Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief. <lb/>
            His painful arm, yet useless with the smart <lb/>
            Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,<lb n="630"/>
            Supported on his better hand he stay'd; <lb/>
            To Phœbus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:</p><pb n="300"/>

            ‘ Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain, <lb/>
            ‘ That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein : <lb/>
            ' I stand unable to sustain the spear, <lb/>

            ‘ Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid, <lb/>

            ‘ But thou, 0 god of health! thy succour lend, <lb/>

            ‘ For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,<lb n="645"/>

          <p>Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood, <lb/>
            His heavenly hand restrained the flux of blood; <lb/>
            He drew the dolours from the wounded part, <lb/>
            And breath'd a spirit in his rising heart.<lb n="650"/>
            Renewed by art divine, the hero stands, <lb/>
            And owns th' assistance of immortal hands. <lb/>
            First to the fight his native troops he warms, <lb/>
            Then loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms ; <lb/>
            With ample strides he stalks from place to place,<lb n="655"/>
            Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas; <lb/>
            Æneas next, and Hector he accosts ; <lb/>
            Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts :</p>
          <p>‘ What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ, <lb/>
            ‘ Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy !<lb n="660"/>
            ‘ Those generous friends, who, from their country far, <lb/>
            ‘ Breathe their brave souls out in another's war. <lb/>
            ‘ See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies, <lb/>
            ‘ In action valiant, and in council wise, <lb/>

            A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguered wall<lb n="675"/>
            A host of heroes, and outshin'd them all. <lb/>

            With horrid shouts they circle round the slain; <lb/>
            The clash of armour rings o'er all the plain. <lb/>
            Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,<lb n="695"/>

          <p>Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls; <lb/>
            Agacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls :<lb n="700"/>
            Who, chas'd for murder thence, a suppliant came <lb/>
            To Peleus and the silver-footed dame ; <lb/>

            A rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head; <lb/>
            Hurl'd by Hectorean force, it cleft in twain <lb/>
            His shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.</p>
          <p>Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came; <lb/>
            And, like an eagle darting at his game,<lb n="710"/>
            Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band : <lb/>
            What grief 9 thy heart, what fury urg'd thy hand, <lb/>

            Far as an able hand a lance can throw, <lb/>
            Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe, <lb/>
            So far the Trojans from their lines retir'd; <lb/>

            Then Bathycleüs fell beneath his rage, <lb/>

            Wide o er the land was stretch'd his large domain, <lb/>

            Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound, <lb/>

            Th' Achaians sorrow for their hero slain; <lb/>

            Between the jaw and ear the javelin went: <lb/>
            The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.</p>
          <p>His spear ineas at the victor threw, <lb/>
            Who, stooping forward, from the death withdrew ;<lb n="740"/>
            The lance hiss’d harmless o'er his covering shield, <lb/>

            Fix'd on the field his sight, his breast debates <lb/>
            The vengeance due, and meditates the fates : <lb n="785"/>
            Whether to urge their prompt effect, and call <lb/>

            Then Hector's mind he fills with dire dismay; <lb/>

            ‘ Those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath <lb/>
            ‘ To the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death : <lb/>
            ‘ They to his friends the mournful charge shall bear <lb/>
            ‘ His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear;<lb n="820"/>
            ‘ What honours mortals after death receive, <lb/>
            ‘ Those unavailing honours we may give.’</p>
          <p>Apollo bows, and from mount Ida s height, <lb/>
            Swift to the field precipitates his flight; <lb/>
            Thence from the war the breathless hero bore,<lb n="825"/>
            Veil’d in a cloud to silver Simois' shore; <lb/>
            There bath'd his honourable wounds, and dress’d <lb/>
            His manly members in th' immortal vest: <lb/>
            And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews, <lb/>
            Restores his freshness, and his form renews.<lb n="830"/>
            Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race, <lb/>
            Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace, <lb/>
            lteceiv'd Sarpedon at the god's command, <lb/>
            And in a moment reach'd the Lycian land; <lb/>
            The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,<lb n="835"/>
            Where endless honours wait the sacred shade.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains, <lb/>
            With foaming coursers, and with loosen'd reins : <lb/>
            Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew, <lb/>
            Ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:<lb n="840"/>
            Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain, <lb/>
            Vain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain. <lb/>
            For he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll'd <lb/>
            Dismay the mighty, and confound the bold; <lb/>
            The god who gives, resumes, and orders all,<lb n="845"/>
            He urg'd thee on, and urg'd thee on to fall.</p>
          <p>Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain, <lb/>
            Who last beneath thy vengeance pressed the plain, <lb/>
            When heaven itself thy fatal fury led, <lb/>
            And call'd to fill the number of the dead ?<lb n="850"/>
            Adrestus first; Autonoiis then succeeds; <lb/>
            Echeclus follows ; next young Megas bleeds ; <lb/>
            Epistor, Menalippus, bite the ground: <lb/>
            The slaughter Elasus and Mulius crowned: <lb/>
            Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night;<lb n="855"/>
            The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.</p>
          <p>Now Troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            Thrice at the battlements Patroclus struck, <lb/>
            His blazing ægis thrice Apollo shook :<lb n="860"/>
            He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud, <lb/>
            A more than mortal voice was heard aloud:</p>
          <p>‘ Patroclus ! cease ; this heaven-defended wall <lb/>
            ‘ Defies thy lance, not fated yet to fall; <lb/>
            ‘ Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,<lb n="865"/>
            ‘ Troy shall not stoop, e'en to Achilles' hand.'</p>
          <p>So spoke the god who darts celestial fires : <lb/>
            The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires : <lb/>
            While Hector, checking at the Scæan gates <lb/>
            His panting coursers, in his breast debates,<lb n="870"/>
            Or in the field his forces to employ, <lb/>
            Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.</p>
          <p>Thus while he thought, beside him Phœbus stood, <lb/>
            In Asius' shape, who reign'd by Sangar's flood : <lb/>
            (Thy brother, Hecuba! from and sprung,<lb n="875"/>
            A valiant warrior, haughty, bold and young:) <lb/>
            Thus he accosts him: ‘ What a shameful sight! <lb/>
            ‘ Gods! is it Hector that forbears the fight ? <lb/>
            ‘ Were thine my vigour, this successful spear <lb/>
            ‘ Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.<lb n="880"/>
            ‘ Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame, <lb/>
            ‘ And in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame. <lb/>
            ‘ Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed, <lb/>
            ‘ And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.'</p>
          <p>So spoke th’ inspiring god: then took his flight,<lb n="885"/>
            And plung’d amidst the tumult of the fight. <lb/>
            He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car; <lb/>
            The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war: <lb/>
            The god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd, <lb/>
            And pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.<lb n="890"/>
            Patroclus lights,8 impatient for the fight; <lb/>
            A spear his left, a stone employs his right: <lb/>
            With all his nerves he drives it at the foe; <lb/>
            Pointed above, and rough and gross below: <lb/>

            The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground. <lb/>
            The charioteer, while yet he held the rein, <lb/>
            Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.<lb n="900"/>
            To the dark shades the soul unw ling glides, <lb/>

          <p>Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize, <lb/>

            Pierc'd through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain ; <lb/>
            And from his fatal courage finds his bane. <lb/>
            At once bold Hector, leaping from his car, <lb/>
            Defends the body, and provokes the war. <lb/>
            Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,<lb n="915"/>
            Two lordly rulers of the wood engage ; <lb/>
            Stung with fierce hunger each the prey invades, <lb/>
            And echoing roars rebellow through the shades. <lb/>
            Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head, <lb/>
            And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead;<lb n="920"/>
            While all around, confusion, rage, and fright <lb/>
            Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight. <lb/>
            So, pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud <lb/>
            In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood; <lb/>
            Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,<lb n="925"/>
            The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans9 groan ; <lb/>
            This way and that the rattling thicket bends, <lb/>
            And the whole forest in one crash descends. <lb/>
            Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage, <lb/>
            In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.<lb n="930"/>
            Darts shower'd on darts now round the carcass ring ; <lb/>
            Now flights of arrows bounding from the string: <lb/>
            Stones follow stones ; some clatter on the fields, <lb/>
            Some, hard and heavy, shake the sounding shields. <lb/>
            But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,<lb n="935"/>
            Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains, <lb/>
            And, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!</p>
          <p>Now, flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven <lb/>
            His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven ; <lb/>
            While on each host with equal tempest fell<lb n="940"/>

            Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows, <lb/>
            And, breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes. <lb/>
            Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew, <lb/>
            And thrice three heroes at each onset slew. <lb/>

          <p>For lo ! the god in dusky clouds enshrin'd, <lb/>
            Approaching, dealt a staggering blow behind. <lb n="955"/>
            The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel; <lb/>
            His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel <lb/>
            In giddy darkness ; far to distance flung, <lb/>
            His bounding helmet on the champaign rung. <lb/>
            Achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore, . <lb n="960"/>
            That plume which never stoop'd to earth before; <lb/>
            lAng us'd, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine, <lb/>
            And shade the temples of the man divine. <lb/>
            Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod; <lb/>
            Not long-for fate pursues him, and the god. <lb n="965"/>
            </p>
          <p>His spear in shivers falls: his ample shield <lb/>
            Drops from his arm: his baldric strews the field: <lb/>
            The corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes ; <lb/>
            Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes, <lb/>
            Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands: <lb n="970"/>
            Such is the force of more than mortal hands!</p>
          <p>A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame, <lb/>
            From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name; <lb/>
            Fam'd for the manage of the foaming horse, <lb/>
            Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course: <lb n="975"/>
            Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car, <lb/>
            While yet he learn'd his rudiments of war. <lb/>
            His venturous spear first drew the hero's gore ; <lb/>
            He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more; <lb/>
            Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood, <lb n="980"/>
            But swift withdrew the long-protended wood, <lb/>
            And turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd. <lb/>
            Thus by an arm divine, and mortal spear, <lb/>
            Wounded at once, Patroclus yields to fear, <lb/>
            Retires for succour to his social train, <lb n="985"/>
            And flies the fate which heaven decreed, in vain. <lb/>
            Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views, <lb/>
            Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues : <lb/>
            The lance arrests him with a mortal wound ; <lb/>
            He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound. <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb n="990"/>

            With him all Greece was sunk ; that moment all <lb/>
            Her yet surviving heroes seem'd to fall. <lb/>
            80, scorch'd with heat, along the desert shore, <lb/>
            The reaming lion meets a bristly boar, <lb/>
            Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood, <lb n="995"/>
            With flaming eyes and jaws besmear'd with blood; <lb/>
            At length the sovereign savage wins the strife, <lb/>
            And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life. <lb/>
            Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown, <lb/>
            So many lives effus'd, expires his own. <lb n="1000"/>
            As dying now at Hector s feet he lies, <lb/>
            He sternly views him, and triumphing cries:</p>
          <p>' Lie there, Patroclus ! and with thee the joy, <lb/>

          <p>Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies, <lb/>
            With faint expiring breath, the chief replies:</p>
          <p>' Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine: <lb/>
            ' Jove's and Apollo's is this deed, not thine ; <lb/>

          <p>Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy: <lb/>
            Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus <lb/>
            retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This Glaucus <lb/>
            objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had <lb/>
            won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till <lb/>
            Ajax rallies them: Æneas sustains the Trojans. Æneas and Hector <lb/>
            attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The <lb/>
            horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body <lb/>
            with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. <lb/>
            Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus's <lb/>
            death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the <lb/>
            utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaxes, bear off the body <lb/>
            to the ships.</p>
          <p>The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies <lb/>
            in the fields before Troy.</p>
          <p>ON the cold earth divine Patroclus spread, <lb/>
            Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead. <lb/>
            Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe, <lb/>
            Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe : <lb/>
            Thus, round her new-fall'n young the heifer moves, <lb n="5"/>
            Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves ; <lb/>
            And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare) <lb/>
            Turns and re-turns her, with a mother's care. <lb/>

            Oppos'd to each that near the carcass came. <lb/>
            His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame. <lb n="10"/>

          <p>The son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send, <lb/>
            Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend: <lb/>
            ' This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low; <lb/>

            ' Depart with life, and leave the glory mine.'</p>
          <p>The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn'd <lb/>

            (In Mentes' shape, beneath whose martial care <lb/>

            O'er all the black battalions sent his view, <lb/>

            All grim in arms, and covered o'er with blood; <lb/>

            The field re-echoed the distressful sound : <lb/>
            ' Oh chiefs ! oh princes! to whose hand is given <lb/>
            ' The rule of men ; whose glory is from heaven! <lb n="295"/>
            'Whom with due honours both Atrides grace : <lb/>
            ' Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race ! <lb/>
            ' All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far, <lb/>
            ' All, whom I see not through this cloud of war, <lb/>
            'Come all! let generous rage your arms employ, <lb n="300"/>
            'And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy.'</p>
          <p>Oilean Ajax first the voice obey'd, <lb/>
            Swift was his pace and ready was his aid; <lb/>
            Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age, <lb/>
            And Merion, burning with a hero's rage. <lb n="305"/>
            The long-succeeding numbers who can name ? <lb/>
            But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame. <lb/>
            Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng; <lb/>
            Whole Troy, embodied, rush'd with shouts along. <lb/>
            Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves, <lb n="310"/>
            Where some swoln river disembogues his waves, <lb/>
            Full in the mouth is stopp'd the rushing tide, <lb/>
            The boiling ocean works from side to side, <lb/>
            The river trembles to his utmost shore, <lb/>
            And distant rocks rebellow to the roar. <lb n="315"/>
            </p>
          <p>Nor less resolv'd, the firm Achaian band <lb/>
            With brazen shields in horrid circle stand : <lb/>
            Jove, pouring darkness o'er the mingled fight, <lb/>

            To him the chief, for whom the hosts contend, <lb n="320"/>
            Had liv'd not hateful, for he liv'd a friend: <lb/>
            Dead lie protects him with superior care, <lb/>
            Nor dooms his carcass to the birds of air.</p>
          <p>The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain, <lb/>
            Repuls'd, they yield ; the Trojans seize the slain : <lb n="325"/>
            Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on <lb/>
            By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon : <lb/>
            (Ajax, to Pcleus' son the second name, <lb/>
            In graceful stature next, and next in fame.) <lb/>
            With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore : <lb n="330"/>
            So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar, <lb/>
            And rudely scatters, far to distance round, <lb/>
            The frighted hunter and the baying hound. <lb/>
            The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus' heir,4 <lb/>
            Hippothoüs, dragg'd the carcass through the war; <lb n="335"/>
            The sinewy ancles bor'd, the feet he bound <lb/>
            With thongs, inserted through the double wound ; <lb/>
            Inevitable fate o'crtakes the deed; <lb/>
            Doom'd by great Ajax' vengeful lance to bleed; <lb/>
            It cleft the helmet's brazen cheeks in twain; <lb n="340"/>
            The shattered crest and horsehair strew the plain : <lb/>
            With nerves relaxed he tumbles to the ground, <lb/>
            The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound. <lb/>
            He drops Patroclus' foot, and, o'er him spread, <lb/>
            Now lies a sad companion of the dead: <lb n="345"/>
            Far from Larissa lies, his native air, <lb/>
            And ill requites his parent's tender care. <lb/>
            Lamented youth ! in life's first bloom he fell, <lb/>
            Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.</p>
          <p>Once more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies; <lb n="350"/>
            The Grecian marking as it cut the skies, <lb/>
            Shunn'd the descending death, which, hissing on, <lb/>
            Stretch'd in the dust the great Iphitus’ son, <lb/>
            Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind <lb/>
            The boldest warrior, and the noblest mind: <lb n="355"/>
            In little Panope, for strength renown'd, <lb/>
            He held his seat, and rul'd the realms around. <lb/>
            Plung'd in his throat, the weapon drank his blood, <lb/>
            And, deep transpiercing, through the shoulder stood; <lb/>
            In clanging arms the hero fell, and all <lb n="360"/>
            The fields resounded with his weighty fall.</p>
          <p>Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends, <lb/>
            The Telamonian lance his belly rends; <note type="footnote"> 4 The original is, " the illustrious son of Pelasgic Lethus.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            The hollow armour burst before the stroke, <lb/>
            And through the wound the rushing entrails broke. <lb n="365"/>
            In strong convulsions panting on the sands <lb/>
            He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.</p>
          <p>Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train: <lb/>
            The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain. <lb/>
            And now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield, <lb n="370"/>
            Fled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field; <lb/>
            Greece, in her native fortitude elate, <lb/>
            With Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate ; <lb/>
            But Phœbus urg'd AEneas to the fight; <lb/>
            He seem'd like aged Periphas to sight: <lb n="375"/>
            (A herald in Anchises' love grown old, <lb/>
            Rever'd for prudence, and, with prudence, bold.)</p>
          <p>Thus he: ‘ What methods yet, oh chief! remain. <lb/>
            ‘To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain ?<lb/>
            ‘ There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care, <lb n="380"/>
            ‘ By valour, numbers, and by arts of war, <lb/>
            ‘ Have forc'd the powers to spare a sinking state, <lb/>
            ‘And gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate. <lb/>
            ‘ But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares <lb/>
            ‘ His partial favour, and assists your wars, <lb n="385"/>
            ‘ Your shameful efforts ’gainst yourselves employ, <lb/>
            ‘ And force th' unwilling god to ruin Troy.'</p>
          <p>Æneas, through the form assumed, descries <lb/>
            The power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries : <lb/>
            ‘ Oh lasting shame ! to our own fears a prey, <lb n="390"/>
            ‘ We seek our ramparts, and desert the day. <lb/>
            ‘ A god (nor is he less) my bosom warms, <lb/>
            ‘ And tells me Jove asserts the Trojan arms.’</p>
          <p>He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew; <lb/>
            The bold example all his hosts pursue. <lb n="395"/>
            Then first Leocritus beneath him bled, <lb/>
            In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede; <lb/>
            Who view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance, <lb/>
            Swift to revenge it, sent his angry lance: <lb/>
            The whirling lance, with vigorous force addressed, <lb n="400"/>
            Descends, and pants in Apisaon's breast: <lb/>
            From rich Pæonia's vales the warrior came ; <lb/>
            Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame, <lb/>
            Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain, <lb/>
            And rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain: <lb n="405"/>
            Indissolubly firm, around the dead, <lb/>
            Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread, <lb/>
            And hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood: <lb/>

            Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care, <lb n="410"/>
            And in an orb contracts the crowded war, <lb/>
            Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall, <lb/>
            And stands the centre and the soul of all : <lb/>
            Fix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound; <lb/>
            A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground ; <lb n="415"/>
            On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled, <lb/>
            And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.</p>
          <p>Greece, in close order and collected might, <lb/>
            Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight; <lb/>
            Fierce as conflicting fires, the combat burns, <lb n="420"/>
            And now it rises, now it sinks, by turns. <lb/>
            In one thick darkness all the fight was lost: <lb/>
            The sun, the moon, and all th' ethereal host, <lb/>
            Seem'd as extinct; day ravish'd from their eyes, <lb/>
            And all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies. <lb n="425"/>
            Such o'er Patroclus’ body hung the night, <lb/>
            The rest in sunshine fought, and open light: <lb/>
            Unclouded there, th' aërial azure spread, <lb/>
            No vapour rested on the mountain s head, <lb/>
            The golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray, <lb n="430"/>
            And all the broad expansion fiam'd with day. ● <lb/>
            Dispers'd around the plain, by fits they fight, <lb/>
            And here, and there, their scatter'd arrows light: <lb/>
            But death and darkness o'er the carcass spread, <lb/>
            There burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled. <lb n="435"/>
            </p>
          <p>Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear, <lb/>
            (Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear, <lb/>
            And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command, <lb/>
            When from the ships he sent the Pylian band. <lb/>
            The youthful brothers thus for fame contend, <lb n="440"/>
            Nor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend; <lb/>
            In thought they view'd him still, with martial joy, <lb/>
            Glorious in arms, and dealing deaths to Troy.</p>
          <p>But round the cone the heroes pant for breath, <lb/>
            And thick and heavy grows the work of death: <lb n="445"/>
            O erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore, <lb/>
            t'heir knees, their legs, their feet, are cover'd o'er; <lb/>
            Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise, <lb/>
            And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes. <lb/>
            As when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide, <lb n="450"/>
            Strain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side, <lb/>
            The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er <lb/>
            Th' extended surface, drunk with fat and gore; <lb/>
            So tugging round the corse both armies stood; <lb/>
            The mangled body bath'd in sweat and blood: <lb n="455"/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ, <lb/>
            Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy. <lb/>
            Not Pallas' self, her breast when fury warms, <lb/>
            Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms, <lb/>
            Could blame this scene ; such rage, such horror, reign'd; <lb n="460"/>
            Such Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.</p>
          <p>Achilles in his ships at distance lay, <lb/>
            Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day ; <lb/>
            He, yet unconscious of Patroclus' fall, <lb/>
            In dust extended under Ilion's wall, <lb n="465"/>
            Expects him glorious from the conquered plain, <lb/>
            And for his wish'd return prepares in vain; <lb/>
            Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend, <lb/>
            Was more than heaven had destin'd to his friend, <lb/>
            Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal'd; <lb n="470"/>
            The rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.</p>
          <p>Still rag'd the conflict round the hero dead, <lb/>
            And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled. <lb/>
            ‘ Curs'd be the man' (e'en private Greeks would say) <lb/>
            ‘ Who dares desert this well-disputed day ! <lb n="475"/>
            ‘ First may the cleaving earth before our eyes <lb/>
            ‘ Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice ! <lb/>
            ‘ First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast <lb/>
            ‘ We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost.'</p>
          <p>Thus they. While with one voice the Trojan said, <lb n="480"/>
            ‘ Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!’</p>
          <p>Then clash their sounding arms ; the clangors rise, <lb/>
            And shake the brazen concave of the skies.</p>
          <p>Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood, <lb/>
            The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood; <lb n="485"/>
            Their godlike master slain before their eyes, <lb/>
            They wept, and shar'd in human miseries. <lb/>
            In vain Automedon now shakes the rein, <lb/>
            Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain ; <lb/>
            Nor to the fight, nor Hellespont they go ; <lb n="490"/>
            Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe : <lb/>
            Still as a tombstone, never to be mov'd, <lb/>
            On some good man, or woman unreprov'd, <lb/>
            Lays its eternal weight; or fix'd as stands <lb/>
            A marble courser by the sculptor's hands, <lb n="495"/>
            Plac'd on the hero's grave. Along their face <lb/>
            The biff round drops cours'd down with silent pace, <lb/>
            Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late <lb/>
            Circled their arched necks, and wav'd in state, <lb/>
            Trail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread, <lb n="500"/>

            <note type="margin"> B. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            Nor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look, <lb/>
            While thus relenting to the steeds lie spoke:</p>
          <p>‘ Unhappy coursers of immortal strain! <lb/>
            ’ Exempt from age, and deathless now in vain ; <lb n="505"/>
            ‘ Did we your race on mortal man bestow, <lb/>
            ‘ Only, alas ! to share in mortal woe ?<lb/>
            ‘ For ah! what is there, of inferior birth, <lb/>
            ‘ That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth; <lb/>

            From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear <lb/>
            The kindling chariot through the parted war. <lb/>
            So flies a vulture through the clamorous train <lb/>
            Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain. <lb/>
            From danger now with swiftest speed they flew, <lb n="530"/>
            And now to conquest with like speed pursue; <lb/>
            Sole in the seat the charioteer remains, <lb/>
            Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins: <lb/>
            Him brave Alcimedonbeheld distress'd, <lb/>
            Approach'd the chariot, and the chief addressed: <lb n="535"/>

          <p>‘ What god provokes thee, rashly thus to dare, <lb/>
            ‘ Alone, unaided, in the thickest war ?<lb/>
            ‘ Alas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields <lb/>
            ‘ Achilles' arms triumphant in the fields.'</p>

            His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried, <lb n="550"/>

          <p>The son of Venus to the counsel yields : <lb/>

            And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lin'd. <lb/>
            Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds, <lb/>

            ' Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind! <lb/>
            ‘ Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow, <lb n="570"/>
            ‘ For hard the fight, determin'd is the foe ; <lb/>

            ‘ War knows no mean: he wins it, or he dies.</p>
          <p>Then through the field he sends his voice aloud, <lb/>
            And calls th' Ajaces from the warring crowd, <lb n="575"/>
            With great Atrides. ‘ Hither turn,' (he said,) <lb/>
            ‘ Turn where distress demands immediate aid ; <lb/>
            ‘ The dead, encircled by his friends, forego, <lb/>

          <p>He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung, <lb/>
            Which pass'd the shield of Aretus the young; <lb n="585"/>
            It pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art; <lb/>
            Then in the lower belly stuck the dart. <lb/>
            As when a ponderous axe, descending full, <lb/>
            Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull; <lb/>
            Struck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound, <lb n="590"/>
            Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground : <lb/>
            Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received, <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> B. XVII.] </note> Now at Automedon the Trojan foe <lb/>
            Discharged his lance ; the meditated blow, <lb n="595"/>
            Stooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled, <lb/>
            And hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head: <lb/>
            Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear <lb/>
            In long vibrations spent its fury there. <lb/>
            With clashing faulchions now the chiefs had clos'd, <lb n="600"/>

            ‘ Thus have I sooth'd my griefs, and thus have paid, <lb/>

            And o’er his seat the bloody trophies hung.</p>
          <p>And now Minerva, from the realms of air, <lb/>
            Descends impetuous, and renews the war; <lb/>
            For, pleas'd at length the Grecian arms to aid, <lb/>
            The lord of thunders sent the blue-ey'd maid. <lb n="615"/>
            As when high Jove, denouncing future woe, <lb/>

            Desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight. <lb/>
            So bums the vengeful hornet, (soul all o'er,) <lb/>

            (Bold son of air and heat,) on angry wings <lb/>
            Untamed, untir'd, he turns, attacks, and stings: <lb n="645"/>
            Fir'd with like ardour fierce Atrides flew, <lb/>
            And sent his soul with every lance he threw.</p>
          <p>There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame, <lb/>
            Eëtion's son, and Podes was his name ; <lb/>
            With riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd, 0 <lb n="650"/>
            By Hector lov'd, his comrade, and his guest; <lb/>
            Through his broad belt the spear a passage found, <lb/>
            And, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound. <lb/>
            Sudden at Hector's side Apollo stood, <lb/>
            Like Phænops, Asius’ son, appeared the god: <lb n="655"/>
            (Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign <lb/>
            In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)</p>
          <p>‘ Oh prince,' (he cried,) ‘ oh foremost once in fame ! <lb/>
            • What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name ?<lb/>
            ‘ Dost thou at length to Menelaüs yield ? <lb n="660"/>
            ‘ A chief, once thought no terror of the field! <lb/>
            ‘ Yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize <lb/>
            ' He bears victorious, while our army flies. <lb/>
            ‘ By the same arm illustrious Podes bled, <lb/>
            ‘ The friend of Hector, unreveng'd, is dead !' <lb n="665"/>
            This heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe, <lb/>
            Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.</p>
          <p>But now th' Eternal shook his sable shield, <lb/>
            That shaded Idc, and all the subject field, <lb/>
            Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud <lb n="670"/>
            Involv'd the mount, the thunder roar'd aloud: <lb/>
            Th’ affrighted hills from their foundations nod, <lb/>
            And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god: <lb/>
            At one regard of his all-seeing eye, <lb/>
            The vanquish’d triumph, and the victors fly. <lb n="675"/>
            </p>
          <p>Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led; <lb/>
            For, as the brave Bœotian turn'd his head <lb/>
            To face the foe, Polydamas drew near, <lb/>
            And raz'd his shoulder with a shorten'd spear: <lb/>
            By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain, <lb n="680"/>
            Pierc'd through the wrist; and, raging with the pain, <lb/>
            Grasps his once formidable lance in vain.</p>
          <p>As Hector followed, Idomen address'd <lb/>

            High on his chariot as the Cretan stood, <lb/>

            But, erring from its aim, th' impetuous spear <lb/>
            Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer <lb n="690"/>
            Of martial Merion: Cœranus his name, <lb/>
            Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame. <lb/>
            On foot bold Merion fought; and now, laid low, <lb/>
            Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe; <lb/>
            But the brave squire the ready coursers brought, <lb n="695"/>
            And with his life his master's safety bought. <lb/>
            Between his check and ear the weapon went, <lb/>
            The teeth it shattered, and the tongue it rent. <lb/>
            Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain; <lb/>
            His dying hand forgets the falling rein: <lb n="700"/>
            This Merion reaches, bending from the car, <lb/>
            And urges to desert the hopeless war; <lb/>
            Idomeneus consents; the lash applies; <lb/>
            And the swift chariot to the navy flies.</p>

            The god relenting, clear d the clouded air; <lb/>
            Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray; <lb n="735"/>
            The blaze of armour flash'd against the day. <lb/>
            ‘ Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>So turns the lion from the nightly fold, <lb/>
            Though high in courage, and with hunger bold, <lb/>
            Long gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex d by hounds, <lb/>
            Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds; <lb/>
            The darts fly round him from a hundred hands, <lb n="745"/>
            And the red terrors of the blazing brands: <lb/>
            Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day <lb/>
            Sour he departs, and quits th' untasted prey. <lb/>
            So mov'd Atrides from his dangerous place, <lb/>
            With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace; <lb n="750"/>
            The foe, he fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain, <lb/>
            And much admonish'd, much adjur'd his train:</p>
          <p>● Oh, guard these relics to your charge consign'd, <lb/>

            ‘ In death a hero, as in life a friend!'</p>
          <p>So parts the chief, from rank to rank he flew, <lb/>
            And round on all sides sent his piercing view. <lb n="760"/>
            As the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye <lb/>
            Of all that wing the mid aerial sky, <lb/>
            The sacred eagle, from his walks above <lb/>
            Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move; <lb/>
            Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare, <lb n="765"/>
            Snatches his life amid the clouds of air: <lb/>
            Not with less quickness his exerted sight <lb/>
            Pass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight <lb/>
            Till on the left the chief he sought, he found, <lb/>
            Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around. <lb n="770"/>

          <p>The youthful warrior heard with silent woe, <lb/>
            From his fair eyes the tears began to flow; <lb/>
            Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say <lb/>
            What sorrow dictates, but no word found way. <lb/>
            To brave Laodocus his arms he flung, <lb n="785"/>
            Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along ; <lb/>
            Then ran, the mournful message to impart, <lb/>
            With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.</p>
          <p>Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaüs stands <lb/>
            (Though sore distress'd) to aid the Pylian bands ; <lb n="790"/>
            But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain; <lb/>
            Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.</p>
          <p>‘ Gone is Antilochus,' (the hero said,) <lb/>
            ‘ But hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid : <lb/>
            Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe, <lb n="795"/>
            ‘ Unarm'd he fights not with the Trojan foe. <lb/>
            ‘ 'Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain, <lb/>
            ‘ ’Tis our own vigour must the dead regain; <lb/>
            ‘And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate <lb/>
            ‘ Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.' <lb n="800"/>
            </p>
          <p>‘ 'Tis well,' (said Ajax ;) ' be it then thy care, <lb/>
            ‘With Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear; <lb/>
            ‘ Myself and my bold brother will sustain <lb/>
            ‘ The shock of Hector and his charging train: <lb/>
            ‘ Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side ; <lb n="805"/>
            ‘ What Troy can dare, we have already tried, <lb/>
            ‘ Have tried it, and have stood.' The hero said: <lb/>
            High from the ground the warriors heave the dead. <lb/>
            A general clamour rises at the sight: <lb/>
            Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight; <lb n="810"/>
            Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood, <lb/>
            With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood, <lb/>
            Voracious hounds, that many a length before <lb/>
            Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar ; <lb/>
            But if the savage turns his glaring eye, <lb n="815"/>
            They howl aloof, and round the forest fly. <lb/>
            Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour, <lb/>
            Wave their thick faulchions, and their javelins shower: <lb/>
            But, Ajax turning, to their fears they yield, <lb/>
            All pale they tremble, and forsake the field. <lb n="820"/>
            </p>
          <p>While thus aloft the hero's cone they bear, <lb/>
            Behind them rages all the storm of war ; <lb/>
            Confusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng <lb/>
            Of men, stee ds. chariots, urged the rout along : <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire, <lb n="825"/>
            To whelm some city under waves of fire ; <lb/>
            Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes; <lb/>
            Now crack the blazing temples of the gods ; <lb/>
            The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls, <lb/>
            And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles. <lb n="830"/>
            The heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load: <lb/>
            As when two mules, along the rugged road, <lb/>
            From the steep mountain with exerted strength <lb/>
            Drag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length; <lb/>
            Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil, <lb n="835"/>
            Th' enormous timber lumbering down the hill; <lb/>
            So these: Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands, <lb/>
            And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands. <lb/>
            Thus when a river, swell'd with sudden rains, <lb/>
            Spreads his broad waters o'er the level plains, <lb n="840"/>
            Some interposing hill the stream divides, <lb/>
            And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides. <lb/>
            Still close they follow, close the rear engage; <lb/>
            AEneas storms, and Hector foams with rage : <lb/>
            While Greece a heavy thick retreat maintains, <lb n="845"/>

          <p>The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by Antilochus. <lb/>
            Thetis hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea-nymphs to com­ <lb/>

            appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders him to show <lb/>
            himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him turns the <lb/>
            fortune of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the <lb/>
            Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas dis. <pb n="329"/>

            Patroclus.</p>
          <p>Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan, to obtain new arms for her son. The <lb/>
            description of the wonderful works of Vulcan ; and, lastly, that noble <lb/>
            one of the shield of Achilles.</p>
          <p>The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing, take <lb/>
            up this book. The scene is at Achilles's tent on the sea-shore, from <lb/>
            whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.</p>
          <p>THUS like the rage of fire the combat burns, <lb/>
            And now it rises, now it sinks, by turns. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow, <lb/>
            Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe. <lb/>
            There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails, <lb n="5"/>
            On hoisted yards extended to the gales; <lb/>
            Pensive he sat; for all that fate designed <lb/>
            Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind. <lb/>
            Thus to his soul he said: ‘ Ah what constrains <lb/>
            ‘ The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains ? <lb n="10"/>
            ‘ Is this the lay, which heaven so long ago <lb/>
            ‘ Ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe, <lb/>
            ‘ (So Thetis warn'd,) when, by a Trojan hand, <lb/>
            ‘ The bravest of the Myrmidonian band <lb/>
            ‘ Should lose the light P Fulfill'd is that decree ? <lb n="15"/>
            ‘ Fall'n is the warrior, and Patroclus he ?<lb/>
            ‘In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain, <lb/>
            ‘ And warn'd to shun Hectorean force in vain!</p>
          <p>Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears, <lb/>
            And tells the melancholy tale with tears : <lb n="20"/>
            ‘Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear; <lb/>
            ‘And wretched I, th' unwilling messenger ! <lb/>
            ‘Dead is Patroclus ! for his corse they fight; <lb/>
            ‘His naked corse: his arms are Hector's right.'</p>
          <p>A sudden horror shot through all the chief, <lb n="25"/>
            And wrapt his senses in the cloud of grief ; <lb/>
            Cast on the ground, with furious hand he spread <lb/>
            The scorching ashes o'er his graceful head; <lb/>
            His purple garments, and his golden hairs, <lb/>
            Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears : <lb n="30"/>
            On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw, <lb/>
            And roll'd and grovell'd, as to earth he grew. <lb/>
            The virgin captives, with disorder'd charms, <lb/>
            (Won by his own, or by Patroclus' arms,) <lb/>
            Rush'd from the tents with cries; and, gathering round, <lb n="35"/>
            Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground: <lb/>
            While Nestor's son sustains a manlier part, <lb/>
            And mourns the warrior with a warrior's heart; <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            Hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe, <lb/>
            And oft prevents the meditated blow. <lb n="40"/>

          <p>Far in the deep abysses of the main, <lb/>
            With hoary Nereus, and the watery train, <lb/>
            The mother-goddess from her crystal throne <lb/>
            Heard his loud cries, and answered groan for groan. <lb/>
            The circling Nereids with their mistress weep, <lb n="45"/>
            And all the sea-green sisters of the deep. <lb/>
            Thalia, Glauce, (every watery name,) <lb/>
            N esæa mild, and silver Spio came: <lb/>
            Cymothoë and Cymodoce were nigh, <lb/>

            Their locks Actæa and Limnoria rear, <lb/>
            Then Proto, Doris, Panope appear, <lb/>

            All these, and all that deep in ocean held <lb n="65"/>
            Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill'd ; <lb/>
            Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe, <lb/>
            Till Thetis' sorrows thus began to flow:</p>

            While the long pomp the silver wave divides, <lb/>
            Approaching now, they touched the Trojan land <lb/>
            Then, two by two, ascended up the strand. <lb n="90"/>
            Th* immortal mother, standing close beside <lb/>
            Her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied ; <lb/>
            Along the coast their mingled clamours ran, <lb/>

            In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream; <lb/>
            The boiling water bubbles to the brim. <lb n="410"/>

            Soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn'd <lb/>
            Their iron mouths, and, where the furnace burn'd, <lb n="540"/>
            Resounding breathed : at once the blast expires, <lb/>
            And twenty forges catch at once the fires; <lb/>
            Just as the god directs, now loud, now low, <lb/>
            They raise a tempest, or they gently blow. <lb/>
            In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd, <lb n="545"/>
            And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold: <lb/>
            Before, deep fix'd, th' eternal anvils stand; <lb/>
            The ponderous hammer loads his better hand, <lb/>
            His left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round; <lb/>
            And thick strong strokes the doubling vaults rebound. <lb n="550"/>

          <p>Then first he form'd th' immense and solid shield; <lb/>

            Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound ; <lb/>
            A silver chain2 suspends the massy round: <lb/>
            Five ample plates the broad expanse compose, <lb n="555"/>
            And godlike labours on the surface rose. <lb/>
            There shone th' image of the master-mind: <lb/>
            There earth, there heaven, there ocean, he designed; <lb/>
            Th' unwearied sun, the moon completely round; <lb/>
            The starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd; <lb n="560"/>
            The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team; <lb/>
            And great Orion's more refulgent beam; <lb/>
            To which, around the axle of the sky, <lb/>
            The Bear revolving points his golden eye ; <lb/>
            Still shines exalted on th' ethereal plain, <lb n="565"/>
            Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.</p>
          <p>Two cities radiant on the shield appear, <lb/>
            The image one of peace, and one of war. <lb/>
            Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight, <lb/>
            And solemn dance, and Hymeneal rite; <lb n="570"/>
            Along the street the new-made brides are led, <lb/>
            With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed: <lb/>
            The youthful dancers in a circle bound <lb/>
            To the soft flute, and cittern's silver sound: <lb/>
            Through the fair streets, the matrons in a row <lb n="575"/>
            Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.</p>
          <p>There, in the Forum swarm a numerous train; <lb/>
            The subject of debate, a townsman slain: <lb/>
            One pleads the fine discharg'd, which one denied, <lb/>
            And bade the public and the laws decide: <note type="footnote"> 2 is Chain" is not the proper word for the original. Cowper’s version <lb/>

            The witness is produced on either hand; <lb/>

            And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands ; <lb/>
            On seats of stone, within the sacred place, <lb n="585"/>
            The reverend elders nodded o'er the case; <lb/>
            Alternate, each th* attending sceptre took, <lb/>
            And, rising solemn, each his sentence spoke. <lb/>
            Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight, <lb/>
            The prize of him who best adjudged the right. <lb n="590"/>

          <p>Another part (a prospect differing far) <lb/>
            Glow'd with refulgent arme, and horrid war. <lb/>
            Two mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace, <lb/>
            And one would pillage, one would burn, the place. <lb/>
            Meantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care, <lb n="595"/>
            A secret ambush on the foe prepare: <lb/>
            Their wives, their children, and the watchful band <lb/>
            Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand. <lb/>
            They march, by PaRas and by Mars made bold; <lb/>
            Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold, <lb n="600"/>
            And gold their armour ; these the squadron led, <lb/>
            August, divine, superior by the head ! <lb/>
            A place for ambush fit they found, and stood <lb/>
            Cover'd with shields, beside a silver flood. <lb/>
            Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem <lb n="605"/>

            Soon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains, <lb/>
            And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains j <lb/>
            Behind them, piping on their reeds, they go, <lb/>
            Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe. <lb n="610"/>
            In arms the glittering squadron rising round, <lb/>
            Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground : <lb/>
            Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains, <lb/>
            And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains! <lb/>
            The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear; <lb n="615"/>
            They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war; <lb/>
            They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood; <lb/>
            The waving silver seem'd to blush with blood. <lb/>
            There tumult, there contention, stood confess'd; <lb/>
            One rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast, <lb n="620"/>
            One held a living foe, that freshly bled <lb/>

            Now here, now there, the carcasses they tore: <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the <lb/>
            body of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the <lb/>
            army, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles <lb/>
            are solemnly reconciled : the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that <lb/>
            occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the <lb/>
            battle till the troops have refreshed themselves, by the advice of Ulysses. <lb/>
            The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles : where Briseis laments <lb/>
            over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately refuses all repast, <lb/>
            and gives himself up to lamentations for his friend. Minerva descends <lb/>
            to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He arms for the fight; his <lb/>
            appearance described. He addresses himself to his horses, and re­ <lb/>
            proaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of them is miracu­ <lb/>
            lously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his fate; but the <lb/>
            hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to the combat.</p>
          <p>The thirtieth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.</p>
          <p>SOON as Aurora heaved her orient head <lb/>
            A bove the waves that blushed with early red, <lb/>
            (With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, <lb/>
            And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,) <lb/>
            Th' immortal arms the goddess-mother bears <lb n="5"/>
            Swift to her son : her son she finds in tears, <lb/>
            Stretch'd o'er Patroclus' corse, while all the rest <lb/>
            Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd. <lb/>
            A ray divine her heavenly presence shed, <lb/>
            And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said: <lb n="10"/>
            </p>
          <p>‘ Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know <lb/>
            ‘ It was not man. but heaven, that gave the blow : <lb/>
            ‘ Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow'd, <lb/>
            ‘ Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god.'</p>
          <p>Then drops the radiant burden on the ground; <lb n="15"/>
            Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around; <lb/>
            Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise, <lb/>
            And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes. <lb/>
            Unmov'd, the hero kindles at the show, <lb/>
            And feels with rage divine his bosom glow; <lb n="20"/>
            From his fierce eye-balls living flames expire, <lb/>
            And flash incessant like a stream of fire: <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            He turns the radiant gift, and feeds his mind <lb/>
            On all th' immortal artist had design'd.</p>
          <p>' Goddess: (he cried,) ‘ these glorious arms that shine <lb n="25"/>
            ‘ With matchless art, confess the hand divine. <lb/>
            ‘ Now to the bloody battle let me bend: <lb/>
            ‘ But all! the relics of my slaughter'd friend ! <lb/>
            ‘ In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled, <lb/>
            ‘ Shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead ?' <lb n="30"/>
            </p>
          <p>‘ That unavailing care be laid aside <lb/>
            (The azure goddess to her son replied;) <lb/>
            ‘ Whole years untouch'd, uninjured shall remain, <lb/>
            ‘ Fresh as in life, the carcass of the slain. <lb/>
            ‘ But go, Achilles, (as affairs require,) <lb n="35"/>
            ‘ Before the Grecian peers renounce thine ire. <lb/>
            ‘ Then uncontroll'd in boundless war engage, <lb/>
            And heav'n with strength supply the mighty rage!’</p>
          <p>Then in the nostrils of the slam she pour’d <lb/>
            Nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower'd <lb n="40"/>
            O'er all the corse: the flies forbid their prey, <lb/>
            Untouch'd it rests, and sacred from decay. <lb/>
            Achilles to the strand obedient went; <lb/>
            The shores resounded with the voice he sent. <lb/>
            The heroes heard, and all the naval train <lb n="45"/>
            That tend the ships, or guide them o'er the main, <lb/>
            Alarm'd, transported, at the well-known sound, <lb/>
            Frequent and full, the great assembly crown'd; <lb/>
            Studious to see that terror of the plain, <lb/>
            Long lost to battle, shine in arms again. <lb n="50"/>

            Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.</p>
          <p>Now issued from the ships the warrior train, <lb/>
            And like a deluge pour'd upon the plain. <lb/>
            As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow, <lb n="380"/>
            And scatter o er the fields the driving snow; <lb/>
            From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies, <lb/>
            Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the sides: <lb/>
            So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields <lb/>
            Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields ; <lb n="385"/>
            Broad glittering breast-plates, spears with pointed rays, <lb/>

            His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress'd; <lb/>

            Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire, <lb/>
            His glowing eye-balls roll with living fire; <lb n="395"/>
            He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay <lb/>
            O'erlooks th* embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.</p>
          <p>The silver cuishes first his thighs infold; <lb/>
            Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold: <lb/>
            The brazen sword a various baldric tied, <lb n="400"/>
            That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side; <lb/>
            And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield <lb/>
            Blaz'd with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.</p>
          <p>So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears, <lb/>
            Wide o'er the watery waste a light appears, <lb n="405"/>
            Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high, <lb/>
            Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky: <lb/>
            With mournful eyes they gaze and gaze again; <lb/>
            Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.</p>
          <p>Next, his high head the helmet grac'd ; behind <lb n="410"/>
            The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind: <lb/>
            Like the red star, that from his flaming hair <lb/>
            Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war ; <lb/>
            So streamed the golden honours from his head, <lb/>

            And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</p>
          <p>And now he shakes his great paternal spear, <lb n="420"/>

            Wav'd o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd. <lb/>
            The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around, <lb/>
            And swift ascended at one active bound. <lb/>
            All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire <lb/>
            Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire ; <lb n="435"/>
            Not brighter Phœbus in th' ethereal way <lb/>
            Flames from his chariot, and restores the day. <lb/>
            High o'er the host, all terrible he stands, <lb/>

            When, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke <lb n="450"/>

          <p>Jupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the gods, <lb/>
            and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the combat <lb/>
            described when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages Æneas to <lb/>
            meet Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes encounter; <lb/>
            but Æneas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune. Achilles falls <lb/>
            upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the point of killing Hector, <lb/>
            but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. Achilles pursues the Trojans <lb/>
            with a great slaughter.</p>
          <p>The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.</p>
          <p>THUS round Pel ides breathing war and blood, <lb/>
            Greece, sheath'd in arms, beside her vessels stood ; <lb/>
            While, near impending from a neighbouring height, <lb/>
            Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight. <lb/>
            Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call <lb n="5"/>
            The gods to council in the starry hall: <lb/>
            Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she flies, <lb/>

            These to the fleet repair with instant flight; <lb/>
            The vessels tremble as the gods alight. <lb n="50"/>
            In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came, <lb/>
            Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame, <lb/>
            Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow, <lb/>
            And the chaste huntress of the silver bow. <lb/>
            Ere yet the gods their various aid employ, <lb n="55"/>
            Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy, <lb/>
            While great Achilles (terror of the plain) <lb/>
            Long lost to battle, shone in arms again. <lb/>
            Dreadful he stood in front of all his host; <lb/>
            Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost; <lb n="60"/>
            Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear, <lb/>
            And trembling see another god of war.</p>
          <p>But when the powers descending swelled the fight, <lb/>
            Then tumult rose; fierce rage and pale affright <lb/>

            Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls, <lb/>

            Mars, hovering o'er his Troy, his terror shrouds <lb/>

            Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours <lb/>
            With voice divine from Ilion's topmost towers; <lb/>
            Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill; <lb/>
            The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still. <lb/>
            Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls, <lb n="75"/>
            And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles. <lb/>
            Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground; <lb/>
            The forests wave, the mountains nod around; <lb/>
            Through all their summits tremble Ida's woods, <lb/>
            And from their sources boil her hundred floods. <lb n="80"/>
            Troy's turrets totter on the rocking plain ; <lb/>
            And the toss'd navies beat the heaving main. <lb/>
            Deep in the dismal regions of the dead, <lb/>
            Th' infernal monarch rear'd his horrid head, <lb/>
            Leap'd from his throne, lest Neptune's arm should lay <lb n="85"/>
            His dark dominions open to the day, <lb/>

            (Her golden arrows sounding at her side,) <lb/>

            His eyes around, for Hector only burn'd; <lb/>
            And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow'd <lb/>

          <p>The king of ocean to the fight descends ; <lb/>

            They join, they throng, they thicken to the war. <lb n="430"/>

            He hears, obedient to the god of light, <lb n="435"/>

          <p>Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies, <lb/>
            On Troy's whole force with boundless fury flies. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the river <lb/>
            Scamander; he falls upon the latter with great slaughter, takes twelve <lb/>
            captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and kills Lycaon <lb/>
            and Asteropæus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves ; Neptune <lb/>
            and Pallas assist the hero ; Simois joins Scamander; at length Vulcan, <lb/>
            by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This combat <lb/>
            ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles con­ <lb/>
            tinues the slaughter, and drives the rest into Troy : Agenor only makes <lb/>
            a stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo : who (to delude <lb/>
            Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's shape, and while he pursues him in <lb/>
            that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their <lb/>
            city.</p>
          <p>The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream <lb/>
            of Scamander.</p>
          <p>AND now to Xanthus gliding stream they drove, <lb/>
            Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove. <lb/>
            The river here divides the flying train: <lb/>
            Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain, <lb/>
            Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight, <lb n="5"/>
            Now chas'd and trembling in ignoble flight: <lb/>
            (These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds, <lb/>
            And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds <lb/>
            Part plunge into the stream': old Xanthus roars; <lb/>

            With cries promiscuous all the banks resound, <lb/>
            And here and there, in eddies whirling round, <lb/>
            The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd. <lb/>
            As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire, <lb/>
            While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire; <lb n="15"/>
            Driven from the land before the smoky cloud, <lb/>
            The clustering legions rush into the flood: <lb/>
            So plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force, <lb/>
            Roars the resounding surge with men and horse. <lb/>
            His bloody lance the hero casts aside, <lb n="20"/>
            (Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,) <lb/>
            Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves, <lb/>

            Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round, <lb/>

            Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed, <lb/>
            And the warm purple circled on the tide. <lb/>
            Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly, <lb/>
            And close in rocks or winding caverns lie: <lb/>
            the huge dolphin tempesting the main, <lb n="30"/>
            In shoals before him fly the scaly train ; <lb/>
            Confus'dly heap'd, they seek their inmost caves, <lb/>
            Or pant and heave-beneath the floating waves. <lb/>
            Now, tir'd with slaughter, from the Trojan band <lb/>
            Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land; <lb n="35"/>
            With their rich belts their captive arms constrains ; <lb/>
            (Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains;) <lb/>
            These his attendants to the ships convey'd, <lb/>

            Then, as once more he plung'd amid the flood, <lb n="40"/>
            The young Lycaon in his passage stood; <lb/>
            The so no of Priam, whom the hero's hand <lb/>

            With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field <lb/>
            His useless lance and unavailing shield,) <lb/>
            As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled, <lb n="60"/>
            And knock'a his faltering knees, the hero said:</p>
          <p>‘ Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view ! <lb/>
            ‘ Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue P <lb/>

          <p>Thus while he spake, the Trojan, pale with fears, <lb/>

            Achilles rais'd the spear, prepar d to wound; <lb/>

            About her temples flies the busy bow ; <lb/>
            Now here, now there, she winds her from the blow; <lb n="570"/>
            The scattering arrows, rattling from the case, <lb/>
            Drop round, and idly mark the dusty place. <lb/>
            Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies, <lb/>
            And scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes : <lb/>
            So when the falcon wings her way above, <lb n="575"/>
            To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove, <lb/>
            (Not fated yet to die,) there safe retreats, <lb/>
            Yet still her heart against the marble beats.</p>
          <p>To her Latona hastes with tender care ; <lb/>
            Whom Hermes viewing thus declines the war : <lb n="580"/>
            ' How shall I face the dame who gives delight <lb/>

            That, glittering on the dust, lay here and there; <lb/>
            Dishonour'd relics of Diana's war. <lb/>
            Then swift pursued her to her blest abode, <lb/>
            Where, all confus'd, she sought the sovereign god; <lb n="590"/>
            Weeping he grasp'd his knees: th' ambrosial vest <lb/>
            Shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.</p>
          <p>The sire superior smiled; and bade her shew <lb/>
            What heavenly hand had caused his daughter's woe P <lb/>
            Abash'd she names his own imperial spouse ; <lb n="595"/>
            And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.</p>
          <p>Thus they above; while; swiftly gliding down, <lb/>
            Apollo enters Ilion's sacred town : <lb/>
            The guardian god now trembled for her wall, <lb/>
            And fear'd the Greeks, though Fate forbade her fall. 9 <lb n="600"/>
            Back to Olympus, from the war's alarms, <lb/>
            Return the shining bands of gods in arms ; <lb/>
            Some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire ; <lb/>
            And take their thrones around th* ethereal sire.</p>
          <p>Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds, <lb n="605"/>
            O'er slaughtered heroes, and o'er rolling steeds. <lb/>
            As when avenging flames, with fury driven, <lb/>
            On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven; <lb/>
            The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly ; <lb/>
            And the red vapours purple all the sky : <lb n="610"/>
            So raged Achilles : death, and dire dismay, <lb/>
            And toils, and terror, fill'd the dreadful day.</p>
          <p>High on a turret hoary Priam stands, <lb/>
            And marks the waste of his destructive hands; <lb/>
            Views, from his arm, the Trojans' scatter'd flight, <lb n="615"/>
            And the near hero rising on his sight. <lb/>
            No stop, no check, no aid ! With feeble pace, <lb/>
            And settled sorrow on his aged face, <lb/>
            Fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls! <lb/>
            And thus, descending, on the guards he calls: <lb n="620"/>
            </p>
          <p>' You, to whose care our city gates belong, <lb/>
            ' Set wide your portals to the flying throng. <lb/>
            For lo ! he comes, with unresisted sway; <lb/>
            He comes, and desolation marks his way! <lb/>
            But when within the walls our troops take breath, <lb n="625"/>
            Lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.' <lb/>
            Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung <lb/>
            The opening folds ! the sounding hinges rung. <lb/>
            Phœbus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet, <lb/>
            Struck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat. <note type="footnote"> 9 Compare B. xx. 42. </note> <pb n="385"/>

            On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate, <lb/>
            And gladsome see their last escape from fate: <lb/>
            Thither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train, <lb/>
            Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain; <lb/>
            And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on <lb n="635"/>
            With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town. <lb/>
            Enraged Achilles follows with his spear; <lb/>
            Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.</p>
          <p>Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquir'd, <lb/>
            And Troy inglorious to her walls retir'd; <lb n="640"/>
            But he, the god who darts ethereal flame, <lb/>
            Shot down to save her, and red em her fame. <lb/>
            To young Agenor force dive he gave, <lb/>
            (Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave :) <lb/>
            In aid of him, beside the beech he sat, <lb n="645"/>
            And, wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate. <lb/>
            When now the generous youth Achilles spies, <lb/>
            Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise: <lb/>
            (So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll:) <lb/>
            He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul: <lb n="650"/>
            </p>
          <p>' What! shall I fly this terror of the plain P <lb/>
            'like others fly, and be like others slain P <lb/>

            'No : with the common heap I scorn to fall- <lb n="655"/>

            ' And, soon as Night her dusky veil extends, <lb/>

            ' What if- P But wherefore all this vain debate P <lb/>

            ' E'en now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall, <lb n="665"/>
            ' The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall: <lb/>

            , And such his valour, that who stands must die. <lb/>
            , Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state, <lb/>

            Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel <lb/>
            (Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel 2 <lb/>
            ' One only soul informs that dreadful frame; <lb/>

            So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts, <lb/>
            Rous'd from his thicket by a storm of darts: <lb/>
            Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds <lb/>
            Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds; <lb n="680"/>
            Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain, <lb/>
            And the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain; <lb/>
            On their whole war, untam'd the savage flies; <lb/>
            And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies. <lb/>
            Not less resolv'd Antenor's valiant heir <lb n="685"/>
            Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war, <lb/>
            Disdainful of retreat: high-held before, <lb/>
            His shield (a broad circumference) he bore; <lb/>
            Then, graceful as he stood, in act to throw <lb/>
            The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe: <lb n="690"/>

            'And strong, and many, are the sons of Troy: <lb/>

            Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms <lb/>
            He stands impassive in th' ethereal arms. <lb/>
            Then, fiercely rushing on the daring foe, <lb/>
            His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow; <lb/>
            But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds <lb n="705"/>
            The godlike Trojan in a veil of clouds: <lb/>
            Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view, <lb/>

          <p>The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose <lb/>
            Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his son <lb/>
            to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain. Hector <lb/>
            consults within himself what measures to take; but, at the advance of <lb/>
            Achilles, his resolution fails him, and be flies : Achilles pursues him <lb/>
            thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning the fate of <lb/>
            Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles. She de­ <lb/>
            ludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and is <lb/>
            slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot, in the sight of <lb/>
            Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their <lb/>
            cries reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired <lb/>
            into the inner part of the palace; she mounts up to the walls, and be­ <lb/>
            holds her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of <lb/>
            grief and lamentation.</p>
          <p>The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and on <lb/>
            the battlements of Troy.</p>
          <p>THUS to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear, <lb/>
            The herded Ilians rush like driven deer; <lb/>
            There safe, they wipe the briny drops away, <lb/>
            And drown in bowls the labours of the day. <lb/>
            Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields, <lb n="5"/>
            Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields, <lb/>
            March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers, <lb/>
            Far-stretching in the shade of Trojan towers. <lb/>
            Great Hector singly stay'd; chain'd down by fate, <lb/>
            There fix'd he stood before the Scæan gate ; <lb n="10"/>
            Still his bold arms determin'd to employ, <lb/>
            The guardian still of long-defended Troy.</p>
          <p>Apollo now to tir'd Achilles turns, <lb/>
            (The power confessed in all his glory burns,) <lb/>
            'And what' (he cries) ' has Peleus' son in view, <lb n="15"/>

          <p>Then to the city, terrible and strong, <lb/>
            With high and haughty steps he towered along: <lb/>
            So the proud courser, victor of the prize, <lb/>
            To the near goal with double ardour flies. <lb/>
            Him, as he blazing shot across the field, <lb n="35"/>
            The careful eyes of Priam first beheld. <lb/>
            Not half so dreadful rises to the sight, <lb/>
            Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night, <lb/>
            Orients do , (the year when autumn weighs,) <lb/>
            And o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays ; <lb n="40"/>

            Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death. <lb/>
            So flam'd his fiery mail. Then wept the sage : <lb/>

            He lifts his wither'd arms ; obtests the skies; <lb n="45"/>

            Full at the Scæan gate expects the war: <lb/>
            While the sad father on the rampart stands, <lb/>

            With him the mournful mother bears a part: <lb n="110"/>
            Yet all their sorrows turn not Hector's heart: <lb/>
            The zone unbraced, her bosom she displayed; <lb/>
            And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:</p>
          <p>' Have mercy on me, 0 my son! revere <lb/>
            ' The words of age ; attend a parent's prayer! <lb n="115"/>
            ' If ever thee in these fond arms I press'd, <lb/>

          <p>So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll : <lb/>
            But fix'd remains the purpose of his soul ; <lb/>
            Itesolv'd he stands, and with a fiery glance <lb/>
            Expects the hero's terrible advance. <lb/>
            So, roll'd up his den, the swelling snake <lb n="130"/>

            When, fed with noxious herbs, his turgid veins <lb/>

            He bums, he stiffens with collected ire, <lb/>

            Beneath a turret, on his shield reclin'd, <lb/>
            He stood, and questioned thus his mighty mind:</p>

            The Pelian javelin, in his better hand, <lb n="175"/>
            Shot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land; <lb/>
            And on his breast the beamy splendours shone <lb/>
            Like Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun. <lb/>
            As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise, <lb/>
            Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies : <lb n="180"/>
            He leaves the gates, he leaves the walls behind; <lb/>
            Achilles follows like the winged wind. <lb/>
            Thus at the panting dove the falcon flies; <lb/>
            (The swiftest racer of the liquid skies ;) <lb/>
            Just when he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey, <lb n="185"/>

            With open beak and shrilling cries he springs, <lb/>

            Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad, <lb/>
            (A wider compass,) smoke along the road. <lb/>
            Next by Scamander's double source they bound, <lb n="195"/>
            Where two fam'd fountains burst the parted ground: <lb/>
            This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise, <lb/>

            (Such as in races crown the speedy strife;) <lb/>
            The prize contended was great Hector's life. <lb n="210"/>

            (Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame,) <lb/>
            The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal, <lb n="215"/>
            And with them turns the rais'd spectator's soul: <lb/>
            Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly; <lb/>
            The gazing gods lean forward from the sky: <lb/>
            To whom, while eager on the chase they look, <lb/>
            The sire of mortals and immortals spoke: <lb n="220"/>

            ' Now see him flying! to his fears resign'd, <lb/>
            ' And Fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind. <lb/>
            ' Consult, ye powers ('tis worthy your debate) <lb/>
            ' Whether to snatch him from impending fate, <lb n="230"/>
            ' Or let him bear, by stem Pelides slain, <lb/>
            ' (Good as he is,) the lot impos'd on man ?'</p>
          <p>Then Pallas thus: 'Shall he whose vengeance forms <lb/>
            ' The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms, <lb/>
            ' Shall he prolong one Trojan's forfeit breath, <lb n="235"/>
            'A man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death ? <lb/>

            So oft Achilles turns him to the plain: <lb n="255"/>
            He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain. <lb/>
            As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace <lb/>

            Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake, <lb/>
            Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake: <lb n="260"/>
            No less the labouring heroes pant and strain; <lb/>
            While that but flies, and this pursues, in vain.</p>
          <p>What god, 0 Muse! assisted Hector's force, <lb/>
            With Fate itself so long to hold the course P <lb/>
            Phœbus it was : who, in his latest hour, <lb n="265"/>
            Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power ; <lb/>
            And great Achilles, lest some Greek's advance <lb/>
            Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance, <lb/>
            Sign'd to the troops, to yield his foe the way, <lb/>
            And leave untouch'd the honours of the day. <lb n="270"/>
            </p>
          <p>Jove lifts the golden balances, that show <lb/>
            The fates of mortal men, and things below: <lb/>
            Here each contending hero's lot he tries, <lb/>
            And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies. <lb/>
            Low sinks the scale surcharg'd with Hector's fate; <lb n="275"/>
            Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.</p>
          <p>Then Phoebus left him. Fierce Minerva flies <lb/>
            To stern Pelides, and, triumphing, cries: <lb/>
            ' Oh lov'd of Jove! this day our labours cease, <lb/>
            ' And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece. <lb n="280"/>

          <p>He spoke, and launched his javelin at the foe; <lb/>
            But Hector shunn'd the meditated blow: <lb n="350"/>
            He stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear <lb/>
            Sung innocent, and spent its force in air. <lb/>

            Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy, <lb n="355"/>

            Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd <lb n="370"/>
            The mortal dart; resulting with a bound <lb/>
            From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground. <lb/>
            Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain, <lb/>
            Nor other lance nor other hope remain; <lb/>
            He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear, <lb n="375"/>
            In vain, for no Deïphobus was there. <lb/>
            All comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh, <lb/>
            ' 'Tis so-heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh! <lb/>
            'I deem'd Deïphobus had heard my call, <lb/>

            Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares; <lb/>

            Refulgent orb ! above his fourfold cone <lb n="395"/>
            The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun, <lb/>
            Nodding at every step, (Vulcanian frame !) <lb/>
            And as he mov'd, his figure seem'd on flame. <lb/>
            As radiant Hesper shines with keener light, <lb/>
            Far-beaming o'er the silver host of night, <lb n="400"/>
            When all the starry train emblaze the sphere: <lb/>
            So shone the point of great Achilles' spear. <lb/>
            In his right hand he waves the weapon round, <lb/>
            Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound; <lb/>
            But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore, <lb n="405"/>
            Securely cased the warrior's body o'er. <lb/>
            One place at length he spies, to let in fate, <lb/>
            Where 'twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate <lb/>

            Nor pierc'd the windpipe yet, nor took the power <lb/>
            Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour. <lb/>
            Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies, <lb/>
            While thus, triumphing, stern Achilles cries :</p>

            ‘ Die thou the first! when Jove and heaven ordain, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. After <lb/>
            the funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep, the <lb/>
            ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of burial: the <lb/>
            next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood <lb/>
            for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering their hair to the <lb/>
            dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly, twelve Trojan <lb/>
            captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays libations to the <lb/>
            winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise the flame. When <lb/>
            the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones, place them in an <lb/>
            urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes the funeral games: <lb/>
            the chariot-race, the fight of the cæstus, the wrestling, the foot race, the <lb/>
            single combat, the discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the <lb/>
            javelin : the various descriptions of which, and the various success of the <lb/>
            several antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.</p>
          <p>In this book ends the thirtieth day: the night following, the ghost of Pa­ <lb/>
            troclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-tbirtieth day is employed in <lb/>
            felling the timber for the pile; the two-and-thirtieth in burning it; and <lb/>
            the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the <lb/>
            sea-shore.</p>
          <p>THUS humbled in the dust, the pensive train <lb/>
            Through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain. <lb/>
            The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore, <lb/>
            Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore: <lb/>
            The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand, <lb n="5"/>
            All, but the martial Myrmidonian band: <lb/>
            These yet assembled great Achilles holds, <lb/>
            And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds : <pb n="403"/>
             <note type="margin">B. XXIII.] </note></p>
          <p>' Not yet (my brave companions of the war) <lb/>
            Release your smoking coursers from the car ; <lb n="10"/>
            ‘ But with his chariot each in order led, <lb/>
            ‘ Perform due honours to Patroclus dead; <lb/>
            ‘ Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief, <lb/>
            ‘ Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief.'</p>
          <p>The troops obey'd; and thrice in order led <lb n="15"/>
            (Achilles first) their coursers round the dead <lb/>
            And thrice their sorrows and laments renew; <lb/>
            Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew. <lb/>
            For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe, <lb/>
            Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow. <lb n="20"/>
            But chief, Pelides; thick-succeeding sighs <lb/>
            Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes : <lb/>
            His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid <lb/>
            On his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said :</p>
          <p>' All hail, Patroclus ! let thy honoured ghost <lb n="25"/>
            ‘ Hear and rejoice on Pluto's dreary coast; <lb/>
            ‘ Behold ! Achilles' promise is complete ; <lb/>
            ‘ The bloody Hector stretch'd before thy feet. <lb/>
            ‘ Lo ! to the dogs his carcass I resign; <lb/>
            ‘ And twelve sad victims of the Trojan line, <lb n="30"/>
            ‘ Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire, <lb/>
            ‘Their lives effus'd around thy funeral pyre.'</p>
          <p>Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view) <lb/>
            Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw, <lb/>
            Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around <lb n="35"/>
            Unbrac'd their armour, and the steeds unbound. <lb/>
            All to Achilles' sable ship repair, <lb/>
            Frequent and full, the genial feast to share. <lb/>
            Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire, <lb/>
            The bristly victims hissing o'er the fire; <lb n="40"/>
            The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries <lb/>
            Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies. <lb/>
            round the hero's prostrate body flow'd, <lb/>
            In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood. <lb/>
            And now a band of Argive monarchs brings <lb n="45"/>
            The glorious victor to the king of kings. <lb/>
            From his dead friend the pensive warrior went, <lb/>
            With steps unwilling, to the regal tent. <lb/>
            Th' attending heralds, as by office bound, <lb/>
            With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround; <lb n="50"/>
            To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore, <lb/>
            They urg'd in vain ; the chief refus'd, and swore,</p>

            ‘ Then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire, <lb n="65"/>

          <p>He spoke: they hear him, and the word obey; <lb/>
            The rage of hunger and of thirst allay, <lb/>
            Then ease in sleep the labours of the day. <lb/>
            But great Pelides, stretch'd along the shore, <lb n="70"/>
            Where dash'd on rocks the broken billows roar, <lb/>
            Lies inly groaning ; while on either hand <lb/>
            The martial Myrmidons confus'dly stand: <lb/>
            Along the grass his languid members fall, <lb/>
            Tir'd with his chase around the Trojan wall; <lb n="75"/>
            Hush'd by the murmurs of the rolling deep, <lb/>
            At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep. <lb/>
            When lo! the shade before his closing eyes <lb/>
            Of sad Patroclus rose, or seemed to rise: <lb/>
            In the same robe he living wore, he came, <lb n="80"/>
            In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same. <lb/>
            The form familiar hover'd o'er his head, <lb/>
            And, ‘ Sleeps Achilles,' (thus the phantom said,) <lb/>
            ‘ Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead P <lb/>

          <p>He said, and with his longing arms essay'd <lb n="115"/>
            In vain to grasp the visionary shade ; <lb/>
            Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly, <lb/>
            And hears a feeble, lamentable cry. <lb/>
            Confus'd he wakes ; amazement breaks the bands <lb/>
            Of golden sleep, and, starting from the sands, <lb n="120"/>
            Pensive he muses with uplifted hands :</p>
          <p>‘ 'Tis true, 'tis certain ; man, though dead, retains <lb/>
            ‘ Part of himself; th' immortal mind remains: <lb/>
            ‘ The form subsists, without the body's aid, <lb/>

            ‘ This night, my friend, so late in battle lost, <lb/>

            'E'en now familiar, as in life, he came, <lb/>
            ‘ Alas, how different! yet how like the same!'</p>
          <p>Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears ; <lb n="130"/>
            And now the rosy-finger'd morn appears, <lb/>
            Shews every mournful face with tears o'erspread, <lb/>
            And glares on the pale visage of the dead. <lb/>
            But Agamemnon, as the rites demand, <lb/>
            With mules and waggons sends a chosen band <lb n="135"/>
            To load the timber, and the pile to rear; <lb/>
            A charge consigned to Merion's faithful care. <lb/>
            With proper instruments they take the road, <lb/>
            Axes to cut, and ropes to ,ling the load. <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            First march the heavy mules, securely slow, <lb n="140"/>
            O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go: <lb/>
            Jumping, high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground, <lb/>
            Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock'd axles bound. <lb/>
            But when arriv'd at Ida's spreading woods, <lb/>
            (Fair Ida, watered with descending floods,) <lb n="145"/>
            Loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes; <lb/>
            On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks <lb/>
            Headlong. Deep-echoing groan the thickets brown; <lb/>
            Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down: <lb/>
            The wood the Grecians cleave, prepar'd to burn ; <lb n="150"/>
            And the slow mules the same rough road return. <lb/>
            The sturdy woodmen equal burthens bore <lb/>
            (Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore ; <lb/>
            There on the spot which great Achilles shew'd, <lb/>
            They eas'd their shoulders and dispos'd the load; <lb n="155"/>
            Circling around the place, where tunes to come <lb/>
            Shall view Patroclus and Achilles' tomb. <lb/>
            The hero bids his martial troops appear <lb/>
            High on their cars, in all the pomp of war: <lb/>
            Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires, <lb n="160"/>
            All mount their chariots, combatants and squires. <lb/>
            The chariots first proceed, a shining train; <lb/>
            Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain; <lb/>
            Next these a melancholy band appear, <lb/>
            Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier: <lb n="165"/>
            O'er all the come their scatter'd locks they throw: <lb/>
            Achilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe, <lb/>
            Supporting with his hands the hero's head, <lb/>
            Bends o'er th' extended body of the dead. <lb/>
            Patroclus decent on th' appointed ground <lb n="170"/>
            They place, and heap the sylvan pile around. <lb/>
            But great Achilles stands apart in prayer, <lb/>
            And from his head divides the yellow hair; <lb/>
            Those curling locks which from his youth he vow'd, <lb/>
            And sacred grew to Sperchius'2 honour'd flood: <lb n="175"/>
            Then, sighing, to the deep his looks he cast, <lb/>
            And roll'd his eves around the watery waste :</p>
          <p>‘ Sperchius! whose waves, in mazy .errors lost, <lb/>
            ‘ Delightful roll along my native coast! <lb/>

          <p>Thus o'er Patroclus while the hero pray'd, <lb n="190"/>
            On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid. <lb/>
            Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow: <lb/>
            And now the sun had set upon their woe ; <lb/>
            But to the king of men thus spoke the chief: <lb/>
            'Enough, Atrides ! give the troops relief: <lb n="195"/>
            'Permit the mourning legions to retire, <lb/>
            'And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre ; <lb/>
            'The pious care be ours, the dead to burn.' <lb/>
            He said: the people to their ships return: <lb/>
            While those deputed to inter the slain, <lb n="200"/>
            Heap with a rising pyramid the plain; <lb/>
            A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide, <lb/>
            The growing structure spreads on every side; <lb/>
            High on the top the manly corse they lay, <lb/>
            And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay: <lb n="205"/>
            Achilles cover'd with their fat the dead, <lb/>
            And the pil'd victims round the body spread ; <lb/>
            Then jars of honey and of fragrant oil <lb/>
            Suspends around, low-bending o'er the pile. <lb/>
            Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan, <lb n="210"/>
            Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown. <lb/>
            Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board, <lb/>
            Fall two, selected to attend their lord. <lb/>
            Then last of all, and horrible to tell, <lb/>
            Sad sacrifice ! twelve Trojan captives fell: <lb n="215"/>
            On these the rage of fire victorious preys, <lb/>
            Involves, and joins them in one common blaze. <lb/>
            Smear'd with the bloody rites he stands on high, <lb/>
            And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:</p>
          <p>'All hail, Patroclus ! let thy vengeful ghost <lb n="220"/>
            'Hear and exult on Pluto's dreary coast. <lb/>

            Celestial Venus hover'd o'er his head, <lb/>

            And drove the bloodhounds from their destin'd prey. <lb/>
            Nor sacred Phœbus less employ'd his care: <lb/>
            He pour'd around a veil of gather'd air, <lb/>
            And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire, <lb/>
            Against the solar beam and Sirian fire. <lb n="235"/>

          <p>Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies, <lb/>
            Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise ; <lb/>
            But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer, <lb/>
            Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air, <lb/>
            And victims promised, and libations cast, <lb n="240"/>
            To gentle zephyr and the Boreal blast: <lb/>
            He call'd th' aerial powers, along the skies <lb/>
            To breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise. <lb/>
            The winged Iris heard the hero's call, <lb/>
            And instant hastened to their airy hall, <lb n="245"/>
            Where, in old Zephyr's open courts on high, <lb/>
            Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky. <lb/>
            She shone amidst them, on her painted bow; <lb/>
            The rocky pavement glittered with the show. <lb/>
            All from the banquet rise, and each invites <lb n="250"/>
            The various goddess to partake the rites. <lb/>
            'Not so,' (the dame replied,) 'I haste to go <lb/>
            'To sacred Ocean, and the floods below; <lb/>

            To the wide main then stooping from the skies, <lb/>

            Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn, <lb/>
            And pour in tears, ere yet they close the urn: <lb/>
            So stay'd Achilles, circling round the shore, <lb/>
            So watoh'd the flames, till now they flame no more. <lb/>
            'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night, <lb n="280"/>
            The morning planet told th' approach of light; <lb/>
            And, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray <lb/>
            O'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day: <lb/>
            Then sunk the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd, <lb/>
            And to their caves the whistling winds return'd: 5 <lb n="285"/>

            And sunk to quiet in th' embrace of sleep, <lb/>
            Exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd <lb n="290"/>
            Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood: <lb/>
            The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook <lb/>
            Unwilling slumber, and the chief bespoke :</p>
          <p>'Ye kings and princes of th' Achaian name ! <lb/>
            'First let us quench the yet remaining flame <lb n="295"/>

            Wide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw, <lb/>
            And deep subsides the ashy heap below. <lb/>
            Next the white bones his sad companions place, <lb/>
            With tears collected, in the golden vase. <lb/>
            The sacred relics to the tent they bore; <lb n="315"/>
            The urn a veil of linen cover'd o'er. <lb/>
            That done, they bid the sepulchre aspire, <lb/>

            Resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames. <lb/>
            First stood the prizes to reward the force <lb/>
            Of rapid racers in the dusty course : <lb/>
            A woman for the first, in beauty's bloom, <lb/>
            Skill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom; <lb n="330"/>
            And a large vase, where two bright handles rise, <lb/>
            Of twenty measures its capacious size. <lb/>
            The second victor claims a mare unbroke, <lb/>
            Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke ; <lb/>
            The third, a charger yet untouched by flame; <lb n="335"/>
            Four ample measures held the shining frame : <lb/>
            Two golden talents for the fourth were plac'd; <lb/>
            An ample double bowl4 contents the last. <lb/>
            These m fair order rang'd upon the plain, <lb/>
            The hero, rising, thus address'd the train: <lb n="340"/>

          <p>'Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks ! decreed <lb/>

            'But this no time our vigour to display, <lb/>

            And skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed. <lb/>
            With equal ardour bold Tydides swell'd, <lb/>
            The steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell'd, <lb n="360"/>
            (Which late obey'd the Dardan chief's command, <lb/>
            When scarce a god redeem'd him from his hand.) <lb/>
            Then Menelaiis his Podargus brings, <lb/>
            And the fam'd courser of the king of kings: <lb/>
            Whom rich Echepolus, (more rich than brave,) <lb n="365"/>

            The prudent son with unattending ears :</p>
          <p>' My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast. <lb n="375"/>
            'The gods have lov'd thee, and with arts have bless'd. <lb/>

            'It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize, <lb/>
            ' And to be swift is less than to be wise : <lb/>
            ''Tis more by art, than force of numerous strokes, <lb n="385"/>
            'The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks; <lb/>

            ' His hand unerring steers the steady horse, <lb/>

            ' Enclos'd with stones, conspicuous from afar, <lb/>
            And round, a circle for the wheeling car. <lb/>
            ' (Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace; <lb n="405"/>
            ' Or then, as now, the limit of a race.) <lb/>
            ' Bear close to this, and warily proceed, <lb/>
            ' A little bending to the left-hand steed; <lb/>

            ' And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll, <lb/>
            ' The wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal; <lb/>

            Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse,) <lb/>
            ' Clear of the stony heap direct the course; <lb/>
            ' Lest, through incaution failing, thou may'at be <lb n="415"/>

            ' Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed <lb/>
            ' Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed; <lb n="420"/>
            ' Or the fam'd race through all the regions known, <lb/>
            ' That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon.'</p>
          <p>Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage <lb/>
            Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age. <lb/>
            Next bold Meriones was seen to rise, <lb n="425"/>
            The last, but not least ardent for the prize. <lb/>
            They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose ; <lb/>
            (Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws ;) <lb/>
            Young Nestor leads the race; Eumelus then ; <lb/>
            And next, the brother of the king of men: <lb n="430"/>
            Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast; <lb/>
            And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last. <lb/>
            They stand in order, an impatient train <lb/>
            Pelides points the barrier on the plain, <lb/>
            And sends before old Phoenix to the place, <lb n="435"/>
            To mark the racers, and to judge the race. <lb/>
            At once the coursers from the barrier bound; <lb/>
            The lifted scourges all at once resound; <lb/>
            Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before ; <lb/>
            And up the champaign thunder from the shore: <lb n="440"/>
            Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise, <lb/>
            And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies ; <lb/>
            Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined, <lb/>
            Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind: <lb/>
            The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound, <lb n="445"/>
            Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground; <lb/>
            While hot for fame, and conquest all their care, <lb/>
            (Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,) <lb/>
            Erect with ardour, pois'd upon the rein, <lb/>
            They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain, <lb n="450"/>
            Now (the last compass fetch d around the goal) <lb/>
            At the near prize each gathers all his soul, <lb/>
            Each burns with double hope, with double pain <lb/>
            Tears up the shore, and thunders tow'rd the main. <lb/>
            First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds; <lb n="455"/>
            With those of Tros, bold Diomed succeeds: <lb/>
            Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind, <lb/>
            And seem just mounting on his car behind; <pb n="413"/>
             <note type="margin">B. XXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze, <lb/>
            And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees. <lb n="460"/>
            Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize; <lb/>
            But angry Phœbus to Tydides flies, <lb/>
            Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain <lb/>
            His matchless horses' labour on the plain. <lb/>
            Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey, <lb n="465"/>
            Snatch'd from his hope, the glories of the day. <lb/>
            The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain, <lb/>
            Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again, <lb/>
            And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke, <lb/>
            She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke: <lb n="470"/>
            No more their way the startled horses held; <lb/>
            The car revers'd came rattling on the field; <lb/>
            Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel, <lb/>
            Prone on the dust th' unhappy master fell; <lb/>
            His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground; <lb n="475"/>
            Nose, mouth, and front one undistinguished wound: <lb/>
            Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes; <lb/>
            Before him far the glad Tydides flies; <lb/>
            Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace, <lb/>
            And crowns him victor of the labour a race. <lb n="480"/>
            </p>
          <p>The next, though distant, Menelaiis succeeds ; <lb/>
            While thus young Nestor animates his steeds : <lb/>
            ' Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force; <lb/>
            ' Not that we hope to match Tydides horse ; <lb/>
            'Since great Minerva wings their rapid way, <lb n="485"/>
            ' And gives their lord the honours of the day. <lb/>
            ' But reach Atrides! shall his mare out-go <lb/>
            'Your swiftness P vanquished by a female foe P <lb/>
            ' Through your neglect, if, lagging on the plain, <lb/>
            ' The last ignoble gift be all we gain, <lb n="490"/>
            ' No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply; <lb/>
            ' The old man's fury rises, and ye die. <lb/>
            ' Haste then! yon narrow road before our sight <lb/>
            ' Presents th' occasion, could we use it right.'</p>
          <p>Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat <lb n="495"/>
            With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat. <lb/>
            And now Antilochus, with nice survey, <lb/>
            Observes the compass of the hollow way. <lb/>
            "Twas where by force of wintry torrents torn, <lb/>
            Fast by the road a precipice was worn: <lb n="500"/>
            Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng, <lb/>
            The Spartan hero's chariot smok'd along. <lb/>
            Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep, <lb/>
            Still edging near, and bears him tow'rd the steep. <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below, <lb n="505"/>
            And wonders at the rashness of his foe: <lb/>
            ' Hold, stay your steeds-what madness thus to ride <lb/>
            ' This narrow way ! Take larger field,' (he cried,) <lb/>
            ' Or both must fall.' Atrides cried in vain; <lb/>
            He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein. <lb n="510"/>
            Far as an able arm the disc can send, <lb/>
            When youthful rivals their full force extend, <lb/>
            So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew <lb/>
            Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew <lb/>
            His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears <lb n="515"/>
            The rattling ruin of the clashing cars, <lb/>
            The floundering coursers rolling on the plain, <lb/>
            And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain. <lb/>
            But thus upbraids his rival as he flies : <lb/>
            ' Go, furious youth ! ungenerous and unwise! <lb n="520"/>
            ' Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign ; <lb/>
            ' Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine.' <lb/>
            Then to his steeds with all his force he cries : <lb/>
            ' Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize! <lb/>
            ' Your rivals, destitute of youthful force, <lb n="525"/>
            ' With fainting knees shall labour in the course, <lb/>
            ' And yield the glory yours.' The steeds obey; <lb/>
            Already at their heels they wing their way, <lb/>
            And seem already to retrieve the day.</p>
          <p>Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld <lb n="530"/>
            The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field. <lb/>
            The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king; <lb/>
            High on a rising ground, above the ring, <lb/>
            The monarch sat; from whence with sure survey <lb/>
            He well observed the chief who led the way, <lb n="535"/>
            And heard from far his animating cries, <lb/>
            And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes; <lb/>
            On whose broad front a blaze of shining white, <lb/>
            Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight. <lb/>
            He saw; and, rising, to the Greeks begun : <lb n="540"/>
            ' Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone P <lb/>
            ' Or can ye, all, another chief survey,</p>
          <p>And other steeds, than lately led the way P <lb/>
            ' Those, though the swiftest, by some god withhold, <lb/>
            Lie sure disabled in the middle field: <lb n="545"/>
            ' For since the goal they doubled, round the plain <lb/>
            'I search to find them, but I search in vain. <lb/>
            ' Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand, <lb/>
            ' And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand, <lb/>
            ' Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray <lb n="550"/>
            ' With frantic fury from the destin'd way. <pb n="415"/>
             <note type="margin">B. XXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            ' Rise then some other, and inform my sight; <lb/>
            ' (For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;) <lb/>
            ' Yet sure he seems (to judge by shape and air) <lb/>
            ' The great Ætolian chief, renown'd in war.' <lb n="555"/>
            </p>
          <p>' Old man!' (Oïleus rashly thus replies,) <lb/>
            ' Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize. <lb/>
            ' Of those who view the course, not sharpest ey'd, <lb/>
            ' Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide. <lb/>
            ' Eumelus' steeds high-bounding in the chase, <lb n="560"/>
            ' Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race; <lb/>
            ' I well discern him, as he shakes the rein, <lb/>
            ' And hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain.' <lb/>
            Thus he. Idomeneus incens'd rejoined: <lb/>
            ' Barbarous of words ! and arrogant of mind! <lb n="565"/>
            ' Contentious prince ! of all the Greeks beside <lb/>
            ' The last in merit, as the first in pride! <lb/>
            ' To vile reproach what answer can we make P <lb/>
            ' A goblet or a tripod let us stake, <lb/>
            ' And be the king the judge. The most unwise <lb n="570"/>
            ' Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price</p>
          <p>He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne, <lb/>
            Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn <lb/>
            To fell extremes. But Thetis' god-like son, <lb/>
            Awful, amidst them rose; and thus begun: <lb n="575"/>
            </p>
          <p>' Forbear, ye chiefs ! reproachful to contend: <lb/>
            Much would ye blame, should others thus offend: <lb/>
            ' And lo! th' approaching steeds your contest end.</p>
          <p>No sooner had he spoke, but, thundering near, <lb/>
            Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer; <lb n="580"/>
            High o'er his head the circling lash he wields; <lb/>
            His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields : <lb/>
            His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd, <lb/>
            Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold, <lb/>
            Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find <lb n="585"/>
            The track his flying wheels had left behind: <lb/>
            And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace <lb/>
            So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race. <lb/>
            Now victor at the goal Tydides stands, <lb/>
            Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands; <lb n="590"/>
            From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream ; <lb/>
            The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam : <lb/>
            With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize, <lb/>
            The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes : <lb/>
            These to the ships his train triumphant leads, <lb n="595"/>
            The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.</p>
          <p>Young Nestor follows, (who by art, not force, <lb/>
            O'erpass'd Atrides,) second in the course. <lb/>
             <pb n="416"/>
            Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near <lb/>
            Than to the courser in his swift career <lb n="600"/>
            The following car, just touching with his heel <lb/>
            And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel <lb/>
            Such, and so narrow, now the space between <lb/>
            The rivals, late so distant on the green; <lb/>
            So soon swift Æthe her lost ground regain'd, <lb n="605"/>
            One length, one moment, had the race obtained.</p>
          <p>Merion pursued, at greater distance still, <lb/>
            With tardier coursers, and inferior skill. <lb/>
            Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son; <lb/>
            Slow dragg'd the steeds his batter d chariot on; <lb n="610"/>
            Achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:</p>
          <p>‘ Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass'd <lb/>
            ‘ The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last ! <lb/>
            ‘ Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay <lb/>
            ‘ (Since great Tydides bears the first away) <lb n="615"/>
            ‘ To him the second honours of the day.'</p>
          <p>The Greeks consent with loud applauding cries, <lb/>
            And then Eumelus had receiv'd the prize, <lb/>
            But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame, <lb/>
            Th' award opposes, and asserts his claim: <lb n="620"/>
            ‘ Think not, (he cries,) ‘ I tamely will resign, <lb/>
            ‘ 0 Pelcus' son! the mare so justly mine. <lb/>
            ‘ What if the gods, the skilful to confound, <lb/>
            ‘ Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground ? <lb/>
            ‘ Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice, <lb n="625"/>
            ‘ And vows omitted forfeited the prize. <lb/>
            ‘ If yet, (distinction to thy friend to shew, <lb/>
            ‘ And please a soul desirous to bestow,) <lb/>
            ‘ Some gift must grace Eumelus ; view thy store <lb/>
            ‘ Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore; <lb n="630"/>
            ‘ An ample present let him thence receive, <lb/>
            ‘ And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give. <lb/>
            ‘ But this, my prize, I never shall forego ; <lb/>
            ‘ This, who but touches, warriors ! is my foe.'</p>
          <p>Thus spake the youth, nor did his words offend; <lb n="635"/>
            Pleas'd with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend, <lb/>
            Achilles smil'd: ‘ The gift propos'd,' (he cried,) <lb/>
            ‘ Antilochus ! we shall ourselves provide. <lb/>
            ‘ With plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er, <lb/>
            ‘ (The same renown’d Asteropæus wore,) <lb n="640"/>
            ‘ Whose glittering margins rais'd with silver shine, <lb/>
            ' (No vulgar gift, Eumelus, shall be thine.' <note type="footnote"> 5 Menelaus followed as close upon Antilochus as a chariot follows upon <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> B. XXIII.] </note></p>
          <p>He said: Automedon at his command <lb/>
            The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand. <lb/>
            Distinguished by his friend, his bosom glows <lb n="645"/>
            With generous joy : then Menelaus rose ; <lb/>
            The herald plac d the sceptre in his hands, <lb/>
            And still'd the clamour of the shouting bands. <lb/>
            Not without cause incens'd at Nestor's son, <lb/>
            And inly grieving, thus the king begun: <lb n="650"/>
            </p>
          <p>‘ The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd, <lb/>
            ‘ An act so rash, Antilochus, has stain'd. <lb/>

            ‘ To you, 0 Grecians ! be my wrong declar'd: <lb/>
            ‘ So not a leader shall our conduct blame, <lb n="655"/>
            ‘ Or judge me envious of a rival's fame. <lb/>
            ‘ But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain ? <lb/>
            f What needs appealing in a fact so plain P <lb/>
            ‘ What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise, <lb/>
            ‘ And vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize ? <lb n="660"/>
            ‘ Rise, if thou dar'st, before thy chariot stand, <lb/>
            ‘ The driving scourge high lifted in thy hand, <lb/>
            ‘ And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent <lb/>
            ‘ Was but to conquer, not to circumvent. <lb/>
            ‘ Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround <lb n="665"/>
            ‘ The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground.'</p>
          <p>The prudent chief with calm attention heard; <lb/>
            Then mildly thus : ‘ Excuse, if youth have err'd; <lb/>
            ‘ Superior as thou art, forgive th' offence, <lb/>
            ‘ Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense. <lb n="670"/>
            ‘Thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age, <lb/>
            ‘ Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage. <lb/>
            ‘ The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign; <lb/>
            ‘ The mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine, <lb/>
            ‘ Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn) <lb n="675"/>
            ‘ Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn.'</p>
          <p>So spoke Antilochus; and at the word <lb/>
            The mare contested to the king restor'd. <lb/>
            Joy swells his soul, as when the vernal grain <lb/>
            Lifts the green ear above the springing plain, <lb n="680"/>
            The fields their vegetable life renew, <lb/>
            And laugh and glitter with the morning dew : <lb/>
            Such joy the Spartan's shining face o’erspread, <lb/>
            And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:</p>
          <p>‘ Still may our souls, 0 generous youth! agree; <lb n="685"/>
            ‘ 'Tis now Atrides' turn to yield to thee. <lb/>
            ‘ Rash heat perhaps a moment might control, I <lb/>

            ‘ For ah! how few, who should like thee offend, <lb/>
            ‘ Like thee, have talents to regain the friend P <lb/>
            ‘ To plead indulgence, and thy fault atone, <lb/>
            ‘ Suffice thy father's merits, and thy own: <lb/>
            ‘ Generous alike, for me the sire and son <lb n="695"/>
            ‘ Have greatly suffer'd, and have greatly done. <lb/>
            ‘ I yield; that all may know my soul can bend, <lb/>
            . Nor is my pride preferred before my friend.'</p>
          <p>He said: and pleased his passion to command, <lb/>
            Resign'd the courser to Noemon's hand, <lb n="700"/>
            Friend of the youthful chief: himself content, <lb/>
            The shining charger to his vessel sent. <lb/>
            The golden talents Merion next obtain'd; <lb/>
            The fifth reward, the double bowl,7 remain'd. <lb/>
            Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears, <lb n="705"/>
            And thus the purpose of his gift declares :</p>
          <p>' Accept thou this, 0 sacred sire,' (he said,) <lb/>
            ‘ In dear memorial of Patroclus dead; <lb/>
            ‘Dead, and for ever lost, Patroclus lies, <lb/>
            ‘For ever snatch'd from our desiring eyes! <lb n="710"/>
            ‘ Take thou this token of a grateful heart: <lb/>

            ‘ Or urge the race, or wrestle on the field: <lb/>
            ‘ Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown, <lb n="715"/>
            ' But left the glory of the past thy own.'</p>
          <p>He said, and plac'd the goblet at his side : <lb/>
            With joy the venerable king replied:</p>
          <p>, WIsely and well, my son, thy words have proved <lb/>

            The host beheld him, silent with amaze! <lb/>
            Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire <lb/>
            To meet his might, and emulate thy sire, <lb/>
            The great Mecistheus ; who in days of yore <lb n="785"/>
            In Theban games the noblest trophy bore, <lb/>
            (The games ordain'd dead (Edipus to grace,) <lb/>
            And singly vanquish’d the Cadmean race. <lb/>
            Him great Tydides urges to contend, <lb/>
            Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend; <lb n="790"/>
            Officious with the cincture girds him round; <lb/>
            And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound. <lb/>
            Amid the circle now each champion stands, <lb/>
            And poises high in air his iron hands : <lb/>
            With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close, <lb n="795"/>
            Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows, <lb/>
            And painful sweat from all their members flows. <lb/>
            At length Epëus dealt a weighty blow <lb/>
            Full on the cheek of his unwary foe; <lb/>
            Beneath that pondrous arm's resistless sway <lb n="800"/>
            Down dropp’d he, nerveless, and extended lay. <lb/>
            As a large fish, when winds and waters roar, <lb/>
            By some huge billow dash'd against the shore, <lb/>
            Lies panting: not less batter d with his wound, <lb/>
            The bleeding hero pants upon the ground. <lb n="805"/>
            To rear his fallen foe the victor lends, <lb/>
            Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends; <lb/>
            Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng, <lb/>
            And dragging his disabled legs along; <lb/>
            Nodding, his head hangs down, his shoulder o'er; <lb n="810"/>
            His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore ; <lb/>
            Wrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought; <lb/>
            His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.</p>
          <p>The third bold game Achilles next demands, <lb/>
            And calls the wrestlers to the level sands: <lb n="815"/>
            A massy tripod for the victor lies, <lb/>
            Of twice six oxen its reputed price: <lb/>
            And next, the loser's spirits to restore, <lb/>
            A female captive, valued but at four. <lb/>
            Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose, <lb n="820"/>
            When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose. <lb/>
            Amid the ring each nervous rival stands, <lb/>
            Embracing rigid with implicit hands : <lb/>
            Close locked above, their heads and arms are mix'd; <lb/>
            Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd: <pb n="421"/>
             <note type="margin">B. XXIII.] </note> <lb n="825"/>
            Like two strong rafters, which the builder forms <lb/>
            Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms, <lb/>
            Their tops connected, but at wider space <lb/>
            Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base. <lb/>
            Now to the grasp each manly body bends; <lb n="830"/>
            The humid sweat from every pore descends ; <lb/>
            Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs, <lb/>
            Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise. <lb/>
            Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd, <lb/>
            O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground; <lb n="835"/>
            Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow <lb/>
            The watchful caution of his artful foe. <lb/>
            While the long strife e'en tir'd the lookers on, <lb/>
            Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon: <lb/>
            Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me : <lb n="840"/>
            ‘ Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree.'</p>
          <p>He said: and, straining, heav'd him off the ground <lb/>
            With matchless strength : that time Ulysses found <lb/>
            The strength t' evade, and where the nerves combine <lb/>
            His ankle struck: the giant fell supine; <lb n="845"/>
            Ulysses following, on his bosom lies; <lb/>
            Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies. <lb/>
            Ajax to lift, Ulysses next essays, <lb/>
            He barely stirr d him, but he could not raise; <lb/>
            His knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied; <lb n="850"/>
            And, grappling close, they tumble side by side. <lb/>
            Defiled with honourable dust, they roll, <lb/>
            Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul: <lb/>
            Again they rage, again to combat rise; <lb/>
            When great Achilles thus divides the prize: <lb n="855"/>
            </p>
          <p>‘ Your noble vigour, oh my friends, restrain ; <lb/>
            ‘ Nor weary out your generous strength in vain. <lb/>
            ‘ Ye both have won :9 let others who excel, <lb/>
            ‘ Now prove that prowess you have proved so well.'</p>
          <p>The hero's words the willing chiefs obey, <lb n="860"/>
            From their tir'd bodies wipe the dust away, <lb/>
            And, cloth'd anew, the following games survey.</p>
          <p>And now succeed the gifts ordam'd to grace <lb/>
            The youths contending in the rapid race: <note type="footnote"> 9 Ajax, lifting Ulysses, excelled in the first instance; and Ulysses, sup­ <lb/>
            planting Ajax, while he was lifted, in the second. The next fall is under­ <lb/>
            stood by some to have been the fall of Ulysses pulled down by the weight <lb/>
            of Ajax: but it seems evident, that the former, by a twist of the knee, <lb/>
            threw the latter, and for that reason had the advantage, though he fell <lb/>
            also. Cowper </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            A silver urn that full six measures held, <lb n="865"/>
            By none in weight or workmanship excell’d: <lb/>
            Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine, <lb/>
            Elaborate, with artifice divine; <lb/>
            Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport, <lb/>
            And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port: <lb n="870"/>
            From him descended, good Eunæus heir'd <lb/>
            The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spar'd, <lb/>
            To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward. <lb/>
            Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace, <lb/>
            It stands the prize of swiftness in the race. <lb n="875"/>
            A well-fed ox was for the second plac'd; <lb/>
            And half a talent must content the last. <lb/>
            Achilles rising then bespoke the train: <lb/>
            ‘ Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain, <lb/>
            ‘ Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain. <lb n="880"/>
            </p>
          <p>The hero said, and, starting from his place, <lb/>
            Mean Ajax rises to the race; <lb/>
            Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd <lb/>
            His youthful equals, Nestor's son the last. <lb/>
            Banged in a line the ready racers stand; <lb n="885"/>
            Pelides points the barrier with his hand: <lb/>
            All start at once; Oïleus led the race; <lb/>
            The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace: <lb/>
            Behind him, diligently close, he sped, <lb/>
            As closely following as the running thread <lb n="890"/>
            The spindle follows, and displays the charms <lb/>
            Of the fair spinster's breast, and moving arms: <lb/>
            Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies, <lb/>
            And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise : <lb/>
            His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays ; <lb n="895"/>
            Th' admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise: <lb/>
            To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes, <lb/>
            And send their souls before him as he flies. <lb/>
            Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal, <lb/>
            The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul: <lb n="900"/>
            ‘ Assist, 0 goddess !’ (thus in thought he pray'd,) <lb/>
            And, present at his thought, descends the maid. <lb/>
            Buoy a by her heavenly force, he seems to swim, <lb/>
            And feels a pinion lifting every limb. <lb/>
            All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain, <lb n="905"/>
            Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain, <lb/>
            (O'erturn'd by Pallas,) where the slippery shore <lb/>
            Was clogg'd with slimy dung, and mingled gore: <lb/>
            (The self-same place beside Patroclus’ pyre, <lb/>
            Whore late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire:) <pb n="423"/>
             <note type="margin">B. XXIII.] </note> <lb n="910"/>
            Besmear’d with filth, and blotted o'er with clay, <lb/>
            Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay: <lb/>
            The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shar'd, <lb/>
            And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward. <lb/>
            Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast, <lb n="915"/>
            The baffled hero thus the Greeks addressed: <lb/>
            ' Accursed fate! the conquest I forego; <lb/>
            ‘ A mortal I, a goddess was my foe: <lb/>
            ‘ She urged her favourite on the rapid way, <lb/>
            ‘ And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.' <lb n="920"/>
            </p>
          <p>Thus sourly wail'a he, sputtering dirt and gore; <lb/>
            A burst of laughter echo'd through the shore. <lb/>
            Antilochus, more humorous than the rest, <lb/>
            Takes the last prize and takes it with a jest:</p>
          <p>' Why with our wiser elders should we strive ? <lb n="925"/>
            ‘ The gods still love them, and they always thrive. <lb/>
            ‘Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize ; <lb/>
            ‘ He to Ulysses, still more ag'd and wise ; <lb/>
            ‘ (A green old age unconscious of decays, <lb/>
            ‘ That proves the hero born in better days!) <lb n="930"/>
            ‘ Behold his vigour in this active race I <lb/>
            ‘ Achilles only boasts a swifter pace: <lb/>
            ‘ For who can match Achilles ? He who can, <lb/>
            ‘ Must yet be more than hero, more than man.'</p>
          <p>Th' effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries, <lb n="935"/>
            ‘ Thy artful praise deserves a better prize. <lb/>
            ‘ Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll’d; <lb/>
            ‘ Receive a talent of the purest gold.' <lb/>
            The youth departs content. The host admire <lb/>
            The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire. <lb n="940"/>
            </p>
          <p>Next these a buckler, spear, and helm he brings ; <lb/>
            Cast on the plain the brazen burthen rings : <lb/>
            Arms, which of late divine Sarpedon wore, <lb/>
            And great Patroclus in short triumph bore. <lb/>
            ‘ Stand forth, the bravest of our host,' (he cries) <lb n="945"/>
            ‘ Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize ! <lb/>
            ‘ Now grace the lists before our army's sight, <lb/>
            ‘ And, sheath'd in steel, provoke his foe to fight. <lb/>
            ‘ Who first the jointed armour shall explore, <lb/>
            ‘ And stain his rival's mail with issuing gore ; <lb n="950"/>
            ‘ The sword Asteropæus possess'd of old, <lb/>
            ‘ (A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,) <lb/>
            ‘ Shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side; <lb/>
            ‘ These arms in common let the chiefs divide: <lb/>
            ‘ For each brave champion, when the combat ends, <lb n="955"/>
            ‘ A sumptuous banquet at our tent attends.'</p><pb n="424"/>
            
          <p>Fierce at the word, up rose great Tydeus' son, <lb/>
            And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon: <lb/>
            Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand, <lb/>
            The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand: <lb n="960"/>
            Lowering they meet, tremendous to the sight; <lb/>
            Each Arrive bosom beats with fierce delight. <lb/>
            Oppos'd in arms not long they idly stood, <lb/>
            But thrice they clos'd, and thrice the charge renew'd. <lb/>
            A furious pass the spear of Ajax made <lb n="965"/>
            Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd: <lb/>
            Not thus the foe; his javelin aim'd above <lb/>
            The buckler’s margin, at the neck he drove. <lb/>
            But Greece now trembling for her hero's life, <lb/>
            Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife. <lb n="970"/>
            Yet still the victoris due Tydides gains, <lb/>
            With him the sword and studded belt remains.</p>
          <p>Then hurl'd the hero, thundering on the ground, <lb/>
            A mass of iron (an enormous round), <lb/>
            Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire, <lb n="975"/>
            Rude from the furnace, and but shap'd by fire. <lb/>
            This mighty quoit Eëtion wont to rear, <lb/>
            And from his whirling arm dismiss'd in air: <lb/>
            The giant by Achilles slain, he stow'd <lb/>
            Among his spoils this memorable load. <lb n="980"/>
            For this he bids those nervous artists vie, <lb/>
            That teach the disc to sound along the sky: <lb/>
            ‘ Let him whose might can hurl this bowl, arise; <lb/>
            ‘ Who farthest hurls it, takes it as his prize: <lb/>
            ‘ If he be one enrich'd with large domain <lb n="985"/>
            ‘ Of downs for flocks, and arable for grain, <lb/>
            ‘ Small stock of iron needs that man provide; <lb/>
            ‘ His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied <lb/>
            ‘ From hence; nor ask the neighbouring city's aid <lb/>
            ' For ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade.' <lb n="990"/>
            </p>
          <p>Stern Polypcetes stepp'd before the throng, <lb/>
            And great Leonteus, more than mortal strong : <lb/>
            Whose force with rival forces to oppose, <lb/>
            Up rose great Ajax; up Epeüs rose. <lb/>
            Each stood in order: first Epeüs threw; <lb n="995"/>
            High o'er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew. <lb/>
            Leonteus next a little space surpass’d, <lb/>
            And third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast: <lb/>
            O'er both their marks it flew; till, fiercely flung <lb/>
            From Polypœtes’ arm, the discus sung: <lb n="1000"/>
            Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,10 <lb/>
            That distant falls among the grazing cows, <note type="footnote"> 10 The use of this staff was to separate the cattle. It had a string </note> <pb n="425"/>
            <note type="margin"> B. XXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            So past them all the rapid circle flies: <lb/>
            His friends (while loud applauses shake the skies) <lb/>
            With force conjoined heave off the weighty prize. <lb n="1005"/>
            </p>
          <p>Those who in skilful archery contend <lb/>
            He next invites, the twanging bow to bend: <lb/>
            And twice ten axes casts amidst the round; <lb/>
            (Ten double-edg'd, and ten that singly wound.) <lb/>
            The mast, which late a first-rate galley bore, <lb n="1010"/>
            The hero fixes in the sandy shore : <lb/>
            To the tall top a milk-white dove they tie, <lb/>
            The trembling mark at which their arrows fly. <lb/>
            ‘ Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird shall bear <lb/>
            ‘ These two-edged axes, terrible in war: <lb n="1015"/>
            ‘ The single, he, whose shaft divides the cord.' <lb/>
            He said: experienc'd Merion took the word; <lb/>
            And skilful Teucer : in the helm they threw <lb/>
            Their lots inscrib'd, and forth the latter flew. <lb/>
            Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies; <lb n="1020"/>
            But flies unblest! No grateful sacrifice, <lb/>
            No firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow <lb/>
            To Phœbus, patron of the shaft and bow. <lb/>
            For this, thy well-aim'd arrow, turn'd aside, <lb/>
            Err'd from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied : <lb n="1025"/>
            Adown the main-mast fell the parted string, <lb/>
            And the free bird to heaven displays her wing: <lb/>
            Seas, shores, and skies with loud applause resound, <lb/>
            And Merion eager meditates the wound: <lb/>
            He takes the bow, directs the shaft above, <lb n="1030"/>
            And, following with his eye the soaring dove, <lb/>
            Implores the god to speed it through the skies, <lb/>
            With vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrifice. <lb/>
            The dove, in airy circles as she wheels, <lb/>
            Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels; <lb n="1035"/>
            Quite through and through the point its passage found, <lb/>
            And at his feet fell bloody to the ground. <lb/>
            The wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last, <lb/>
            With flagging wings alighted on the mast, <lb/>
            A moment hung, and spread her pinions there, <lb n="1040"/>
            Then sudden dropped, and left her life in air. <lb/>
            From the pleas'a crowd new peals of thunder rise, <lb/>
            And to the ships brave Merion bears the prize.</p>
          <p>To close the funeral games, Achilles last <lb/>
            A massy spear amid the circle plac'd, <note type="footnote">attached to the lower part of it, which the herdsman wound about his <lb/>
            hand, and by the help of it hurled the staff to a prodigious distance. <lb/>

            For these he bids the heroes prove their art, <lb/>
            Whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart. <lb/>
            Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize; <lb n="1050"/>
            Nor here disdain’d the king of men to rise. <lb/>
            With joy Pelides saw the honour paid, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector’s body. Jupiter <lb/>
            sends Thetis to Achilles to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris to <lb/>
            Priam, to encourage him to go in person, and treat for it. The old <lb/>
            king, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for <lb/>
            the journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He <lb/>
            sets forth in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the <lb/>
            charge of Idæus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a <lb/>
            young man, and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their con­ <lb/>
            versation on the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself <lb/>
            at his feet, and begs for the body of his son: Achilles, moved with <lb/>
            compassion, grants his request, detains him one night in his tent, and <lb/>
            the next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out <lb/>
            to meet him. The lamentation of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, <lb/>
            with the solemnities of the funeral.</p>
          <p>The time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of <lb/>
            Hector lies in the tent of Achilles. And as many more are spent in the <lb/>
            truce allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles'a camp <lb/>
            and partly in Troy.</p>
          <p>Now from the finish’d games the Grecian band <lb/>

            All stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share, <lb/>
            And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care. <lb/>
            Not so Achilles : he, to grief resign'd, <lb n="5"/>
            His friend's dear image present to his mind, <lb/>
            Takes his sad couch, more unobserv'd to weep, <lb/>
            Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep ; <lb/>
            Restless he roll'd around his weary bed, <lb/>
            And all his soul on his Patroclus fed: <lb n="10"/>
            The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind, <lb/>
            That youthful vigour, and that manly mind, <lb/>
            What toils they shar'd, what martial works they wrought, <lb/>
            What seas they measur'd, and what fields they fought; <lb/>
            All pass'd before him in remembrance dear, <lb n="15"/>
            Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear. <lb/>
            And now supine now prone, the hero lay, <lb/>
            Now shifts his side, impatient for the day; <lb/>
            Then starting up, disconsolate he goes <lb/>
            Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes. <lb n="20"/>
            There as the solitary mourner raves, <lb/>
            The ruddy morning rises o'er the waves: <lb/>
            Soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join'd; <lb/>
            The chariot flies, and Hector tiails behind. <lb/>
            And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument <lb n="25"/>
            Was Hector dragged, then hurried to the tent. <lb/>
            There sleep at last overcomes the hero's eyes; <lb/>
            While foul in dust th' unhonour'd carcass lies, <lb/>
            But not deserted by the pitying skies. <lb/>
            For Phœbus watch'd it with superior care, <lb n="30"/>
            Preserved from gaping wounds, and tainting air ; <lb/>
            And, ignominious as it swept the field, <lb/>
            Spread o'er the sacred corse his golden shield. <lb/>
            All heaven was mov'd, and Hermes will'd to go <lb/>
            By stealth to snatch him from th' insulting foe: <lb n="35"/>
            But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies, <lb/>
            And th' unrelenting empress of the skies: <lb/>
            E'er since that day implacable to Troy, <lb/>
            What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy, <lb/>
            Won by destructive lust (reward obscene) <lb n="40"/>
            Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen. <lb/>
            But when the tenth celestial morning broke, <lb/>
            To heaven assembled, thus Apollo spoke:</p>
          <p>‘ Unpitying powers! how oft each holy fane <lb/>
            Has Hector ting'd with blood of victims slain ? <lb n="45"/>
            ‘ And can ye still his cold remains pursue P <lb/>
            ‘ Still grudge his body to the Trojans' view? <lb/>
            ‘ Deny to consort, mother, son, and sire, <lb/>
            ‘ The last sad honours of a funeral fire P <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            ‘ Is then the dire Achilles all your care ? <lb n="50"/>
            ‘ That iron heart, inflexibly severe; <lb/>
            ‘ A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide <lb/>
            ‘ In strength of rage and impotence of pride, <lb/>
            ‘ Who hastes to murder with a savage joy, <lb/>
            ‘ Invades around, and breathes but to destroy. <lb n="55"/>
            ‘ Shame is not of his soul; nor understood, <lb/>
            ‘ The greatest evil and the greatest good.1 <lb/>
            ‘ Still for one loss he rages unresign'd, <lb/>

            ‘ But this insatiate the commission given <lb/>

            ‘ Brave though he be, yet by no reason aw'd, <lb/>
            ‘ He violates the laws of man and God!'</p>

            ‘ Then hear, ye gods! the patron of the bow. <lb/>

            ‘ His birth deriving from a mortal dame: <lb n="75"/>
            ‘ Achilles of your own ethereal race <lb/>
            ‘ Springs from a goddess, by a man's embrace: <lb/>

            The sentiment, as put into the mouth of Thetis in an address to her son, <lb/>
            has given occasion for much remark. Eustathius, and some other critics, <lb/>
            were inclined to think that this part of the speech must be spurious. Diony­ <lb/>

            ‘Still as Aurora's ruddy beam is spread, <lb/>

            ‘Majestical in death ! No stains are found <lb/>

          <p>He said, then took the chariot at a bound, <lb/>
            And snatch'd the reins, and whirl’d the lash around: <lb/>

            The coursers ny, with spirit not their own. <lb/>
            And now they reach , the naval walls, and found <lb n="545"/>
            The guards recasting, while the bowls go round: <lb/>
            On these the virtue of his wand he tries, <lb/>
            And pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes : <lb/>
            Then heaved the massy gates, removed the bars, <lb/>
            And o'er the trenches led the rolling cars. <lb n="550"/>
            Unseen, through all the hostile camp they went, <lb/>
            And now approach'd Pelides’ lofty tent. <lb/>
            Of fir the roof was rais'd, and cover'd o'er <lb/>
            With reeds collected from the marshy shore; <lb/>
            And, fenced with palisades, a hall of state, <lb n="555"/>
            (The work of soldiers,) where the hero sat. <lb/>
            Large was the door, whose well-compacted strength <lb/>
            A solid pine-tree barr'd of wondrous length; <lb/>
            Scarce three strong Greeks could lift its mighty weight, <lb/>
            But great Achilles singly closed the gate. <lb n="560"/>
            This Hermes (such the power of gods) set wide; <lb/>
            Then swift alighted the celestial guide, <lb/>
            And thus, revealed: ' Hear prince ! and understand <lb/>
            ‘Thou ow'st thy guidance to no mortal hand; <lb/>

            ‘His son, his mother! urge him to bestow <lb/>
            ‘Whatever pity that stern heart can know.'</p>
          <p>Thus having said, he vanish'd from his eyes, <lb/>
            And in a moment shot into the skies : <lb n="575"/>
            The king, confirm'd from heaven, alighted there, <lb/>
            And left his aged herald on the car. <lb/>
            With solemn pace through various rooms he went, <lb/>
            And found Achilles in his inner tent: <lb/>
            There sat the hero; Alcimus the brave, <lb n="580"/>
            And great Automedon, attendance gave ; <lb/>
             <pb n="440"/>
            These served his person at the royal feast <lb/>
            Around, at awful distance, stood the rest.</p>
          <p>Unseen by these, the king his entry made; <lb/>
            And, prostrate now before Achilles laid, <lb n="585"/>
            Sudden (a venerable sight!) appears; <lb/>
            Embrac'd his knees, and bath'd his hands in tears; <lb/>
            Those direful hands his kisses pressed, imbrued <lb/>
            E'en with the best, the dearest of his blood !</p>
          <p>As when a wretch (who, conscious of his crime, <lb n="590"/>
            Pursued for murder, flies his native clime) <lb/>
            Just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amaz'd! <lb/>
            All gaze, all wonder: thus Achilles gaz'd: <lb/>
            Thus stood th' attendants stupid with surprise: <lb/>
            All mute, yet seem'd to question with their eyes: <lb n="595"/>
            Each look'd on other, none the silence broke, <lb/>
            Till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke :</p>
          <p>‘Ah think, thou favour d of the powers divine! <lb/>
            Think of thy father's age, and pity mine! <lb/>

            ‘Yet still one comfort in his soul may rise; <lb/>
            ‘He hears his son still lives to glad his eyes; <lb/>
            ‘And, hearing, still may hope a better day <lb n="610"/>
            ‘May send him thee, to chase that foe away. <lb/>
            ‘No comfort to my griefs, no hopes remain, <lb/>

            Th' infectious softness through the heroes ran; <lb/>
            One universal solemn shower began; <lb n="645"/>
            They bore as heroes, but they felt as man.</p>
          <p>Satiate at length with unavailing woes, <lb/>

          <p>He said, and, rising, chose the victim ewe <lb/>
            With silver fleece, which his attendants slew. <lb/>
            The limbs they sever from the reeking hide, <lb/>
            With skill prepare them, and in parts divide: <lb/>
            Each on the coals the separate morsels lays, <lb n="790"/>
            And hasty snatches from the rising blaze. <lb/>
            With bread the glittering canisters they load, <lb/>
            Which round the board Automedon bestow'd : <lb/>
            The chief himself to each his portion plac'd, <lb/>
            And each indulging shar'd in sweet repast. <lb n="795"/>
            When now the rage of hunger was repress’d, <lb/>
            The wondering hero eyes his royal guest; <lb/>
            No less the royal guest the hero eyes, <lb/>
            His godlike aspect, and majestic size; <lb/>
            Here, youthful grace and noble fire engage, <lb n="800"/>
            And there, the mild benevolence of age. <lb/>
            Thus hazing long, the silence neither broke; <lb/>
            (A solemn scene !) at length the father spoke :</p>
          <p>‘Permit me now, belov'd of Jove, to steep <lb/>
            ‘My careful temples in the dew of sleep : <lb n="805"/>

            ‘My hapless son, the dust has been my bed; <lb/>

            ‘I share thy banquet, and consent to live.'</p>
          <p>With that, Achilles bade prepare the bed, <lb/>
            With purple soft, and shaggy carpets spread <lb/>
            Forth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way, <lb/>

            He joins the mules, directs them with his hand, <lb n="860"/>

            At Scæa s gates,6 they meet the mourning wain, <lb/>
            Hang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain. <lb/>
            The wife and mother, frantic with despair. <lb/>
            Kiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter'd hair ; <lb/>
            Thus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay; <lb n="890"/>
            And there had sigh'd and sorrow'd out the day; <lb/>

          <p>WE have now passed through the Iliad, and seen the anger of <lb/>
            Achilles, and the terrible effects of it, at an end: as that only <lb/>
            was the subject of the poem, and the nature of Epic poetry <lb/>
            would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war, <lb/>
            it may perhaps be acceptable to the common reader to give a <lb/>
            short account of what happened to Troy and the chief actors in <lb/>
            this poem, after the conclusion of it.</p>
          <p>I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death <lb/>
            of Hector, by the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars <lb/>
            of which are described by Virgil in the second book of the Æneis.</p>
          <p>Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of <lb/>
            an arrow in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at his death, <lb/>
            book xxii.</p>
          <p>The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of <lb/>
            Achilles.</p>
          <p>Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for <lb/>
            the armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his aim, he slew <lb/>
            himself through indignation.</p>
          <p>Helen, after the death of Paris, married Deiphobus his bro­ <lb/>
            ther, and at the taking of Troy betrayed him, in order to recon­ <lb/>
            cile herself to Menelaus, her first husband, who received her <lb/>
            again into favour.</p>
          <p>Agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by Ægis­ <lb/>
            thus, at the instigation of Clytæmnestra, his wife, who in his <lb/>
            absence had dishonoured his bed with Ægisthus..</p>
          <p>Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his own country, <lb/>
            and scarce escaped with life from his adulterous wife Ægiale ; <lb/>
            but at last was received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his <lb/>
            kingdom ; it is uncertain how he died.</p>
          <p>Nestor lived in peace, with his children, in Pylos, his native <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at <lb/>
            last returned in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer's <lb/>
            Odyssey.</p>
          <p>I must end these notes by discharging my duty to two of my <lb/>
            friends, which is the more an indispensable piece of justice, as the <lb/>
            one of them is since dead. The merit of their kindness to me <lb/>
            will appear infinitely the greater, as the task they undertook was, <lb/>
            in its own nature, of much more labour, than either treasure or <lb/>
            reputation. The larger part of the extracts from Eustathius, <lb/>
            together with several excellent observations, were sent me by <lb/>
            Mr Broome: and the whole Essay upon Homer was written, <lb/>
            upon such memoirs as I had collected, by the late Dr. Parnell, <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            Archdeacon of Clogher in Ireland. How very much that gentle­ <lb/>
            man's friendship prevailed over his genius, in detaining a writer <lb/>
            of his spirit in the drudgery of removing the rubbish of past <lb/>
            pedants, will soon appear to the world, when they shall see those <lb/>
            beautiful pieces of poetry, the publication. of which he left to my <lb/>
            charge, almost with his dying breath.</p>
          <p>For what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of <lb/>
            taking leave at the end of my work ; and from embarrassing <lb/>
            myself, or others, with any defences or apologies about it. But <lb/>
            instead of endeavouring to raise a vain monument to myself, of <lb/>
            the merits or difficulties of it (which must be left to the world, <lb/>
            to truth, and to posterity), let me leave behind me a memorial of <lb/>
            my friendship with one of the most valuable men, as well as <lb/>
            finest writers, of my age and country; one who has tried, and <lb/>
            knows by his own experience, how hard an undertaking it is to <lb/>
            do justice to Homer; and one who (I am sure) sincerely rejoices <lb/>
            with me at the period of my labours. To him, therefore, having <lb/>
            brought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to dedicate it; <lb/>
            and to have the honour and satisfaction of placing together, in <lb/>
            this manner, the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of</p>
          <p>A. POPE.</p>
