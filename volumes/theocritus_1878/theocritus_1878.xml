          <p>IN the following translation of Theocritus, Bion, aud <lb/>
            Moschus, the text of Kiessling has been mainly adopted. But <lb/>
            where a passage appeared obscure or corrupt, the trans­ <lb/>
            lator has used his own judgment in deciding between the <lb/>
            readings suggested by Heindorf, in 1810, Briggs, in 1821, <lb/>
            and Wordsworth, in 1844 ; and has either recorded in notes, <lb/>
            or admitted into the body of the translation, whichever he <lb/>
            deemed preferable. He has also had recourse to the Poetæ <lb/>
            Græci Minores, of Gaisford ; to " Theocritus Sacram Scrip­ <lb/>
            turam illustrans," by Chr. Porschberger, Lipsiae, 1744 ; and <lb/>
            to the several metrical translations of Theocritus, &amp;c., by <lb/>
            Creech, Fawkes, Polwhele, and Chapman, the latter of which <lb/>
            is appended to this volume. And he has given, in the form <lb/>
            of notes, much information derived from these, and from <lb/>
            scattered criticisms in the Classical Museum and elsewhere, <lb/>
            including Smith's Dictionaries of Greek and Roman Anti­ <lb/>
            quities, and Biography. This labour has been undertaken <lb/>
            and completed in the hope that it may be useful to those who <lb/>
            have not leisure to search for themselves, and yet would fain <lb/>
            refresh their memory with the sweet strains of the Doric min­ <lb/>
            strelsy, as well as to those who require assistance towards <lb/>
            mastering these confessedly difficult poets.</p><pb n="VI"/>
            
          <p>Whatever the labour, the translator is aware that the credit <lb/>
            attaching to a prose translation is by no means large. Yet <lb/>
            he believes that, properly applied, such a work may be of <lb/>
            great advantage : and though a resolute opponent of the in­ <lb/>
            discriminate use of a “ crib," he is not the less persuaded that <lb/>
            there are many hard-working tyros, as well as advanced <lb/>
            students, to whom it may be a great boon, and whose progress <lb/>
            in classical knowledge it will assist rather than impede. He <lb/>
            has taken up the work " con amore;" inasmuch as the taste <lb/>
            for the Bucolic Poets, which he imbibed under one who had <lb/>
            a keen appreciation of their beauties,-and who, in his too <lb/>
            brief tenure of the head-mastership of one of our principal <lb/>
            schools, manifested singular felicity in inspiring his pupils <lb/>
            with a zest for their song,-has grown into an ardent desire to <lb/>
            do somewhat towards their more extended study. He rejoices <lb/>
            to hear that there is hope of a fresh edition of the Greek Bucolic <lb/>
            Poets from the University of Cambridge, the promise of <lb/>
            which is not likely to be imperfectly fulfilled, considering the <lb/>
            hand from which it is to come. Meanwhile, if through this <lb/>
            unpretending translation, which, without being servile in its <lb/>
            literality, is, the translator hopes, sufficiently close, a score more <lb/>
            men within the next two years shall be induced to place Theo­ <lb/>
            critus on their list for the public examinations at Oxford, he <lb/>
            will not regret the labour bestowed upon rendering into bare <lb/>
            prose a bard whose lays are so full of poetry.</p>

          <p>FOR the biography of the foremost of Bucolic minstrels, the <lb/>
            pastoral poet Theocritus, unfortunately few materials exist. <lb/>
            Indeed the little which is known is inferred either from the <lb/>
            actual poems of Theocritus himself, or from such as have <lb/>
            been published under his name. Of the latter class is the 22nd <lb/>
            epigram, from which we gather his parentage and birth-place, <lb/>
            and which is generally held to have been the work of Ar­ <lb/>
            temidorus the grammarian. Evidently written with a view <lb/>
            to distinguishing between our poet and his Chian namesake, <lb/>
            an orator and sophist, it fixes for his native place Syracuse, <lb/>
            and for his parents Praxagoras and Philinna. With this <lb/>
            account Suidas substantially agrees, though he adds that <lb/>
            some make Theocritus the son of Simichus, or Simichidas, and <lb/>
            holds that, being originally a native of Cos, he had become a <lb/>
            metæch or foreign settler at Syracuse. Now if we compare <lb/>
            this notion with the Scholia on the 7th Idyll, vs. 21, (where it <lb/>
            is suggested by some that the name is an assumed one, derived <lb/>
            from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σίμος</foreign>, flat-nosed,) as well as with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεοκϱίτου γένος</foreign>, it <lb/>
            seems that a confusion has arisen with regard to the identity of <lb/>
            Theocritus with Simichidas, into whose mouth the 7th Idyll is <lb/>
            put. It does not seem to have occurred to those who make Simi­ <lb/>
            chus the father of the Syracusan poet, that bards are wont to <lb/>
            shadow forth their own words, thoughts, and acts, under ficti­ <lb/>
            tious names and unreal characters, and that Theocritus might <lb/>
            really have described what happened to himself in the "Thaly­ <lb/>
            sia," and yet not have used the name of Simichidas, otherwise <lb/>
            than Virgil uses that of Tityrus.—Nor is there any reason to <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            suppose that the claims of Cos to the honour of his birth and <lb/>
            early training rest on stronger grounds than that he studied <lb/>
            under Philetus of Cos, whom he mentions in Idyll vii. 40, whe­ <lb/>
            ther at Cos itself or in Alexandria is not clear. Of Philetus,. <lb/>
            and Asclepiades, of whom he speaks as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν ἐσθλὸν Σικελίδαν <lb/>
            το̃ν ἐκ Σάμω</foreign>, (Idyll vii. 40,) it is known that they were dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished poets of the Alexandrian school, whom Theocritus <lb/>
            professedly admired, and of the former of whom he was pro­ <lb/>
            bably a pupil.</p>
          <p>There is internal evidence in the Idylls of the poet, that I <lb/>
            resided for some space at Alexandria, and afterwards at <lb/>
            Syracuse, whilst the 7th Idyll shows such a knowledge of <lb/>
            the localities of Cos, as could hardly, one should think, <lb/>
            have been obtained without a personal acquaintance with <lb/>
            the island. Here may have arisen his intimacy with Ni­ <lb/>
            cias of Miletus, the physician to whom he dedicated the <lb/>
            11th and 13th Idylls, and to whose wife, Theugenis, he wrote <lb/>
            a pleasing ditty, (28th,) with a silver distaff. -But this is <lb/>
            mere conjecture, arising probably out of the nearness of Cos <lb/>
            to Miletus. To Alexandria Theocritus was no doubt at­ <lb/>
            tracted by the fame of its library, founded by Ptolemy <lb/>
            Soter, and raised to its highest point of eminence by his son <lb/>
            Philadelphus, under whose care it became the resort of tht, <lb/>
            most distinguished literati of the day, Zenodotus, Callimachus, <lb/>
            Hegesias, Euclid, Aratus. To the last of these, the astro­ <lb/>
            nomer and poet, who was the author of the Phænomena, <lb/>
            he addressed his 6th Idyll, and his name occurs again in the <lb/>
            Idyll following. Association with such a man would not be <lb/>
            without its advantages, and we here and there discover traces <lb/>
            of his having imbibed from his friend some acquaintance <lb/>
            with astronomical matters. But it was probably at Alex­ <lb/>
            andria, too, that he found access to the pages of the Septua­ <lb/>
            gint, itself a lasting monument of the Egyptian monarch's zeal <lb/>
            in the collection of literary treasures. No one can read the <lb/>
            16th, 18th, 20th, and 23rd Idylls without being struck by the <lb/>
            similarity of thought and expression of passages in each, to <lb/>
            portions of the Psalms of David, the Book of Job, the Song <lb/>
            of Solomon, and the Prophecies of Isaiah. The parallels have <lb/>
            been pointed out in the notes to the present translation: but <lb/>
            the strength of internal evidence to the supposition that Theo­ <lb/>
            critus availed himself of the access, which he might undoubt­ <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            edly have had, to the Septuagint, receives additional force in the <lb/>
            comparison of the whole scene of altercation between Pollux <lb/>
            and Amycus with the historical record of the encounter be­ <lb/>
            tween David and Goliath in the First Book of Samuel. It can <lb/>
            hardly be doubted that Theocritus composed the 14th, 15th, <lb/>
            and 17th Idylls at Alexandria : he could not have enjoyed <lb/>
            even the passing favour and brief notice of Ptolemy Phila­ <lb/>
            delphus, without becoming interested in the law and records <lb/>
            of that strange race, the Jews of many wanderings ; one hun­ <lb/>
            dred and twenty thousand of whom had been liberated by that <lb/>
            monarch from the slavery in which Ptolemy Soter had bound <lb/>
            them. Josephus (Antiq. xii. 2) writes at length respecting <lb/>
            the interest shown by Ptolemy Philadelphus in obtaining for <lb/>
            his vast library an accurate translation of the Books of the <lb/>
            Old Testament. We find from him how the monarch strove <lb/>
            to purchase the good will of the nation by sending splendid <lb/>
            gifts to the God of Israel: how he valued the translators <lb/>
            and their translations : and how he conversed with his <lb/>
            librarian, Demetrius Phalereus, on the deep meaning and <lb/>
            superior wisdom of the Jewish law. And we know enough <lb/>
            of the tide of fashion, especially if it is royal taste that lifts <lb/>
            the floodgate, which carries onward successful literature <lb/>
            of any class, to feel sure that a scholar could hardly have <lb/>
            tarried even for a brief space at Alexandria without inspect­ <lb/>
            ing that volume, which even to heathens was a work of <lb/>
            wonder, fostered by reflecting credit upon one of the fore­ <lb/>
            most of the then rulers of the world. A poet likewise, im­ <lb/>
            bued, as was Theocritus, with a sense of the charm of natural <lb/>
            simplicity, and having withal, as some of his poems show, no <lb/>
            mean appreciation of the glorious epic, could never have been <lb/>
            content with a transient glance at a collection of Such infinite <lb/>
            graces, simplicity, grandeur, natural colouring, and noble <lb/>
            imagery, as the translation of the Seventy elders, inferior <lb/>
            though it be in diction to the original. No! like others, he <lb/>
            dipped often into that well of wisdom, albeit he knew not the <lb/>
            spell which renders it sweeter to the taste than all other <lb/>
            waters. Hovering around those sacred pages, he caught the <lb/>
            scent of flowers of poesy, which he has transferred into his <lb/>
            Idylls, and we have the gratification of an involuntary testi­ <lb/>
            nony from a heathen poet to the charms of composition and <lb/>
            material, with which the sacred volume is so richly fraught. <note type="footnote">b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            Our taste will be wilfully dull, if it acknowledge not the <lb/>
            extreme probability that the Syracusan saw the Septuagint, <lb/>
            and there need be no stumbling-block in the argument that he <lb/>
            no where mentions the Jews. He dived for pearls of poesy, <lb/>
            leaving unexplored the buried treasures of history and reli­ <lb/>
            gion. Without satisfactory data for any certain conclusion, <lb/>
            we can at least give the benefit of probabilities in favour of <lb/>
            our poet's acquaintance with the Septuagint. From this we <lb/>
            pass on to other matter.</p>
          <p>Theocritus, while at Alexandria, was allowed, we presume, <lb/>
            to dedicate his 17th Idyll to Ptolemy Philadelphus ; and we <lb/>
            have reason to suppose that the 14th and 15th were com­ <lb/>
            posed there also. But it is clear that he did not find the <lb/>
            monarch and his capital such kindly fosterers of his Muse <lb/>
            as he might have expected: for very soon we find him <lb/>
            hymning at Syracuse the praises (considerably qualified by <lb/>
            doubts of his open-handedness) of King Hiero the Second. <lb/>
            That monarch had ascended the throne B. C. 270 : and the <lb/>
            Idyll to which reference has been made, appears to have <lb/>
            been written during the 1st Punic War, if we may judge <lb/>
            from the allusion which he makes to the failing Carthagi­ <lb/>
            nians, and Hiero's alliance with their implacable foe. This <lb/>
            would fix the date of the Idyll as 263 B. c.; when a treaty <lb/>
            between Hiero and the Romans was concluded. But the <lb/>
            rays of courtly favour must have .been here also any thing <lb/>
            but warm, the atmosphere chilly, when a poet was to be cher­ <lb/>
            ished, or creative genius to be saved from starvation and blight. <lb/>
            Hiero's munificence was bestowed rather on kingdoms and <lb/>
            potentates, than on minstrels and their songs. Perhaps Theo­ <lb/>
            critus discovered at this point the mistake of trusting in princes <lb/>
            for the advancement of poetic excellence: at any rate, the <lb/>
            greater portion of his Idylls show him to have sought in <lb/>
            the calm tranquillity of country life and pastoral scenery, that <lb/>
            independent self-reliance, Which, after all, is the safest nurse <lb/>
            of the lovely rhyme. Though when he rises to heroics, as in <lb/>
            the encomiums on Ptolemy and Hiero, and in the 22nd, 24th, <lb/>
            and 25th Idylls, he fully sustains his reputation, and no where <lb/>
            falls into poverty of language, or mediocrity of conception; <lb/>
            yet it is on the first eleven Idylls, the 14th, 15th, and 21st, <lb/>
            that his title to the fame, which has been universally ac­ <lb/>
            corded to him, is most really and justly based. Bion and <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            Moschu3 are pretty conceit-weavers : they sometimes delight <lb/>
            US'with passages unrivalled for warmth of colouring and ten­ <lb/>
            derness of pathos :-but for simple rural life, accurately and <lb/>
            tastefully depicted, for the thorough appreciation of nature, <lb/>
            and reliance thereupon for the staple of his song, Theocritus <lb/>
            ranks immeasurably above them. He stands alone, with a <lb/>
            crowd of imitators at a wide interval of merit. Virgil's Ec­ <lb/>
            logues have no inherent stamp of reality about them. We <lb/>
            lack the shepherd's account of his own life among his sheep. <lb/>
            There is more of polish than of nature. We have the cour­ <lb/>
            tier drawing smooth pictures from fancy ; not the passion­ <lb/>
            ate lover of the country deriving his materials from the real <lb/>
            landscapes on which he is actually looking out. To borrow <lb/>
            an apt expression, Virgil's Eclogues are pictures of a polished <lb/>
            mind playing at shepherd.</p>
          <p>And as to our own pastoral writers, Spenser, Pope, Gay, <lb/>
            Lyttleton, and Shenstone, none reach to half the height of <lb/>
            Bucolic minstrelsy, to which their great model undeniably <lb/>
            attained. Spenser's dialect and metre are unfavourable to his <lb/>
            subject; and hecan lay no claim to be a true bard of nature ; <lb/>
            while it is matter of fact that beneath his rural images there is <lb/>
            an under-current of allusion to matters of religion. Who can <lb/>
            enjoy with true zest the pastoral, where the shepherd Roffin <lb/>
            symbolizes a bishop of Rochester, and the watch-dog Lowder, <lb/>
            one of his chaplains ? (See Shepherd's Calendar, Eel. ix.) <lb/>
            And as for Pope, whose pretensions rank next, his pastorals <lb/>
            deserve credit only because they were written by a boy of <lb/>
            sixteen ; it were an insult to compare them with the mature <lb/>
            productions of Theocritus. For smoothness of versification, <lb/>
            they have indeed won praise from Macaulay and the Earl of <lb/>
            Carlisle; but these two most capable judges assign to them <lb/>
            no higher meed. Indeed, had Pope's pastorals alone survived <lb/>
            their author, we may well question whether his name would <lb/>
            have even been remembered. As for the rest, they claim <lb/>
            still less right to tread the same ground, to rank in the same <lb/>
            order with Theocritus, in that portion of the temple of fame <lb/>
            which good taste will always assign to the Pastoral or Bu­ <lb/>
            colic poets.</p>
          <p>Coarse though the Syracusan bard be here and there, he is <lb/>
            indeed, as Quinctilian calls him, " admirabilis in suo genere," <lb/>
            nor is it any detraction from his well-won laurels that the <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            same critic goes on to say, " sed musa illa rustica et pastoralis <lb/>
            non forum mode, verum ipsam etiam urbem reformidat." (Inst. <lb/>
            Orator, x. 1.) It must be borne in mind, when we stumble <lb/>
            on grave objections against the poems of Theocritus, that his <lb/>
            idea of simplicity is not a transcendental, but a natural one. <lb/>
            He has no model Arcadia in view : his eye is all the while <lb/>
            upon the woods and vales and river pastures of his native <lb/>
            Sicily ; taking his shepherds as he found them there, mak­ <lb/>
            in,, them speak what they did speak, not what they ought to <lb/>
            have spoken. There are blemishes to his Idylls, which cer­ <lb/>
            tainly render an expurgated edition of them a desideratum : <lb/>
            but these affect more or less all the chief writers of antiquity. <lb/>
            The question however which is just now dividing the educa­ <lb/>
            tional world of France, seems to us to admit of but one solu­ <lb/>
            tion. What is true of most of the Greek and Latin Classics, <lb/>
            is of course true of Theocritus, as one of them. We cannot) <lb/>
            forego the charms of the whole, because our delicacy is of­ <lb/>
            fended, our purity shocked, by one or two Idylls, which, while <lb/>
            they illustrate the darkest traits in the life of a heathen, only <lb/>
            make us the more thankful that Christianity has at least gone <lb/>
            far to banish one of the worst forms of human guilt and <lb/>
            degradation.) But upon the whole, the poems of Theocritus, <lb/>
            without aiming at any deep moral lesson, are eminently calcu­ <lb/>
            lated to nourish in us a growth of that keen taste for rural <lb/>
            scenery, which is one of the purest and finest of earthly yearn­ <lb/>
            ings : whilst in liveliness, variety, and rhythm they certainly <lb/>
            surpass anything of their kind, ancient or modern. And this <lb/>
            must have arisen from the familiarity in which, we infer, The­ <lb/>
            ocritus passed his latter years with rural scenes and characters.</p>
          <p>It is seldom that we have no notice, at any rate no tradition, <lb/>
            respecting the death of the poets of the ancient world. Of <lb/>
            Hesiod, Simonides, Æschylus, Sophocles, Callimachus, Apol­ <lb/>
            lonius, Rhodius, (and these are but a few names taken hap-ha­ <lb/>
            zard,) we find some story at least, vague though it be, of their <lb/>
            death or their burial-place. But Theocritus seems to have <lb/>
            vanished from before the eyes of men, after he had lamented <lb/>
            at Syracuse the small account in which bards of his day were <lb/>
            held of tyrants. May he not have ended his days unnoticed <lb/>
            in some quiet spot, to rise long after into fame by his depic­ <lb/>
            tion of it, while his bones lay sepulchred on one of the head­ <lb/>
            lands which he puts before us so vividly ? Did he not fall. <lb/>
             <pb n="XIII"/>
            asleep afar from the din of cities, bewept, like his fabled <lb/>
            Daphnis, by universal nature ? Ovid, we can hardly doubt, <lb/>
            was in his Ibis confusing the poet with his Chian namesake, <lb/>
            where he says, <lb/>
            Utque Syracosio præstrietâ. fauce poetæ <lb/>
            Sic animæ laqueo sit via clausa tibi. Lib. in Ibim, 554. <lb/>
            In a note upon this passage in the Delphin edition, it is ob­ <lb/>
            served, that the old interpreters understood this to mean that <lb/>
            Theocritus was hung by the son of Hiero, king of Sicily, <lb/>
            on account of his invectives against him. But this only <lb/>
            proves the fear of him, who wrote the epigram before alluded <lb/>
            to, as distinguishing the name-sakes of Syracuse and Chios, to <lb/>
            have been a well-grounded fear. Ovid, if, by the Syracusan <lb/>
            poet, he means Theocritus, seems to have stumbled on the <lb/>
            rock of which that epigram might have warned him. The <lb/>
            fate of the Chian seems to have been transferred in his mind <lb/>
            to the Syracusan, as will be seen by the following extract from <lb/>
            Macrobius, Saturnalia, lib. vii. c. 3.</p>
          <p>"King Antigonus put to death the Chian Theocritus, al­ <lb/>
            though he was bound by an oath to spare him, on account of <lb/>
            an unfortunate joke of that individual at his expense. For <lb/>
            when he was being dragged before Antigonus as if to receive <lb/>
            punishment, and his friends were comforting him, and afford­ <lb/>
            ing hopes that he would experience the royal clemency, <lb/>
            when once he had come before the eyes of the king ; Then,' <lb/>
            observed he, ‘ the hope you hold out of safety is a vain one.' <lb/>
            For the king had lost one eye. So the ill-timed witticism <lb/>
            cost the prisoner his life."</p>
          <p>Now if we thus clear away this very apparent confusion <lb/>
            between the two, we have no account of the death of the <lb/>
            pastoral poet; no, nor the vaguest allusion to it. But the works <lb/>
            which survive him are evidence that he has not all died: <lb/>
            while taste survives, he must hold undisputed supremacy in <lb/>
            his own branch of the poetic art.</p>
          <p>Of the origin and nature of that species of poetry which <lb/>
            dates its ascendency from Theocritus, there is little which <lb/>
            has not been said again and again. The student who <lb/>
            desires to arrive at the results of older lucubrations on this <lb/>
            subject, must wade through subtle distinctions and learned <lb/>
            disquisitions respecting pastoral and heroic poetry. He will <lb/>
             <pb n="XIV"/>
            find that the birth-place of the former is contended by some <lb/>
            to have been Sicily, by others Arcadia. And while one and <lb/>
            another ascribe its first authorship to various poets of more <lb/>
            or less historical periods, some have been fain to date it from <lb/>
            the golden age. Now, when we gain experience of the diffi­ <lb/>
            culties which arise in reconciling so many and diverse state­ <lb/>
            ments, and find that the more effort we make, the further we <lb/>
            drift into a sea of troubles, our natural inclination coincides <lb/>
            with some sort of likelihood, which is in favour of that last <lb/>
            opinion. The truth may be that some kind of pastoral was <lb/>
            the first form of poetry. What more natural, when we reflect <lb/>
            that the eldest of the human race reckoned their superiority <lb/>
            by their flocks and herds. Men were all shepherds: and <lb/>
            so little of shame was there connected with an occupation <lb/>
            now so lowly, that no higher or more expressive title for a <lb/>
            mighty ruler was sought than that of " shepherd of his <lb/>
            peoples." Of course, under these circumstances, the pastoral <lb/>
            was likely to be an early form of poetry, and withal one <lb/>
            not likely to be despised. Indeed, among those who practised <lb/>
            it at an early date were Moses and Miriam, Deborah and <lb/>
            Barak, as well as the sweet Psalmist of Israel.</p>
          <p>When therefore we discuss the age of its invention, we can <lb/>
            but say that it was of every age. The first up-rising of it was, <lb/>
            we may conclude, in that primæval condition of men, when <lb/>
            the system of concentration into towns and fenced cities had <lb/>
            not yet begun: but when men led a nomad life, and whiled <lb/>
            their hours afield by alternate strains, whilst they were pastur­ <lb/>
            ing their flocks. It was the song of nature, little polished per­ <lb/>
            haps, but still not without its inspiration, because it flowed <lb/>
            directly from the shrines of her, whom he that worships most <lb/>
            is ever the truest and most accepted poet. The rustling of <lb/>
            the trees, the vocal pine, the murmurings of rivulets, the very <lb/>
            notes of birds, were so many of nature's hints to man to create <lb/>
            for himself a harmony more excellent in proportion as the <lb/>
            gift of speech excels all inarticulate sounds. And when we <lb/>
            add to this the influence of a sunny sky, a genial atmosphere, <lb/>
            a mind unruffled with the cares and sins which harass and <lb/>
            pollute the life of crowded cities, the wonder would be if <lb/>
            song had not arisen ; and that song, in common gratitude, of <lb/>
            such a kind as should depict and hold up to imitation the <lb/>
            life which was so singularly blessed. Gratitude, too, led <lb/>
             <pb n="XV"/>
            them no doubt to celebrate the festivals of their gods, the <lb/>
            tutelar deities of light and shade, of cattle and of fruits- <lb/>
            Apollo, Diana, Pan, and Ceres. Prizes offered for such strains <lb/>
            at these holy seasons would kindle a rivalry promotive of <lb/>
            advancement, and render easier the steps by which they should <lb/>
            pass into an art. This is probably the key to the mythical <lb/>
            ascription of pastoral poetry to Apollo Nomius, the herds­ <lb/>
            man whilome in the halls of Admetus. Diomus, Daphnis, <lb/>
            and Stesiehorus, all of them Sicilian, may have been its first <lb/>
            promoters upon Dorian soil; and as Theocritus seems to have <lb/>
            been the first who applied a highly cultivated mind to the task <lb/>
            of infusing into Amæbœan strains the grace and beauty which <lb/>
            he has wrought into his Idylls, his country Sicily stands justly <lb/>
            foremost as the birth-place of Bucolic minstrelsy. The Dorian <lb/>
            character, too, was apter than that of other races to this kind <lb/>
            of poetry: mimetic art had its eminent representative in the <lb/>
            Sicilian Sophron: and among them mimetic and comic dia­ <lb/>
            logue, as well as pastoral, arose in some measure out of the <lb/>
            unstudied repartees of the Lydiastæ and Bucolistæ, or of some <lb/>
            such performers. These gave a basis, whereon the more <lb/>
            studied Idyll might take its stand, and the great master of <lb/>
            whom we are treating, was not slow to apply all his varied <lb/>
            knowledge of nature and of art to this lively form of poetry, <lb/>
            so calculated to keep the interest from flagging, the hearer or <lb/>
            reader from becoming wearied. He first moulded these rude <lb/>
            strains into grace and beauty. He smoothed the ruggednesses <lb/>
            of verse. He inspired the picture with novel life ; and, whilst <lb/>
            he preserved the guise of nature throughout, evinced that <lb/>
            master power which is most teeming with the perfection of <lb/>
            art, when its creations look likest nature.</p>
          <p>It remains that we should attempt a classification of the <lb/>
            various poems of Theocritus which have come down to us. <lb/>
            The arguments to each of these have been prefixed in the <lb/>
            body of the translation. Of the thirty Idylls extant, ten are <lb/>
            properly Bucolics, the 1st, the 3rd, and all up to the 12th. <lb/>
            The 2nd Idyll can scarcely come under this head, though the <lb/>
            wider term <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδη</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδύλλια</foreign>, pictures, that is, of common every­ <lb/>
            day life, may embrace that as well as the 14th, 15th, the <lb/>
            21st, and perhaps some others. Some, however, claim the <lb/>
            2nd and 15th for a separate class under the head of mimetic <lb/>
            Idylls. The 12th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 23rd, 27th, and 29th, <lb/>
             <pb n="XVI"/>
            are erotic : the 16th and 17th, encomiastic: the 22nd, 24th, <lb/>
            25th, and 26th, belong to the epic class ; whilst the 28th is <lb/>
            epistolary, and the 30th Anacreontic. Of those classed as <lb/>
            erotic, the manner and form isvarious, as the reader will ob­ <lb/>
            serve. The genuineness of all the Idylls after the 18th has <lb/>
            been much questioned : this however is not a matter either <lb/>
            likely to repay great research, or calculated to interest the <lb/>
            general reader. They are for the most part in hexameter <lb/>
            verse : the thirty-two epigrams are some of them elegiac, <lb/>
            some epodic.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to fix upon one beauty beyond another in these <lb/>
            matchless pastorals, by singling out which one may send <lb/>
            the uninitiated reader with a whetted appetite to the whole <lb/>
            volume. A thousand charms of poesy press forward, each <lb/>
            claiming foremost commemoration. In the first Idyll we <lb/>
            linger long over the sorrows of Daphnis, which Virgil has <lb/>
            transfused into his Eclogues, over the immortal lines (66— <lb/>
            69) which have lost none of their pristine sweetness, when, <lb/>
            having passed the ordeal of transplantation, they bloom anew <lb/>
            in the Lycidas of Milton, (Lycidas, 1. 50,) <lb/>
            " Where were ye, nymphs, when the remorseless deep," &amp;c.; <lb/>
            or yet again in the same Idyll, over that (to the translator's <lb/>
            taste at least) most enviable epitaph, (140, 141,) <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_68_fig3.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              In the second Idyll, we view the fierceness of disappointed <lb/>
              love, in the raging passion of Simætha : in the sixth, a more <lb/>
              rustic and clownish, yet not less touching, hopelessness, at­ <lb/>
              tributed to the Cyclops in the song of Damætas. Or if <lb/>
              pretty picturings of scenery are more the object of our search, <lb/>
              what translation can-do justice to the 13th Idyll, the Hylas, <lb/>
              the charming rural scene in the end of the 7th, or the 25th <lb/>
              Idyll from the 34th to the 50th line ? There are passages in <lb/>
              the Hylas unsurpassed by any poet of whatever age or clime ; <lb/>
              as, for instance, from the 35th to the 60th line, where the <lb/>
              capture of the youth by the enamoured Naiads is depicted. <lb/>
              The Gossips of Theocritus are such a life-like picture, so <lb/>
              capitally drawn, that it were a work of supererogation to <lb/>
              point it out, or to commend it. It is nature itself, not as it <lb/>

            <title type="main">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF BION.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IF materials are scanty for a Life of Theocritus, they are <lb/>
            much more so for those of his first imitators, Bion and Moschus. <lb/>
            An Elegy of the latter is the only faint glimmer of light, <lb/>
            by which we can guess at, we cannot say discern, aught of <lb/>
            history of the former. Yet it would interest us if we could <lb/>
            know how far Bion professedly reverenced Theocritus, what <lb/>
            value he set upon simplicity in Pastorals, whether he aimed at <lb/>
            a new school of that branch of the poetic art, and whether he <lb/>
            would account as an improvement that over-refined sentiment­ <lb/>
            ality which robs his Muse of all claim to be a child of nature.</p>
          <p>But, except the 3rd Idyll of Moschus, no data for his life <lb/>
            exist-unless we take upon the authority of Suidas that he <lb/>
            was born beside that river, which by tradition is reputed to <lb/>
            have reared on its banks the greatest of poets, the immortal <lb/>
            Homer, the river Meles, at Phlossa in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Smyrna.</p>
          <p>From the Elegy above referred to, we assume that Bion <lb/>
            left his native country for Sicily, and spent at least his latter <lb/>
            days in cultivating the Bucolic minstrelsy, so thoroughly <lb/>
            identified with that pastoral isle. It seems hardly safe how­ <lb/>
            ever to lay it down, with some, on the faith of the words <lb/>
            in Moschus, (Id. iii. 17, &amp;c.,) that Bion visited Thrace and <lb/>
            Macedonia; because the sense of the passage does not neces­ <lb/>
            sarily imply more than that Strymonian swans and Æagrian <lb/>
            nymphs might well mourn and weep afresh, since a Dorian, <lb/>
            equal to their native Orpheus, had ceased to breathe forth <lb/>
            his lovely lays. One fact, however, stands out distinctly, <lb/>
            namely, that the poet came to an untimely death by poison, <lb/>
             <pb n="XIX"/>
            which was administered to him by more than one individual, <lb/>
            and that the murderers, whosoever they were, paid the penalty <lb/>
            of their crime. The age of Bion can be determined only by <lb/>
            the statement of Moschus, (iii. 100—105,) that he was one <lb/>
            of his disciples, and that Theocritus mourned his loss. Grant - <lb/>
            ing this, we must take his date as 280 B. C.</p>
          <p>As has been before observed in the Life of Theocritus, the <lb/>
            poems of Bion which have come down to us are vastly inferior <lb/>
            in pastoral beauty, in natural simplicity, and inherent truthful­ <lb/>
            ness, to the works of the Syracusan master. But here and <lb/>
            there we chance upon a passage of eminent loveliness. Every <lb/>
            where the Asiatic softness seems to add luxurious grace to his <lb/>
            tuneful songs ; though this is but a poor substitute for the <lb/>
            vigorous and healthy freshness of the Father of Pastorals. Bion <lb/>
            standing alone would soon fade from our memories. He is <lb/>
            fortunate in being preserved with his pupil and elegiast to <lb/>
            complete the volume of Greek Pastoral Poets, which is, alas ! <lb/>
            our sole legacy in this kind from the Alexandrian school. <lb/>
            His versification is very elegant; his language, Doric, with <lb/>
            some few Ionicisms and Atticisms.</p>

          </head>
          <p>THE poet Moschus seems to have found no kindred spirit <lb/>
            to embalm his memory in harmonious numbers : or if he <lb/>
            had that fortune, it has not survived the oblivion which so <lb/>
            remorselessly overwhelms the rest of his personal history. <lb/>
            We reckon him a Syracusan, whose day was about the close <lb/>
            of the third century before Christ. And he must have been con­ <lb/>
            temporaneous with Bion, probably in age somewhat younger. <lb/>
            He does not reach the excellence of his friend and teacher, <lb/>
            far less that of Theocritus. Indeed there lies over all his <lb/>
            pieces a clothing of affectation, and study of ornament, which <lb/>
            makes them read as forced and unnatural compositions. Still <lb/>
            many passages might be quoted which are highly poetic, none <lb/>
            more so perhaps than that exquisite passage in the third Idyll, <lb/>
            (105—114,) where, in a lament over the briefness of this mor­ <lb/>
            tal life, the mighty of the earth are contrasted with the flowers <lb/>
            of the field in such an earnest tone of pathos, as shows the <lb/>
            enlightened heathen dissatisfied with prevailing religions, <lb/>
            whilst it teaches our own higher privileges, to us -who have, <lb/>
            held out and within our grasp, " the sure and certain hope of <lb/>
            the resurrection to eternal life."</p>

          <p>THE elegiac poet, Tyrtæus, whose remains, in an English <lb/>
            garb, close the present volume, follows immediately in his <lb/>
            branch of the poetic art, the founder -of Greek elegy, Callinus. <lb/>
            An elegy, according to the Greek notion, is a poem composed <lb/>
            of a combination of hexameters and pentameters. It seems <lb/>
            often to have been of the nature of a dirge or lament, and the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλεγος</foreign> has no distinct reference to metrical form, though <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλεγεία</foreign> has. Its origin was undoubtedly Asiatic. Crossing the <lb/>
            Ægean, it found one of its most eminent cultivators in Tyr­ <lb/>
            tæus, the poet whom tradition has handed down to us as the <lb/>
            Athenian present to their hereditary enemies the Spartans, <lb/>
            when they had been directed by the Delphic oracle to seek a <lb/>
            leader from Athens for the second Messenian war. The <lb/>
            story runs, that Athens, never hearty towards Sparta, save in <lb/>
            her hatred, sent her the worst selection that, according to ap­ <lb/>
            pearances, could be made,-a lame schoolmaster and composer <lb/>
            of verses, who dwelt at Aphidnæ, a village of Attica : and <lb/>
            that this Ionian inspired the Dorian warriors who adopted <lb/>
            him, with such spirit through his fiery strains, that victory <lb/>
            crowned their prowess. The second Messenian war is placed <lb/>
            by Pausanias between 01. 23, 4 and 28, 1, that is, between <lb/>
            B. c. 685 and 668: but this date is considered by the latest <lb/>
            authorities too high, and indeed, as Callinus probably flour­ <lb/>
            ished about B. c. 660, and we are led to believe that Tyrtæus <lb/>
             <pb n="XXII"/>
            was but a few years junior to him, this would seem to be the <lb/>
            more probable date.</p>
          <p>The main features of the popular tradition, however pleas­ <lb/>
            ing to our school-day notions of history, must of course be <lb/>
            taken only as containing the germ of certain truths, and not <lb/>
            as being themselves broad historical truths. Castor and Pol­ <lb/>
            lux, according to old legends, had been adopted by Aphidnus, <lb/>
            the hero from whom Aphidnæ was named : and as the Dios­ <lb/>
            curi were Spartan, the Aphidnæans may have been moved <lb/>
            by some feelings or ties of kindred, and not by the will of <lb/>
            Athens, to send Tyrtæus to the aid of Laconia. This would <lb/>
            crush the fable of intentional insult on the part of Athens. <lb/>
            And then as to the origin of Tyrtæus, it cannot be doubted <lb/>
            that he was of Ionian stock, (whether a native of Attica, or a <lb/>
            settler in it from one of her Asiatic colonies, as Suidas states, <lb/>
            it matters not, for the inventions of the colonies would soop <lb/>
            find their way to their polished metropolis:) because we <lb/>
            know that the branch of poetry in which he excelled was pe­ <lb/>
            culiarly Ionian; and not such as can claim any early vigour <lb/>
            or native success among the Dorians. Whether he came from <lb/>
            Miletus to Aphidnæ, or was born at the latter place, we need <lb/>
            not inquire ; there is no ground at any rate for the supposi­ <lb/>
            tion that he was a Lacedæmonian by birth, as Strabo and <lb/>
            Athenæus have stated on the authority of Philochorus and <lb/>
            Callisthenes. Surely his elegiac strains disprove this. With <lb/>
            regard to his lameness, and his supposed office of village school­ <lb/>
            master at Aphidnæ, the truth to be evolved from these state­ <lb/>
            ments is probably that he wrote uneven couplets, and, like <lb/>
            other early poets, taught the art, of which he was so skilful a <lb/>
            master. If he was either by birth or by sojourn an Aphid­ <lb/>
            naean, there is no wonder in his interest for Sparta, nor, on the <lb/>
            other hand, any difficulty in understanding why, coining from <lb/>
            Attica, he yet became a favourite with the Lacedæmonians. ' <lb/>
            And, certain it is, that whatever may have been his bodily defects, <lb/>
            whatever his inexperience in generalship, his martial strains <lb/>
            and wise counsels achieved much, in which a skilful general <lb/>
            might have failed without them. As a bard, he was no mean <lb/>
            leader of his adopted countrymen : for ages afterwards, their <lb/>
            evening meal on their campaigns closed with the recitation of <lb/>
            his spirit-stirring war-songs : and when the foe was vanquish-</p>

          <p>The Poet, proposing to celebrate the end of Daphnis, the hero of <lb/>
            Sicilian shepherds, finds an opening of his subject in a dialogue be­ <lb/>
            tween a goatherd and a shepherd named Thyrsis. The latter begs the <lb/>
            former to sing with the accompaniment of his pipe. This he de­ <lb/>
            clines, for fear of awakening Pan, and strives to prevail upon Thyrsis, <lb/>
            by the offer of a goat and a most highly wrought drinking-cup, to <lb/>
            sing of the death of Daphnis. Thyrsis accordingly begins by invok­ <lb/>
            ing the Nymphs : describes the grief of the brute creation at the <lb/>
            sorrows of Daphnis: the sympathy of Pan and Mercury, as well as <lb/>
            the shepherds their -worshippers: the bitterness of Daphnis towards <lb/>
            Venus, who had caused his sorrows, but is now inclined to relent. <lb/>
            The song concludes with the farewell of Daphnis to all the objects of <lb/>
            his former joys. After which performance, the goatherd presents <lb/>
            Thyrsis with the meed of his song.</p>

            yon resounding water pours down from the rock above. If <lb/>
            the Muses bear-off for themselves the sheep as a gift, you <lb/>
            shall receive as your prize the 4young lamb: but should it <lb/>

            you willing, goatherd, to take your seat here at this sloping <lb/>
            mound, 5 where the tamarisks are, and to play upon your <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>This Idyll is wholly of a Bucolic and mimic character. Two hireling <lb/>
            herdsmen chat together without any fixed subject of conversation. <lb/>
            The one, Corydon, is tending the herds of Ægon, who has become a <lb/>
            wrestler and gone with Milo to the Olympic games. The other, Bat­ <lb/>
            tus, is a man of a sarcastic turn, and keeps annoying his fellow with <lb/>
            various sharp sayings; above all, predicting death to the ill-tended <lb/>
            herds of Ægon. Corydon, being easy and good-tempered, answers <lb/>
            him mildly. While they are chatting, the calves bark the straying <lb/>
            olive branches, and Battus, driving them off, is pricked by a thorn. <lb/>
            While Corydon is tending his wound, they spy the old father of AEgon, <lb/>
            and get into a smart talk about his wanton way of living. This Idyll <lb/>
            abounds in pictures of pastoral life and manners. Its scene is laid in <lb/>
            the country, at the foot of an olive-clad hill. Virgil imitates it in <lb/>
            his third Eclogue, together with the next Idyll.</p>
          <p>Battus. 1 TELL me, Corydon, whose are these heifers ? Are <lb/>
            they the property of Philondas ? <lb/>
            Corydon. No ! but of Ægon ! and he gave them to me to <lb/>
            tend. <note type="footnote"> 16 Ceres came to Jasion while he slept. She became the mother of Pluto <lb/>

          <p>Coryd. Nay, the old man puts the calves to their dams to <lb/>
            suck, and watches me.</p>
          <p>Batt. And to what quarter has the cowherd himself dis­ <lb/>

          <p>Coryd. Have you not heard ? Milo has gone off with him <lb/>
            to the 3 Alphous.</p>
          <p>Batt. 4 Why, when has that fellow seen oil with his eyes ?</p>
          <p>Coryd. They say that in strength and force he vies with <lb/>
            Hercules.</p>
          <p>Batt. And so my mother said that I was better than Pollux.</p>
          <p>Coryd. 5 And he is gone off with a hoe, and twenty sheep <lb/>
            from hence.</p>
          <p>Batt. 6 Milo, methinks, would persuade the wolves too to <lb/>
            rave straightway.</p>
          <p>Coryd. 7 But the young heifers here show their loss of him, <lb/>
            by lowing.</p>
          <p>Batt. 8 Ay, wretched are they ! How bad a cowherd they <lb/>
            have found !</p>
          <p>Coryd. 9Why yes, in very truth they are wretched: and <lb/>
            they no longer care to feed. <note type="footnote">2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψε</foreign> here is Doric for <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφε</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφεας</foreign>, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψιν</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφιν</foreign> elsewhere.

            which, as it stands, lacks point. Eichstadt for <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτίκα</foreign> would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμνίδα</foreign>, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαγοὺς</foreign>) for <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυκὸς</foreign>. Dahl thinks the common reading will stand if we <lb/>
            take <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὼς</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὣς</foreign>, and construe “<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὼς λυκὸς</foreign> like wolves, ‘ luporum instar.’” <lb/>
            It will then be, “ Milo would persuade him (Ægon) to be rabid like a <lb/>
            wolf;" in allusion to his going off with twenty sheep. Battus seems to <lb/>
            mean that Milo has no hard task to persuade one so wolf-like as Ægon <lb/>
            to a savage occupation. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Virgo Eel. i. 36, Tityrus hinc aberat, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Virgo Eel. iii. 3, Infelix, 0 semper oves pecus. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Not unlike this is Pope's Past. iv. 37, </note> <pb n="23"/>

          <p>Batt. 10 Now of yon calf look you there is nothing but the <lb/>
            bones left. Does she 11 feed on dew-drops, like the cicada ?</p>
          <p>Coryd. No! by earth. Sometimes I put her to graze near <lb/>
            the 12 Æsarus, and give her a nice wisp of soft grass; and <lb/>
            at other times she frolics in the neighbourhood of shady <lb/>

            wander through various topics,, supplied either by the condition of the <lb/>
            singers, the nature of the country and spot, the memory of the past, or <lb/>
            by their very anger and inclination. At last Morson adjudges the prize <lb/>
            to Comatas ; who, on receiving it, brags of it proudly, and promises to <lb/>
            offer a victim to the Nymphs. Much of this Idyll, though not to the <lb/>
            taste of our more refined age, is yet eminent for its poetic power and <lb/>
            lively colouring of rustic manners. Its scene is a glade near Sybaris <lb/>
            in Lower Italy. Virgil has gathered from the Idyll many of the verses, <lb/>
            as well as the plan, of his third Eclogue.</p>

          <p>Lacon. 2 St! Won't you be off from the fountain, my <lb/>

            pipe?</p>
          <p>Com. What sort of pipe, pray ? Why, when did you, slave <lb/>

          <p>Damætas and Daphnis, having driven their herds to water, while away <lb/>
            the time in Amæbæan strains. The youths picture Polyphemus seated <lb/>
            on a rock overlooking the sea; and Galatea, his love, on the other hand, <lb/>
            sporting in the waves at no great distance from the shore. Daphnis <lb/>
            begins, directing his song to the Cyclops : and Damætas responds un­ <lb/>
            der the character of Polyphemus. The performance is ended by mu­ <lb/>
            tual presents between the swains. The Idyll is commended by the <lb/>
            manner in which the character and temper of the Cyclops is shadowed <lb/>
            forth. Its subject is the same as that of Idyll xi. Compare also <lb/>
            Moschus, Idyll iii. 59—63.</p>
          <p>DAMÆTAS and Daphnis, the herdsman, once drove the herd <lb/>
            to one spot, 1 0 Aratus : now one of them was reddish in <lb/>
            beard, and the other had but half a one: and both of them, <lb/>
            taking their seats at a certain fountain, in summer-time at <lb/>
            mid-day, began to sing as follows. And Daphnis struck up <lb/>
            first, since he too was first to challenge.</p>
          <p>Daphnis. 2 Galatea, 0 Polyphemus, pelts your flock with <lb/>
            apples, calling you the goat-herd inaccessible-to-love : and <lb/>
            you do not regard her, wretched, wretched man, but sit play­ <lb/>

            against the legs of the damsel, as she comes forth from the <lb/>

            my solitary eyeball, (as it has been determined by my judg­ <lb/>

            whiter than Parian marble. And that I might not be be­ <lb/>

          <p>in this Idyll, one Simichidas is represented describing a celebration of <lb/>
            the festival in honour of De meter after harvest, in which he himself <lb/>
            and some friends had been engaged at the house of Phrasidamus and <lb/>
            Antigenes, on the banks of the Hales. The former part of the Idyll <lb/>
            is a narration of the journey to the feast; the latter, a description of <lb/>
            the feast itself. On their road, Simichidas and his friends fall in with <lb/>
            a goatherd, Lycidas, of great poetic talent, whom they invite to while <lb/>
            the length of the way by his song. He accordingly sings, his love for <lb/>
            the boy Ageanax. After which, Simichidas in turn celebrates the pas­ <lb/>
            sion of Aratus for the lad Philinus. The songs being ended, Lycidas <lb/>
            presents Simichidas with a crook, and turns off on another route. The <lb/>
            rest go forward to their proposed destination, where beside the mur­ <lb/>
            inuring fountain, in a most delightful spot, they indulge in wine and <lb/>
            good cheer. The scene, according to the Scholiast, is laid in Cos ; <lb/>
            though Heinsius maintains that Sicily is represented. Theocritus is <lb/>
            known to have stayed some time at Cos to hear Philetas, which <lb/>
            makes for the Scholiast's view. It has been supposed that the poet <lb/>
            describes himself under the character of Simichidas, and a Cydonian <lb/>
            poet of his own day under the name of Lycidas. Virgil has planned <lb/>
            his ninth Eclogue somewhat on the model of this Idyll.</p>
          <p>1 IT was the time when I and Eucritus were sauntering from <lb/>
            the city to the Hales, and with us a third, Amyntas. For to <lb/>
            Ceres both Thrasidamus and Antigenes, two sons of Lycopeus, <lb/>
            were preparing the Thalysia; worthy men, if aught is worthy <lb/>
            that springs from the good men of old, being descended both <lb/>
            from 2 Clytia and Chalcon himself; 3 he who by his foot raised <lb/>
            the fountain Burinna, having planted strongly his knee against <note type="footnote"> 1 The festival to which our travellers were going, was one to Ceres, or <lb/>
            Demeter, held in autumn after harvest, to thank her for her benefits to <lb/>
            man. Compare Callimach. Hymn to Demeter, 20. Horn. II. ix. 529. <lb/>
            The scene lies in Cos. Hales was a river of the island ; and the city <lb/>
            mentioned, vs. 2, was the chief city of the island, also named Cos. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Clytia and Chalcon.] Clytia was the daughter of Merops, wife of <lb/>
            Eurypylus, (who is mentioned by Homer, Iliad ii. 677,) king of Cos, <lb/>
            and the mother of Chalcon. Scholiast. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴ τί περ ἐσθλὸν</foreign>, see Ovid. <lb/>

          <p>6 Nor yet had we finished half our way, nor did the tomb <lb/>
            of Brasilas yet come in sight to us, when we fell in with <lb/>
            a wayfarer, 7 a favourite with the Muses, a man of Cydon, <lb/>
            whose name was Lycidas ; he was a goatherd, nor could <lb/>
            any one that looked upon him have mistaken him, for he was <lb/>
            exceedingly like a goatherd. For on his shoulders he wore a <lb/>
            8 tawny skin of a shaggy thick-haired goat, smelling of new <lb/>
            rennet: an old cloak was fastened by a broad belt about his <lb/>
            breast; whilst in his right hand he held a crooked club of <lb/>
            wild-olive : and grinning, he said to me softly with a smiling <lb/>
            eye (and laughter played upon his lip) : 9 ‘Simichidas, where, <lb/>

            patronymically. Amyntas and Amyntichus, in this Idyll, stand for one <lb/>
            and the same person, and there is clearly some ground for supposing the <lb/>
            , patronymic was used by both father and son. But the obscurity may be <lb/>

          <p>MENALCAS, 1as they say, whilst tending his sheep along the <lb/>
            high mountains, fell in with the graceful Daphnis a-driving <lb/>
            his herd. 2 Now both of them were 3 red-haired, both lads : <lb/>
            each skilled in playing on the pipes, each in singing. And <lb/>
            first then Menalcas, gazing at Daphnis, addressed him.</p>
          <p>Menalcas. Daphnis, watcher of the lowing oxen, wilt thou <lb/>
            sing with me ? I maintain that I will beat you at singing, to <lb/>
            my heart's content.</p>
          <p>And him, I ween, Daphnis answered in speech like the <lb/>
            following.</p>
          <p>Daphnis. Shepherd of woolly sheep, piper Menalcas, you <lb/>
            at all events shall never beat me in singing, no, not if you <lb/>
            should die for it.</p>

          <p>Men. Well what shall we stake, that would be of sufficient <lb/>

          <p>Daph. I will stake a calf : and do you stake on your part <lb/>
            5 a lamb like its mother.</p>

          <p>Men. How if we should call hither yon goatherd, whose <lb/>

          <p>And the youths indeed shouted to him, and the goatherd <lb/>
            came, having heard them. And the youths on their part be­ <lb/>
            gan to sing, and the goatherd was willing to be umpire. So <lb/>
            then first the 9 piper Menalcas proceeded to sing, having ob­ <lb/>
            tained precedence by lot. And then Daphnis took up the <lb/>

          <p>Men. Spare my kids, spare, wolf, my she-goats with young, <lb/>

            sleep in the open air beside running water. 22 The acorns are <lb/>
            an ornament to the oak, apples to the apple-tree, and to the <lb/>
            cows the calf, the cows themselves to the herdsman.</p>
          <p>Thus sang the youths, but the goatherd addressed them as <lb/>
            follows:</p>
          <p>Goatherd. Something sweet is thy mouth, and lovely thy <lb/>
            voice, 0 Daphnis. 'Tis better to hear thee sing than 23to <lb/>
            sip honey. Take the pipe, for thou hast won in singing. <lb/>
            And if at all you desire to teach me too to sing, while I feed <lb/>
            my goats along with you, I will give you, as the price of your <lb/>
            teaching, yon hornless she-goat, which always fills the milk- <lb/>
            pail above the brim.</p>
          <p>As then the youth was delighted, and leapt up, and shouted <lb/>
            as victorious; so would a fawn leap upon its dam. And as <lb/>
            the other smouldered away, and was cast down in heart by <lb/>
            chagrin, so also would a nymph grieve, 24when betrothed. <lb/>
            And from this time, Daphnis became first among shepherds, <lb/>
            and, while yet in earliest youth, wedded a Naiad nymph.</p>

            the power of song in relieving the pains of disappointed love. The <lb/>

            Galatea. Polyphemus, sitting on a rock overhanging the sea, beguiles <lb/>

          <p>This Idyll, which is of a lyric, not a Bucolic character, has been suspect­ <lb/>
            ed to be not the work of Theocritus. It is an expression of love <lb/>
            towards a youth on his return to his friend after three days' absence. <lb/>
            The poet goes on to hope that this love may be mutual and perpetual. <lb/>
            It is ended with a strain in honour of the Megarensians, on account <lb/>
            of their having instituted annual kissing-matches at the tomb of Dio­ <lb/>
            cles. For the different opinions of commentators, &amp;c., on the author­ <lb/>
            ship of this Idyll, see the edition of Kiessling, London, 1829, at the <lb/>

          <p>The poet premising somewhat about the power of love over gods and <lb/>
            men, opens the subject of the rape of Hylas with a description of the <lb/>
            love and care of Hercules for the lad. When the Argonauts had put <lb/>
            to shore at the land of the Cyanians, on the coast of the Propontis, <lb/>
            Hylas was sent by Hercules to fetch water. Whilst drawing from the <lb/>
            fountain, in a lovely spot, he is drawn in by the Nymphs, who are <lb/>
            captivated by the exceeding beauty of the boy. Hercules, suspecting <lb/>
            some mishap from the delay of Hylas, sets out in quest of him ; and <lb/>
            as his fruitless search detains him a long time, he is left behind by the <lb/>
            Argonauts, who suppose he has quitted them purposely. The hero <lb/>
            goes afoot to Colchis. This Idyll is Epic in its character, but with <lb/>
            such a touch of Bucolic sweetness about it as to win it a high place <lb/>
            among the Idylls of Theocritus. Note the description of the fountain, <lb/>
            vs. 40, and the anxiety of the Nymphs to console the lad, 54—59.</p>

          <p>This Idyll describes a festival in honour of Adonis, kept at the cost of <lb/>
            Arsinoe, with great pomp, at Alexandria; and it affords the poet an <lb/>
            opportunity for lauding the queen, and through her, king Ptolemy also. <lb/>
            Two Syracusan women who have Alexandrian husbands, in a low rank <lb/>
            of life, start out with their maids to the palace, to see the show. The Idyll <lb/>
            has three scenes, so to speak—first, the dialogue between Gorge and <lb/>
            Praxinoe, at the house of the latter;—then their adventures in the <lb/>
            way to the palace ;-and lastly, the interior of the palace, and the battle <lb/>
            of words between these women and a stranger, which is hushed by the <lb/>
            song of a female minstrel in honour of Adonis: when this is ended, <lb/>
            they return home. The poem is true to life in its lighter and more <lb/>
            homely parts; and is also remarkable for the graceful introduction of <lb/>
            praise of the royal family. <note type="footnote"> 24 <foreign xml:lang="grc">επ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">άμφοτέροισι</foreign> (understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποσί</foreign>). Tyrtæus i. 53, </note> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>Gorgo. Is Praxinoe within ?</p>
          <p>Praxinoe. Dear Gorge, how late you are ! I am at home. <lb/>
            'Tis a wonder you have come even now. 1 See for a chair <lb/>
            for her, Eunoe: and put a cushion on it.</p>
          <p>Gorg. 2 It does very well.</p>

          <p>Gorg. Oh ! my unbroken spirit, with difficulty have I <lb/>
            reached you in safety, Praxinoe, the crowd being great, and <lb/>
            the chariots many. Every where there are 3 booted men ; <lb/>
            every where cavaliers ; and the road is toilsome, and you live <lb/>
            too far from me.</p>

          <p>This poem is written in praise of Hiero, son of Hierocles, tyrant of Sy­ <lb/>
            racuse, a ruler of great moderation, and also of warlike renown, ac­ <lb/>
            quired in his battles with the Carthaginians. The poet lashes the avarice <lb/>
            of most rulers ; who, he says, do not favour poets, and so prevent <lb/>
            their fame from gaining that immortality, which cannot be attained, <lb/>
            save by song. He goes on to praise Hiero as an honourable exception; <lb/>
            and afterwards prays for the future safety and fortunes of Syracuse, <lb/>
            and of Hiero, its ornament and support. In conclusion he invokes the <note type="footnote"> 43 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δευκαλίωνες</foreign>, i. e. such as Deucalion. So Plutarch speaks of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πηλει̃ς <lb/>

            t9 hymn immortals, 1 to hymn the glories of brave men. The <lb/>
            Muses indeed are goddesses ; goddesses sing of gods: but we <lb/>
            are mortals here ; let us mortals sing of mortals. 2 Yet who <lb/>
            of as many as dwell under the bright dawn, will open his <lb/>
            doors, and graciously welcome in his home our 3 Graces, and <lb/>

          <p>The poet intending to celebrate Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, <lb/>
            sets out with the praise of his father, Ptolemy Lagus, to whom after <lb/>
            his death a place among the gods had been ascribed ; and goes on to <lb/>
            eulogize Berenice, the mother of Philadelphus, whom Venus was sup­ <lb/>
            posed to have received into her temples to be her <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρεδρος</foreign>, or assessor, <lb/>
            He next proceeds to set forth the fortunes and virtues of Philadelphus <lb/>
            himself, beginning with the happy omens which had attended his birth <lb/>
            in the island of Cos, and portended his future opulence and power. <lb/>
            Then follows an enumeration of the royal territories, and laudation of <lb/>
            the royal wealth, augmented as it has been by the blessings of peace. <lb/>
            The poet commends in glowing terms the munificence and discern­ <lb/>
            ment of Philadelphus in conferring favours, as well as his filial piety <lb/>
            shown so eminently. He ends with praise of the queen, the wife and <lb/>
            sister of Ptolemy. Reiske, Warton, and others have held this to be a <lb/>
            poem of Callimachus; but Eichstadt declares that, while it equals the <lb/>
            lightness of the poems of that writer, it surpasses them in jejuneness. <note type="footnote"> 33 Hiero. Silius Ital. xiv. 79, &amp;c., gives a character of the old age of <lb/>

            whensoever we sing in our minstrelsy the best of immortals. <lb/>
            But of men, on the other hand, let Ptolemy be spoken of <lb/>
            among 2 the first, and last, and at the middle; for he is the <lb/>
            most excellent of men. Heroes, who 3 aforetime sprung from <lb/>
            demigods, having done noble deeds have met with skilful <lb/>
            poets. But I, knowing how to speak well, would fain hymn <lb/>
            the praise of Ptolemy; and hymns are a glory even of the <lb/>
            immortals themselves. A wood-cutter having gone to woody <lb/>

            to the chamber of his dear spouse, to the one he gives his <lb/>

          <p>After the nuptials of Helen and Menelaus, the chief maidens of Sparta, <lb/>
            ranging themselves before the bridal chamber, sing an Epithalamium, <lb/>
            beginning with the jokes which would naturally be passed at the ex­ <lb/>
            pense of the bridegroom. Menelaus is next felicitated on the score of <lb/>
            the prize of beauty which he has won, while so many of the noblest <lb/>
            suitors failed. The poet passes naturally on to a description of Helen's <lb/>
            personal and mental graces, and puts into the mouth of the chorus a <lb/>
            warm expression of their love and regard for her. This Idyll is of a <lb/>
            lyric character, and is amongst the most beautiful of its kind. Some <lb/>
            have been led, by its dissimilarity from the other Idylls, to suppose <lb/>
            Theocritus not to have been its author.

          <p>This little poem seems to have been wrought out of the fortieth ode of <lb/>
            Anacreon, which has been rendered into English by our freshly lost <lb/>
            Thomas Moore ; to which however it is clearly inferior in the merit of <lb/>
            originality and management of subject. Valkenaer thinks it a poem <lb/>
            of Bion ; but Stobæus (c. 63) quotes the lines as the work of Theo­ <lb/>
            critus. Meleager (Epigr. cviii. Antholog. Jacobs) has taken the same <lb/>
            subject for his muse.</p>

            plundering a comb from the hives, and pierced all the tips of <lb/>
            his fingers; and he began to lament and blow his hand; and <lb/>
            struck the earth, and leaped aloft. Then showed he his pain <lb/>
            to Aphrodite, and began to complain 'that at any rate the bee <lb/>
            is a little creature, and yet what great wounds it inflicts!' <lb/>

          <p>The poet in this Idyll introduces a rustic complaining of the scorn and <lb/>
            contempt of a city maiden in rejecting his addresses. Having de­ <lb/>
            clared the cause of this scorn, he shows how undeserving he is of it, <lb/>
            as being neither ugly nor a man of the lowest condition, seeing that <lb/>
            gods and goddesses had sought out of his rank of life, objects of love. <lb/>
            Heinsius holds this to be a poem of Moschus, but though Valkenaer <lb/>
            inclines to the same opinion, the mass of testimony ascribes it to <lb/>
            Theocritus.</p>
          <p>EUNICA laughed at me when I wished sweetly to kiss her, <lb/>
            and, teasing me, said thus: 1 'Away with you from me! <lb/>
            Clown as you are, do you want to kiss me, wretch ? I have <lb/>
            not learned to kiss bumpkins, 2 but to press city lips. Don't <lb/>
            you at any rate kiss my fair mouth, no, not in your dreams. <lb/>
            What a look you have ! what a speech ! 3 how rudely you toy <lb/>
            How mincingly you talk! what wheedling words you utter! <lb/>
            How 4 smooth is the beard you have ! what sweet hair ! 5 Nay, <lb/>
            your lips in truth are diseased, and your hands are black, and <lb/>
            you smell foully. Away from me, lest you contaminate me!'</p>

          <p>This Idyll contains a conversation of two fishermen by night. Our poet <lb/>
            addressing one Diophantus with a few observations on the force of <lb/>
            poverty in rousing men to active pursuits, describes the scene of this <lb/>
            colloquy, which is laid in a scantily furnished sea-side but. One of <lb/>
            the fishermen calls upon the other to unriddle him the dream which <lb/>
            he has dreamed. It was this: that he had in pursuit of his calling <lb/>
            caught a golden fish, and thereupon determined with an oath to es­ <lb/>
            chew the trade for the future. Now that the golden hope and his <lb/>
            dream have proved alike unreal, he fears lest he ought to consider his <lb/>
            oath binding. His comrade bids him be of good cheer, telling him <lb/>
            that his oath is clearly no more real than his dream was. This is the <lb/>
            only Idyll descriptive of fishermen's life that has come down to us; <lb/>
            and it has been suggested, with much reason, that in it Theocritus <lb/>
            imitated the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυννοθήρα</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αλιευς</foreign> of Sophron.</p>

          <p>1 POVERTY, 0 Diophantus, alone arouses the arts: she is <lb/>
            the teacher of labour; for hard cares do not permit labouring <lb/>
            men even to sleep. And even if a man shall have tasted <lb/>
            sleep 2for a little space in the night, solicitudes on a sudden <note type="footnote"> 21 it Would-be Venus." It seems clear that the poet makes his rustic <lb/>
            taunt Eunica in these last words, and the suggestion of Wordsworth, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τον</foreign> <lb/>
            *Apta, "thy Mars," (alluding to Venus' amour with that God,) will give <lb/>
            point to an otherwise obscure passage. Theocritus, in the 27th Idyll, in <lb/>
            like manner makes a shepherd call himself "Paris," and address his <lb/>
            sweetheart as " Helen." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Virgo Georg. i. 145, 146, <lb/>

            the rods, the hooks, and 4 the gum cistus, covered by sea-weed, <lb/>
            fishing lines, and weels, and bow-nets of rushes, cords, and <lb/>
            5two oars, and an old boat on its rollers. Beneath their <lb/>
            heads was a scanty cloak of mat-work, garments, and felt <lb/>
            caps. This was to the fishermen their whole 6 stock of im­ <lb/>
            plements, this their wealth. And neither had an earthen <lb/>
            pot, or a 7measure ; all, all seemed superfluous to them; <lb/>

              or “coverlet,” as the case might be, of Greek sailors, mentioned by <lb/>

              car accomplishing the mid-way of her course, when their <lb/>
              wonted toil began to wake the fishermen, and having thrust <lb/>
              away slumber from their eyelids, they proceeded to rouse a <lb/>
              song in their minds.</p>
          <p>Asph. They were all liars, friend, as many as used to say <lb/>
            that the summer nights shorten, when Jove draws out the <lb/>
            days to a great length. Already have I seen a myriad dreams, <lb/>
            nor is it yet dawn. Have I forgotten myself ? What is the <lb/>
            matter ? 11Are the nights then lagging ?</p>
          <p>Com. Asphalion, are you blaming the fair summer? For it <lb/>
            is not the season which has of its own accord over-stepped <lb/>
            its due course, but your cares, disturbing your sleep, make the <lb/>
            night long to you.</p>

            for I have seen a good one. I would not have you be with­ <lb/>

            understanding is the teacher. Besides there is leisure too ; <lb/>

          <p>Asph. 16 At evening, when I fell asleep over my sea-faring <lb/>
            labours, (I was not indeed full of meat; for dining 17at the <lb/>
            proper time, if you recollect, we were sparing of our stomachs,) <lb/>
            I fancied I saw myself on a rock, busy, and I was sitting and <lb/>
            watching for fish, and throwing the sly bait hanging from the <lb/>
            rod. And one of the fat fellows made a bite ; (for even in sleep <lb/>
            every do- scents loaves, and so do I a fish;) and it indeed <lb/>
            clung to the hook, and the blood began to flow, and I was getting <lb/>
            the rod bent by his movement. So stretching out both my <lb/>
            hands, I found a struggle about the creature, how I should catch <lb/>
            a large fish with hooks rather small for him. 18 Then, remind­ <lb/>
            ing him of his wound, 'will you prick me then,' said I : 'Nay, <lb/>
            rather you shall be pierced sorely;' and I extended my rod, <lb/>
            while he did not escape it. I seemed to have accomplished <lb/>
            my labour, I drew ashore a golden fish, altogether wrapt up <lb/>
            in the gold. But fear possessed me, lest haply it should be a <note type="footnote"> 14,15 To this very difficult passage the only light which seems clear, is <lb/>
            the explanation of Strothius. The comrade says, (34—37,) Unfold your <lb/>
            dream, since we have leisure : we cannot sleep, so comfortless is our <lb/>
            couch, and we cannot work because 'tis dark. We have not the same <lb/>
            means of dispelling darkness as the rich, or public halls, which can keep <lb/>
            their lamps (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λυχνια</foreign>) burning all night; nor is our <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅγρα</foreign>, our gain from <lb/>
            our craft, such as to enable us to get a light for the dark nights. When <lb/>
            it is said the light is in the Prytaneum, (the common hall of Athens, <lb/>
            Syracuse, and other large towns,) it is implied that it is " not in thefisher­ <lb/>
            man's hut," by the same figure as we say " wine is the rich man's drink," <lb/>
            i. e. “not for the poor man." And so in the New Testament, St. Matt. <lb/>
            xi. 8, “ Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in king's houses," i. e. <lb/>
            you must not look for them in the desert. The 37th verse implies that <lb/>
            public halls can always afford to be lit up. These fishermen, says Chap­ <lb/>
            man, were honest radicals. </note><note type="footnote"> 16 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλινὸν</foreign>, adverbially.

            Amphitrite. Then softly I disengaged him from the hook, <lb/>
            lest ever the hooks should retain the gold from his mouth. <lb/>
            19 And thefish indeed I hauled ashore with ropes, and I swore <lb/>
            ,that never in future would I set foot upon the sea, but abide <lb/>
            on land and reign over the gold. This was even what awoke <lb/>

          <p>Com. Why then fear it not ! you have not sworn ; for <lb/>
            neither did you find, as you saw, a fish of gold. But visions <lb/>
            resemble falsehoods. 20 And if in reality, and not in sleep, you <lb/>
            shall search these spots, the hope of your dreams requires a <lb/>

              shores of the Bebrycians, Pollux and Castor, going in quest of water, <lb/>
              find in the region, which abounds in springs, one Amycus of great <lb/>
              bodily strength; who gives out to them that they shall then only <lb/>

              Pollux comes off victorious, although there was reason to fear that his <lb/>
              adversary's vast strength might overwhelm him. In the remainder of <lb/>
              the Hymn is commemorated Castor's fight with Lynceus. The cir­ <lb/>

              which he had fled. Idas, grieved at the loss of his brother, seizes a <lb/>

            ioned Pollux, were both keeping aloof, having strayed from their <lb/>

          <p>Poll. My good sir, would not you at any rate allow us even <lb/>

            rattled; whilst he kept maiming his face with ever sharper <lb/>
            blows, until he had smashed his cheeks ; but then all on the <lb/>

            points of their spears, ere they had wounded one or the other, <lb/>

            in beauty fair, but in disposition no longer on a par. He <lb/>
            hated him that loved him, and had not even a jot of mildness, <lb/>
            and he knew not Eros, what god he was, and 2 what sort of <lb/>
            bow and arrows he holds in his hands, how grievous shafts <lb/>
            he hurls against boys; but in all respects, whether in <lb/>
            speeches or in approaches, he was unbending. Nor was <lb/>
            there any solace of the fires of love, not quivering of lip, <lb/>
            nor bright flash of eyes, 3 nor rosy cheek, nor word, nor kiss <lb/>
            that relieves love. 4 But as a beast of the forest watches the <lb/>
            hunters, so would he do all things against the man : and <lb/>
            fierce were his lips, and sternly looked his eyes; 5they had <lb/>
            fate upon them: and his countenance answered to his bile, <lb/>
            and the colour fled from it, 6 clad in arrogance from his <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολύφιλτρος</foreign>, suffering from many love-charms. Hence enamoured, <lb/>

            last he could not endure so great a blaze of Cytherea, but <lb/>
            went and 9 began to bewail at the cruel dwelling, and kissed <lb/>
            the door-post, and thus lifted up his voice:-</p>
          <p>Cruel and morose youth, offspring of an evil lioness, 10 flinty <lb/>
            youth, and unworthy of love, I have come bringing thee this <lb/>
            last present, my rope; since no longer do I wish to pain thee, <lb/>
            lad, angered as thou art, but I am going whither thou hast de­ <lb/>
            voted me ; where, 'tis said, the road is common, and 11 where <lb/>
            oblivion is the remedy, for them that love. 12But even though I <lb/>
            should have taken it all to my lips, and have drained the cup, <lb/>
            not even thus shall I quench my yearning thirst. But now I <lb/>

          <p>In this Idyll the first achievement of the boy Hercules is recounted, his <lb/>
            victory, to wit, over the hostile dragons sent against him by Juno. <lb/>
            Alcmena, terrified by this prodigy, (62,) sends for Teiresias, the seer, <lb/>
            to explain it, and to point out means of appeasing the wrath of the <lb/>
            gods. He comes, and unfolds the labours, the earthly and the hea­ <lb/>
            venly glory which should attend the child, when grown to man's <lb/>
            estate. He also orders the dragons to be burned, and the house to be <lb/>
            purified. There follows an enumeration of the masters, whose train­ <lb/>
            ing conduced to make Hercules a worthy hero. The end of the poem, <lb/>
            which we may suppose to have gone deeply into the history of his <lb/>

            25th, and the Megara of Moschus, are the three parts of one poem, <lb/>
            the Heraclea of some nameless author. Reiske supposed Idylls 24th <lb/>
            and 25th to be parts of the Heraclea of Pisander; but Kiessling <lb/>
            points out that the non-preservation of the customs of the heroic age <lb/>
            in these two Idylls disproves this theory. We may safely, with War­ <lb/>
            ton, reckon it among the Idylls of Theocritus.</p>
          <p>ONCE upon a time Alcmena of 1 Midea, having washed both <lb/>
            Hercules, now ten months old, and Iphiclus, younger by a <lb/>
            night, and having filled them with milk, had laid them down <lb/>
            in a 2brazen shield, which, a noble piece of armour, Amphi­ <lb/>
            tryon had taken as spoil from fallen Pterelaus. And the <lb/>
            woman, touching the head of her children, spake thus: 'Sleep, <lb/>
            my babes, a sweet sleep, and one from which ye may awake; <lb/>
            sleep, my lives, two brothers, secure children, happily may ye <lb/>
            sleep, and happily arrive at morn.' Thus having said, she <lb/>
            rocked the great shield, and sleep took possession of them.</p>
          <p>But what time 3 the Bear revolves at midnight toward the <lb/>
            setting, opposite Orion himself, and he displays his broad <lb/>
            shoulder, then in sooth Juno of many schemes set in motion <lb/>
            two dreadful monsters, dragons bristling with azure coils, <lb/>
            against the broad threshold, where the door-posts of the cham­ <lb/>
            ber are hollow, having urged them by threats to devour the <lb/>
            babe Hercules.</p>
          <p>These twain then having uncoiled themselves, were rolling <lb/>
            their ravenous bellies along the ground; and 4from their <lb/>
            eyes, as they went, evil fire was glancing, and they were spit- <note type="footnote"> 1Midea. See Idyll xiii. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Meursius (at Callim. H. in Jov. 48) tells us that the shield was often <lb/>

            locant in clypeo." Pterelaus, king of the Taphians, was subdued by Am­ <lb/>

            which was taken, he was to be immortal. This his daughter Comætho <lb/>

            their forked tongues, they had come nigh the boys, then, I <lb/>
            wot, as Jove knoweth all things, the dear children of Alc­ <lb/>
            mena awoke, and a light was raised all over the chamber. In <lb/>
            truth, the one, namely Iphiclus, forthwith shouted out, when <lb/>
            he perceived the evil monsters above the hollow shield, and <lb/>
            saw their ruthless fangs ; and kicked away with his feet the <lb/>
            fine coverlet, being eager to escape: but the other, Hercules, <lb/>
            opposing them, held fast to them with his hands, and bound <lb/>
            both in a firm grasp, having seized them by the throat, where <lb/>
            baneful poisons, such as even the gods abhor, are wrought by <lb/>
            murderous serpents. 6 And they two, on the other hand, <lb/>
            began to wind with their coils around the child, late-born, <lb/>
            still a suckling, ever tearless under his nurse's care: but again <lb/>
            they began to uncoil, since they were wearied in their spines, <lb/>
            in trying to find a riddance from his constraining grasp. And <lb/>
            Alcmena heard a cry, and awoke first. 'Rise, Amphitryon, <lb/>
            for timid fear possesses me : rise, 7 nor put your sandals on <lb/>
            your feet. Hear you not how greatly the younger of the <lb/>
            children is crying? 8Or perceive you not that, some where in <lb/>

            without the aid of clear dawn ? There is some strange thing, <lb/>

            him upon a peg, above his cedar couch. In truth he was <lb/>

            the spacious chamber was filled again with gloom. Then at <lb/>
            length he shouted to the servants 10 snoring heavily in sleep : <lb/>
            'Bring fire with all speed, having snatched it from the hearth, <lb/>
            my servants, and force back the strong bolts of the doors: <lb/>

            servants then speedily came forward with blazing lights, and <lb/>
            the chamber was filled with the bustling of each. In good <lb/>
            truth, I ween, when they saw the suckling Hercules tightly <lb/>

          <p>In this fragmentary poem we find Hercules in the land of Elis, in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of the famous stables of Augeas. Having arrived <lb/>
            thither, he is led to the king by an old rustic. The king has retired <lb/>
            into the country to visit his herds. A description of a vast herd re­ <lb/>
            turning from pasture is finely interwoven, (84—137,) and Hercules is <lb/>
            exhibited repelling with ease the assault of the finest bull of the herd, <lb/>
            a proof of valour which excites the admiration of the king and his <lb/>
            son. This son of Augeas, as they travel by the same road, begs Her­ <lb/>
            cules to recount to him, by what means he slew the Nemean lion. <lb/>
            The hero, complying, narrates the whole exploit. Some have doubted <lb/>
            whether Theocritus wrote this poem. It is variously assigned by such, <note type="footnote"> daughter of Hipponous, by whom he had Tydeus. Tydeus, when grown <lb/>

            hands : ‘ Stranger, I will readily tell over to you all that you <lb/>
            ask, since I stand in awe of the dread vengeance of 2 Hermes <lb/>

            king Augeas 3feed not all on one pasture, or one spot; but <lb/>
            some, I ween, pasture round about on the banks of 4 Elisus, <lb/>

            again hard by 6Buprasium teeming with grapes, and others <lb/>

            arrived, coming up from pasture to their 19 folds and pens. <lb/>

              were making for him. And with him his son as well as mighty <lb/>

              yet was vastly astonished on seeing the countless tribe of oxen, <lb/>

              stock of one man, no, nor of ten others, ay, such as were rich <lb/>
              in flocks beyond all other men, was so great. Since Phoebus <lb/>
              had presented to his son this special gift, to be rich in cattle <lb/>

            27looking slaughter in their visages. And chief of them in­ <lb/>
            deed both in strength, and in his natural force and high <lb/>

            all 28 wont to liken to a star, because as he moved he shone <lb/>
            out greatly among other oxen, and was very conspicuous. Now <lb/>
            he in fact, when he beheld the dry hide of a fierce-eyed lion, <lb/>
            upon this rushed against wary Hercules himself, so as to bring <lb/>

            the earth beneath ; and then thrust him back again, having <lb/>
            pressed heavily with his shoulder ; so the bull, having the <lb/>

            truth, look you, was also discoursing among many of the <lb/>
            Epeans, that one of the Argives in his presence had destroyed <lb/>
            a wild beast, a savage lion, a monster of evil to rustics, having <lb/>
            a hollow den 37 in the grove of Nemean Jupiter. I know not <lb/>
            accurately, whether he was from 38 sacred Argos, on the spot, <lb/>
            or an inhabitant of the city of Tiryns, or Mycenæ. Thus he <lb/>
            at least used to say : but by birth he reported that the hero <lb/>
            was (that is, if I recollect rightly) 39 of the lineage of Perseus. <lb/>

              the courage to do this deed, and the wild beast's hide, which <lb/>
              envelopes your sides, very clearly bespeaks the work of your <lb/>

              O hero, whether I guess rightly or not,) if even you are that <lb/>
              hero, 41 of whom the Achæan from Helice told us, his hearers, <lb/>
              and I judge of you rightly. And tell me how you yourself <lb/>
              slew this dreadful wild beast, and how it came into the land <lb/>
              of well-watered Nemea. For such a monster you could not <lb/>
              find, though you desired to see it, in 42 Apis; since it surely <lb/>
              rears none such, but only bears, and wild boars, 43 and the <lb/>

              immortals, 45 angry on account of sacrifices, inflicted the pest <lb/>
              on the men descended from -Phoroneus. For overwhelming, <lb/>
              like a river, all 46 the men of Pisa, the lion kept ravaging them <lb/>
              furiously, and most of all the 47 Bembinæans, who were dwell­ <lb/>
              ing near to him, being in most intolerable plight. Now this <lb/>
              conflict Eurystheus imposed on me to accomplish first of all, <lb/>
              for he desired that the savage beast might kill me. But I took <lb/>
              my supple bow, and hollow quiver filled with arrows, and <lb/>
              set forth: and in my other hand was my stout club, bark and <lb/>
              all, of the shady wild olive, of a good size: which I myself <lb/>
              having found under sacred Helicon, had pulled up whole with <lb/>
              its thick roots. But when I had come to the place where the <lb/>
              lion was, then it was that, having taken my bow, and applied <lb/>
              the string to the 48 hooked tip, I forthwith set upon it a bane­ <lb/>
              ful arrow. And moving my eyes every where, I proceeded <lb/>
              to look out for the destructive monster, if haply I might spy <lb/>
              him, and that too before he had caught sight of me. 49 'Twas <lb/>
              mid-day, and no where was I able to discern tracks of him, <lb/>
              or to hear his roar. No, nor was there any man, set over <lb/>

              straightway began to make trial of prowess. In truth, he <lb/>
              was 50 going before evening to his den, having fed on flesh <lb/>

              upon me: and I hit him, as he drew nearer, on his left flank, <lb/>

              penetrate through his flesh, but glancing back fell on the green <lb/>
              herbage. Then speedily did he raise in astonishment his blood- <lb/>
              red head from the ground, and ran over it on all sides with <lb/>
              his eyes, making his observations, and, in yawning, 52he hegave <lb/>

              did the painful arrow pierce beneath the hide, but fell before <lb/>

          <p>This poem narrates the slaughter of Pentheus, king of Thebes. While <lb/>
            Agave his mother, with her sisters, Ino and Autonoe, is celebrating the <lb/>
            orgies of Bacchus, Pentheus is spied by the Bacchants, concealed <lb/>
            amongst some shrubs. Hereupon they make an attack upon the un­ <lb/>
            fortunate offender, and, under the influence of Bacchic phrensy, seize <lb/>
            him and mangle him. At the close of the poem, our poet prays the <lb/>
            gods that it may be permitted him to live purely and safely, and adds <lb/>
            an encomium on Bacchus and Semele. The subject has been treated <lb/>
            by Euripides and by Lucius Accius, his translator. See also Ovid's <lb/>
            Metamorph. iii. 701—733.</p>
          <p>INO and Autonoe, and 1 apple-cheeked Agave, led three <lb/>

            indeed having plucked wild foliage of a 3 bushy oak, and green <lb/>
            ivy, and asphodel that grows over the ground, had reared 4in <lb/>
            an open meadow twelve altars, the three for Semele, the nine <lb/>
            for Bacchus: and, when they had taken in their hands 5from <lb/>
            the mystic chest curiously-wrought sacred images, had laid <lb/>
            them down silently upon the 6 newly plucked altars, as Bacchus <lb/>
            himself was wont to teach, as himself was well pleased it <lb/>
            should be. But Pentheus was beholding all from a high rock, <lb/>
            creeping under an ancient mastich tree, a shrub of the country. <lb/>
            Autonoe first spied him, and raised a fearful cry, and rushing <lb/>
            in suddenly, with her feet disturbed the orgies of frantic Bac­ <lb/>
            chus: and these, 7 uninitiated persons behold not. Maddened <lb/>
            indeed both she, and maddened, I ween, straightway also others. <lb/>
            Pentheus was flying affrighted; while they kept pursu­ <lb/>
            ing, having drawn-up-tight their robes by the waist to the <lb/>
            knee. Now Pentheus spake thus, ‘What want ye, women ?' <lb/>
            But Autonoe said this, ‘Soon shalt thou know, ere thou hast <lb/>
            heard it.' His mother, on the one hand, roared out, as she <lb/>
            seized the head of her son, deeply 8as is the roar of a lioness <lb/>

          <p>This sweet ditty was written to commend an ivory distaff, which the <lb/>
            poet, about to sail to Miletus, intended as a present for Theugenis, the <lb/>
            wife of Nicias the physician. Under the semblance of teaching the <lb/>
            distaff what sort of a mistress it is about to have, he cleverly and <lb/>
            gracefully praises a most honourable matron and her husband. The <lb/>
            Idyll is of the lyric class; the metre Choriambic; a favourite of Alcæus, <lb/>
            and one which Horace imitates in the 18th Ode of the first book.</p>

          <p>1‘WINE,’ dear youth, ‘and truth,' is the saying; and we <lb/>

            in the depths of my heart. You choose not to love me with <lb/>
            your whole soul, I know it: 2 for the half of life, which I <lb/>
            have, lives in thy beauteous form, and the rest has perished. <lb/>
            And whensoever you choose, I pass a day like the gods ; but <lb/>
            when you choose not, I am wholly in gloom. How is this <lb/>
            seemly, 3to consign him that loves thee to cares ? Nay, if <lb/>
            you would be persuaded at all by me, the younger by the <lb/>
            elder, then you yourself would be better circumstanced, and <lb/>
            commend me for it; build one nest in one tree, where no <lb/>
            savage reptile shall reach. But now you occupy one branch <lb/>
            to-day, and another to-morrow; and you seek one after <lb/>
            another. And suppose any one shall have seen and praised <lb/>
            4 your fair face, to him then you straightway become a friend of <lb/>
            more than three years' date; whilst you place your first admirer <lb/>
            in the third rank. You seem to savour of arrogant men. <lb/>
            Nay, prefer, as long as you live, to have always one like your­ <lb/>
            self. For if you thus do, you will be well-reported of by <lb/>
            the citizens; and Love would not be troublesome to you, Love, <lb/>
            who easily subdues the minds of men, and hath wrought me <lb/>
            into softness from being iron-hearted. But be this as it may, <lb/>

          <p>When Venus, on the death of Adonis, had bidden a boar, the author of <lb/>
            the crime, be brought before her, the animal tries to excuse his sin, <lb/>
            by pleading, that he had been smitten by love of the beauteous <lb/>
            youth, and had therefore longed to kiss his limbs. Then he surren­ <lb/>
            ders himself to Venus, that she may inflict upon him the penalty due <lb/>
            to his guilt. The goddess, taking pity, orders him to go free. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence of which, the boar thenceforth voluntarily attends Venus.</p>

            was advancing timidly, for he was afraid of Cytherea. Then <lb/>
            Aphrodite said to him, ‘Thou worst of all wild beasts, didst <lb/>
            thou wound this thigh? Hast thou stricken 3my lover?' <lb/>
            But the beast answered thus, ‘I swear to thee, Cytherea, by <lb/>

            hunters, I did not wish to wound thy beauteous lover ! but I <lb/>
            gazed on him 4 as though I had been a statue, and not being <lb/>
            able to endure my warmth, I was mad to kiss the limb which <lb/>
            he had bare ; and then 5my tooth hurt him. Take these, 0 <lb/>

            if these do not satisfy thee, then take these my lips also ; for <lb/>
            why did they dare to kiss ?'</p>
          <p>But Venus pitied him, and bade the Loves to loose his bonds. <lb/>
            Thenceforth he was wont to attend her, and would not go to <lb/>
            the woods ; 6and having approached the fire, kept burning <lb/>

            and his eyes are glazed neath the lids, and the rose flies from <lb/>

            do you desire most to come ? Is it summer, when all things, <lb/>
            as many as we labour at, are completed ? Or sweet autumn, <lb/>
            when hunger comes but lightly on men ? Or is it even 2idle <lb/>
            winter ? since 'tis e'en in winter that many, while they warm <lb/>
            themselves, 3 are overpowered by laziness and sloth. Or is <lb/>
            beauteous spring more agreeable to you ? Tell me what your <lb/>
            inclination prefers ; for our leisure has given us leave to <lb/>
            speak.</p>
          <p>Myrson. For mortals to judge divine works is unmeet; for <lb/>
            all these are holy and sweet; yet for your sake, Cleodamus, <lb/>
            I will speak out which is to me more sweet than all the rest. <lb/>
            I would not it were summer, 4for then the sun scorches me. <lb/>
            I would not it were 5 autumn, for then ripe fruits breed disease. <lb/>

              sembled a native, and hugged her more closely as her own <lb/>
              child; and kept saying that she-was her mother, and that <lb/>
              herself had nurtured her. But the other, using violence with <lb/>
              strong hands, was drawing her away, nothing loth: for she <lb/>
              said that 'twas fated by ægis-bearing Jove that Europa should <lb/>

          <p>She then started in affright from 4her strown couch, quak­ <lb/>
            in- at heart, for she had beheld the dream as a real appear­ <lb/>
            ance ; and seating herself she kept silence a long time, yet still <lb/>
            had she before her waking eyes both the women. And late <lb/>
            at length the maiden uplifted a timid voice, Who of the ce­ <lb/>
            lestials has sent upon me such phantoms ? What manner of <lb/>
            dreams are these which have exceedingly scared me, as I <lb/>

            own child! But may the blessed gods decide the dream to <lb/>
            me for good.' Thus saying, she sprang up; and went to seek <lb/>

            And in like manner Alcmena was 10bedewing her white <lb/>

          <p>11 Unhappy in thy children, why then, I pray, bath this <lb/>

          <p>SWEET is the music which the whispering pine <lb/>
            Makes to the murmuring fountains; sweet is thine, <lb/>
            Breathed from the pipe: the second prize thy due— <lb/>
            To Pan, the horned ram; to thee, the ewe; <lb/>
            And thine the yearling, when the ewe he takes- <lb/>
            A savoury mess the tender yearling makes.</p>

            <title type="sub">GOATHERD.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Sweeter thy song than yonder gliding down <lb/>
            Of water from the rock's o'erhanging crown ; <lb/>
            If a ewe-sheep for fee the Muses gain, <lb/>
            Thou, shepherd! shalt a stall-fed lamb obtain ; <lb/>
            But if it rather please the tuneful Nine <lb/>
            To take the lamb, the ewe shall then be thine.</p>

          <p>0 wilt thou, for the Nymphs’ sake, goatherd ! fill <lb/>
            Thy pipe with music on this sloping hill, <lb/>
            Where grow the tamarisks ? wilt sit, dear friend, <lb/>
            And play for me, while I thy goats attend ?</p>

          <p>We must not pipe at noon in any case; <lb/>
            For then Pan rests him, wearied from the chase. <lb/>
            Him, quick to wrath we fear, as us befits; <lb/>
            On his keen nostril sharp gall ever sits. <lb/>
            But thou-to thee the griefs of Daphnis known, <lb/>
            And the first skill in pastoral song thine own- <lb/>
            Come to yon elm, into whose shelter deep <lb/>
            Afront Priapus and the Naiads peep- <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            Where the thick oaks stand round the shepherd's seat <lb/>
            There, sitting with me in that cool retreat, <lb/>
            If thou wilt sing, as when thou didst contest <lb/>
            With Libyan Chromis which could sing the best, <lb/>
            Thine, Thyrsis, this twin-bearing goat shall be, <lb/>
            That fills two milk-pails thrice a-day for me ; <lb/>
            And this deep ivy-cup with sweetest wax <lb/>
            Bedewed, twin-eared, that of the graver smacks. <lb/>
            Around its lips lush ivy twines on high, <lb/>
            Sprinkled with drops of bright cassidony ; <lb/>
            And as the curling ivy spreads around, <lb/>
            On every curl the saffron fruit is found. <lb/>
            With flowing robe and Lydian head-dress on, <lb/>
            Within, a woman to the life is done- <lb/>
            An exquisite design ! on either side <lb/>
            Two men with flowing locks each other chide, <lb/>
            By turns contending for the woman's love, <lb/>
            But not a whit her mind their pleadings move. <lb/>
            One while she gives to this a glance and smile, <lb/>
            And turns and smiles on that another while. <lb/>
            But neither any certain favour gains- <lb/>
            Only their eyes are swollen for their pains. <lb/>
            Hard by, a rugged rock and fisher old, <lb/>
            Who drags a mighty net, and seems to hold, <lb/>
            Preparing for the cast: he stands to sight, <lb/>
            A fisher putting forth his utmost might. <lb/>
            A youth's strength in the gray-head seems to dwell, <lb/>
            So much the sinews of his neck outswell. <lb/>
            And near that old man with his sea-tanned hue, <lb/>
            With purple'grapes a vineyard shines to view. <lb/>
            A little boy sits by the thorn-hedge trim, <lb/>
            To watch the grapes-two foxes watching him: <lb/>
            One through the ranges of the vines proceeds, <lb/>
            And on the hanging vintage slyly feeds ; <lb/>
            The other plots and vows his scrip to search, <lb/>
            And for his breakfast leave him—in the lurch. <lb/>
            Meanwhile he twines and to a rush fits well <lb/>
            A locust trap with stalks of asphodel; <lb/>
            And twines away with such absorbing glee, <lb/>
            Of scrip or vines he never thinks-not be ! <lb/>
            The juicy curled acanthus hovers round <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            Th' Æoliancup-when seen a marvel found. <lb/>
            Hither a Calydonian skipper brought it, <lb/>
            For a great cheese-cake and a goat I bought it; <lb/>
            Untouched by lip—this cup shall be thy hire, <lb/>
            If thou wilt sing that song of sweet desire. <lb/>
            I envy not: begin ! the strain outpour ; <lb/>
            'Twill not be thine on dim Oblivion's shore.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THYRSIS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Begin, dear Muses ! the bucolic strain ; <lb/>
            For Thyrsis sings, your own Ætneän swain. <lb/>
            Where were ye, Nymphs ! when Daphnis pined away, <lb/>
            Where through his Tempe Peneus loves to stray, <lb/>
            Or Pindus lifts himself ? Ye Were not here- <lb/>
            Where broad Anapus flows or Acis clear, <lb/>
            Or where tall Ætna looks out on the main.</p>
          <p>Begin, dear Muses ! the bucolic strain. <lb/>
            From out the mountain-lair the lions growled, <lb/>
            Wailing his death-the wolves and jackals howled</p>
          <p>Begin, dear Muses ! the bucolic strain : <lb/>
            Around him in a long and mournful train, <lb/>
            Sad-faced, a number of the horned kind, <lb/>
            Heifers, bulls, cows, and calves, lamenting pined.</p>
          <p>First Hermes from the mountain came and said, <lb/>
            " Daphnis, by whom art thou disquieted ? <lb/>
            For whom dost thou endure so fierce a flame ?"</p>
          <p>Then cowherds, goatherds, shepherds, thronging came, <lb/>
            And asked what ailed him. E'en Priapus went, <lb/>
            And said : " Sad Daphnis, why this languishment ? <lb/>
            In every grove, by fountains, far and near, <lb/>
            Thee the loved girl is seeking every where. <lb/>
            Ah, foolish lover ! to thyself unkind, <lb/>
            Miscalled a cowherd, with a goatherd's mind ! <lb/>
            The goatherd when he sees his goats at play, <lb/>
            Envies their wanton sport and pines away. <lb/>
            And thou at sight of virgins, when they smile, <lb/>
            Dost look with longing eyes and pine the while, <lb/>
            Because with them the dance thou dost not lead."</p>
          <p>No word he answered, but his grief did feed, <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            And brought to end his love, that held him fast, <lb/>
            And only ended with his life at last.</p>
          <p>Then Cypris came-the queen of soft desire, <lb/>
            Smiling in secret, but pretending ire, <lb/>
            And said : "To conquer love did Daphnis boast, <lb/>
            But, Daphnis ! is not love now uppermost ?" <lb/>
            Her answered he : " Thou cruel sorrow-feeder ! <lb/>
            Curst Cypris ! mankind's hateful mischief-breeder ! <lb/>
            'Tis plain my sun is set: but I shall show <lb/>
            The blight of love in Hades' house below. <lb/>
            ‘Where Cypris kiss'd a cowherd’—men will speak— <lb/>
            Hasten to Ida ! thine Anchises seek. <lb/>
            Around their hives swarmed bees are humming here, <lb/>
            Here the low galingale—thick oaks are there. <lb/>
            Adonis, the fair youth, a shepherd too, <lb/>
            Wounds hares, and doth all savage beasts pursue. <lb/>
            Go ! challenge Diomede to fight with thee­ <lb/>
            'I tame the cowherd Daphnis, fight with me.'</p>
          <p>" Ye bears, who in the mountain hollows dwell, <lb/>
            Ye tawny jackals, bounding wolves, farewell! <lb/>
            The cowherd Daphnis never more shall rove <lb/>
            In quest of you through thicket, wood, and grove. <lb/>
            Farewell, ye rivers, that your streams profuse <lb/>
            From Thymbris pour ; farewell, sweet Arethuse ! <lb/>
            I drove my kine—a cowherd whilom here- <lb/>
            To pleasant pasture, and to water clear. <lb/>
            Pan ! Pan ! if seated on a jagged peak <lb/>
            Of tall Lycæus now ; or thou dost seek <lb/>
            The heights of Mænalus—leave them awhile, <lb/>
            And hasten to thy own Sicilian isle. <lb/>
            The tomb, which e'en the gods admire, leave now- <lb/>
            Lycaon's tomb and Helice's tall brow. <lb/>
            Hasten, my king ! and take this pipe that clips, <lb/>
            Uttering its honey breath, the player's lips. <lb/>
            For even now, dragged downward, must I go, <lb/>
            By love dragged down to Hades' house below. <lb/>
            Now violets, ye thorns and brambles bear ! <lb/>
            Narcissus now on junipers appear ! <lb/>
            And on the pine-tree pears ! since Daphnis dies, <lb/>
            To their own use all things be contraries ! <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            The stag trail hounds ; in rivalry their song <lb/>
            The mountain owls with nightingales prolong !"</p>
          <p>He said, and ceased: and Cypris wished, indeed, <lb/>
            To raise him up, but she could not succeed ; <lb/>
            His fate-allotted threads of life were spent, <lb/>
            And Daphnis to the doleful river went. <lb/>
            The whirlpool gorged him—by the Nymphs not scorned,, <lb/>
            Dear to the Muses, and by them adorned.</p>
          <p>Cease! cease, ye Muses! the bucolic strain. <lb/>
            Give me the cup and goat that I may drain <lb/>
            The pure milk from her ; and, for duty's sake, <lb/>
            A due libation to the Muses make. <lb/>
            All hail, ye Muses ! hail, and favour me, <lb/>
            And my hereafter song shall sweeter be.</p>

            The finest purple wool around the bowl. <lb/>
            Quick ! Thestylis, that I with charms may bind <lb/>
            The man I love, but faithless and unkind. <lb/>
            This is the twelfth day he my sight hath fled, <lb/>
            And knows not whether I be quick or dead; <lb/>
            The twelfth day since he cross'd my threshold o'er, <lb/>
            Nor, cruel! once hath knocked upon my door, <lb/>

            I'll go-to see and chide him for my sorrow- <lb/>
            To Timagetus' wrestling-school to-morrow. <lb/>
            Now will I charm him with the magic rite: <lb/>
            Come forth, thou Moon! with thy propitious light; <lb/>
            Cold, silent goddess ! at this witching hour <lb/>
            To thee I'll chant, and to th' Infernal Power, <lb/>
            Dread Hecate; whom, coming through the mounds <lb/>
            Of blood-swoln corses, flee the trembling hounds. <lb/>
            Hail, Hecate ! prodigious demon, hail! <lb/>
            Come at the last, and make the work prevail; <lb/>
            That this strong brewage may perform its part <lb/>
            No worse than that was made by Circe's art, <lb/>
            By bold Medea, terrible as fair, <lb/>
            Or Perimeda of the golden hair.</p>
          <p>Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel! <lb/>
            First in the fire is burnt the barley meal; <lb/>
            Quick ! Thestylis, quick ! sprinkle more-yet more; <lb/>
            Wretch ! wither do thine idle fancies soar ? <lb/>
            Am I thy scorn and mock ? sprinkle and say­ <lb/>

            Delphis has made me fiercest tortures feel; <lb/>

            As crackles loud the kindled laurel bough, <lb/>
            Blazes, and e'en its dust we not discern- <lb/>
            So may the flesh of Delphis dropping burn !</p>

            Whoever lies with Delphis, cheek by cheek, <lb/>
            May he forget her so much as they say <lb/>
            Theseus forgot, and left in Dia's bay <lb/>
            The bright-haired Ariadne—fast away <lb/>
            Sailing from Dia with his rapid keel.</p>
          <p>Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel! <lb/>
            A little herb in Arcady there grows, <lb/>
            Which colts and mares doth strangely discompose, <lb/>

            O'er mountain-ranges with a frantic hurry: <lb/>
            Thus from the wrestling-school, all bright with oil, <lb/>
            May Delphis madly rush-with thoughts that boil; <lb/>
            May he for me this maddening passion feel!</p>
          <p>Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel! <lb/>
            This fringe he dropt, that ran his cloak across, <lb/>
            I tear, and to the furious fire I toss. <lb/>
            Ah, love! ah, cruel love! why dost outsuck <lb/>

            A draught whose ill none antidote can heal <lb/>
            From a bruised lizard I'll to-morrow make: <lb/>
            Now, Thestylis, this poisonous brewage take, <lb/>
            And smear his threshold-there my mind must be, <lb/>
            As thereto bound; but he cares not for me: <lb/>
            And having smeared the door-way, spitting there, <lb/>
            Then say, " The bones of Delphis thus I smear."</p>
          <p>Him hither, hither draw, my magic wheel! <lb/>
            How, left alone, shall I with sorrow deal ? <lb/>
            Or where begin with my grief-plighted thought ? <lb/>
            Who first on me this love-this mischief brought ? <lb/>
            Anaxo came, on whom it fell this year <lb/>

            Outshone the sparkles of thy golden sheen.</p>
          <p>Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend: <lb/>
            I saw, loved, maddened! raging love did rend <lb/>
            My very soul; my bloom of beauty bright <lb/>
            Withered at once as by a sudden blight: <lb/>
            The pomp I saw not passing in my view, <lb/>
            And how I reached my home I never knew ; <lb/>
            A fiery torment on my vitals fed; <lb/>
            Ten days and nights I lay upon my bed.</p>
          <p>Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend: <lb/>
            Such hues and juices of the thapsus lend <lb/>
            Gloomed on my cheek ; off dropt my crown of hair; <lb/>
            I was but skin and bones; in my despair <lb/>
            Whom sought I not ? what magic-dealing crone <lb/>
            Consulted not ? but I found help from none: <lb/>
            On hastened time, that brings all things to end.</p>
          <p>Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend: <lb/>
            Then to my hand-maid I revealed my mind; <lb/>
            " Some remedy for ray sore sickness find ; <lb/>
            I pine for, dote upon, the Myndian youth, <lb/>
            Am altogether his in very sooth; <lb/>
            At Timagetus' school watch, bring him me, <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            For there he visits-there he loves to be. <lb/>
            And when you see him from the rest apart, <lb/>
            Then nod and softly whisper him, Sweetheart! <lb/>
            Simætha calls you’—guide him here, my friend."</p>
          <p>Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend: <lb/>
            She went and found the remedy I sought, <lb/>
            And to my house the blooming Delphis brought. <lb/>
            But when I saw him o'er my threshold-sill <lb/>
            Pass with light foot, I sudden grew more chill <lb/>
            Than wintry snow; and from my forehead burst <lb/>
            Sweat like the dew the melting South hath nurst; <lb/>
            I could not utter—e’en the murmur fine <lb/>
            That sleeping infants to their mothers whine; <lb/>
            Senseless I stiffened in my strange affright, <lb/>
            Like a wax-doll, the girl-child's dear delight.</p>
          <p>Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend : <lb/>
            The heartless minion first on me did bend <lb/>
            His eager eyes, then sitting on the bed <lb/>
            He turned them on the ground, and softly said :— <lb/>
            “In calling me before I came self-moved, <lb/>
            Thou hast as much outpast me, my beloved, <lb/>
            As I did lately with swift foot out-pace <lb/>
            The beautiful Philinus in the race."-</p>
          <p>(Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend:) <lb/>
            " For, by sweet Eros ! with a second friend, <lb/>
            Or with a third, I should have come to-night, <lb/>
            Bringing sweet apples, crowned with poplar white, <lb/>
            Careful the wreath with purple stripes to blend:"</p>
          <p>(Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend:) <lb/>
            " Had you received me—well ;for me, 'mid all, <lb/>
            The handsome, active bachelor they call; <lb/>
            A kiss from those rich lips, that sweetly pout, <lb/>
            Had been enough ; but had you shut me out, <lb/>
            And your barred doors had interposed delay, <lb/>
            Axes and torches then had forced a way."</p>
          <p>(Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend:) <lb/>
            “To Cypris first in gratitude I bend, <lb/>
            Thou, next to her, hast snatched me from the fire, <lb/>
            In calling me half burnt with fierce desire; <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            For Eros oft a fiercer flame awakes <lb/>
            Than those Sicilian fires Hephæstus makes.'</p>
          <p>(Whence grew my love, divinest Moon ! attend :) <lb/>
            " He from her bed the virgin oft doth send, <lb/>
            Stung by his furies ; and the new-made bride <lb/>
            Scares from the warm couch and her husband's side."</p>
          <p>These words he spoke; but I with credulous mind <lb/>
            Held his dear hand, and on the bed reclined : <lb/>
            Our bodies did by touching warmer grow, <lb/>
            And on our cheeks there came a hotter glow : <lb/>
            Sweetly we whispered ; and, in short, dear Moon ! <lb/>
            By Eros fired, we gained Cythera's boon. <lb/>
            Nor any blame on me could Delphis lay, <lb/>
            Nor haply I on him—’till yesterday. <lb/>
            I only learned to-day his yester ill: <lb/>
            While yet up-prancing the high eastern hill, <lb/>
            Her fiery-footed steeds from ocean's dew <lb/>
            With rosy-armed Aurora upward flew, <lb/>
            There came the mother of the festive pair, <lb/>
            Sweet-voiced Philista and Melixo fair, <lb/>
            And told me :—" Delphis loves elsewhere, I know, <lb/>
            But whom I know not; yet enamoured so, <lb/>
            That from the banquet suddenly he fled, <lb/>
            To hang his lady's house with flowers, he said." <lb/>
            My old friend told me this, and told me truth : <lb/>
            For twice or thrice a day once came my youth, <lb/>
            And often left his Dorian pyx with me ; <lb/>
            This the twelfth day since him I last did see. <lb/>
            Has he forgot me for another love ? <lb/>
            With philters will I try his soul to move; <lb/>
            But if he still will grieve, betray me, mock, <lb/>
            He shall, by fate! the door of Hades knock. <lb/>
            That chest has drugs shall make him feel my rage ; <lb/>
            The art I learned from an Assyrian sage. <lb/>
            Thy steeds to ocean now, bright Queen, direct; <lb/>
            What I have sworn to do I will effect. <lb/>
            Farewell, clear Moon ! and skyey cressets bright, <lb/>
            That follow the soft-gliding wheels of Night.</p><pb n="215"/>

          <p>I GO to serenade my charming fair, <lb/>
            Sweet Amaryllis; Tityrus, to your care <lb/>
            I leave my goats, that on the mountain feed ; <lb/>
            But of yon Libyan tawny ram take heed, <lb/>
            Lest with his horn he butt you ; careful tend, <lb/>
            And to the fountain drive them, heart-dear friend !</p>
          <p>Sweet Amaryllis! why dost thou no more, <lb/>
            Peeping from out thy cavern as before, <lb/>
            Espy and call to thee thy little lover ? <lb/>
            Dost hate me ? or do I myself discover <lb/>
            Flat-nosed, or with a length of chin, when near ? <lb/>
            Thy scorn will make me hang myself, I swear. <lb/>
            Behold, ten apples, nymph ! I bring for thee, <lb/>
            Plucked from the place where thou didst order me <lb/>
            To pluck them; others will I bring to-morrow. <lb/>
            Consider now my heart-devouring sorrow : <lb/>
            Oh ! that I were a little humming bee, <lb/>
            To pass through fern and ivy in to thee, <lb/>
            Where in thy cave thou dost thyself conceal! <lb/>
            I now know love-a grievous god to feel; <lb/>
            He surely sucked a savage lioness, <lb/>
            Reared in the wild, who works me such distress, <lb/>
            Eating into the marrow of the bone. <lb/>
            0 sweet in aspect! altogether stone ! <lb/>
            Nymph ! with thine eye-brows of a raven hue, <lb/>
            Clasp me, that I may suck the honey-dew <lb/>
            From off thy lip : mere kisses yield some joy. <lb/>
            Now wilt thou make me the sweet crown destroy, <lb/>
            This wreath of ivy which for thee I brought, <lb/>
            With rose-buds and with parsley sweet inwrought. <lb/>
            Ah me ! what shall I do ? I plead in vain- <lb/>
            Thou nearest not: I'll plunge into the main, <lb/>
            My jerkin stript, where Olpis sits on high, <lb/>
            Watching the tunnies. Should I even die, <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            'Twill please thee. This the sign I lately found <lb/>
            For the struck pop-bell gave me back no sound, <lb/>
            (When by that proof thy doubtful love I tried,) <lb/>
            But withering on my elbow shrunk and dried. <lb/>
            Agræo, the diviner by the sieve, <lb/>
            Forewarned me also what I now believe, <lb/>
            (Binding the sheaves, the reapers followed she,) <lb/>
            That I loved wholly one who loved not me. <lb/>
            A white twin-bearing goat, which the brunette, <lb/>
            Old Memnon’s child, Erithacis, would get <lb/>
            By wheedling from me, I have kept as thine ; <lb/>
            But since thou scornest me with airs so fine, <lb/>
            It shall be hers. A throbbing, I declare, <lb/>
            In my right eye-shall I behold my fair ? <lb/>
            My ditty, leaning on this pine, I'll chant; <lb/>
            She'll haply look, since she's not adamant.</p>
          <p>When in the race, mistrustful of his knees, <lb/>
            To win the virgin ran Hippomenes ; <lb/>
            Three golden apples in his hand he took, <lb/>
            And Atalanta could not help but look- <lb/>
            She saw, and maddened instant at the sight, <lb/>
            And rushed into the gulf of love outright. <lb/>
            The seer Melampus from Mount Othrys drove <lb/>
            The stolen herd to Pylos. Thence did Love <lb/>
            His brother Bias crown-for in his arms <lb/>
            Alphesibæa’s mother lodged her charms. <lb/>
            Did not Adonis, the fair shepherd youth, <lb/>
            So madden Cypris that for very ruth, <lb/>
            E'en when she had received his dying gasp, <lb/>
            She could not bear to loose him from her clasp ? <lb/>
            Thrice blest, methinks, was that Endymion, <lb/>
            Now laid asleep ; thrice blest Iäsion, <lb/>
            Who in his life did those sweet joys obtain, <lb/>
            Of which ye must not, shall not hear, profane !</p>
          <p>How my head aches ! my anguish doth not move thee ; <lb/>
            I'll sing no more, and since in vain I love thee, <lb/>
            Here will I lie—me here the wolves shall eat; <lb/>

          <p>" With apples Galatea pelts thy sheep, <lb/>
            Inviting one, whose pulses never leap <lb/>
            To love, whilst thou, cold Polypheme ! dost pipe, <lb/>
            Regardless of the sea-born beauty ripe. <lb/>
            And lo ! she pelts the watch-dog—with a bound <lb/>
            He barking starts, and angry looks around- <lb/>
            Then bays the sea ; the waves soft-murmuring show <lb/>
            An angry dog fast running to and fro. <lb/>
            Take heed he leap not on her, coming fresh <lb/>
            From the sea-wave, and tear her dainty flesh. <lb/>
            But like the thistle-down, when summer glows, <lb/>
            The sportive nymph, soft moving, comes and goes; <lb/>
            Pursues who flies her, her pursuer flies, <lb/>
            And moves the landmark of love's boundaries. <lb/>
            What is not lovely, lovely oft doth seem <lb/>

            I, to provoke her, look not in return, <lb/>
            And say that for another girl I burn.. <lb/>
            At hearing which with envy, by Apollo ! <lb/>
            The sea-nymph pines; and her eye-quest doth follow, <lb/>
            Leaping from out the sea like one that raves, <lb/>
            Amid my flocks, and peeps into the caves. <lb/>
            I make the dog bark just to discompose her; <lb/>
            He, when I loved her, whining used to nose her. <lb/>
            Noting my action, she perchance will find <lb/>
            Some messenger to let me know her mind. <lb/>
            I'll shut my door, till she on oath agree <lb/>
            To make her sweet bed on this isle with me. <lb/>
            Nor am I that unsightly one they say: <lb/>
            For in the calm, smooth wave the other day <lb/>
            I saw myself: and handsome was my beard, <lb/>
            And bright, methought, my single eye appeared. <lb/>
            And from the beautiful sea-mirror shone <lb/>
            My white teeth, brighter than the Parian stone. <lb/>
            To screen myself from influence malign, <lb/>
            Thrice on my breast I spat. This lesson fine <lb/>
            I learned from that wise crone Cotyttaris."</p>

            Sons of Lycopeus both, and good men these, <lb/>

            Firmly against the rock, did make outflow <lb/>

            Near which a thickly wooded grove is seen, <lb/>
            Poplars and elms, high overarching green. <lb/>
            Midway not reached, nor tomb of Brasilas, <lb/>
            We chanced upon Cydonian Lycidas, <lb/>
            By favour of the Muses : who not knew <lb/>
            That famous goatherd as he came in view ? <lb/>
            A tawny, shaggy goat-skin on his back, <lb/>
            That of the suppling pickle yet did smack ; <lb/>
            Bound by a belt of straw the traveller wore <lb/>
            An aged jerkin ; in his hand he bore <lb/>
            A crook of the wild olive coming nigh, <lb/>
            With widely parted lips, and smiling eye- <lb/>
            The laughter on his lip was plain to see- <lb/>
            He quietly addressed himself to me:</p>
          <p>" Whither so fast at noon-tide, when no more <lb/>
            The crested larks their sunny paths explore, <lb/>
            And in the thorn-hedge lizards lie asleep ? <lb/>
            To feast or to a wine-press do you leap ? <lb/>
            The stones ring to your buskins as you pass."</p>
          <p>To him I made reply—“ Dear Lycidas ! <lb/>
            All say you are the piper-far the best <lb/>
            'Mid shepherds and the reapers; this contest <lb/>
            Gladdens my heart; and yet (to put in speech <lb/>
            My fancy) I expect your skill to reach. <lb/>
            Our way is to a harvest-feast, which cater <lb/>
            Dear friends of ours for richly robed Damater, <lb/>
            Offering their first-fruits—since their garner-floor <lb/>
            Her bounteous love hath filled to running o'er. <lb/>
            Let us with pastoral song beguile the way ; <lb/>
            Common the path, and common is the day. <lb/>
            We shall each other, it may be, content; <lb/>
            For I, too, am a mouth-piece eloquent <lb/>
            Of the dear Muses ;and all men esteem, <lb/>

            Let us at once begin the pastoral strain ; <lb/>
            Here is a little song, which I did late, <lb/>
            Musing along the highlands, meditate:</p>
          <p>" To Mitylene sails my heart-dear love: <lb/>
            Safe be the way, and fair the voyage prove, <lb/>
            E'en when the south the moist wave dashes high on <lb/>
            The setting Kids, and tempest-veiled Orion <lb/>
            Places his feet on ocean ; and, returned, <lb/>
            My love be kind to me by Cypris burned; <lb/>
            For hot love burns me : may the Halcyons smooth <lb/>
            The swell o' the sea, the south and east winds soothe, <lb/>
            That from the lowest deep the sea-weed stir- <lb/>
            Best Halcyons ! whom of all the birds that skir <lb/>
            The waves for prey, the Nereids love the most. <lb/>
            Safe may my loved one reach the Lesbian coast, <lb/>
            And on the way be wind and weather fair! <lb/>
            With dill or roses will I twine my hair, <lb/>
            Or on my head will put a coronet, <lb/>
            Wreathed with the fragrance of the violet. <lb/>
            I by the fire will quaff the Ptelean wine, <lb/>
            And one shall roast me beans, while I recline <lb/>
            Luxurious, lying on a fragrant heap <lb/>
            Of asphodel and parsley, elbow deep ; <lb/>
            And mindful of my love the goblet clip, <lb/>
            Until the last lees trickle to my lip. <lb/>
            Two swains shall play the flute ; and Tityrus sing <lb/>
            How love for Xenea did our Daphnis sting, <lb/>
            How on the mountain he was wont to stray, <lb/>
            How wailed for him the oaks of Himera, <lb/>
            When he, dissolving, passed away from us, <lb/>
            Like snow on Hæmus, or far Caucasus, <lb/>
            Athos or Rhodope : or in his song <lb/>
            Recite, how by his master's cruel wrong <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            The swain was in a cedar ark shut up, <lb/>
            While quick-and how from many a flower-cup <lb/>
            The flat-nosed bees to his sweet prison flew, <lb/>
            And there sustained him with the honey-dew, <lb/>
            For that the Muse into his lip distilled <lb/>
            Sweet nectar: blest Comatas! that fulfilled <lb/>
            A whole spring, feeding on the bag o' the bee, <lb/>
            Shut in an ark! How had it gladdened me, <lb/>
            (Would only thou wert of the living now !) <lb/>
            To tend thy goats along the mountain's brow, <lb/>
            And hear thee sweetly sing, 0 bard divine ! <lb/>
            Lying at leisure under oak or pine !”</p>
          <p>He ceased: I in my turn : " Dear Lycidas ! <lb/>
            Whilst on the highlands with my herd I pass, <lb/>
            The Nymphs have taught me precious ditties oft, <lb/>
            Which haply Fame has borne to Zeus aloft. <lb/>
            I choose for you the very best I know; <lb/>
            Now listen, since the Muses love you so:</p>
          <p>" The Loves, ill omen ! sneezed on me, who dote <lb/>
            On lovely Myrtis, as on spring the goat. <lb/>
            Aratus, whom of men I love the best, <lb/>
            Loves a sweet girl. Aristis, minstrel blest, <lb/>
            And worthiest man, whom his own tripod near <lb/>
            Phœbus himself would not disdain to hear <lb/>
            Sing to the harp, knows that Aratus feels <lb/>
            This scorching flame. Pan !whose rich music peals <lb/>
            On Homolus, place in his longing arms <lb/>
            Of her own will the blushing bloom of charms. <lb/>
            So may the youth of Arcady forbear <lb/>
            With squills thy shoulders and thy side to tear, <lb/>
            When fails the chase. If thou wilt not, then weep, <lb/>
            By nails all mangled, and on nettles sleep ! <lb/>
            Where Hebrus flows, in frost-time of the year <lb/>
            Dwell on the mountains 'neath the polar bear; <lb/>
            In summer with swart Æthiop, at the pile <lb/>
            Of Blemyan rocks, beyond the springs of Nile ! <lb/>
            Ye loves ! from Hyetis and Byblis flown, <lb/>
            Who make Dione's lofty seat your own; <lb/>
            Ye loves ! that are to blushing apples like, <lb/>
            The blooming Phyllis with your arrows strike- <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            Strike her, because she pities not my friend; <lb/>
            Though softer than a pear, her bloom shall end: <lb/>
            Ah, Phyllis ! Phyllis ! now the bachelors say, <lb/>
            Behold thy flower of beauty drops away ! <lb/>
            Let us, my friend Aratus ! pace no more, <lb/>
            Nor keep our painful watch beside her door; <lb/>
            Let Chanticleer, that crows at dawn, behold <lb/>
            Some other lover there benumbed with cold : <lb/>
            Such watch be Molon's, and be his alone ; <lb/>
            But rest be ours-and eke a friendly crone, <lb/>
            Who may by spitting and by magic skill <lb/>
            Quick disenchant us from foreshadowed ill."</p>
          <p>Ended my song, he, smiling as before, <lb/>
            The friendly muse-gift gave-the crook he bore; <lb/>
            Then turning to the left pursued the way <lb/>
            To Pyxa; speeding, presently we lay, <lb/>
            Where Phrasidamus dwelt, on loosened sheaves <lb/>
            Of lentisk, and the vine's new-gathered leaves. <lb/>
            Near by, a fountain murmured from its bed, <lb/>
            A cavern of the Nymphs :elms overhead, <lb/>
            And poplars rustled; and the summer-keen <lb/>
            Cicadæ sung aloft amid the green ; <lb/>
            Afar the tree-frog in the thorn-bush cried; <lb/>
            Nor larks nor goldfinches their song denied ; <lb/>
            The yellow bees around the fountains flew; <lb/>
            And the lone turtle-dove was, heard to coo: <lb/>
            Of golden summer all was redolent, <lb/>
            And of brown autumn ; boughs with damsons bent, <lb/>
            We had ; and pears were scattered at our feet, <lb/>
            And by our side a heap of apples sweet. <lb/>
            A four-year cask was broached. Ye Nymphs excelling <lb/>
            Of Castaly, on high Parnassus dwelling, <lb/>
            Did ever Chiron in the Centaur's cave <lb/>
            Give draught so rich to Hercules the brave ? <lb/>
            Through Polypheme did such sweet nectar glance, <lb/>
            That made the shepherd of Anapus dance, <lb/>
            The huge rock-hurler—as the generous foam, <lb/>
            Which, Nymphs, ye tempered at that harvest-home ? <lb/>
            0 be it mine again her feast to keep, <lb/>
            And fix the fan in good Damater's heap ; <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            And may she sweetly smile, while spikes of corn <lb/>
            And up-torn poppies either hand adorn !</p>

            Not only I—thou, too, art woman-mad. <lb/>
            Their sweet notes thus, in turn, they did prolong; <lb/>

            Their share of milk,—I some for cheese may save.</p>
          <p>Then Daphnis next his tones preluding rung, <lb/>
            Gave to the music voice, and sweetly sung.</p>

          <p>As yesterday I drove my heifers by, <lb/>
            A girl, me spying from a cavern nigh, <lb/>
            Exclaimed, " How handsome !" I my way pursued <lb/>
            With down-cast eyes, nor made her answer rude. <lb/>
            Sweet is the breath of cows and calves-and sweet <lb/>
            To bask by running stream in summer heat. <lb/>
            Acorns the oak; and apples on the bough <lb/>
            Adorn the apple-tree ; her calf the cow; <lb/>
            His drove of kine, depasturing the field, <lb/>
            His proper honour to the cowherd yield.</p>
          <p>Th' admiring goatherd then his judgment spake: <lb/>
            Sweet is thy mouth, and sweetest tones awake <lb/>
            From thy lips, Daphnis ! I would rather hear <lb/>
            Thee sing, than suck the honeycomb, I swear. <lb/>
            Take thou the pipe, for thine the winning song. <lb/>
            If thou wilt teach me here my goats among <lb/>
            Some song, I will that hornless goat bestow, <lb/>
            That ever fills the pail to overflow.</p><pb n="234"/>
            
          <p>Glad Daphnis clapped his hands, and on the lawn <lb/>
            He leaped, as round her mother leaps the fawn. <lb/>
            But sad Menalcas fed a smouldering gloom, <lb/>
            As grieves a girl betrothed to unknown groom. <lb/>
            And first in song was Daphnis from that time, <lb/>
            And wived a Naiad in his blooming prime.</p>

            From the bluff crag. There stretched, no more I mind <lb/>

          <p>NICIAS ! there is no remedy for love, <lb/>
            Except the Muses; this alone doth prove <lb/>
            A sweet and gentle solace for the mind <lb/>
            Of love-sick man—not easy though to find. <lb/>
            Full knowledge of this truth I deem is thine, <lb/>
            Physician, and beloved of all the Nine !</p>
          <p>Thus, Polypheme of yore, our Cyclops, found <lb/>
            The power of song on love's uneasy wound ; <lb/>
            With the first down that budding youth discloses <lb/>
            On cheek and chin, he doted-not with roses <lb/>
            And apples for his love, and the trim curl <lb/>
            To please her eye, but with delirious whirl, <lb/>
            Neglecting all things else. Oft to the stall <lb/>
            His sheep from pasture came without his call, <lb/>
            While he from dawn mid sea-weeds and the spray <lb/>
            Of Galatea sung, and pined away, <lb/>
            By mighty Cypris wounded at the heart, <lb/>
            Who in his liver fixed her cruel dart. <lb/>
            He found the cure while from the cliff he flung <lb/>
            His glances seaward, and his ditty sung :—</p>
          <p>" Why, Galatea, scorn for love dost render ? <lb/>
            Whiter than fresh curds, than the lamb more tender; <lb/>
            More skittish than the calf, more clearly bright <lb/>
            Than unripe grape transparent in the light ! <lb/>
            Here dost thou show thyself when sleeps thy lover, <lb/>
            Still flying ever as my sleep is over, <lb/>
            E'en as the sheep, the gray wolf seeing, flees. <lb/>
            I loved when with my mother from the seas <lb/>
            Thou first didst come, and seek the mountain-side <lb/>
            To gather hyacinths—and I thy guide. <lb/>
            Since then I never yet have ceased to love thee, <lb/>
            Although my passion never yet did move thee.. <lb/>
            I know the reason why the beauty flies— <lb/>
            One shaggy eye-brow on my forehead lies <lb/>
            Over one eye, stretched out from tip to tip <lb/>
            Of either ear, and overhangs my lip <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            A nostril broad. Such as I am, I keep, <lb/>
            Drinking their best of milk, a thousand sheep; <lb/>
            My cheeses fail not in their hurdled row <lb/>
            In depth of winter nor in summer's glow. <lb/>
            No Cyclops here can breathe the pipe like me, <lb/>
            Who sing, when I should sleep, myself and thee, <lb/>
            Sweet-apple ! I for thee four bear-whelps rear, <lb/>
            And eke eleven fawns that collars wear. <lb/>
            Come live (thou shalt not fare the worse) with me, <lb/>
            And to its murmurs leave that azure sea. <lb/>
            Thy nights will sweeter pass within my cave, <lb/>
            Where the tall cypress and the laurel wave ; <lb/>
            The sweet-fruit vine and ivy dark are there ; <lb/>
            From the white snow its waters cool and clear <lb/>
            Thick-wooded AEtna sends : whom would it please <lb/>
            In sea to dwell, when land has joys like these ? <lb/>
            Though rough I seem in Galatea's eyes, <lb/>
            My wealth of oak a constant fire supplies ; <lb/>
            O fire of love ! I could be well content <lb/>
            That life and precious eye at once were brent. <lb/>
            Had I but fins ! then would I dive and kiss <lb/>
            Thy dainty hand, though daintier lip I miss ; <lb/>
            In different seasons take thee different flowers, <lb/>
            The summer lily white in summer hours, <lb/>
            And while it winter was, what winter bred, <lb/>
            The tender poppy with its pop-bells red. <lb/>
            From some sea-ranger I will learn to swim, <lb/>
            To see what charms you in your ocean dim. <lb/>
            Come, Galatea ! sparkling from the foam, <lb/>
            And then, like me, forget to turn thee home. <lb/>
            Would that the shepherd and his life could please- <lb/>
            To milk my ewes, with runnet fix the cheese. <lb/>
            My mother is in fault, and only she— <lb/>
            She never spake a friendly word for me ; <lb/>
            Although she sees me pining fast away, <lb/>
            Thinner and thinner still from day to day. <lb/>
            I'll tell her that my feet and temples throb, <lb/>
            That she, as I have done, with grief may sob. <lb/>
            O Cyclops ! Cyclops ! whither dost thou hover ? <lb/>
            To weave thy baskets would more wit'discover, <lb/>
            And get thy lambs green leaves. Milk the near ewe ; <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            Why one that faster flies in vain pursue ? <lb/>
            A fairer Galatea you may find; <lb/>
            Others are fair, and all are not unkind: <lb/>
            For many a damsel, when eve's shadow falls, <lb/>
            Me to sport with her fondly, sweetly calls ; <lb/>
            And all of them, with eyes that brightly glisten, <lb/>
            Giggle most merrily, whene'er I listen: <lb/>
            That I am somebody on earth is plain."</p>
          <p>Thus Polypheme with song relieved love's pain <lb/>
            And from his ails himself did safer free, <lb/>
            Than had he given a leech a golden fee.</p>

            For love who passion, wax old-in a day. <lb/>
            As much as apples sweet the damson crude <lb/>
            Excel; the bloomy spring the winter rude; <lb/>
            In fleece the sheep her lamb; the maid in sweetness <lb/>
            The thrice-wed dame; the fawn the calf in fleetness; <lb/>
            The nightingale in song all feathered kind- <lb/>
            So much thy longed-for presence cheers my mind. <lb/>

            The sun fierce blazes. May our love be strong, <lb/>
            To all hereafter times the theme of song ! <lb/>
            " Two men each other loved to that degree, <lb/>
            That either friend did in the other see <lb/>
            A dearer than himself. They lived of old, <lb/>
            Both golden natures in an age of gold."</p>
          <p>O father Zeus! ageless Immortals all! <lb/>
            Two hundred ages hence may one recall, <lb/>
            Down-coming to the irremeable river, <lb/>
            This to my mind, and this good news deliver: <lb/>
            " E'en now from east to west, from north to south, <lb/>
            Your mutual friendship lives in every mouth." <lb/>
            This, as they please, the Olympians will decide: <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            Of thee, by blooming virtue beautified, <lb/>
            My glowing song shall only truth disclose ; <lb/>
            With falsehood's pustules I'll not shame my nose. <lb/>
            If thou dost sometime grieve me, sweet the pleasure <lb/>
            Of reconcilement, joy in double measure <lb/>
            To find thou never didst intend the pain, <lb/>
            And feel myself from all doubt free again.</p>
          <p>And, ye Megarians, at Nisæa dwelling, <lb/>
            Expert at rowing, mariners excelling, <lb/>
            Be happy ever! for with honours due <lb/>
            Th' Athenian Diodes, to friendship true, <lb/>
            Ye celebrate. With the first blush of spring <lb/>
            The youth surround his tomb: there who shall bring <lb/>
            The sweetest kiss, whose lip is purest found, <lb/>
            Back to his mother goes with garlands crowned. <lb/>
            Nice touch the arbiter must have, indeed, <lb/>
            And must, methinks, the blue-eyed Ganymede <lb/>
            Invoke with many prayers-a mouth to own <lb/>
            True to the touch of lips, as Lydian stone <lb/>
            To proof of gold,-which test will instant show <lb/>
            The pure or base, as money-changers know.</p>

          <p>FRIEND! not for us alone was love designed, <lb/>
            Whoe'er his parent of immortal kind ; <lb/>
            Nor first to us fair seemeth fair to be, <lb/>
            Who mortal are, nor can the morrow see. <lb/>
            But e'en Amphitryon's brazen-hearted son, <lb/>
            Who stood the lion's rage, did dote upon <lb/>
            The curled and lovely Hylas—made his joy <lb/>
            To train him as a father would his boy, <lb/>
            And taught him all whereby himself became <lb/>
            A minstrel-praised inheritor of fame ; <lb/>
            Nor left him when the sun was in mid-air, <lb/>
            Or Morn to Jove's court drove her milk-white pair; <note type="footnote"> <unclear>P</unclear> </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            Or when the twittering chickens were betaking <lb/>
            Themselves to rest, her wings their mother shaking, <lb/>
            Perched on the smoky beam; that, trained to go <lb/>
            In the right track, he might a true man grow.</p>
          <p>When Jason sailed to find the golden fleece, <lb/>
            And in his train the choicest youth of Greece; <lb/>
            Then with the worthies from the cities round, <lb/>
            Came Hercules, for patient toil renowned, <lb/>
            And Hylas with him: from Iölcos they, <lb/>
            In the good Argo ploughed the watery way. <lb/>
            Touched not the ship the dark Cyanean rocks, <lb/>
            That justled evermore with crashing shocks, <lb/>
            But bounded through, and shot the swell o' the flood, <lb/>
            Like to an eagle, and in Phasis stood: <lb/>
            Thence either ridgy rock in station lies.</p>
          <p>But at what times the Pleiades arise: <lb/>
            When to the lamb the borders of the field <lb/>
            (The spring to summer turning) herbage yield ; <lb/>
            The flower of heroes minded then their sailing ; <lb/>
            And the third day, a steady south prevailing, <lb/>
            They reached the Hellespont; and in the bay <lb/>
            Of long Propontis hollow Argo lay : <lb/>
            Their oxen for Cianians dwelling there <lb/>
            The ploughshare in the broadening furrow wear. <lb/>
            They land at eve ; in pairs their mess they keep ; <lb/>
            And many strow a high and rushy heap: <lb/>
            A meadow broad convenient lay thereby, <lb/>
            With various rushes prankt abundantly. <lb/>
            And gold-tressed Hylas is for water gone <lb/>
            For Hercules and sturdy Telamon, <lb/>
            Who messmates were: a brazen urn he bore, <lb/>
            And soon perceived a fountain straight before. <lb/>
            It was a gentle slope, round which was seen <lb/>
            A multitude of rushes, parsley green, <lb/>
            And the close couch-grass, creeping to entwine <lb/>
            Green maiden-hair, and pale-blue celandine. <lb/>
            Their choir the wakeful Nymphs, the rustics' dread, <lb/>
            In the mid sparkle of the fountain led ; <lb/>
            Malis, and young Nychea looking spring, <lb/>
            And fresh Eunica. There the youth did bring, <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            And o'er the water hold his goodly urn, <lb/>
            Eager at once to dip it and return. <lb/>
            The Nymphs all clasped his hand; for love seized all, <lb/>
            Love for the Argive boy ; and he did fall <lb/>
            Plumping at once into the water dark, <lb/>
            As when a meteor glides with many a spark <lb/>
            Plumping from out the heavens into the seas- <lb/>
            And then some sailor cries, " A jolly breeze, <lb/>
            Up with the sail, boys !" Him upon their knees <lb/>
            The Nymphs soft held; him dropping many a tear <lb/>
            With soft enticing words they tried to cheer.</p>
          <p>Anxious Alcides lingered not to go, <lb/>
            Armed like a Scythian with his curved bow. <lb/>
            He grasped his club ; and thrice he threw around <lb/>
            His deep, deep voice at highest pitch of sound; <lb/>
            Thrice called on Hylas ; thrice did Hylas hear, <lb/>
            And from the fount a thin voice murmured near ; <lb/>
            Though very near, it very far appeared : <lb/>
            As when a lion, awful with his beard, <lb/>
            Hearing afar the whining of a fawn, <lb/>
            Speeds to his banquet from the mountain-lawn ; <lb/>
            In such wise. Hercules, the boy regretting, <lb/>
            Off at full speed through pathless brakes was setting. <lb/>
            Who love, much suffer : what fatigue he bore! <lb/>
            What thickets pierced ! what mountains clambered o'er i <lb/>
            What then to him was Jason's enterprise ?</p>
          <p>With sails aloft the ship all ready lies; <lb/>
            Midnight they sweep the decks and oft repeat, <lb/>
            " Where, where is Hercules ?" Where'er his feet <lb/>
            Convey him, there the frantic mourner hurries, <lb/>
            For a fierce god his liver tears and worries. <lb/>
            Fair Hylas thus is numbered with the blest: <lb/>
            Their friend, as ship-deserter, all the rest <lb/>
            Reproach ; while trudges be (and sad his case is) <lb/>

          <p>The Argive, I, and the Thessalian knight <lb/>
            Good Apis, and Cleunicus, brave in fight, <lb/>
            Were drinking at my farm. We had for fare <lb/>
            Two pullets and a sucking pig; and rare <lb/>
            Rich Biblian wine (near four years old) I drew, <lb/>
            And fragrant still, as from the wine-press new. <lb/>
            A Colchian onion gave the brewage zest; <lb/>
            As mirth with drink advanced, we thought it best <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            To quaff the wine's pure juice, each to his flame, <lb/>
            And every one was bound to tell her name. <lb/>
            So said, so done: we drank to them we loved: <lb/>
            But she, my she ! by all my love unmoved, <lb/>
            Said nothing, though I then and there named her. <lb/>
            Think what a tempest did my temper stir! <lb/>
            “Won’t speak?" I said : "or, as the wise man spoke, <lb/>
            Hast seen a wolf ? " another said in joke. <lb/>
            From her red burning face (it kindled so) <lb/>
            You might have lit a lamp. Lycus, you know, <lb/>
            Is name for wolf; and there is such an one, <lb/>
            Tall, delicate, my neighbour Laba's son ; <lb/>
            And many think him handsome : for this youth, <lb/>
            And his fine love my damsel pined in sooth. <lb/>
            I heard a whisper, nor I sifted it, <lb/>
            Having a man's beard without manly wit. <lb/>
            But Apis—we were at our cups again- <lb/>
            Sang out “ My Lycus !" a Thessalian strain. <lb/>
            Then sudden into tears Cynisca burst- <lb/>
            The girl of six years for the breast that nurst <lb/>
            Her tender infancy, not so much weeps. <lb/>
            You know me, how no bound my temper keeps ; <lb/>
            With doubled fist once and again I struck <lb/>
            Both of her cheeks. She thereat did up-tuck <lb/>
            Her skirts and quickly bolted through the door. <lb/>
            Do I not please thee ? hast a paramour <lb/>
            Nearer thy heart ? plague o' my life ! go, go ! <lb/>
            Hug him for whom your tears, like beads, thick flow. <lb/>
            As for her callow brood, that nested lies <lb/>
            Under the roof, the swallow swiftly flies <lb/>
            To bring them food, and flies for more again : <lb/>
            From her soft couch more swift she fled amain, <lb/>
            Through hall, court, gate, as fast as she was able: <lb/>
            " The bull into the wood," as runs the fable. <lb/>
            Add two to this, the eight and fiftieth day, <lb/>
            'Twill be two full months since she went away; <lb/>
            And since we parted, as a sign of woe, <lb/>
            My hair has, Thracian-like, been left to grow. <lb/>
            But only Lycus is her sole delight; <lb/>
            For him her door is open e'en at night. <lb/>
            But hapless I, with the Megarian lot, <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            Am held in none account, and quite forgot. <lb/>
            All would be well, could I my love restrain ; <lb/>
            But mice, they say, the taste of pitch retain. <lb/>
            I cannot cure myself, however I try ; <lb/>
            For hapless love I know no remedy; <lb/>
            Except that Simus sailed across the water, <lb/>
            When smitten with old Epichalcus' daughter, <lb/>
            And came back whole. I too will cross the wave, <lb/>

            What living man the poet will repay <lb/>
            With generous love for his ennobling lay ? <lb/>
            I know not: men no longer, as before, <lb/>
            Would live for good deeds in poetic lore; <lb/>
            But are overcome by detestable gain ; <lb/>
            Close-fisted, every one doth fast retain <lb/>
            His money, thinking how to make it grow, <lb/>
            Nor freely would the smallest mite bestow; <lb/>
            But says : " the knee is nearer than the shin ; <lb/>
            Some good be mine ! from gods bards honour win. <lb/>
            But who will hear another ? one will do-- <lb/>
            Homer, best poet, and the cheapest too-- <lb/>
            He costs me nothing." Fools ! what boots the gold <lb/>
            Hid within doors in heaps cannot be told ? <lb/>
            Not so the truly wise their wealth employ: <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            With some 'tis fit one's natural man to joy ; <lb/>
            Some to the bard should freely be assigned, <lb/>
            To kin—and many others of mankind. <lb/>
            The gods their offerings ; guests should have their dues, <lb/>
            Welcome to come and go whene'er they choose. <lb/>
            But most of all the generous mind prefers <lb/>
            The Muses' consecrate interpreters. <lb/>
            So may you live to fame, when life is done, <lb/>
            Nor mourn inglorious at cold Acheron, <lb/>
            Like one from birth to poverty betrayed, <lb/>
            Whose palms are horny from the painful spade. <lb/>
            To many a serf Antiochus the great, <lb/>
            To many king Aleuas in his state, <lb/>
            Measured the monthly dole. Much kine to see <lb/>
            Lowed at the full stalls of the Scopadæ. <lb/>
            Innumerous flocks to some cool green retreat <lb/>
            The shepherds drove, to screen them from the heat, <lb/>
            O'er Cranon's plain-choice flocks in choicest place, <lb/>
            The wealth of Creon's hospitable race. <lb/>
            No pleasure had been theirs these things about, <lb/>
            When once their sweet souls they had emptied out <lb/>
            Into the broad raft of drear Acheron ; <lb/>
            But they, sad with the thoughts of life foregone, <lb/>
            Had lain-their treasures left and memory hid— <lb/>
            Long ages lain the wretched dead amid, <lb/>
            Had not the glorious Ceian breathed the fire <lb/>
            Of his quick spirit to the stringed lyre, <lb/>
            And would not let them altogether die, <lb/>
            But made them famous to posterity : <lb/>
            And e'en their swift-foot steeds obtained renown, <lb/>
            Which in the sacred race-course won the crown. <lb/>
            Who would have known the noble Lycian pair- <lb/>
            The sons of Priam with their pomp of hair- <lb/>
            Or Cycnus, as a woman fair to ken, <lb/>
            Had no bard sung the wars of former men ? <lb/>
            Nor that Odysseus, who went wandering round, <lb/>
            Twice sixty moons, wherever man is found, <lb/>
            And, while alive, to farthest Hades sped, <lb/>
            And from the cavern of the Cyclops fled, <lb/>
            Had been aye famed; the keeper of the swine, <lb/>
            Eumæus, and the man the herded kine <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            Had in his watchful care, Philœtius, <lb/>
            And e'en Laertes the magnanimous, <lb/>
            Had been in a perpetual silence pent, <lb/>
            But for that old Ionian eloquent.</p>
          <p>The Muses best renown on men bestow: <lb/>
            The living waste the wealth of those below. <lb/>
            It were all one the waves to number o'er, <lb/>
            As many as wind and blue sea drive ashore, <lb/>
            Or wash with water from the spring's dark urn <lb/>
            The clay of unbaked brick, as try to turn <lb/>
            The money-lover from his wretched pelf- <lb/>
            But let us leave the miser to himself. <lb/>
            May countless pieces swell his silver store ! <lb/>
            And let him ever have a wish for more ! <lb/>
            But may I still prefer bright honour's meed, <lb/>
            And man's good will, to many a mule and steed!</p>
          <p>I am in quest of one whose willing mind <lb/>
            I may, by favour of the Muses, find. <lb/>
            Without the Jove-born sisters, harsh and hard <lb/>
            Are all approaches found by every bard. <lb/>
            Not weary yet revolving heaven appears <lb/>
            Of bringing round the months and circling years. <lb/>
            The car shall yet be moved by many a steed; <lb/>
            And me shall some one as a minstrel need ; <lb/>
            Than him more deeds heroic never wrought <lb/>
            Achilles, or stout Alas, when they fought, <lb/>
            Where in his tomb the Phrygian Ilus lies, <lb/>
            On the broad plain of mournful Simoeis. <lb/>
            Who, where the sun sets, dwell-on Libya's heel, <lb/>
            The bold Phœnicians shuddering terror feel ; <lb/>
            For Syracuse against them takes the field, <lb/>
            Each with his ready spear and willow shield. <lb/>
            Amidst them arms heroic Hieron, <lb/>
            Equal to heroes of the times foregone ; <lb/>
            Floats o'er his helm, in wavy darkness loose, <lb/>
            His horse-hair crest—Athene ! mightiest Zeus ! <lb/>
            And thou, who with thy mother reignest queen <lb/>
            O'er Ephyra the wealthy, where is seen <lb/>
            Lysimeleia's water, may the blow <lb/>

            And scatter them from our sweet island back <lb/>
            O'er the Sardonian ocean's yeasty track ; <lb/>
            And out of many, few return to tell <lb/>
            Their wives and children how the perished fell! <lb/>
            In the foe-ruined cities of the plain <lb/>
            Soon may their former dwellers live again, <lb/>
            And till the fruitful fields ! unnumbered sheep. <lb/>
            And fat, bleat cheerily ! the cattle creep <lb/>
            Herded in safety to the wonted stalls, <lb/>
            Warning the traveller that evening falls ! <lb/>
            For sowing-time be wrought the fallow lea, <lb/>
            When the cicada, sitting on his tree, <lb/>
            Watches the shepherds in the open day, <lb/>
            And blithely sings, perched on the topmost spray ; <lb/>
            O'er martial arms may spiders draw their train, <lb/>
            And of fierce war not e'en the name remain ; <lb/>
            And famous Hieron illustrious be, <lb/>
            By poets hymned, beyond the Scythian sea ; <lb/>

          <p>I am but one: but many others are <lb/>
            Dear to the Muses-may it be their care <lb/>
            To praise the warrior-king (as poets use), <lb/>

          <p>MusES ! begin and end the song with Zeus, <lb/>
            When of immortals we the chief extol: <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            Of men the name of Ptolemy produce <lb/>
            First, last, and midst-for he is chief of all. <lb/>
            For their exploits the seed heroical <lb/>
            Of demigods life-giving minstrels found : <lb/>
            I, skilled to sing, will Ptolemy install <lb/>
            Theme of my song-and glowing hymns redound <lb/>
            E'en to their praise, who dwell th' Olympian heights around.</p>
          <p>In Ida's thick of wood, perplexed with choice, <lb/>
            Which to begin with, the wood-cutter flings <lb/>
            His glance around : to what shall I give voice <lb/>
            First out of all the many blessed things, <lb/>
            With which the gods have graced the best of kings ? <lb/>
            How great the son of Lagus from his birth ! <lb/>
            Born for what deeds ! what great imaginings <lb/>
            His mind conceived beyond the sons of earth ! <lb/>
            Up to the gods by Zeus exalted for his worth !</p>
          <p>In Jove's own house his golden couch is spread, <lb/>
            And by him sits his friend in royal pride, <lb/>
            Great Alexander, the portentous dread <lb/>
            Of Persians glittering with the turban pied : <lb/>
            And Hercules, the vast Centauricide, <lb/>
            Sits opposite on adamantine throne ; <lb/>
            There with the gods he banquets gratified, <lb/>
            In his sons' sons rejoicing as his own, <lb/>
            Made free of age by Zeus, and as immortals known.</p>
          <p>For from heroic Hercules the twain <lb/>
            Descended : therefore when he goes content <lb/>
            From the gods'.banquet to his wife again, <lb/>
            Sated with nectar of a fragrant scent, <lb/>
            To one his quiver and his bow unbent <lb/>
            Ever he hands, and to that other blest <lb/>
            His iron-shotted club, with knobs besprent ; <lb/>
            And so they marshal him unto his rest <lb/>

            Dionis wiped her fingers on the spicy <lb/>
            Swell of her bosom. No man in such measure <lb/>
            E'er loved his wife, as Ptolemy's best leisure <note type="footnote"> s </note> <lb/>

            Doted on her ; and she with him contended <lb/>
            In love—yea ! loved him more : his house and treasure <lb/>
            Thus to his sons he with full trust commended, <lb/>
            Since, loving, he the couch of loving wife ascended.</p>
          <p>Some stranger draws the wanton's fancy flighty— <lb/>
            Her children many, like the father none ! <lb/>
            Loveliest of goddesses ! bright Aphrodite ! <lb/>
            Through thee, the way of wailful Acheron <lb/>
            Was ne'er by lovely Berenice gone : <lb/>
            Her, thy sweet care, from the Cyanean river, <lb/>
            And death's grim ferryman, the gloomy one ! <lb/>
            Thou didst, soft-placing in thy fane, deliver, <lb/>
            And a conceded share of thine own honours give her.</p>
          <p>Soft loves on mortal kind she breathes benign, <lb/>
            And makes his love-care light to every lover. <lb/>
            Thou, who in Argos didst with Tydeus twine, <lb/>
            Dark brows thy gentle eye-lids arching over, <lb/>
            Didst Diomede to light of day discover ; <lb/>
            To Peleus the full-bosomed Thetis bore <lb/>
            Achilles; thee, (for there the birth-pang drove her <lb/>
            The aid of Eileithuia to implore,) <lb/>
            Bright Berenice brought forth on the Coan shore:</p>
          <p>The Woman-helper stood benignant by, <lb/>
            Her limbs from pain composing, till she smiled <lb/>
            On thee new-born to warrior Ptolemy— <lb/>
            And like his father was the lovely child. <lb/>
            Exulting Cos, with jubilant rapture wild, <lb/>
            Fondled the babe, loud-hymning at the sight: — <lb/>
            " Boy ! be thou blest; for me be honours piled <lb/>
            On thy account, such as the Delian bright <lb/>
            Hung round the blue-crowned isle, on which he sprung to <lb/>
            light.</p>
          <p>“From thee to Triop's hill such honour follow, <lb/>
            And no less to the Dorians dwelling nigh, <lb/>
            As his Rhenæa had from King Apollo ! " <lb/>
            Thus Cos: the bird of Zeus, up-poised on high, <lb/>
            Under the clouds, well-omened thrice did cry: <lb/>
            From king-protecting Zeus the sign was sent; <lb/>
            But when from birth he marks a royalty, <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            That king surpassingly is excellent <lb/>
            For wealth, wide rule by sea and o'er much continent.</p>
          <p>In many a region many a tribe doth till <lb/>
            The fields, made fruitful by the shower of Zeus ; <lb/>
            None like low-lying Egypt doth fulfil <lb/>
            Hope of increase, when Nile the clod doth loose, <lb/>
            O'er-bubbling the wet soil: no land doth use <lb/>
            So many workmen of all sorts, enrolled <lb/>
            In cities of such multitude profuse, <lb/>
            More than three myriads, as a single fold <lb/>
            Under the watchful sway of Ptolemy the bold.</p>
          <p>Part of Phoenicia ; some Arabian lands ; <lb/>
            Some Syrian ; tribes of swart Æthiopes ; <lb/>
            All the Pamphylians, Lycians he commands, <lb/>
            And warlike Carians ; o'er the Cyclades <lb/>

            Ocean and rivers, earth within her bounds <lb/>
            Obeys him : and a host of chivalries, <lb/>
            And shielded infantry, with martial sounds <lb/>
            Of their far-glittering brass, the warrior-king surrounds,</p>
          <p>His wealth, that daily flows from every side, <lb/>
            The treasure of all other kings outweighs ; <lb/>
            His busy people's days in quiet glide: <lb/>
            The monster-breeding Nile no hostile blaze <lb/>
            Doth overpass, the war-shout there to raise. <lb/>
            Nor hath armed foeman from swift ship outleapt <lb/>
            To seize the kine Egyptian pastures graze ; <lb/>
            For o'er the broad lands of that happy sept <lb/>
            The bright-haired Ptolemy strict ward hath ever kept.</p>
          <p>His whole inheritance he cares to keep, <lb/>
            As a good king : himself hath garnered more: <lb/>
            Nor useless in his house the golden heap, <lb/>
            Increased like that of ants; for of his store <lb/>
            The gods have much, since them he doth adore <lb/>
            Ever with first-fruits, and his love commends <lb/>
            With other gifts ; his bounty ne'er is poor; <lb/>
            To noble-minded princes much he sends, <lb/>
            ,And gives to cities much, and much to worthy friends. <note type="footnote"> s 2 </note> <lb/>

            None in the sacred games e'er took a part, <lb/>
            Skilled the melodious song to modulate, <lb/>
            Without a royal recompense of art: <lb/>
            Whence Ptolemy the muse-priests celebrate <lb/>
            For his munificence. What meed more great <lb/>
            Than good renown can wealthy man befall ? <lb/>
            This meed doth on the dead Atridæ wait; <lb/>
            Their infinite spoil from Priam's ravaged hall <lb/>
            In the thick gloom lies hid, from whence is no recall.</p>
          <p>Only this prince hath in his fathers' ways <lb/>
            Exactly walked, and doth their stamp retain ; <lb/>
            Whence he to both his parents loved to raise <lb/>
            Temples, and placed their statues in each fane, <lb/>
            Of gold and ivory-never sought in vain <lb/>

            Himself and consort-one more furnished <lb/>

          <p>Such were the nuptials of the royal pair, <lb/>
            Whom Rhea bore, the royalties divine <lb/>
            Of blest Olympus : Iris spread with care, <lb/>
            Iris the virgin yet, whose fingers shine <lb/>
            With fragrant brightness, when they would recline <lb/>
            The marriage couch. Hail, Ptolemy ! to thee <lb/>
            And other demigods I will assign <lb/>
            Due praise. One word for after-men ; to me <lb/>

            Jove's daughter, peerless beauty-bud of Greece, <lb/>
            Now lies with thee beneath one broidered fleece. <lb/>
            What offspring to thy hopes will she prefer- <lb/>
            Could her dear offspring but resemble her ! <lb/>
            Where flows Eurotas in his pleasant place, <lb/>
            Thrice eighty virgins, we pursued the race, <lb/>
            Like men, anointed with the glistering oil, <lb/>
            A bloom of maiden buds—love's blushing spoil: <lb/>
            Of equal years ; but, seen by Helen's side, <lb/>
            Not one in whom some blemish was not spied. <lb/>
            As rising Morn, oh, venerable Night ! <lb/>
            Shows from thy bosom dark her face of light ; <lb/>
            As the clear spring, when winter's gloom is gone, <lb/>
            So mid our throng the golden Helen shone. <lb/>
            As of a field or garden ornament, <lb/>
            The lofty cypress shoots up eminent; <lb/>
            As of the chariot the Thessalian steed, <lb/>
            So rosy Helen of the Spartan breed <lb/>
            Is ornament and grace. Like Helen none <lb/>
            Draws the fine thread around the spindle spun, <lb/>
            And in the ready basket piles so much ; <lb/>
            None interlaces with so quick a touch <lb/>
            The woof and warp ; for other never came <lb/>
            A web so perfect from the broidering frame. <lb/>
            Like Helen none the cithern knows to ring, <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            Of Artemis or tall Athene sing, <lb/>
            Like Helen, in whose liquid-shining eyes <lb/>
            Desire, the light of love, dissolving lies. <lb/>
            O fair and lovely girl! a matron now- <lb/>
            Where meadow-flowers in dewy brightness grow, <lb/>
            We'll hie with early dawn, and fondly pull <lb/>
            Sweets to twine garlands for our beautiful ; <lb/>
            Remembering Helen with our fond regrets, <lb/>
            As for the absent ewe her suckling frets. <lb/>
            Of lotuses we'll hang thee many a wreath <lb/>
            Upon the shady plane, and drop beneath <lb/>
            Oil from the silver pyx ; and on the bark, <lb/>
            In Doric, shall be graved for all to mark, <lb/>
            “To me pay honour—I am Helen's tree." <lb/>
            Hail, bride ! high-wedded bridegroom, hail to thee! <lb/>
            Fruitful Latona fruit of marriage give ; <lb/>
            Cypris in bonds of mutual love to live; <lb/>
            And Zeus the wealth that shall without an end <lb/>
            From high-born sire to high-born son descend! <lb/>
            Sleep, happy pair ! in love enjoy your rest, <lb/>
            Breathing desire into each other's breast. <lb/>
            But wake at dawn ; for we'll present us here <lb/>
            At the first call of crested chanticleer. <lb/>
            Hymen, 0 Hymenaean ! joyful spread <lb/>

          <p>EUNICA, smiling with a bitter scoff, <lb/>
            When I would sweetly kiss her, bade me " off ! <lb/>
            Fool cowherd ! would you kiss me ? not to kiss <lb/>
            Rude clowns, but city lips, I've learnt, I wis. <lb/>
            You never, man ! shall kiss my lovely mouth- <lb/>
            Not in a dream. You are—O how uncouth ! <lb/>
            Your look offends me, and your speech provokes; <lb/>
            Your play is horse-play ; vulgar are your jokes. <lb/>
            How smooth in speech ! how delicate an air ! <lb/>
            How soft your beard ! how odorous your hair ! <lb/>
            Your lips are sickly ; and your hands are black, <lb/>
            And you smell rank: don't foul me; back, clown, back!</p>
          <p>Thrice on her breast she spat, these hard words saying, <lb/>
            Me scornfully from head to foot surveying; <lb/>
            Pouting and muttering proudly looked askaunt, <lb/>
            Before mine eyes did plume her form and flaunt, <lb/>
            And mocking smiled with lips drawn far apart. <lb/>
            My blood boiled fiercely from my grief of heart, <lb/>
            And red my cheeks from passionate anguish grew, <lb/>
            As vernal roses from the morning dew. <lb/>
            She left me then : but angry feelings glow <lb/>
            Within my heart, because she used me so.</p>
          <p>Am I not handsome, shepherds ? tell me truly; <lb/>
            Or has some god transformed my person newly ? <lb/>
            For as lush ivy clips the stem o' the tree, <lb/>
            The bloom of beauty lately covered me. <lb/>
            My curls, like parsley, round my temples clung ; <lb/>
            A shining forehead my dark brows o'erhung; <lb/>
            My eyes were bluer than Athene's own ; <lb/>
            My mouth than new cheese sweeter ; every tone <lb/>
            Sweeter than honeycombs: and sweet I take <lb/>
            My song to be; the sweetest sounds I wake <lb/>
            From all wind instruments, in very deed- <lb/>
            Straight pipe or transverse, flute or vocal reed. <lb/>
            The girls upon the hills me handsome call; <lb/>

            But ah ! my city-madam never kist me ; <lb/>

            That Dionysus in the valleys green <lb/>
            Once tended kine, she never heard, I ween ; <lb/>
            Nor knows that Cypris on a cowherd doted, <lb/>
            And on the Phrygian hills herself devoted <lb/>
            To tend his herd; nor how the same Dionis <lb/>
            In thickets kist, in thickets wept Adonis. <lb/>
            Who was Endymion ? him tending kine <lb/>
            Stooped down to kiss Selena the divine, <lb/>
            Who from Olympus to the Latmian grove <lb/>
            Glided to slumber with her mortal love. <lb/>
            Didst thou not, Rhea, for a cowherd weep ? <lb/>
            And didst thou not, high Zeus ! the heaven sweep, <lb/>
            In form of winged bird, and watch indeed <lb/>
            To carry off the cowherd Ganymede ? <lb/>
            Only Eunica (daintier she must be <lb/>
            Than were Selena, Cypris, Cybele,) <lb/>
            Won't kiss a cowherd. May'st thou ne'er uncover <lb/>
            Thyself, self-worshipt Beauty! to a lover <lb/>
            In town or country ; but, vain poppet! ever <lb/>

          <p>THE nurse of industry and arts is want; <lb/>
            Care breaks the labourer's sleep, my Diophant! <lb/>
            And should sweet slumber o'er his eyelids creep, <lb/>
            Dark cares stand over him, and startle sleep.</p>
          <p>Two fishers old lay in their wattled shed, <lb/>
            Close to the wicker on one sea-moss bed; <lb/>
            Near them the tools wherewith they plied their craft, <lb/>
            The basket, rush-trap, line, and reedy shaft, <lb/>
            Weed-tangled baits, a drag-net with its drops, <lb/>

            And this was all their wealth. They were not richer <lb/>

            All else seemed vanity: they could not mend <lb/>
            Their poverty-which was their only friend. <lb/>
            They had no neighbours ; but upon the shore <lb/>
            The sea soft murmured at their cottage door. <lb/>
            The chariot of the moon was midway only, <lb/>
            When thoughts of toil awoke those fishers lonely: <lb/>

          <p>When yester-eve I slept, outwearied quite <lb/>
            With the sea-toil, not over-fed, for our <lb/>
            Commons, you know, were short at feeding hour, <lb/>
            I saw myself upon a rock, where I <lb/>
            Sat watching for the fish—so eagerly ! <lb/>
            And from the reed the tripping bait did shake, <lb/>
            Till a fat fellow took it-no mistake : <lb/>
            ('Twas natural-like that I should dream of fish, <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            As hounds of meat upon a greasy dish :) <lb/>
            He hugged the hook, and then his blood did flow; <lb/>
            His plunges bent my reed like any bow ; <lb/>
            I stretched both arms, and had a pretty bout, <lb/>
            To take with hook so weak a fish so stout. <lb/>
            I gently warned him of the wound he bore ; <lb/>
            " Ha ! will you prick me ? you'll be pricked much more.” <lb/>
            But when he struggled not, I drew him in; <lb/>
            The contest then I saw myself did win. <lb/>
            I landed him, a fish compact of gold ! <lb/>
            But then a sudden fear my mind did hold, <lb/>
            Lest king Poseidon made it his delight, <lb/>
            Or it was Amphitrite's favourite. <lb/>
            I loosed him gently from the hook, for fear <lb/>
            It from his mouth some precious gold might tear, <lb/>
            And with my line I safely towed him home, <lb/>
            And swore that I on sea no more would roam, <lb/>
            But ever after would remain on land, <lb/>
            And there my gold, like any king, command. <lb/>
            At this I woke; your wits, good friend, awaken, <lb/>

            But now no longer slumber : up, awake ! <lb/>
            And for a false a real vision take. <lb/>
            Hunt for the foodful fish that is, not seems ; <lb/>

            For you, nor want I yours." “Pray, let me learn, <lb/>
            Wilt let me drink from out this fountain urn ?" <lb/>

          <p>" In pugilistic fight, nor spare your skill." <lb/>
            - " Who is my gauntlet-armed antagonist ? " <lb/>
            " At hand ! he's here ; you see him if you will, <lb/>
            I, Amycus, the famous pugilist." <lb/>
            " And what the prize of the victorious fist ? " <lb/>
            " The vanquished shall become the victor's thrall." <lb/>
            " Red-crested cocks so fight, and so desist." <lb/>
            " Cock-like or lion-like the combat call; <lb/>
            This is the prize for which we fight, or none at all."</p>
          <p>Then on a conch he blew a mighty blast: <lb/>
            The long-haired Bebryces, hearing the sound, <lb/>
            Under the shady planes assembled fast; <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            And likewise Castor, in the fight renowned, <lb/>
            Hastened and called his comrades to the ground, <lb/>
            From the Magnesian ship. With gauntlets both <lb/>
            Armed their strong hands ; their wrists and arms they <lb/>
            bound <lb/>
            With the long thongs; with one another wroth, <lb/>
            Each breathing blood and death, they stood up nothing loth.</p>
          <p>First'each contended which should get the sun <lb/>
            Of his antagonist; but much in sleight <lb/>
            That huge man, Pollux! was by thee outdone; <lb/>
            And Amycus was dazzled with the light; <lb/>
            But raging rushed straight forward to the fight, <lb/>
            Aiming fierce blows ; but wary Pollux met him, <lb/>
            Striking the chin of his vast opposite, <lb/>
            Who fiercer battled, for the blow did fret him, <lb/>
            And leaning forward tried unto the ground to get him.</p>
          <p>Shouted the Bebryces ; and, for they feared <lb/>
            The man like Tityus might their friend down-weigh <lb/>
            In the scant place, the heroes Pollux cheered: <lb/>
            But shifting here and there Jove's son made play, <lb/>
            And struck out right and left, but kept away <lb/>
            From the fierce rush of Neptune's son uncouth, <lb/>
            Who, drunk with blows, reeled in the hot affray, <lb/>
            Out-spitting purple blood; the princely youth <lb/>
            Shouted, when they beheld his battered jaws and mouth.</p>
          <p>His eyes were nearly closed from the contusion <lb/>
            Of his swoln face ; the prince amazed him more <lb/>
            With many feints, and seeing his confusion, <lb/>
            Mid-front he struck a heavy blow and sore, <lb/>
            And to the bone his forehead gashing tore; <lb/>
            Instant he fell, and at his length he lay <lb/>
            On the green leaves ; but fiercely as before, <lb/>
            On his uprising, they renewed the fray, <lb/>
            Aiming terrific blows, as with intent to slay.</p>
          <p>But the Bebrycian champion strove to place <lb/>
            His blows upon the broad breast of his foe, <lb/>
            Who ceaselessly disfigured all his face: <lb/>
            His flesh with sweating shrunk, that he did show, <lb/>
            From huge, but small; but larger seemed to grow <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            The limbs of Pollux, and of fresher hue <lb/>
            The more he toiled: Muse ! for 'tis thine to know, <lb/>
            And mine to give interpretation true. <lb/>
            Tell how the son of Zeus that mighty bulk o’verthrew.</p>
          <p>Aiming at something great, the big Bebrycian <lb/>
            The left of Pollux with his left hand caught, <lb/>
            Obliquely leaning out from his position, <lb/>
            And from his flank his huge right hand he brought, <lb/>
            And had he hit him would have surely wrought <lb/>
            Pollux much damage; but escape he found, <lb/>
            Stooping his head, and smote him, quick as thought, <lb/>
            On the left temple; from the gaping wound <lb/>
            A bubbling gush of gore out-spurted on the ground.</p>
          <p>Right on his mouth his left hand then he dashed; <lb/>
            Rattled his teeth ; and with a quicker hail <lb/>
            Of blows he smote him, till his cheeks he smashed: <lb/>
            Stretched out he lay; his senses all did fail, <lb/>
            Save that he owned the other did prevail <lb/>
            By holding up his hands: nor thou didst claim <lb/>
            The forfeit, Pollux, taking of him bail <lb/>
            Of a great oath in his own father's name, <lb/>
            Strangers to harm no more with word or deed of shame.</p>
          <p>To Castor now belongs my votive strain, <lb/>
            The brass-mailed, shake-spear knight. The twins of Zeus, <lb/>
            It chanced, had carried off the daughters twain <lb/>
            Of old Leucippus; wroth for which abuse, <lb/>
            The two bold brothers, sons of Aphareus, <lb/>
            Pursued the ravishers incontinent- <lb/>
            Their plighted bridegrooms, Idas and Lynceus. <lb/>
            They overtook them at the monument <lb/>
            Of the dead Aphareus, as on their way they went.</p>
          <p>With shields and spears all from their chariots leapt, <lb/>
            And Lynceus through his helmet loudly spoke: <lb/>
            " Why not let brides be by their bridegrooms kept ? <lb/>
            Why with your drawn swords, ready for the stroke, <lb/>
            Do you so eagerly the fight provoke ? <lb/>
            To us their sire betrothed them, and did swear <lb/>
            An oath thereto-which oath he only broke <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            Persuaded by your gifts, (foul shame to hear <lb/>
            In case of others' brides,) kine, mules, and divers gear.</p>
          <p>" Oft have I said, although no speechifier, <lb/>
            Before you both ; my friends ! it is not right <lb/>
            Princes for wives those maidens should desire, <lb/>
            Whose bridegrooms wait them and the nuptial night; <lb/>
            Sparta, sweet Arcady with fleeces white, <lb/>
            Equestrian Elis, famous Argolis, <lb/>
            The Achæan towns, Messenia's ample site, <lb/>
            And all the shore-reach of rich Sisyphis, <lb/>
            Are all of great extent with choice of maids, I wis.</p>
          <p>" And you may pick and choose at will of these, <lb/>
            Who are in mind, form, feature, excellent; <lb/>
            Good men for sons-in-law most fathers please, <lb/>
            And you 'mid heroes are pre-eminent, <lb/>
            On either side ennobled by descent. <lb/>
            Come, let our nuptials to their end proceed ; <lb/>
            We'll find brides for you to your heart's content: <lb/>
            The wind to wave swept off my useless rede ; <lb/>
            might as well have preached unto the winds indeed.</p>
          <p>" You are ungentle in your wilful mood ; <lb/>
            Be now persuaded for your own behoof; <lb/>
            Though we are cousins-if it seems you good <lb/>
            This strife to finish by the battle-proof, <lb/>
            Let Idas and brave Pollux stand aloof, <lb/>
            While Castor and myself, the younger, try <lb/>
            The battle; thus to the parental roof <lb/>
            We shall not leave an utter misery- <lb/>
            One death is quite enough for one sad family.</p>
          <p>" Those who survive shall gladden all their friends, <lb/>
            (Bridegrooms, not corses,) and these virgins wed: <lb/>
            Good is small ill that great contention ends." <lb/>
            And Providence fulfilled the words he said. <lb/>
            That elder pair their arms deposited; <lb/>
            But Lynceus shook, under his shield's broad rest, <lb/>
            His quivering lance, and Castor likewise sped <lb/>
            To meet him : to the conflict fierce they prest; <lb/>
            On either martial head nodded the horse-hair crest. <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            First with their spears they aimed full many a blow, <lb/>
            Where'er an exposed part came into sight, <lb/>
            But ere they injured one another so, <lb/>
            The spear-heads broke in either broad shield pight: <lb/>
            Then from the sheaths they drew their swords outright, <lb/>
            And fiercely on the other either prest, <lb/>
            Nor paused a moment in the furious fight; <lb/>
            And each at shield or helm their blows addrest, <lb/>
            3ut quick-eyed Lynceus maimed-only the purple crest.</p>
          <p>At Castor's left knee then he fiercely strook, <lb/>
            Who, 'scaping, smote the threatening hand away; <lb/>
            He, running, to his father's tomb betook <lb/>
            Himself, dropping the hand : there Idas lay <lb/>
            Watching the cousins ply the bloody fray; <lb/>
            But eager Castor drove his thirsty sword <lb/>
            Through flank and navel; out-gushed to the day <lb/>
            His bowels, where out-spread he lay begored ; <lb/>
            And down his eyelids dim the heavy sleep was poured.</p>
          <p>Nor was it fated that his mother dear <lb/>
            Should see the other wed to her content; <lb/>
            For Idas at that hapless sight did tear <lb/>
            A pillar from his father's monument, <lb/>
            To slay his brother's slayer; but Zeus sent, <lb/>
            In aid of Castor, his devouring fire, <lb/>
            Made drop the marble, and himself up'-brent. <lb/>
            So they did to none easy task aspire, <lb/>
            Who fought those mighty ones-the sons of mighty sire.</p>
          <p>Hail, sons of Leda ! give my hymns renown : <lb/>
            To you and Helen, dear the minstrel's claim, <lb/>
            And dear to all who threw proud Ilion down. <lb/>

            Hymning the song : may mine be free from blame! <lb/>
            I give you what to me the Muses gave; <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE LOVER ; OR LOVE-SICK.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A YOUTH was love-sick for a maid unkind, <lb/>
            Whose form was blameless, but not so her mind. <lb/>
            She scorned her lover and his suit disdained; <lb/>
            One gentle thought she never entertained. <lb/>
            She knew not Love-what sort of god, what darts <lb/>
            From what a bow he shoots at youthful hearts ! <lb/>
            Her lips were strangers to soft gentleness, <lb/>
            And she was difficult of all access. <lb/>
            She had no word to soothe his scorching fire, <lb/>
            No sparkle of the lip ; no moist desire <lb/>
            To her bright eyes a dewy lustre lent; <lb/>
            Blushed on her cheek no crimson of consent; <lb/>
            She breathed no word of sighing born-no kiss <lb/>
            That lightens love, and turns its pain to bliss. <lb/>
            But, as the wild game from his thicket spies <lb/>
            The train of hunters with suspicious eyes, <lb/>
            So she her lover ; ever did she turn <lb/>
            Toward him scornful lip, and eye-glance stern. <lb/>
            She was his fate: and on her glooming face, <lb/>
            The scorn that burned within her left its trace. <lb/>
            Her colour fled; and every feature showed <lb/>
            Pale from the rage that in her bosom glowed. <lb/>
            Yet even so she was - how fair to see! <lb/>
            The more she scorned him, still the more loved he. <lb/>
            At last by Cypris scorched without her cure, <lb/>
            He could no more the raging flame endure. <lb/>
            He went and kist her door, and tears he shed, <lb/>
            And, 'midst his tears and kisses, sadly said:­</p>
          <p>" Harsh, cruel girl! stone-heart and pitiless! <lb/>
            The nurseling of some savage lioness, <lb/>
            Unworthy love! my latest gift I bring, <lb/>
            This noose-no more will I thine anger sting. <lb/>
            But now I go where thou hast sentenced me— <lb/>
            The common road which all reports agree <lb/>
            Must at some time by all that live be gone, <lb/>
            And where love's cure is found-Oblivion. <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            Ah ! could I drink it all, I should not slake <lb/>
            My passionate longing: at thy gates I take <lb/>
            My last farewell, thereto commit indeed <lb/>
            My latest sigh. The future I can read- <lb/>
            The rose is beautiful, the rose of prime, <lb/>
            But soon it withers at the touch of time; <lb/>
            And beautiful in spring-time to behold <lb/>
            The violet, but ah ! it soon grows old; <lb/>
            White are the lilies, but they soon decay; <lb/>
            White is the snow, but soon it melts away; <lb/>
            And beautiful the bloom of virgin youth, <lb/>
            But lives a very little time in sooth. <lb/>
            Thy time will come-thou too at last shalt prove, <lb/>
            And weep most bitterly, the flames of love. <lb/>
            But grant, I pray thee, grant my latest prayer: <lb/>
            When thou shalt see me hanging high in air, <lb/>
            E'en at thy door—O pass not heedless by ! <lb/>
            But drop a few tears to my memory. <lb/>
            From the harsh thong unloose thy hapless lover, <lb/>
            And from thy limbs a garment take and cover <lb/>
            The lifeless body, and the last kiss give ; <lb/>
            Fear not that haply I may come alive <lb/>
            At thy lip's touch—I cannot live again ; <lb/>
            Thy kiss, if given in love, were given in vain ! <lb/>
            Hollow a mound to hide my love's sad end, <lb/>
            And thrice on leaving, cry, 'Here lie, my friend <lb/>
            And, if thou wilt, by thee this word be said, <lb/>
            ‘Here lies my love, my beautiful is dead.' <lb/>
            And let this epitaph mine end recall, <lb/>
            Just at the last I scratch it on thy wall: <lb/>
            ‘Love slew him : stop and say,- Who here is laid <lb/>
            Well but not wisely loved a cruel maid.' " <lb/>
            Then in the doorway for its cruel use <lb/>
            He set a stone; he fitted next the noose ; <lb/>
            Put in his neck, and eagerly he sped, <lb/>
            Spurning the stone away-and swung there dead. <lb/>
            But when she saw the corse her doorway kept, <lb/>
            She was not moved in spirit, nor she wept: <lb/>
            She felt no ruth, but, scornful to the last, <lb/>
            She spat upon the body, as she past; <lb/>
            And careless went to bathe her and adorn, <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            Where stood a statue of the god, her scorn. <lb/>
            From the bath's marble edge whereon it stood, <lb/>
            The statue leapt and slew her: with her blood <lb/>
            The water was impurpled, and the sound <lb/>
            Of the girl's dying accent swam around :— <lb/>
            " Ah lovers ! she that scorned true love is slain ; <lb/>
            Love is revengeful: when loved, love again."</p>

          </ab>
          <p>ALCMENA having washed her twin delight, <lb/>
            Her Hercules, who then was ten months old, <lb/>
            And her Iphicles, younger by a night, <lb/>
            Gave them the breast, then laid them in the hold <lb/>
            Of a brass shield won by Amphitryon bold- <lb/>
            The spoil of Pterelas in battle slain; <lb/>
            And, touching either head, her blessing told : <lb/>
            “Sleep, healthful sleep enjoy my blessed twain ; <lb/>
            Sleep happy ! happy wake at coming dawn again."</p>
          <p>And with these words she rocked the mighty shield, <lb/>
            And sleep came over them: in the midnight, <lb/>
            What time the Bear, watching Orion's field, <lb/>
            (Who then his shoulder shows uprising bright,) <lb/>
            To setting turns, vex'd Hera's wily spite, <lb/>
            With many threats of her revengeful ire, <lb/>
            To eat the infant Hercules outright, <lb/>
            Sent to the chamber-door two monsters dire, <lb/>
            Each bristling horribly with his dark-gleaming spire.</p>
          <p>They their blood-gorging bellies on the ground <lb/>
            Uncoiling rolled ; their eyes shot baleful flame, <lb/>
            And evermore they spat their poison round; <lb/>
            But when, quick brandishing with evil aim <lb/>
            Their forked tongues, they to the children came, <lb/>
            They both awoke : (what can escape Jove's eye ?) <lb/>
            Light in the chamber shone ; and who can blame <lb/>
            Or wonder that Iphicles did outcry, <lb/>
            Screaming, when he did their remorseless teeth espy ? <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            He kicked aside the woollen coverlet, <lb/>
            Struggling to flee ; but Hercules comprest, <lb/>
            Relaxing not the gripe his hand did get, <lb/>
            With a firm grasp the throat of either pest, <lb/>
            Where is their poison, which e'en gods detest. <lb/>
            The boy, that in the birth was long confined, <lb/>
            Who ne'er was known to cry, though at the breast <lb/>
            A suckling yet, they with their coils entwined : <lb/>
            Infolding him they strained their own release to find,</p>
          <p>Till wearied in their spines they loosed their fold. <lb/>
            Alcmena heard the noise and woke in fear :— <lb/>
            " Amphitryon, up ! for me strange fear doth hold- <lb/>
            Up ! up ! don't wait for sandals ; don't you hear <lb/>
            Iphicles screaming ? see ! the walls appear <lb/>
            Distinctly shining in the dead of night, <lb/>
            As though 'twere dawn. There is some danger near ; <lb/>
            I'm sure there is, dear man !" He then outright <lb/>
            Did leap from off the bed to hush his wife's affright.</p>
          <p>And hastily his costly sword he sought; <lb/>
            Suspended near his cedar-bed it hung ; <lb/>
            With one hand raised the sheath of lotus wrought, <lb/>
            While with the other he the belt unswung. <lb/>
            The room was filled with night again : he sprung, <lb/>
            And for his household, breathing slumber deep, <lb/>
            He loudly called ; his voice loud echoing rung : <lb/>
            " Ho! from the hearth bring lights ! quick ! do not <lb/>
            creep ! <lb/>
            Fling wide the doors-awake ! this is no time for sleep."</p>
          <p>They hastened all with lights at his command ; <lb/>
            But when they saw (their eyes they well might doubt) <lb/>
            A serpent clutched in either tender hand <lb/>
            Of suckling Hercules, they gave a shout, <lb/>
            And clapped their hands : he instantly held out <lb/>
            The serpents to Amphitryon, and wild <lb/>
            With child-like exultation leaped about, <lb/>
            And laid them at his father's feet and smiled- <lb/>
            Laid down those monsters grim, in sleep of death now mild.</p>
          <p>Alcmena to her fragrant bosom drew <lb/>
            Iphicles screaming and with fear half-dead ; <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            The lamb-wool coverlet Amphitryon threw <lb/>
            O'er Hercules and went again to bed.</p>
          <p>The cocks, the third time crowing, heralded <lb/>
            The day-dawn: then Alcmena sent to call <lb/>
            Tiresias the seer, who truly said <lb/>
            Whate'er he said would be ; and told him all, <lb/>
            And bade him answer her what thing would thence befall:</p>
          <p>" Hide not, I pray, from reverence for me <lb/>
            If aught of ill the gods design : 'tis clear <lb/>
            What fate has spun for him no man can flee ; <lb/>
            But saying this I teach the wise, good seer !” <lb/>
            He answered : " Woman ! privileged to bear <lb/>
            The noblest offspring, princess of the blood <lb/>
            Of Perseus, by my own sweet light I swear, <lb/>
            Which once was in these eyes, as name for good <lb/>
            Shall be remembered long Alcmena's womanhood.</p>
          <p>" The Achæan women while they spin, I wis, <lb/>
            Alcmena's name to latest eve shall sing ; <lb/>
            And famous shalt thou be in Argolis ; <lb/>
            For this thy son to star-paved heaven shall spring : <lb/>
            All that contend with the broad-breasted king, <lb/>
            Or man or beast, shall yield the victory. <lb/>
            Twelve labours wrought, him Destiny shall bring <lb/>
            To Jove's own house, but all of him can die <lb/>
            On the Trachinian pyre shall perish utterly.</p>
          <p>" And he the son-in-law of her shall be, <lb/>
            Who sent these dragons to destroy the child ; <lb/>
            Then in his lair the sharp-toothed wolf shall see <lb/>
            The fawn, nor harm it, wonderfully mild. <lb/>
            In the hearth-ashes let there now be piled <lb/>
            All sorts of thorn, bramble, and prickly pear, <lb/>
            And dry, wind-shaken twigs of buck-thorn wild ; <lb/>
            And at the midnight burn these dragons here, <lb/>
            Since they to slay the child at midnight did appear.</p>
          <p>" A maid must cast these ashes with the wind <lb/>
            At morn from yon rock to the rushing tide, <lb/>
            Then hasten home and never look behind. <lb/>
            With sulphur let the house be purified ; <lb/>
            Pure water, mixed with salt, from side to side <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            Then from a full urn sprinkle on the floor : <lb/>
            For so the holy custom doth provide ; <lb/>
            And sacrifice to Zeus supreme a boar, <lb/>
            That o'er your foes you may be victors evermore."</p>
          <p>Then, rising from the ivory chair, withdrew <lb/>
            Tiresias, and bent with years was he. <lb/>
            But Hercules with his fond mother grew, <lb/>
            As grows a young plant in a fruitful lea, <lb/>
            And still Amphitryon's boy was thought to be : <lb/>
            Linus, Apollo's son, heroic name ! <lb/>
            Instructed him in letters carefully. <lb/>
            And Eurytus, who from rich parents came, <lb/>
            Taught him to bend the bow and take unerring aim.</p>
          <p>To move his fingers on the harp with ease, <lb/>
            And to the music minstrelsy to sing, <lb/>
            Him taught Eumolpus Philammonides: <lb/>
            And with what sleights the men of Argos fling <lb/>
            Each other, wrestling fiercely in the ring, <lb/>
            And every sort of pugilistic sleight, <lb/>
            Him taught the son of the Cyllenian king, <lb/>
            Harpalicus, whose dreadful brow did fright <lb/>
            Men from afar, that few would dare with him to fight.</p>
          <p>To drive the chariot, and impel, control <lb/>
            The rapid-bounding steeds, and how to shun <lb/>
            Dashing his axle-nave against the goal, <lb/>
            He was instructed by Amphitryon, <lb/>
            Who willingly did teach his hopeful son : <lb/>
            In Argos oft, whose praises are far-spoken <lb/>
            For generous steeds, himself had prizes won ; <lb/>
            And of his skill there was this certain token, <lb/>
            Though time had marred the reins, his chariot was unbroken.</p>
          <p>In stationary fight to aim the lance, <lb/>
            Shielding himself; to bide swords flashing round ; <lb/>
            To draw his battle out, and bid advance <lb/>
            The cavalry; to scan the foeman's ground, <lb/>
            While to the charge the troops impetuous bound,- <lb/>
            He learned from Castor, who, till he was old, <lb/>
            Of demigods was warrior most renowned, <lb/>
            Exiled from Argos then, which Tydeus bold <lb/>
            With all the vine-land broad did from Adrastus hold. <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            Alcmena thus had taught her Hercules. <lb/>
            His sleeping-place was near his father's bed; <lb/>
            And, what did most of all his fancy please, <lb/>
            For the bold boy a lion's hide was spread. <lb/>
            His morning meal, roast meat and Dorian bread- <lb/>
            No ploughman would a larger loaf desire; <lb/>
            His evening meal (the day already sped) <lb/>
            Was very light; nor such as needed fire. <lb/>
            He always wore, bare to his knees, a plain attire.</p>

          <p>WHEN, to perform his fated lord's behest, <lb/>
            Amphitryon's son, with toils and perils tried, <lb/>
            Hero with the prodigious breadth of breast,- <lb/>
            In his right hand his club, the lion's hide <lb/>
            Hung from his shoulders by the fore-feet tied,- <lb/>
            To the rich vale of fruitful Elis came, <lb/>
            Where the sweet waters of Alphëus glide, <lb/>
            Seeing herds, flocks, and pastures, none might claim, <lb/>
            But only wealthiest lord, some prince well known to fame,</p>
          <p>He asked a countryman, whose watchful care <lb/>
            O'erlooked the grounds, (his task was his delight,) <lb/>
            “Good friend! wilt tell a traveller, whose are <lb/>
            These herds, and flocks, and pastures infinite ? <lb/>
            He is, I well may guess, the favourite <lb/>
            Of the Olympian gods. Here should abide <lb/>
            Those I am come to seek." The man, at sight <lb/>
            And claim of stranger, quickly laid aside <lb/>
            The work he had in hand, and courteously replied :</p>
          <p>" What thou dost ask I willingly will tell, <lb/>
            Good stranger ! for I fear the heavy wrath <lb/>
            Of Hermes, the way-god ; of all who dwell <lb/>
            Above us, most is he provoked, when scath <lb/>
            Or scorn is done to him who asks his path. <lb/>
            Not in one pasture all the flocks appear, <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            Nor in one region, King Augeias hath: <lb/>
            Some pasture where Elisson glides ; some, where <lb/>
            Alpheus ; at vine-clad Buprasion some ; some, here :</p>
          <p>" And every flock has its particular fold. <lb/>
            Their pasture never fails his numerous kine <lb/>
            In the green lowlands that receiving hold <lb/>
            The gush of Peneus, and the dew divine: <lb/>
            As in the genial moisture they recline, <lb/>
            The meads throw up soft herbage, which supplies <lb/>
            The strength of the horned kine. Beyond the shine <lb/>
            Of the far-gliding river-turn your eyes <lb/>
            A little to the left-their stalled enclosure lies ;</p>
          <p>" Yonder, where the perennial planes elate <lb/>
            Stand lordly, and the green wild-olives grow,- <lb/>
            A grove to King Apollo dedicate, <lb/>
            The pastoral god, most perfect god we know. <lb/>
            Hard by, our dwellings in a lengthened row ; <lb/>
            Our labour an immense revenue yields <lb/>
            To our good lord, as often as we sow, <lb/>
            When thrice or four times ploughed, the fallow fields : <lb/>
            Each of his husbandmen the spade or hoe that wields,</p>
          <p>" Earthing the vine-roots, or at vintage-tide <lb/>
            Toils at the wine-press, knows where the domain <lb/>
            Of rich Augeias ends on every side. <lb/>
            For his is all the far-extended plain, <lb/>
            Orchards thick-set with trees, and fields with grain, <lb/>
            E'en to the fount-full hill-tops far away ; <lb/>
            All which we work at (as behoves the swain, <lb/>
            Whose life is spent a-field) through all the day. <lb/>
            Why thou art come-to tell may be thy profit-say.</p>
          <p>" Dost seek Augeias, or some one of those <lb/>
            Who serve him ? I will give an answer clear, <lb/>
            And to the point, as one that fully knows. <lb/>
            Not mean art thou, nor of mean sires, I'd swear, <lb/>
            So grand thy form. The sons of gods appear <lb/>
            Such among men." To him Jove's son replied : <lb/>
            " In truth, old man ! for that did bring me here, <lb/>
            Augeias I would see : if it betide <lb/>
            Th' Epeän chief doth in the city now abide, <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            " And, caring for the folk, as j udge fulfils <lb/>
            True judgment; bid his trusty steward me speed, <lb/>
            With whom as guide I may converse. God wills <lb/>
            That mortal men should one another need." <lb/>
            To him the husbandman : " It seems, indeed, <lb/>
            Thy way was heaven-appointed : in thine aim, <lb/>
            E'en to thy wish, thou dost at once succeed; <lb/>
            For yesterday Augeias hither came, <lb/>
            With his illustrious son, Phyleüs hight by name.</p>
          <p>"After long time, his rural wealth to see, <lb/>
            He came: to this e'en princes are not blind, <lb/>
            The master there, his house will safer be. <lb/>
            But let us to the stall; there shall we find <lb/>
            Augeias." Led the way that old man kind : <lb/>
            Seeing the great hand-filling club, and spoil <lb/>
            Of the wild beast, he puzzled much his mind, <lb/>
            Who he could be, come from what natal soil; <lb/>
            And with desire to ask him this did inward boil,</p>
          <p>But caught the word just to his lips proceeding, <lb/>
            For fear he might with question indiscreet, <lb/>
            Or out of place, annoy the stranger speeding: <lb/>
            'Tis a hard thing another's thought to weet. <lb/>
            The hounds both ways, by scent and fall of feet, <lb/>
            Perceived them from afar. At Hercules <lb/>
            They flew, loud barking at him, but did greet <lb/>
            The old man, whining gently as you please, <lb/>
            And round him wagged their tails, and fawning licked his <lb/>
            knees.</p>
          <p>But he with stones-to lift them was enough- <lb/>
            Scared back the hounds, their barking did restrain, <lb/>
            And scolded them ; but, though his voice was rough, <lb/>
            His heart was glad they did such guard maintain, <lb/>
            When he was absent. Then he spoke again: <lb/>
            " Gods ! what an animal! what faithful suit <lb/>
            He does to man ! if he where to abstain, <lb/>
            Where rage, but knew, none other might dispute <lb/>
            With him in excellence ; but 'tis too fierce a brute."</p>
          <p>And soon they reached the stall. The sun his steeds <lb/>
            Turned to the west, bringing the close of day. <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            The herds and flocks, returning from the meads, <lb/>
            Came to the stables where they nightly lay. <lb/>
            The kine in long succession trod the way, <lb/>
            Innumerous ; as watery clouds on high, <lb/>
            By south or west wind driven in dense array, <lb/>
            One on another press, and forward fly, <lb/>
            Numberless, without end, along the thickened sky;</p>
          <p>So many upon so many impels the wind; <lb/>
            Others on others drive their crests to twine: <lb/>
            So many herds so many pressed behind ; <lb/>
            The plain, the ways, were filled in breadth and line; <lb/>
            The fields were straitened with the lowing kine. <lb/>
            The sheep were folded soon ; the cattle, too, <lb/>
            That inward, as they walk, their knees incline, <lb/>
            Were all installed, a multitude to view : <lb/>
            No man stood idle by for want of work to do.</p>
          <p>Some to the kine their wooden shoes applied, <lb/>
            And bound with thongs; while some in station near <lb/>
            To milk them took their proper place beside : <lb/>
            One to the dams let go their younglings dear, <lb/>
            Mad for the warm milk; while another there <lb/>
            The milk-pail held, the curds to cheese one turned: <lb/>
            Meanwhile Augeias went by every where, <lb/>
            And with his own eyes for himself he learned <lb/>
            What revenue for him his cattle-keepers earned.</p>
          <p>With him his son and mighty Hercules <lb/>
            Through his exceeding show of riches went. <lb/>
            And, though his mind Amphitryonides <lb/>
            Was wont to keep on balance and unbent, <lb/>
            At sight thereof he was in wonderment: <lb/>
            Had he not seen it, he'd have thought it fable, <lb/>
            That any one, however eminent <lb/>
            For wealth, or any ten, in fold, stall, stable, <lb/>
            The richest of all kings, to show such wealth were able.</p>
          <p>Hyperion gave unto his son most dear, <lb/>
            That he should all in flocks and herds excel. <lb/>
            His care increased them more from year to year; <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            For on his herds no sort of ailment fell, <lb/>
            Such as destroys the cattle: his grew well, <lb/>
            In pith improving still. None cast their young, <lb/>
            Which almost all were female. He could tell <lb/>
            Three hundred white-skinned bulls his kine among, <lb/>
            And eke two hundred red, that to their pastime sprung.</p>
          <p>Twelve swan-white bulls were sacred to the sun, <lb/>
            All inknee'd bulls excelling; these apart <lb/>
            Cropped the green pasture, and were never done <lb/>
            Exulting; when from thicket shag did dart <lb/>
            Wild beasts, among the herds to play their part, <lb/>
            These twelve first rushed, death-looking, to the war, <lb/>
            Roaring most terribly. In pride of heart <lb/>
            And strength great Phaethon (men to a star <lb/>
            Did liken him) was first, mid many seen afar.</p>
          <p>When this bull saw the tawny lion's hide, <lb/>
            He rushed on watchful Hercules, intent <lb/>
            To plunge his armed forehead in his side: <lb/>
            But then the hero grasped incontinent <lb/>
            The bull's left horn, and to the ground back-bent <lb/>
            His heavy neck; then backward pressed his might. <lb/>
            The bull, more struggling as more backward sent, <lb/>
            At last stood, stretching every nerve, upright. <lb/>
            The king, and prince, and swains, all marvelled at the sight.</p>
          <p>But to the city, on the following day, <lb/>
            Bold Hercules and prince Phyleüs sped. <lb/>
            At first their path through a thick vineyard lay, <lb/>
            Narrow, and 'mid the green, through which it led, <lb/>
            Half-hid. This past, Phyleüs turned his head <lb/>
            O'er his right shoulder, soon as they did reach <lb/>
            The public road, and to the hero said, <lb/>
            Who walked behind him : “Friend, I did impeach <lb/>
            Myself as having lost, concerning thee, some speech</p>
          <p>" I long since heard : now I remember me, <lb/>
            A young Achæan hither on a day <lb/>
            From Argos came, from sea-shore Helice, <lb/>
            Who, many Epeans present, then did say <lb/>
            He saw an Argive man a monster slay, <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            A lion, dread of all the country round, <lb/>
            Whose lair in grove of Zeus the Nemean lay: <lb/>
            I am not sure if on Tirynthian ground, <lb/>
            Or else in Argos born, or in Mycenian bound;</p>
          <p>"But said, if I remember rightly now, <lb/>
            The hero sprung from Perseus: I confess <lb/>
            Methinks none other Argive man but thou <lb/>
            Dared that adventure: yea! that piece of dress, <lb/>
            The lion's hide, avows that hardiness. <lb/>
            Then, hero, first of all explain tome, <lb/>
            That I may know if right or wrong my guess, <lb/>
            Whether thou art in truth that very he, <lb/>
            Whose deed was told us by the man of Helice.</p>
          <p>" Next, tell how thou didst slay the dreadful beast, <lb/>
            And how his way to Nemean haunt he found: <lb/>
            One, if he searched in Apian land at least, <lb/>
            Such monster could not find, though bears abound, <lb/>
            Boars and destructive wolves, the country round: <lb/>
            Wherefore all marvelled at the man's recital, <lb/>
            And thought the traveller, with idle sound <lb/>
            Of his invented wonders, in requital <lb/>
            Of hospitable rites, was striving to delight all."</p>
          <p>Then from the mid-path to the road-side near <lb/>
            Phyleüs kept, that both abreast might find <lb/>
            Sufficient room, and he might better hear <lb/>
            What Hercules should say, who, still behind, <lb/>
            To him replied: " Not from the truth declined, <lb/>
            But with just balance thou hast judged it well: <lb/>
            Since thou would'st hear, I with a willing mind <lb/>
            Will tell, Phyleüs, how the monster fell, <lb/>
            But whence he came nor I, nor Argive else can tell.</p>
          <p>“Only we think that some immortal sent, <lb/>
            For holy rites profaned or left undone, <lb/>
            That ill on the Phoronians; forth he went, <lb/>
            And the Piseäns, like a flood, o'errun : <lb/>
            The Bembinaeans least of all could shun <lb/>
            His fateful wrath; they, nearest, fared the worst: <lb/>
            To slay that terrible redoubted one <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            Was task enjoined me by Eurystheus erst; <lb/>
            His wish I undertook, of my set toils the first.</p>
          <p>"My flexile bow I took, and quiver full <lb/>
            Of arrows, and my club, the bark still on, <lb/>
            The stem of a wild olive I did pull <lb/>
            Up by the roots, when thither I was gone, <lb/>
            Under the brow of holy Helicon. <lb/>
            But when I came to the huge lion's lair, <lb/>
            I to the tip the string did straightway don, <lb/>
            And fix'd one of the arrows which I bare: <lb/>
            To see, ere I was seen, I looked around with care.</p>
          <p>“It was the mid-day, and not yet I found <lb/>
            His traces ; nor could hear his mighty roar. <lb/>
            I saw no herdsman, ploughman on the ground, <lb/>
            To point me where I should his haunt explore: <lb/>
            Green fear kept every man within his door. <lb/>
            Nor till I saw him and his vigour tried, <lb/>
            Ceased I to search the sylvan mountain o'er; <lb/>
            And ere came on the cool of eventide, <lb/>
            Back to his cavern, gorged with flesh and blood, he hied.</p>
          <p>"His dew-lap, savage face, and mane, were gory; <lb/>
            He licked his beard, while I, yet unespied, <lb/>
            Lurked in a thicket of the promontory ; <lb/>
            But as he nearer came, at his left side <lb/>
            I shot an arrow, but it did not glide, <lb/>
            Though sharp, into his flesh, but with rebound <lb/>
            Fell on the grass. The thick he closely eyed, <lb/>
            His bloody head up-lifting from the ground, <lb/>
            And ghastly grinned, showing his teeth's terrific round.</p>
          <p>" Then on the string another shaft I placed, <lb/>
            And shot—vext that the former idly flew : <lb/>
            Mid-breast I hit him, where the lungs are placed: <lb/>
            His hide the sharp, sharp arrow pierced not through, <lb/>
            But at his feet fell ineffectual too : <lb/>
            Again a third I was in act to shoot, <lb/>
            Enraged to think in vain my bow I drew, <lb/>
            When I was seen by the blood-thirsty brute, <lb/>
            Who to the battle-thought his angry signs did suit. <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            " With his long tail he lashed himself; and all <lb/>
            His neck was filled with wrath: the fiery glow <lb/>
            Of his vext mane up-bristled ; in a ball <lb/>
            He gathered up himself, till like a bow <lb/>
            His spine was arched : as when one, who doth know <lb/>
            Chariots to build, excelling in his art, <lb/>
            Having first heated in a fire-heat slow <lb/>
            Bends for his wheel a fig-branch ; with a start <lb/>
            The fissile wild-fig flies far from his hands apart.</p>
          <p>"Collected for the spring, and mad to rend me, <lb/>
            So leapt the lion from afar : I strove <lb/>
            With skin-cloak, bow, and quiver to defend me <lb/>
            With one hand; with the other I up-hove <lb/>
            My weighty club, and on his temple drove, <lb/>
            But broke in pieces the rough olive wood <lb/>
            On his hard shaggy head : he from above <lb/>
            Fell ere he reached me, by the stroke subdued, <lb/>
            And nodding with his head on trembling feet he stood.</p>
          <p>"Darkness came over both his eyes : his brain <lb/>
            Was shaken in the bone ; but when I spied <lb/>
            The monster stunned and reeling from his pain, <lb/>
            I cast my quiver and my bow aside, <lb/>
            And to his neck my throttling hands applied, <lb/>
            Before he could recover. I did bear me <lb/>
            With vigour in the death-clutch, and astride <lb/>
            His body from behind from scath did clear me, <lb/>
            So that he could not or with jaw or talons tear me.</p>
          <p>"His hind feet with my heels I pressed aground ; <lb/>
            Of his pernicious throat my hands took care ; <lb/>
            His sides were for my thighs a safe-guard found <lb/>
            From his fore-feet: till breathless high in air <lb/>
            I lifted him new sped to hell's dark lair. <lb/>
            Then many projects did my thoughts divide, <lb/>
            How best I might the monster's carcass bare, <lb/>
            And from his dead limbs strip the shaggy hide : <lb/>
            Hard task it was indeed, and much my patience tried.</p>
          <p>" I tried and failed with iron, wood, and flint; <lb/>
            For none of these his skin could penetrate ; <lb/>
            Then some immortal gave to me a hint <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            With his own talons I might separate <lb/>
            The carcass and the hide : success did wait <lb/>
            The trial of this thought; he soon was flayed. <lb/>
            I wear his hide, that serves me to rebate <lb/>
            Sharp-cutting war. The Nemean beast was laid <lb/>
            Thus low, which had of men and flocks much havoc made."</p>

          <p>THREE troops three sisters to the mountain led; <lb/>
            Agavé with' her cheeks that blossomed red <lb/>
            The bloom of apple ; and in wildest mood <lb/>
            Autonöa and Ino. From the wood <lb/>
            They stript oak-leaves and ivy green as well, <lb/>
            And from the ground the lowly asphodel; <lb/>
            In a pure lawn with these twelve altars placed; <lb/>
            Nine Dionysus, three his mother graced; <lb/>
            Then from the chest the sacred symbols moved, <lb/>
            And, as their god had taught them and approved, <lb/>
            Upon the leafy altars reverent laid. <lb/>
            Hid in a native mastic's sheltering shade, <lb/>
            Them from a steep rock Pentheus then surveyed. <lb/>
            Him perched aloft Autonöa first discerned, <lb/>
            And dreadful shrieked, and spurning overturned <lb/>
            The sacred orgies of the frenzied one, <lb/>
            Which none profane may ever look upon. <lb/>
            She maddened, maddened all: scared Pentheus fled, <lb/>
            And they, with robes drawn up, pursued : He said: <lb/>
            " What want ye, dames ! " Autonöa then: " Thou, fellow ! <lb/>
            Shalt know, not hear "-and mightily did bellow, <lb/>
            Loud as a lioness her brood defending ; <lb/>
            His mother clutched his head, whilst Ino rending <lb/>
            Tore off his shoulder, trod and trampled o'er him ; <lb/>
            Autonöa likewise: limb from limb they tore him. <lb/>
            Then all returned to Thebes; defiled with gore, <lb/>
            They of their Pentheus only fragments bore, <lb/>
            Their after-grief. This troubles not my mind : <lb/>
            Not let another, impotent and blind, <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            Name Dionysus as hereby defiled,— <lb/>
            Nor though he harsher used some curious child. <lb/>
            May I my life to holy courses give, <lb/>
            Dear to the holy who reproachless live ! <lb/>
            This omen, sent from aegis-bearing Jove, <lb/>
            Shows what he hates, and what his thoughts approve ; <lb/>
            Blest are the children of the godly-ever ; <lb/>
            Blest are the children of the godless-never. <lb/>
            Hail, Blessed! whom Jove's thigh enclosed for us, <lb/>
            Till thou wert born on snowy Dracanus. <lb/>
            Hail, Semele ! Cadmean sisters, hail ! <lb/>
            Whose names in songs of heroines prevail. <lb/>

            Garments for men, and such as women wear <lb/>
            Of silk, whose colour is the sea-blue clear. <lb/>
            And she so diligent a housewife is, <lb/>
            That ever for well-ankled Theugenis <lb/>

            You do not wholly love me as you ought. <lb/>
            All of my life-the half that is not fled, <lb/>

            See ! how you change about for ever now, <lb/>

            And if one .chance to praise your lovely face, <lb/>
            Him more than friend of three years proof you grace : <lb/>
            To him that loved you first you are as cold, <lb/>

            But now you breathe of wantonness and pride ; <lb/>

            So do, and good renown you shall obtain, <lb/>
            And Love will never visit you with pain, <lb/>
            Who mortal hearts can easily subdue, <lb/>
            And made me, heart of iron, dote on you. <lb/>
            In all the changes of your fitful will, <lb/>
            Unchanged I live but in your kisses still. <lb/>
            Remember that you were last year, last week, <lb/>
            Younger than now : we grow old while we speak. <lb/>
            Wrinkles soon come; and Youth speeds on amain, <lb/>

            We, slow-foot mortals, cannot overtake <lb/>
            Birds, or what else a winged passage make. <lb/>
            Take thought, and be more mild : to me, who burn <lb/>
            In love for you, a guileless love return, <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            That when your bloom of youthful beauty ends, <lb/>
            We may be time-enduring, faithful friends. <lb/>
            But if you cast my words unto the wind, <lb/>
            Or piqued to anger murmur in your mind, <lb/>
            " Why dost thou trouble me ?" I for thy sake, <lb/>
            And thy much scorn, myself will straight betake, <lb/>
            Where the gold apples their sweet fragrance spread, <lb/>
            To Cerberus, the keeper of the dead. <lb/>
            Then freed from love, and all its anxious pain, <lb/>

          <p>CYPRIS, when she saw Adonis <lb/>
            Cold and dead as any stone is, <lb/>
            All his dark hair out of trim, <lb/>
            And his fair cheek deadly dim, <lb/>
            Thither charged the Loves to lead <lb/>
            The cruel boar that did the deed. <lb/>
            And they, swiftly overflying <lb/>
            All the wood where he was lying, <lb/>
            Soon the hapless creature found, <lb/>
            And with cords securely bound. <lb/>
            One the captive dragged along <lb/>
            Holding at its end the thong; <lb/>
            While another with his bow <lb/>
            Struck behind and made him go. <lb/>
            Path of fear they made him tread- <lb/>
            Aphrodite was his dread.</p>
          <p>Him the goddess thus addrest: <lb/>
            " Of all beasts thou wickedest! <lb/>
            Thou ! didst thou this white thigh tear ? <lb/>
            Didst thou smite my husband dear ? " <lb/>
            Fearfully, then, answered he : <lb/>
            “Cypris ! I do swear to thee <lb/>
            By thyself and husband dear, <lb/>
            By the very bonds I wear, <lb/>
            By these huntsmen, never I <lb/>

            Meant to tear thy husband's thigh ; <lb/>
            Thinking there a statue stood, <lb/>
            In the fever of my blood, <lb/>
            I was mad a kiss to press <lb/>
            On the naked loveliness : <lb/>
            But my long tusk pierced the boy: <lb/>
            Punish these, and these destroy, <lb/>
            Tusks that worse then useless prove- <lb/>
            What had they to do with love ? <lb/>
            And if this suffice not, pray, <lb/>
            Cypris ! cut my lips away- <lb/>
            What had they to do with kissing ? " <lb/>
            Cypris then, her wrath dismissing, <lb/>
            Pitied him that knew no better ; <lb/>
            And she bade them loose his fetter. <lb/>
            The boar, from that time of her train, <lb/>
            Went not to the wood again ; <lb/>
            But, approaching to the fire, <lb/>
            Fairly burned out his desire.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I AND the Loves Adonis dead deplore: <lb/>
            The beautiful Adonis is indeed <lb/>
            Departed, parted from us. Sleep no more <lb/>
            In purple, Cypris ! but in watchet weed, <lb/>
            All-wretched! beat thy breast and all aread— <lb/>
            " Adonis is no more." The Loves and I <lb/>
            Lament him. Oh ! her grief to see him bleed, <lb/>
            Smitten by white tooth on his whiter thigh, <lb/>
            Out-breathing life's faint sugh upon the mountain high!</p>
          <p>Adown his snowy flesh drops the black gore ; <lb/>
            Stiffen beneath his brow his sightless eyes; <lb/>
            The rose is off his lip ; with him no more <lb/>
            Lives Cytherea's kiss-but with him dies. <lb/>
            He knows not that her lip his cold lip tries, <lb/>
            But she finds pleasure still in kissing him. <lb/>
            Deep is his thigh-wound ; hers yet deeper lies, <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            E'en in her heart. The Oread's eyes are dim; <lb/>
            His hounds whine piteously ; in most disordered trim,</p>
          <p>Distraught, unkempt, unsandalled, Cypris rushes <lb/>
            Madly along the tangled thicket-steep ; <lb/>
            Her sacred blood is drawn by bramble-bushes ; <lb/>
            Her skin is torn; with wailings wild and deep <lb/>
            She wanders through the valley's weary sweep, <lb/>
            Calling her boy-spouse, her Assyrian fere. <lb/>
            But from his thigh the purple jet doth leap <lb/>
            Up to his snowy navel; on the clear <lb/>
            Whiteness beneath his paps the deep-red streaks appear.</p>
          <p>" Alas for Cypris !" sigh the Loves, " deprived <lb/>
            Of her fair spouse, she lost her beauty's pride; <lb/>
            Cypris was lovely whilst Adonis lived, <lb/>
            But with Adonis all her beauty died." <lb/>
            Mountains, and oaks, and streams, that broadly glide, <lb/>
            Or wail or weep for her; in tearful rills <lb/>
            For her gush fountains from the mountain side ; <lb/>
            Redden the flowers from grief; city and hills <lb/>
            With ditties sadly wild, lorn Cytherea fills.</p>
          <p>Alas for Cypris ! dead is her Adonis, <lb/>
            And Echo " dead Adonis " doth resound. <lb/>
            Who would not grieve for her whose love so lone is ? <lb/>
            But when she saw his cruel, cruel wound, <lb/>
            The purple gore that ran his wan thigh round, <lb/>
            She spread her arms, and lowly murmured: " Stay thee, <lb/>
            That I may find thee as before I found, <lb/>
            My hapless own Adonis ! and embay thee, <lb/>
            And mingle lips with lips, whilst in my arms I lay thee.</p>
          <p>“Up for a little ! kiss me back again <lb/>
            The latest kiss-brie as itself that dies <lb/>
            In being breathed, until I fondly "drain"" <lb/>
            The last breath of my soul, and greedy-wise <lb/>
            Drink it into my core. I will devise <lb/>
            To guard it as Adonis-since from me <lb/>
            To Acheron my own Adonis flies, <lb/>
            And to the drear dread king; but I must be <lb/>
            A goddess still and live, nor can I follow thee. <pb n="303"/>
            </p>
          <p>" But thou, Persephona! my spouse receive, <lb/>
            Mightier than I, since to thy chamber drear <lb/>
            All bloom of beauty falls: but I must grieve <lb/>
            Unceasingly. I have a jealous fear <lb/>
            Of thee, and weep for him. My dearest dear! <lb/>
            Art dead, indeed ? away my love did fly, <lb/>
            E'en as a dream. At home my widowed cheer <lb/>
            Keeps the Loves idle; with thy latest sigh <lb/>
            My cestus perished too; thou rash one ! why, oh why</p>
          <p>" Did'st hunt? so fair, contend with monsters grim?" <lb/>
            Thus Cypris wailed ; but dead Adonis lies ; <lb/>
            For every gout of blood that fell from him, <lb/>
            She drops a tear; sweet flowers each dew supplies- <lb/>
            Roses his blood, her tears anemonies. <lb/>
            Cypris ! no longer in the thickets weep ; <lb/>
            The couch is furnished! there in loving guise <lb/>
            Upon thy proper bed, that odorous heap, <lb/>
            The lovely body lies-how lovely! as in sleep.</p>
          <p>Come ! in those softest vestments now array him <lb/>
            In which he slept the live-long night with thee ; <lb/>
            And in the golden settle gently lay him,— <lb/>
            A sad, yet lovely sight; and let him be <lb/>
            High heaped with flowers ; though withered all when he <lb/>
            Surceased. With essences him sprinkle o'er <lb/>
            And ointments ; let them perish utterly, <lb/>
            Since he, who was thy sweetest, is no more. <lb/>
            He lies in purple ; him the weeping Loves deplore.</p>
          <p>Their curls are shorn : one breaks his bow ; another <lb/>
            His arrows and the quiver ; this unstrings, <lb/>
            And takes Adonis' sandal off; his brother <lb/>
            In golden urn the fountain water brings ; <lb/>
            This bathes his thighs; that fans him with his wings. <lb/>
            The Loves, " Alas for Cypris !” weeping say: <lb/>
            Hymen hath quenched his torches ; shreds and flings <lb/>
            The marriage wreath away ; and for the lay <lb/>
            Of love is only heard the doleful " weal-away.</p>
          <p>Yet more than Hymen for Adonis weep <lb/>
            The Graces ; shriller than Dione vent <lb/>
            Their shrieks; for him the Muses wail and keep <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            Singing the songs he hears not, with intent <lb/>
            To call him back: and would the nymph relent, <lb/>
            How willingly would he the Muses hear! <lb/>
            Hush! hush ! to-day, sad Cypris and consent <lb/>
            To spare thyself-no more thy bosom tear- <lb/>
            For thou must wail again, and weep another year.</p>

            A birder, yet a boy, saw winged Love <lb/>

            " Against this bird do not your rods employ ; <lb/>

            Until you take him, happy will you be. <lb/>

            " Dear herdsman, take and teach for me, I pray, <lb/>

            If sweet these songs are not, what profit more <lb/>
            Have I to labour at them o'er and o'er ? <lb/>
            If Saturn's son and changeful Fate assigned <lb/>
            A double life-time to our mortal kind, <lb/>
            That one in joys and one in woes be past, <lb/>
            Who had his woes first would have joys at last. <lb/>
            But since Heaven wills one life to man should fall, <lb/>
            And this is very brief-too brief for all <lb/>
            We think to do, why should we fret and moil, <lb/>
            And vex ourselves with never-ending toil ? <lb/>
            To what end waste we life exhaust our health <lb/>
            On gainful arts, and sigh for greater wealth ? <lb/>
            We surely all forget our mortal state- <lb/>
            How brief the life allotted us by Fate !</p>

            Hellenes, Elians, and Mycenians, came, <lb/>
            And brave Laconians, to retake the dame. <lb/>
            When Greece her battle led across the deep, <lb/>
            Himself at home no warrior then might keep. <lb/>
            Achilles only went not then, indeed, <lb/>

            A seeming virgin with a virgin's bloom, <lb/>

            No virgin of them all had airs more fine, <lb/>

            He veiled his hair; but Mars and fiery Love, <lb/>
            That stings young manhood, all his thoughts did move. <lb/>
            He lingered by Deidamia's side, <lb/>
            Close as he could, from morn till eventide: <lb/>
            Often he kissed her hand, and often raised <lb/>

            " With one another other sisters sleep ; <lb/>
            In station, love, and age, we twain are one, <lb/>
            Why should we, maidens both, each sleep alone ? <lb/>

          <p>HER Eros thus proclaimed the Cyprian Queen <lb/>
            " If any one has in the highway seen <lb/>
            My straying Eros, and reports to me <lb/>
            His whereabouts, he shall rewarded be; <lb/>
            A kiss for him ; but if it shall betide <lb/>
            One bring him me, a kiss-and more beside. <lb/>
            Midst twenty he is notable to view; <lb/>
            Not fair, but flamy, is his dazzling hue ; <lb/>
            Sharp are his eyes, and flame their glances fleet; <lb/>
            His mind is wicked, but his speech is sweet. <lb/>
            His word and meaning are not like at all ; <lb/>
            His word is honey, and his meaning gall. <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            He is a mischievous, deceitful child ; <lb/>
            Beguiles with falsehood, laughs at the beguiled. <lb/>
            He has a lovely head of curling hair, <lb/>
            But saucy features, with a reckless stare. <lb/>
            His hands are tiny, but afar they throw, <lb/>
            E'en down to Dis and Acheron below. <lb/>
            Naked his form, his mind in covert lies; <lb/>
            Winged as a feathered bird, he careless flies <lb/>
            From girls to boys, from men to women flits, <lb/>
            Sports with their heart-strings, on their vitals sits. <lb/>
            Small is his bow, his arrow small to sight, <lb/>
            But to Jove's court it wings its ready flight. <lb/>
            Upon his back a golden quiver sounds, <lb/>
            Full of sharp darts, with which e'en me he-wounds. <lb/>
            All cruel things by cruel Love are done ; <lb/>
            His torch is small, yet scorches e'en the sun. <lb/>
            But should you take him—fast and safely bind him, <lb/>
            And bring him to me with his hands behind him. <lb/>
            If he should weep, take heed-he weeps at will; <lb/>
            But should he smile--then drag him faster still <lb/>
            And should he offer you a kiss, beware ! <lb/>
            Evil his kiss, his red lips poisoned are ! <lb/>
            And should he say, with seeming friendship hot, <lb/>
            ' Accept my bow and arrows,' touch them not ! <lb/>
            Tears, smiles, words, gifts, deceitful wiles inspire, <lb/>
            And every thing he has is dipt in fire."</p>

          <p>CYPRIS, when all but shone the dawn's glad beam, <lb/>
            To fair Europa sent a pleasant dream ; <lb/>
            When sleep, upon the close-shut eyelids sitting, <lb/>
            Sweeter than honey, is eye-fetters knitting, <lb/>
            The limb-dissolving sleep ! when to and fro <lb/>
            True dreams, like sheep at pasture, come and go. <lb/>
            Europa, sleeping in her upper room, <lb/>
            The child of Phoenix, in her virgin bloom, <lb/>
            Thought that she saw a contest fierce arise <lb/>
            Betwixt two continents, herself the prize ; <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            They to the dreamer seemed like women quite, <lb/>
            Asia, and Asia's unknown opposite. <lb/>
            This was a stranger, that a native seemed, <lb/>
            And closer hugged her-so Europa dreamed ; <lb/>
            And called herself Europa's nurse and mother, <lb/>
            Said that she bore and reared her; but that other <lb/>
            Spared not her hands, and still the sleeper drew, <lb/>
            With her good will, and claimed her as her due, <lb/>
            And said that Zeus Ægiochus gave her, <lb/>
            By Fate's appointment, that sweet prisoner.</p>
          <p>Up-started from her couch the maiden waking, <lb/>
            And felt her heart within her bosom quaking ; <lb/>
            She thought it true, and sat in hushed surprise- <lb/>
            Still saw those women with her open eyes ; <lb/>
            Then to her timid voice at last gave vent :­ <lb/>
            " Which of the gods to me this vision sent ? <lb/>
            What kind of dream is this that startled me, <lb/>
            And sudden made my pleasant slumber flee ? <lb/>
            Who was the stranger that I saw in sleep ? <lb/>
            What love for her did to my bosom creep ! <lb/>
            And how she hailed me, as her daughter even ! <lb/>
            But only turn to good my vision, Heaven !"</p>
          <p>So said, and bounded up, and sought her train <lb/>
            Of dear companions, all of noble strain, <lb/>
            Of equal years and stature ; 'gentle, kind, <lb/>
            Sweet to the sight, and pleasant to the mind ; <lb/>
            With whom she sported, when she led the choir, <lb/>
            Or in the river's urn-like reservoir <lb/>
            She bathed her limbs, or in the meadow stopt, <lb/>
            And from its bosom odorous lilies crept. <lb/>
            And soon around her shone the lovely band, <lb/>
            Her flower-basket in each maiden's hand ; <lb/>
            And to the meadows near the pleasant shore <lb/>
            They sped, where they had often sped before, <lb/>
            Pleased with the roses growing in their reach, <lb/>
            And with the waves that murmured on the beach.</p>
          <p>A basket by Hephæstus wrought of gold, <lb/>
            Europa bore-a marvel to behold ; <lb/>
            He gave it Libya, when, a blooming bride, <lb/>
            She went to grace the great Earth-shaker's side; <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            She gave it Telephassa fair and mild, <lb/>
            Who now had given it to her virgin child. <lb/>
            Therein were many sparkling wonders wrought— <lb/>
            The hapless Iö to the sight was brought; <lb/>
            A heifer's for a virgin's form she wore ; <lb/>
            The briny paths she frantic wandered o'er, <lb/>
            And was a swimming heifer to the view, <lb/>
            While the sea round her darkened into blue. <lb/>
            Two men upon a promontory stood, <lb/>
            And watched the heifer traversing the flood. <lb/>
            Again where seven-mouthed Nile divides his strand, <lb/>
            Zeus stood and gently stroked her with his hand, <lb/>
            And from her horned figure and imbruted <lb/>
            To her original form again transmuted. <lb/>
            In brass the heifer—Zeus was wrought in gold ; <lb/>
            Nile softly in a silver current rolled. <lb/>
            And to the life was watchful Hermes shown <lb/>
            Under the rounded basket's golden crown ; <lb/>
            And Argus near him with unsleeping eyes <lb/>
            Lay stretched at length ; then from his blood did rise <lb/>
            The bird, exulting in the brilliant pride <lb/>
            Of his rich plumes and hues diversified, <lb/>
            And like a swift ship with her out-spread sail, <lb/>
            Expanding proudly his resplendent tail, <lb/>
            The basket's golden rim he shadowed o'er: <lb/>
            Such was the basket fair Europa bore.</p>
          <p>They reached the mead with vernal blossoms full, <lb/>
            And each began her favourite flowers to pull. <lb/>
            Narcissus one ; another thyme did get; <lb/>
            This hyacinth, and that the violet; <lb/>
            And of the spring-sweets in the meadow found <lb/>
            Much scented bloom was scattered on the ground. <lb/>
            Some of the troop in rivalry chose rather <lb/>
            The sweet and yellow crocuses to gather ; <lb/>
            Shining, as mid the Graces Cypris glows, <lb/>
            The princess in the midst preferred the rose: <lb/>
            Nor long with flowers her gentle fancy charmed, <lb/>
            Nor long she kept her virgin flower unharmed. <lb/>
            With love for her was Saturn's son inflamed, <lb/>
            By unexpected darts of Cypris tamed, <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            Who only tames e'en Zeus. To shun the rage <lb/>
            Of Here, and the virgin's mind engage, <lb/>
            To draw her eyes and her attention claim, <lb/>
            He hid his godhead and a bull became ; <lb/>
            Not such as feeds at stall, or then or now, <lb/>
            The furrow cuts and draws the crooked plough ; <lb/>
            Not such as feeds the lowing kine among, <lb/>
            Or trails in yoke the heavy wain along ; <lb/>
            His body all a yellow hue did own, <lb/>
            But a white circle in his forehead shone ; <lb/>
            His sparkling eyes with love's soft lustre gleamed ; <lb/>
            His arched horns like Dian's crescent seemed. <lb/>
            He came into the meadow, nor the sight <lb/>
            Fluttered the virgins into sudden flight. <lb/>
            But they desired to touch and see him near; <lb/>
            His breath surpassed the meadow-sweetness there. <lb/>
            Before Europa's feet he halted meek, <lb/>
            Licked her fair neck, and eke her rosy cheek; <lb/>
            Threw round his neck her arms the Beautiful, <lb/>
            Wiped from his lips the foam and kissed the bull; <lb/>
            Softly he lowed ; no lowing of a brute <lb/>
            It seemed, but murmur of Mygdonian flute ; <lb/>
            Down on his knees he slunk ; and first her eyed, <lb/>
            And then his back, as asking her to ride. <lb/>
            The long-haired maidens she began to call :­ <lb/>
            " Come let us ride, his back will hold us all, <lb/>
            E'en as a ship ; a bull unlike the rest, <lb/>
            As if a human heart were in his breast, <lb/>
            He gentle is and tractable and meek, <lb/>
            And wants but voice his gentleness to speak."</p>
          <p>She said, and mounted smiling, but before <lb/>
            Another did, he bounded for the shore. <lb/>
            The royal virgin, struck with instant fear, <lb/>
            Stretched out her hands and called her playmates dear ; <lb/>
            But how could they the ravished princess reach ? <lb/>
            He, like a dolphin, pushed out from the beach. <lb/>
            From their sea-hollows swift the Nereids rose, <lb/>
            Seated on seals, and did his train compose ; <lb/>
            Poseidon went before, and smooth did make <lb/>
            The path of waters for his brother's sake ; <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            Around their king in close array did keep <lb/>
            The loud-voiced Tritons, minstrels of the deep, <lb/>
            And with their conchs proclaimed the nuptial song. <lb/>
            But on Jove's bull-back as she rode along, <lb/>
            The maid with one hand grasped his branching horn, <lb/>
            The flowing robe, that did her form adorn, <lb/>
            Raised with the other hand, and tried to save <lb/>
            From the salt moisture of the saucy wave ; <lb/>
            Her robe, inflated by the wanton breeze, <lb/>
            Seemed like a ship's sail hovering o'er the seas. <lb/>
            But when, her father-land no longer nigh, <lb/>
            Nor sea-dashed shore was seen, nor mountain high, <lb/>
            But only sky above, and sea below- <lb/>
            She said, and round her anxious glance did throw :—</p>
          <p>" Whither with me, portentous bull ? discover <lb/>
            This and thyself: and how canst thou pass over <lb/>
            The path of waters, walking on the wave, <lb/>
            And dost not fear the dangerous path to brave ? <lb/>
            Along this tract swift ships their courses keep, <lb/>
            But bulls are wont to fear the mighty deep. <lb/>
            What pasture here ? what sweet drink in the brine ? <lb/>
            Art thou a god ? thy doings seem divine. <lb/>
            Nor sea-born dolphins roam the flowery mead, <lb/>
            Nor earth-born bulls through Ocean's realm proceed; <lb/>
            Fearless on land, and plunging from the shores <lb/>
            Thou roamest ocean, and thy hoofs are oars. <lb/>
            Perchance anon, up-borne into the sky, <lb/>
            Thou without wings like winged birds wilt fly ! <lb/>
            Ah me unhappy! who my father's home <lb/>
            Have left and with a bull o'er ocean roam, <lb/>
            A lonely voyager ! my helper be, <lb/>
            Earth-shaking regent of the hoary sea ! <lb/>
            I hope to see this voyage's cause and guide, <lb/>
            For not without a god these things betide."</p>
          <p>To her the horned bull with accent clear :— <lb/>
            " Take courage, virgin ! nor the billow fear ; <lb/>
            The seeming bull is Zeus; for I with ease <lb/>
            Can take at will whatever form I please ; <lb/>
            My fond desire for thy sweet beauty gave <lb/>
            To me this shape—my footstep to the wave. <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            Dear Crete, that nursed me, now shall welcome thee; <lb/>
            In Crete Europa's nuptial rites shall be ; <lb/>
            From our embrace illustrious sons shall spring, <lb/>
            And every one of them a sceptred king."-</p>
          <p>And instantly they were in Crete: his own <lb/>
            Form Zeus put on-and off her virgin zone. <lb/>
            Strewed the glad bed the Hours, of joy profuse; <lb/>
            The whilom virgin was the bride of Zeus.</p>

            In grief, anemonies and roses, steep ! <lb/>
            In softest murmurs, Hyacinth ! prolong <lb/>
            The sad, sad woe thy lettered petals keep; <lb/>
            Our minstrel sings no more his friends among- <lb/>
            Sicilian Muses ! now begin the doleful song.</p>
          <p>Ye nightingales, that 'mid thick leaves let loose <lb/>
            The gushing gurgle of your sorrow, tell <lb/>
            The fountains of Sicilian Arethuse <lb/>
            That Bion is no more-with Bion fell <lb/>
            The song, the music of the Dorian shell. <lb/>
            Ye swans of Strymon, now your banks along <lb/>
            Your plaintive throats with melting dirges swell <lb/>
            For him who sang like you the mournful song: <lb/>
            Discourse of Bion's death the Thracian nymphs among;</p>
          <p>The Dorian Orpheus, tell them all, is dead. <lb/>
            His herds the song and darling herdsman miss, <lb/>
            And oaks, beneath whose shade he propt his head : <lb/>
            Oblivion's ditty now he sings for Dis: <lb/>
            The melancholy mountain silent is ; <lb/>
            His pining cows no longer wish to feed, <lb/>
            But mourn for him : Apollo wept, I wis, <lb/>
            For thee, sweet Bion ! and in mourning weed <lb/>

          <p>The tears by Naiads shed are brimful bourns ; <lb/>
            Afflicted Pan thy stifled music rues ; <lb/>
            Lorn Echo 'mid her rocks thy silence mourns, <lb/>
            Nor with her mimic tones thy voice renews : <lb/>
            The flowers their bloom, the trees their fruitage lose <lb/>
            No more their milk the drooping ewes supply; <lb/>
            The bees - to press their honey now refuse ; <lb/>
            What need to gather it and lay it by, <lb/>
            When thy own honey-lip, my Bion ! thine is dry ?</p>
          <p>SicilianMuses ! lead the doleful chaunt: <lb/>
            Not so much near the shore the dolphin moans ; <lb/>
            Nor so much wails within her rocky haunt <lb/>
            The nightingale; nor on their mountain thrones <lb/>
            The swallows utter such lugubrious tones ; <lb/>
            Nor so much Cëyx wailed for Halcyon, <lb/>
            Whose song the blue wave, where he perished, owns; <lb/>
            Nor in the valley, neighbour to the sun, <lb/>
            The funeral birds so wail their Memnon's tomb upon-</p>
          <p>As these moan, wail, and weep, their Bion dead. <lb/>
            The nightingales and swallows, whom he taught, <lb/>
            For him their elegiac sadness shed; <lb/>
            And all the birds contagious sorrow caught; <lb/>
            The sylvan realm was all with grief distraught. <lb/>
            Who bold of heart will play on Bion's reed, <lb/>
            Fresh from his lip, yet with his breathing fraught ? <lb/>
            For still among the reeds does Echo feed <lb/>
            On Bion's minstrelsy. Pan only may succeed</p>
          <p>To Bion's pipe; to him I make the gift: <lb/>
            But lest he second seem, e'en Pan may fear <lb/>
            The pipe of Bion to his mouth to lift. <lb/>
            For thee sweet Galatea drops the tear, <lb/>
            And thy dear song regrets, which sitting near <lb/>
            She fondly listed; ever did she flee <lb/>
            The Cyclops and his song; but far more dear <lb/>
            Thy song and sight than her own native sea : <lb/>
            On the deserted sands the nymph without her fee</p>
          <p>Now sits and weeps, or weeping tends thy herd. <lb/>
            Away with Bion all the muse-gifts flew— <lb/>
            The chirping kisses breathed at every word : <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            Around thy tomb the Loves their playmate rue; <lb/>
            Thee Cypris loved more than the kiss she drew <lb/>
            And breathed upon her dying paramour. <lb/>
            Most musical of rivers ! now renew <lb/>
            Thy plaintive murmurs : Meles ! now deplore <lb/>
            Another son of song, as thou didst wail of yore</p>
          <p>That sweet, sweet mouth of dear Calliope: <lb/>
            The threne, 'tis said, thy waves for Homer spun <lb/>
            With saddest music filled the refluent sea ; <lb/>
            Now melting wail and weep another son ! <lb/>
            Both loved of fountains-that of Helicon <lb/>
            Gave Melesigenes his pleasant draught; <lb/>
            To this sweet Arethuse did Bion run, <lb/>
            And from her urn the glowing rapture quaft: <lb/>
            Blest was the bard who sang how Helen bloomed and laught:</p>
          <p>On Thetis' mighty son his descant ran, <lb/>
            And Menelaus ; but our Bion chose <lb/>
            Not arms and tears to sing, but Love and Pan; <lb/>
            While browsed his herd, his gushing music rose ; <lb/>
            He milked his kine ; did pipes of reeds compose ; <lb/>
            Taught how to kiss; and fondled in his breast <lb/>
            Young Love and Cypris pleased. For Bion flows <lb/>
            In every glorious land a grief contest: <lb/>
            Ascra for her own bard, wise Hesiod, less exprest:</p>
          <p>Bœotian Hylæ mourned for Pindar less; <lb/>
            Teos regretted less her minstrel hoar, <lb/>
            And Mytelene her sweet poetess ; <lb/>
            Nor for Alcæus Lesbos suffered more; <lb/>
            Nor lovely Pares did so much deplore <lb/>
            Her own Archilochus. Breathing her fire <lb/>
            Into her sons of song, from shore to shore <lb/>
            For thee the Pastoral Muse attunes her lyre <lb/>
            To woeful utterance of passionate desire.</p>
          <p>Sicelidas, the famous Samian star, <lb/>
            And he with smiling eye and radiant face, <lb/>
            Cvdonian Lycidas, renowned afar, <lb/>
            Lament thee ; where quick Hales runs his race, <lb/>
            Philetus wails ; Theocritus, the grace <lb/>
            Of Syracuse, thee mourns ; nor these among <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            Am I remiss Ausonian wreaths to place <lb/>
            Around thy tomb : to me doth it belong <lb/>
            To chaunt for thee from whom I learnt the Dorian song.</p>
          <p>Me with thy minstrel skill as proper heir <lb/>
            Others thou didst endow with thine estate. <lb/>
            Alas ! alas ! when in a garden fair <lb/>
            Mallows, crisp dill, or parsley yields to fate, <lb/>
            These with another year rcgerminate ; <lb/>
            But when of mortal life the bloom and crown, <lb/>
            The wise, the good, the valiant, and the great <lb/>
            Succumb to death, in hollow earth shut down <lb/>
            We sleep-for ever sleep-for ever lie unknown.</p>
          <p>Thus art thou pent, while frogs may croak at will; <lb/>
            I envy not their croak. Thee poison slew- <lb/>
            How kept it in thy mouth its nature ill ? <lb/>
            If thou didst speak, what cruel wretch could brew <lb/>
            The draught ? He did, of course, thy song eschew. <lb/>
            But justice all o'ertakes. My tears fast flow <lb/>
            For thee, ray friend ! Could I, like Orpheus true, <lb/>
            Odysseus, or Alcides, pass below <lb/>
            To gloomy Tartarus, how quickly would I go !</p>
          <p>To see and haply hear thee sing for Dis ! <lb/>
            But in the Nymph's ear warble evermore, <lb/>
            My dearest friend ! thy sweetest harmonies : <lb/>
            For whilom, on her own Etnæan shore, <lb/>
            She sang wild snatches of the Dorian lore. <lb/>
            Nor will thy singing unrewarded be ; <lb/>
            Thee to thy mountain haunts she will restore, <lb/>
            As she gave Orpheus his Eurydice. <lb/>
            Could I charm Dis with songs, I too would sing for thee.</p>

            And parents in her country left behind. <lb/>
            With tear-stained cheek, and many a groan and sigh, <lb/>
            Alcmena to her son's wife made reply­</p>
          <p>" Why, hapless mother ! with this train of thought <lb/>
            Dost thou provoke the grief that comes unsought ? <lb/>
            Why dost thou talk these dreadful sorrows o'er, <lb/>
            Now wept by us—as we have wept before ? <lb/>
            Are not the new griefs that we look to see <lb/>
            From day to day, enough for you and me ? <lb/>
            Lover of dole were he, who would recount <lb/>
            Our tale of woes, and find their whole amount! <lb/>
            Take heart, and bear those ills we cannot cure, <lb/>
            But by the will of heaven we must endure. <lb/>
            And yet I cannot bid thee cease to grieve, <lb/>
            For even joy to spend itself has leave. <lb/>
            For thee I wail, why wert thou doomed, oh why, <lb/>
            To be a partner in our misery ? <lb/>
            I mourn that fate with ours thy fortune blends <lb/>
            Under the woe that over us impends. <lb/>
            Ye ! by whose names unpunished none forswear, <lb/>
            Persephona and dread Demeter, hear ! <lb/>
            Not less on thee has my true love reposed, <lb/>
            Than if my womb thy body had enclosed; <lb/>
            I love thee, sweetest! as an old-age child, <lb/>
            That has, beyond hope, on its mother smiled ; <lb/>
            Thou knowest this ; then say not, I implore, <lb/>
            I love thee not, or foster sorrow more, <lb/>
            Or in my grief I careless am of thee, <lb/>
            Though I weep more than e'er wept Niobe. <lb/>
            No blame is due to her with anguish wild, <note type="footnote">Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            Who hapless weeps for her unhappy child. <lb/>
            Ten weary months within my womb he lay- <lb/>
            What pains I suffered ere he came to day! <lb/>
            What pangs ! I all but said farewell to earth, <lb/>
            While yet my unborn lingered in the birth. <lb/>
            New toils now task him in a foreign plain- <lb/>
            Oh shall I ever see my son again ? <lb/>
            Besides, an awful vision of the night, <lb/>
            Scaring my sleep, hath filled me with affright, <lb/>
            And much I fear, when I my dream recall, <lb/>
            Lest some untoward thing my sons befall. <lb/>
            Methought, aside his cloak and tunic laid, <lb/>
            My Hercules with both hands grasped a spade, <lb/>
            And round a cultured field a mighty dyke <lb/>
            He delved, as one that toils for hire belike. <lb/>
            But when the dyke around the vineyard run, <lb/>
            And he was just about (his task now done, <lb/>
            The shovel thrown on the projecting rim,) <lb/>
            With his attire again to cover him ; <lb/>
            Sudden above the bank a fire burst out, <lb/>
            Whose greedy flames enclosed him round about: <lb/>
            He to the flames with rapid flight did yield, <lb/>
            Holding the spade before him as a shield, <lb/>
            And here and there he turned his anxious eye, <lb/>
            If he might shun his scorching enemy. <lb/>
            High-souled Iphicles, I remember well <lb/>
            As it me-seemed, rushing to help him, fell; <lb/>
            Nor could he raise himself from where he rolled, <lb/>
            But helpless lay there like some weak man old, <lb/>
            Tript up by joyless age against his will; <lb/>
            Stretched on the ground he was, and seeming still <lb/>
            Hopeless of rising, till a passer-by <lb/>
            In pity raised the hoar infirmity. <lb/>
            Thus helpless lay the warrior brave in fight; <lb/>
            And I did weep to see that sorry sight- <lb/>
            This son stretched feeble, that engirt with flame, <lb/>
            Till sleep forsook me and the day-dawn came. <lb/>
            Such frightful visions on my sleep did fall; <lb/>
            Ye gods ! on curst Eurystheus turn them all! <lb/>
            Oh be this presage true my wish supplies, <lb/>
            And may no god ordain it otherwise! ” <pb n="323"/>
