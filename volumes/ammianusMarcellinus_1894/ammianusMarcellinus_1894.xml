            <title type="main">PREFACE</title>
          </head>
          <p>OF Ammianus Marcellinus, the writer of the following <lb/>
            History, we know very little more than what can be col- <lb/>
            lected from that portion of it which remains to us. From <lb/>
            that source we learn that he was a native of Antioch, and <lb/>
            a soldier; being one of the prefectures domestici—the body- <lb/>
            guard of the emperor, into which none but men of noble birth <lb/>
            were admitted. He was on the staff of Ursicinus, whom <lb/>
            he attended in several of his expeditions; and he bore a <lb/>
            share in the campaigns which Julian made against the <lb/>
            Persians. After that time he never mentions himself, and <lb/>
            we are ignorant when he quitted the service and retired <lb/>
            to Rome, in which city he composed his History. We <lb/>
            know not when he was born, or when he died, except that <lb/>
            from one or two incidental passages in his work it is plain <lb/>
            that he lived nearly to the end of the fourth century: and <lb/>
            it is even uncertain whether he was a Christian or a Pagan; <lb/>
            though the general belief is, that he adhered to the religion <lb/>
            of the ancient Romans, without, however, permitting it to <lb/>
            lead him even to speak disrespectfully of Christians or <lb/>
            Christianity.</p>
          <p>His History, which he divided into thirty-one books (of <lb/>
            which the first thirteen are lost, while the text of those <lb/>
            which remain is in some places imperfect), began with the <lb/>
            accession of Nerva, A.D. 96, where Tacitus and Suetonius <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            end, and was continued to the death of Valens, A.D. 378, a <lb/>
            period of 282 years. And there is probably no work as to the <lb/>
            intrinsic value of which there is so little difference of opi- <lb/>
            nion. Gibbon bears repeated testimony to his accuracy, <lb/>
            fidelity, and impartiality, and quotes him extensively. In <lb/>
            losing his aid after A.D. 378, he says, " It is not without <lb/>
            sincere regret that I must now take leave of an accurate <lb/>
            and faithful guide, who has composed the history of his <lb/>
            own times without indulging the prejudices and passions <lb/>
            which usually affect the mind of a contemporary." Pro- <lb/>
            fessor Ramsay (in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman <lb/>
            Biography) says, " We are indebted to him for a know- <lb/>
            ledge of many important facts not elsewhere recorded, <lb/>
            and for much valuable insight into the modes of thought <lb/>
            and the general tone of public feeling prevalent in his <lb/>
            day. Nearly all the statements admitted appear to be <lb/>
            founded upon his own observations, or upon the informa- <lb/>
            tion derived from trustworthy eye-witnesses. A consider- <lb/>
            able number of dissertations and digressions are introduced, <lb/>
            many of them highly interesting and valuable. Such are <lb/>
            his notices of the institutions and manners of the Saracens <lb/>
            (xiv. 4), of the Scythians and Sarmatians (xvii. 12), of the <lb/>
            Huns and Alani (xxxi. 2), of the Egyptians and their <lb/>
            country (xxii. 6, 14-16), and his geographical discussions <lb/>
            upon Gaul (xv. 9), the Pontus (xxii. 8), and Thrace (xxvii. <lb/>
            4). Less legitimate and less judicious are his geological <lb/>
            speculations upon earthquakes (xvii. 7), his astronomical <lb/>
            inquiries into eclipses (xx. 3), comets (xxv. 10), and the <lb/>
            regulation of the calendar (xxvi. 1) ; his medical researches <lb/>
            into the origin of epidemics (xix. 4); his zoological theory <lb/>
            on the destruction of lions by mosquitos (xviii. 7), and his <lb/>
            horticultural essay on the impregnation of palms (xxiv. 3). <lb/>
            In addition to industry in research and honesty of purpose, <lb/>
            he was gifted with a large measure of strong common sense, <lb/>
            which enabled him in many points to rise superior to the <lb/>
            prejudices of his day, and with a clear-sighted independence <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            of spirit which prevented him from being dazzled or over- <lb/>
            awed by the brilliancy and the terrors which enveloped <lb/>
            the imperial throne. But although sufficiently acute in <lb/>
            detecting and exposing the follies of others, and especially <lb/>
            in ridiculing the absurdities of popular superstition, Am- <lb/>
            mianus did not entirely escape the contagion. The general <lb/>
            and deep-seated belief in magic spells, omens, prodigies, <lb/>
            and oracles, which appears to have gained additional <lb/>
            strength upon the first introduction of Christianity, evi- <lb/>
            dently exercised no small influence over his mind. The <lb/>
            old legends and doctrines of the pagan creed, and the <lb/>
            subtle mysticism which philosophers pretended to discover <lb/>
            lurking below, when mixed up with the pure and simple <lb/>
            but startling tenets of the new faith, formed a confused <lb/>
            mass which few intellects could reduce to order and har- <lb/>
            mony."</p>
          <p>The vices of our author's style, and his ambitious affect- <lb/>
            ation of ornament, are condemned by most critics ; but <lb/>
            some of the points which strike a modern reader as defects <lb/>
            evidently arise from the alteration which the Latin lan- <lb/>
            guage had already undergone since the days of Livy. His <lb/>
            great value, however, consists in the facts he has made <lb/>
            known to us, and is quite independent of the style or lan- <lb/>
            guage in which he has conveyed that knowledge, of which <lb/>
            without him we should have been nearly destitute.</p>
          <p>The present translation has been made from Wagner and <lb/>
            Erfurdt's edition, published at Leipzig in 1808, and their <lb/>
            division of chapters into short paragraphs has been fol- <lb/>
            lowed.</p>

          <p>§ 1, AFTER the events of an expedition full of almost in- <lb/>
            superable difficulties, while the spirits of all parties in the <lb/>
            state, broken by the variety of their dangers and toils, were <lb/>
            still enfeebled; while the clang of trumpets was ringing <lb/>
            in men's ears, and the troops were still distributed in their <lb/>
            winter quarters, the storms of angry fortune surrounded <lb/>
            the commonwealth with fresh dangers through the mani- <lb/>
            fold and terrible atrocities of Cæsar Gallus:1 who, when <lb/>
            just entering into the prime of life, having been raised with <note type="footnote"> 1 Gallus and his brother Julian were the nephews of the great Con- <lb/>
            stantine, sons of his brother Julius. When Constantius, who succeeded <lb/>
            Constantine on the throne, murdered his uncles and most of his cousins, <lb/>
            he spared these two, probably on account of their tender age. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. I</note> <lb/>
            unexpected honour from the lowest depth of misery to tho <lb/>
            highest rank, exceeded all the legitimate bounds of the <lb/>
            power conferred on him, and with preposterous violence <lb/>
            threw everything into confusion. For by his near relation- <lb/>
            ship to the royal family, and his connection with the name <lb/>
            of Constantine, he was so inflated with pride, that if he had <lb/>
            had more power, he would, as it seemed, have ventured <lb/>
            to attack even the author of his prosperity.</p>
          <p>2. His wife added fuel to his natural ferocity; she was a <lb/>
            woman immoderately proud of her sisterly relationship to <lb/>
            Augustus, and had been formerly given in marriage by <lb/>
            the elder Constantine to King Hannibalianus,1 his brother's <lb/>
            son. She was an' incarnate fury : never weary of inflam- <lb/>
            ing his savage temper, thirsting for human blood as <lb/>
            insatiably as her husband. The pair, in process of time, <lb/>
            becoming more skilful in the infliction of suffering, em- <lb/>
            ployed a gang of underhand and crafty talcbcarcrs, accus- <lb/>
            tomed in their wickedness to make random additions to <lb/>
            their discoveries, which consisted in general of such false- <lb/>
            hoods as they themselves delighted in ; and these men loaded <lb/>
            the innocent with calumnies, charging them with aiming at <lb/>
            kingly power, or with practising infamous acts of magic.</p>
          <p>3. And among his less remarkable atrocities, when his <lb/>
            power had gone beyond the bounds of moderate crimes, <lb/>
            was conspicuous the horrible and sudden death of a certain <lb/>
            noble citizen of Alexandria, named Clematius. His <lb/>
            mother-in-law, having conceived a passion for him, could <lb/>
            not prevail on him to gratify it; and in consequence, as <note type="footnote">1 Hannibalianus was another nephew of Constantine. That emperor <lb/>
            raised his own three sons, Constantine, Constantius, and Constans, to <lb/>
            the dignity of Cæsar; and of his two favourite nephews, Dahnaeius <lb/>
            and Hannibalianus, lie raised the first, by the title of Cæsar, to an <lb/>
            equality with his cousins; " in favour of the latter he invented the <lb/>
            new and singular appellatiou of Fortitissimus, to which he annexed <lb/>
            the flattering distinction of a robe of purple aud gold. But of the <lb/>
            whole series of Roman princes in any age of the empire Hannibalianus <lb/>
            alone was distinguished by the title of king, a name which the subjects <lb/>
            of Tiberius would have detested as the profane and cruel insult of <lb/>
            capricious tyranny."—Gibbon, cxviii. The editor of Bohn's edition <lb/>
            adds in a note : "The title given to Hannibalianus did not apply to <lb/>
            him as a Roman prince, but as king of a territory assigned to him in <lb/>
            Asia. This territory consisted of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the lesser <lb/>
            Armenia, the city of Cæsarea being chosen for his residence."—Gibbon, <lb/>
            Bohn's edition, vol. ii. pp. 256, 257. </note> <pb n="3"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            was reported, she, having obtained an introduction by a <lb/>
            secret door into the palace, won over the queen by the <lb/>
            present of a costly necklace, and procured a fatal warrant <lb/>
            to be sent to Honoratus, at that time count-governor of the <lb/>
            East, in compliance with which Clematius was put to <lb/>
            death, a man wholly innocent of any kind of wickedness, <lb/>
            without being permitted to say a word in his defence.</p>
          <p>4. After this iniquitous transaction, which struck others <lb/>
            also with fear lest they should meet with similar treat- <lb/>
            ment, as if cruelty had now obtained a licence, many were <lb/>
            condemned on mere vague suspicion ; of whom some were <lb/>
            put to death, others were punished by the confiscation of <lb/>
            their property, and driven forth as exiles from their <lb/>
            homes, so that having nothing left but their tears and <lb/>
            complaints, they were reduced to live on the contributions <lb/>
            of their friends; and many opulent and famous houses were <lb/>
            shut up, the old constitutional and just authority being <lb/>
            changed into a government at the will of a bloodthirsty <lb/>
            tyrant.</p>
          <p>5. Nor amid these manifold atrocities was any testimony <lb/>
            of an accuser, not even of a suborned one, sought for, in <lb/>
            order to give at least an appearance of these crimes being <lb/>
            committed according to law and statute, as veiy commonly <lb/>
            even the most cruel princes have done: but whatever <lb/>
            suited the implacable temper of Cæsar was instantly accom- <lb/>
            plished in haste, as if its accordance with human and <lb/>
            divine law had been well considered.</p>
          <p>6. After these deeds a fresh device was adopted, and a <lb/>
            body of obscure men, such as, by reason of the meanness <lb/>
            of their condition, were little likely to excite suspicion, <lb/>
            were sent through all the districts of Antioch, to collect <lb/>
            reports, and to bring news of whatever they might hear. <lb/>
            They, travelling about, and concealing their object, joined <lb/>
            clandestinely in the conversational circles of honourable <lb/>
            men, and also in disguise obtained entrance into the houses <lb/>
            of the rich. When they returned they were secretly ad- <lb/>
            mitted by back doors into the palace, and then reported <lb/>
            all that they had been able to hear or to collect; taking <lb/>
            care with an unanimous kind of conspiracy to invent <lb/>
            many things, and to exaggerate for the worse all they really <lb/>
            knew ; at the same time suppressing any praises of Cæsar <lb/>
            which had come to their ears, although these were wrung <pb n="4"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH. I. </note> <lb/>
            from many, against their consciences, by the dread of <lb/>
            impending evils.</p>
          <p>7. And it had happened sometimes that, if in his secret <lb/>
            chamber, when no domestic servant was by, the master of <lb/>
            the house had whispered anything into his wife's ear, the <lb/>
            very next day, as if those renowned seers of old, Amphia- <lb/>
            raus or Marcius, had been at hand to report it, the <lb/>
            emperor was informed of what had been said; so that <lb/>
            even the walls of a man's secret chamber, the only wit- <lb/>
            nesses to his language, were viewed with apprehension.</p>
          <p>8. And Cæsar's fixed resolution to inquire into these <lb/>
            and other similar occurrences was increased by the queen, <lb/>
            who constantly stimulated his desire, and was driving on <lb/>
            the fortunes of her husband to headlong destruction, while <lb/>
            she ought rather, by giving him useful advice, to have led <lb/>
            him back into the paths of truth and mercy, by feminine <lb/>
            gentleness, as, in recounting the acts of the Gordiani, we <lb/>
            have related to have been done by the wife of that trucu- <lb/>
            lent emperor Maximums.</p>
          <p>9. At last, by an unsurpassed and most pernicious <lb/>
            baseness, Gallus ventured on adopting a course of fearful <lb/>
            wickedness, which indeed Gallicnus, to his. own exceed- <lb/>
            ing infamy, is said formerly to have tried at Rome; and, <lb/>
            taking with him a few followers secretly armed, he used <lb/>
            to rove in the evening through the streets and among the <lb/>
            shops, making inquiries in the Greek language, in which <lb/>
            he was well skilled, what were the feelings of individuals <lb/>
            towards Cæsar. And he used to do this boldly in the city, <lb/>
            where the brillancy of the lamps at night often equalled <lb/>
            the light of day. At last, being often recognized, and <lb/>
            considering that if he went out in this way he should be <lb/>
            known, he took care never to go out except openly in broad <lb/>
            daylight, to transact whatever business which he thought <lb/>
            of serious importance. And these things caused bitter <lb/>
            though secret lamentation, and discontent to many.</p>
          <p>10. But at that time Thalassius was the present prefect1 <lb/>
            of the palace, a man of an arrogant temper; and he, per- <note type="footnote">1 " There was among the commanders of the soldiery one prefect <lb/>
            who was especially entitled Præsens. or Præsentalis. because his office <lb/>

            ceiving that the hasty fury of Gallus gradually increased <lb/>
            to the danger of many of the citizens, did not mollify it by <lb/>
            either delay or wise counsels, as men in high officc have <lb/>
            very often pacified the anger of their princes; but by <lb/>
            untimely opposition and reproof, did often excite him the <lb/>
            more to frenzy; often also informing Augustus of his <lb/>
            actions, and that too with exaggeration, and taking care, <lb/>
            I know not with what intention, that what he did should <lb/>
            not be unknown to the emperor. And at this Cæsar soon <lb/>
            became more vehemently exasperated, and, as if raising <lb/>
            more on high than ever the standard of his contumacy, <lb/>
            without any regard to the safety of others or of himself, he <lb/>
            bore himself onwards like a rapid torrent, with an impe- <lb/>
            tuosity which would listen to no reason, to sweep away all <lb/>
            the obstacles which opposed his will.</p>

          <p>§ 1. NOR indeed was the East the only quarter which this <lb/>
            plague affected with its various disasters. For the <lb/>
            Isaurians also, a people who were accustomed to frequent <lb/>
            alternations of peace, and of turbulence which threw <lb/>
            everything into confusion with sudden outbreaks—impu- <lb/>
            nity having fostered their growing audacity and encouraged <lb/>
            it to evil-broke out in a formidable war. Being especially <lb/>
            excited, as they gave out by this indignity, that some of <lb/>
            their allies, having been taken prisoners, were in an unpre- <lb/>
            cedented manner exposed to wild beasts, and in the games <lb/>
            of the amphitheatre, at Iconium, a town of Pisidia.</p>
          <p>2. And as Cicero1 says, that " even wild beasts, when <lb/>
            reminded by hunger, generally return to that place where <lb/>
            they have been fed before." So they all, descending like a <lb/>
            whirlwind from their high and pathless mountains, came <lb/>
            into the districts bordering on the sea: in which hiding <lb/>
            themselves in roads full of lurking-places, and in defiles, <lb/>
            when the long nights were approaching, the moon being at <lb/>
            that time new, and so not yet giving her full light, they <lb/>
            lay wait for the sailors ; and when they perceived that they <lb/>
            .were wrapped in sleep, they, crawling on their hands and <lb/>
            feet along the cables which held the anchors, and raising <lb/>
            themselves up by them, swung themselves into the boats, <note type="footnote">1 The passage is found in Cicero a Oration pro Cluentio, c. 25. </note> <pb n="6"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. II</note> <lb/>
            and so came upon the crews unexpectedly, and, their <lb/>
            natural ferocity being inflamed by covetousness, they <lb/>
            spared not even those who offered no resistance, but slew <lb/>
            them all, and carried off a splendid booty with no more <lb/>
            trouble than if it had been valueless.</p>
          <p>3. This conduct did not last long, for when the deaths <lb/>
            of the crows thus plundercd and slaughtered became <lb/>
            known, no one afterwards brought a vessel to the stations <lb/>
            on that coast; but, avoiding them as they would have <lb/>
            avoided the deadly precipices of Sciron,' they sailed on, <lb/>
            without halting, to the shores of Cyprus, which lie oppo- <lb/>
            site to the rocks of Isauria.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore as time went on, and no foreign vessels <lb/>
            went there any more, they quitted the sea-coast, and be- <lb/>
            took themselves to Lycaonia, a country which lies on the <lb/>
            borders of Isauria. And there, occupying the roads with <lb/>
            thick barricades, they sought a living by plundering the <lb/>
            inhabitants of the district, as well as travellers. These <lb/>
            outrages aroused the soldiers who were dispersed among <lb/>
            the many municipal towns and forts which lie on the <lb/>
            borders. And they, endeavouring to the utmost of their <lb/>
            strength to repel these banditti, who were spreading every <lb/>
            day more widely, sometimes in solid bodies, at others in <lb/>
            small straggling parties, were overcome by their vast <lb/>
            numbers.</p>
          <p>5. Since the Isaurians, having been born and brought up <lb/>
            amid the entangled defiles of lofty mountains, could bound <lb/>
            over them as over plain and easy paths, and attacked all <lb/>
            who came in their way with missiles fium a distance, <lb/>
            terrifying them at the same time with savage yells.</p>
          <p>6. And very often our infantry were compelled in <lb/>
            pursuit of them to climb lofty crags, and, when their feet <lb/>
            slipped, to catch hold of the shrubs and briars to raise <lb/>
            themselves to the summits ; without ever being able to <lb/>
            deploy into battle array, by reason of the narrow and <lb/>
            difficult nature of the ground, nor even to stand firm; <lb/>
            while their enemy running round in every direction <lb/>
            hurled down upon them fragments of rock from above <lb/>
            till they retired down the declivities with great danger. <note type="footnote"> 1 Sciron was a pirate slain by Theseus, v. Ov. Metam. vii. 44, and <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            Or else, sometimes, in the last necessity fighting bravely, <lb/>
            they were overwhelmed with fragments of immense bulk <lb/>
            and weight.</p>
          <p>7. On this account they subsequently were forced to <lb/>
            observe more caution, and whenever the plunderers began <lb/>
            to retire to the high ground, our soldiers yielded to the <lb/>
            unfavourable character of the country and retired. But <lb/>
            whenever they could be met with in the plain, which often <lb/>
            happened, then charging them without giving them time <lb/>
            to combine their strength, or even to brandish the javelins <lb/>
            of which they always carried two or three, they slaughtered <lb/>
            them like defenceless sheep.</p>
          <p>8. So that these banditti, conceiving a fear of Lycaonia, <lb/>
            which is for the most part a champaign country, since <lb/>
            they had learnt by repeated proofs that they were unequal <lb/>
            to our troops in a pitched battle, betook themselves by <lb/>
            unfrequented tracks to Pamphylia. This district had long <lb/>
            been free from the evils of war, but nevertheless had been <lb/>
            fortified in all quarters by strong forts and garrisons, from <lb/>
            the dread entertained by the people of rapine and slaugh- <lb/>
            ter, since soldiers were scattered over all the neighbouring <lb/>
            districts.</p>
          <p>9. Therefore hastening with all speed, in order by their <lb/>
            exceeding celerity of movement to anticipate all rumour of <lb/>
            their motions, trusting to their strength and activity of <lb/>
            body, they travelled by winding roads until they reached <lb/>
            the high ground on the tops of the mountains, the steep- <lb/>
            ness of which delayed their march more than they had <lb/>
            expected. And when at last, having surmounted all the <lb/>
            difficulties of the mountains, they came to the precipitous <lb/>
            banks of the Melas, a deep river and one full of dangerous <lb/>
            currents, which winds round the district, protecting the <lb/>
            inhabitants like a wall, the night which had overtaken <lb/>
            them increased their fears, so that they halted for a while <lb/>
            awaiting the daylight. For they expected to be able to cross <lb/>
            without hindrance, and then, in consequence of the sudden- <lb/>
            ness of their inroad, to be able to ravage all the country <lb/>
            around ; but they had incurred great toil to no purpose.</p>
          <p>10. For when the sun rose they were prevented from <lb/>
            crossing by the size of the river, which though narrow was <lb/>
            very deep. And while they were searching for some <lb/>
            fishing-boats, or preparing to commit themselves to the <pb n="8"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH. II </note> <lb/>
            stream on rafts hastily put together, the legions which at <lb/>
            that time were wintering about Side, came down upon <lb/>
            them with great speed and impetuosity; and having <lb/>
            pitched their standards close to the bank with a view to an <lb/>
            immediate battle, they packed their shields together before <lb/>
            them in a most skilful manner, and without any difficulty <lb/>
            slew some of the banditti, who either trusted to their <lb/>
            swimming, or who tried to cross the river unperceived in <lb/>
            barks made of the trunks of trees hollowed out.</p>
          <p>11. And the Jsaurians having tried many devices to <lb/>
            obtain success in a regular battle, and having failed in <lb/>
            everything, being repulsed in great consternation, and <lb/>
            with great vigour on the part of the legions, and being <lb/>
            uncertain which way to go, came near the town of La- <lb/>
            randa. And there, after they had refreshed themselves <lb/>
            with food and rest, and recovered from their fears, they at- <lb/>
            tacked several wealthy towns; but being presently scared <lb/>
            by the support given to the citizens by some squadrons <lb/>
            of horse which happened to be at hand, and which they <lb/>
            would not venture to resist in the extensive plains, they <lb/>
            retreated, and retracing their steps summoned all the flower <lb/>
            of their youth which had been left at home to join them.</p>
          <p>12. And as they were oppressed with severe famine, they <lb/>
            made for a place called Palea, standing on the sea-shore, <lb/>
            and fortified with a strong wall; where even to this day <lb/>
            supplies are usually kept in store, to be distributed to the <lb/>
            armies which defend the frontier of Isauria.</p>
          <p>13. Therefore they encamped around this fortress for <lb/>
            three days and three nights, and as the steepness of the <lb/>
            ground on which it stood prevented any attempt to storm <lb/>
            it without the most deadly peril, and as it was impossible <lb/>
            to effect anything by mines, and no other manoeuvres <lb/>
            such as are employed in sieges availed anything, they <lb/>
            retired much dejected, being compelled by the necessities <lb/>
            of their situation to undertake some enterprise, even if it <lb/>
            should be greater than their strength was equal to.</p>
          <p>14. Then giving way to greater fury than ever, being <lb/>
            inflamed both by despair and hunger, and their strength <lb/>
            increased by their unrestrainable ardour, they directed <lb/>
            their efforts to destroy the city of Seleucia, the metropolis <lb/>
            of the province, which was defended by Count Castueius, <lb/>
            whose legions were inured to every kind of military service. <pb n="9"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> 15. The commanders of the garrison being forewarned <lb/>
            of their approach by their own trusty scouts, having, ac- <lb/>
            cording to custom, given out the watchword to the troops, <lb/>
            led forth all their forces in a rapid sally, and having with <lb/>
            great activity passed the bridge over the river Calicadnus, <lb/>
            the mighty waters of which wash the turrets of the walls, <lb/>
            they drew out their men as if prepared for battle. But <lb/>
            as yet no man left the ranks, and the army was not <lb/>
            allowed' to engage; for the band of the Isaurians was <lb/>
            dreaded, inasmuch as they were desperate with rage, and <lb/>
            superior in number, and likely to rush upon the arms of <lb/>
            the legions without any regard to their lives. There- <lb/>
            fore as soon as the army was beheld at a distance, <lb/>
            and the music of the trumpeters was heard, the banditti <lb/>
            halted and stood still for a while, brandishing their <lb/>
            threatening swords, and after a time they marched on <lb/>
            slowly. And when the steady Roman soldiery began to <lb/>
            deploy, preparing. to encounter them, beating their shields <lb/>
            with their spears (a custom which rouses the fury of the <lb/>
            combatants, and strikes terror into their enemies), they <lb/>
            filled the front ranks of the Isaurians with consternation. <lb/>
            But as the troops were pressing forward eagerly to the <lb/>
            combat their generals recalled them, thinking it inoppor- <lb/>
            tune to enter upon a contest of doubtful issue, when their <lb/>
            walls were not far distant, under protection of which the <lb/>
            safety of the whole army could be placed on a solid <lb/>
            foundation.</p>
          <p>16. Therefore the soldiers were brought back inside the <lb/>
            walls in accordance with this- resolution, and all the ap- <lb/>
            proaches and gates were strongly barred ; and the men <lb/>
            were placed on the battlements and bulwarks, having vast <lb/>
            stones and weapons of all kinds piled close at hand, so that <lb/>
            if any one forced his way inside he might be overwhelmed <lb/>
            with a multitude of missiles and stones.</p>
          <p>17. But those who were shut up in the walls were at <lb/>
            the same time greatly afflicted, because the Isaurians <lb/>
            having taken some vessels which were conveying grain <lb/>
            down the river, were well provided with abundance of <lb/>
            food, while they themselves, having almost consumed the <lb/>
            usual stores of food, were in a state of alarm dreading the <lb/>
            fatal agonies of approaching famine. When the news of <lb/>
            this distress got abroad, and when repeated messages <pb n="10"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH. III. </note> <lb/>
            to this effect had moved Gallus Caesar, because the master <lb/>
            of the horse was kept away longer than usual at that <lb/>
            season, Nebridius the count of the East was ordered to <lb/>
            collect a military force from all quarters, and -hastened <lb/>
            forward with exceeding zeal to deliver the city, so wealthy <lb/>
            and important, from such a peril. And when this was <lb/>
            known the banditti retired, without having performed <lb/>
            any memorable exploit, and dispersing, according to their <lb/>
            wont, they sought the trackless recesses of the lofty <lb/>
            mountains.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE affairs were in this state in Isauria, and while the <lb/>
            king of Persia was involved in wars upon his frontier, <lb/>
            repulsing from his borders a set of ferocious tribes which, <lb/>
            being full of ficklcness, were continually either attacking <lb/>
            him in a hostile manner, or, as often happens, aiding him <lb/>
            when he turned his arms against us, a certain noble, by name <lb/>
            Nohodares, having been appointed to invade Mesopotamia, <lb/>
            whenever occasion might serve, was anxiously exploring <lb/>
            our territories with a view to some sudden incursion, if he <lb/>
            could anywhere find an opportunity.</p>
          <p>2. And because since every part of Mesopotamia is accus- <lb/>
            temcd to be disturbed continually, the lands were pro- <lb/>
            tected by frequent barriers, and military stations in the rural <lb/>
            districts, Nohodares, having directed his march to the left. <lb/>
            had occupied the most remote parts of the Osdrocne, having <lb/>
            devised a novel plan of operations which had never <lb/>
            hitherto been tried. And if he had succeeded he would <lb/>
            have laid waste the whole country like a thunderbolt.</p>
          <p>3. Now the plan which he had conceived was of this kind. <lb/>
            There is a town in Anthemusia called Batne, built by the <lb/>
            ancient Macedonians, a short distance from the river Eu- <lb/>
            phrates, thickly peopled by wealthy merchants. To this <lb/>
            city, about the beginning of the month of September, a <lb/>
            great multitude of all ranks throng to a fair, in order to <lb/>
            buy the wares which the Indians and Chinese send thither, <lb/>
            and many other articles which are usually brought to this <lb/>
            fair by land and sea.</p>
          <p>4. The leader before named, preparing to invade this <lb/>
            district on the days set apart for this solemnity, marching <lb/>
            through the deserts and along the grassy banks of the <pb n="11"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            river Abora, was betrayed by information given by some <lb/>
            of his own men, who being alarmed at the discovery of <lb/>
            certain crimes which they had committed, deserted to the <lb/>
            Roman garrisons, and accordingly he retired again without <lb/>
            having accomplished anything; and after that remained <lb/>
            quiet without undertaking any further enterprise.</p>

            never desirable to have either for friends or enemies, <lb/>
            ranging up and down the country, if ever they found any- <lb/>
            thing, plundered it in a moment, like rapacious hawks <lb/>
            who, if from on high they behold any prey, carry it off <lb/>
            with rapid swoop, or, if they fail in their attempt, do not <lb/>

            Marcus, and once or twice subsequently, I remember <lb/>
            having discussed the manners of this people, nevertheless <lb/>
            I will now briefly enumerate a few more particulars con- <lb/>
            cerning them.</p>
          <p>3. Among these tribes, whose primary origin is derived <lb/>
            from the cataracts of the Nile and the borders of the Blem- <lb/>
            myæ, all the men are warriors of equal rank; half naked, <lb/>
            clad in coloured cloaks down to the waist, overrunning <lb/>
            different countries, with the aid of swift and active horses <lb/>
            and speedy camels, alike in times of peace and war. Nor <lb/>
            does any member of their tribes ever take plough in hand <lb/>
            or cultivate a tree, or seek food by the tillage of the land; <lb/>
            but they are perpetually wandering over various and <lb/>
            extensive districts, having no home, no fixed abode or <lb/>
            laws; nor can they endure to remain long in the same <lb/>
            climate, no one district or country pleasing them for a <lb/>
            continuance.</p>
          <p>4. Their life is one continued wandering; their wives <lb/>
            are hired, on special covenant, for a fixed time; and that <lb/>
            there may be some appearance of marriage in the business, <lb/>
            the intended wife, under the name of a dowry, offers <lb/>
            spear and a tent to her husband, with a right to quit him <lb/>
            after a fixed day, if she should choose to do so. And it is <lb/>
            inconceivable with what eagerness the individuals of botk <lb/>
            sexes give themselves up to matrimonial pleasures. <pb n="12"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. V. </note> 5. But as long as they live they wander about with such <lb/>
            extensive and perpetual migrations, that the woman is <lb/>
            married in one place, brings forth her children in another, <lb/>
            and roars them at a distance from either place, no oppor- <lb/>
            tunity of remaining quiet being ever granted to her.</p>
          <p>6. They all live on venison, and arc further supported <lb/>
            on a great abundance of milk, and on many kinds of herbs, <lb/>
            and on whatever birds they can catch by fowling. And <lb/>
            we have seen a great many of them wholly ignorant of the <lb/>
            use of either corn or wine.</p>
          <p>7. So much for this most mischievous nation. Now let <lb/>
            us return to the subject we originally proposed to our <lb/>
            selves.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE these events were taking place in the East, Con- <lb/>
            stantius was passing the winter at Aries ; and after an <lb/>
            exhibition of games in the theatre and in the circus, which <lb/>
            were displayed with most sumptuous magnificence, on the <lb/>
            tenth of October, the day which completed the thirtieth <lb/>
            year of his reign, he began to give the reins more freely <lb/>
            to his insolence, believing every information which was <lb/>
            laid before him as proved, however doubtful or false it <lb/>
            might be; and among other acts of cruelty, he put Geron- <lb/>
            tius, a count of the party of Magnentius, to the torture, <lb/>
            and then condemned him to banishment.</p>
          <p>2. And as the body of a sick man is apt to be agitated <lb/>
            by even trifling grievances, so his narrow and sensitive <lb/>
            mind, thinking every sound that stirred something either <lb/>
            done or planned to the injury of his safety, made his <lb/>
            victory 1 mournful by the slaughter of innocent men.</p>
          <p>3. For if any one of his military officers, or of those <lb/>
            who had ever received marks of honour, or if any one of <lb/>
            high rank was accused, on the barest rumour, of having <lb/>
            favoured the faction of his enemy, he was loaded with <lb/>
            chains and dragged about like a beast. And whether any <lb/>
            enemy of the accused man pressed him or not, as if the <note type="footnote">1 His victory over Magnentius, whom he defeated at Mursa, on the <lb/>
            Doave, in the year 351. Magnentius fled to Aqaileia, but was pursued, <lb/>
            and again defeated the next year, at a place called Mons Seleuci, in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of Gap, and threw himself on his own sword to <lb/>
            avoid falling into the hands of Constantius. </note> <pb n="13"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            mere fact that his name had been mentioned was sufficient, <lb/>
            every one who was informed against or in any way called <lb/>
            in question, was condemned either to death, or to confis- <lb/>
            cation of his property, or to confinement in a desert <lb/>
            island.</p>
          <p>4. For his ferocity was excited to a still further degree <lb/>
            when any mention, was made of treason or sedition; and <lb/>
            the bloodthirsty insinuations of those around him, ex- <lb/>
            aggerating everything that happened, and pretending <lb/>
            great concern at any danger which might threaten the life <lb/>
            of the emperor, on whose safety, as on a thread, they <lb/>
            hypocritically exclaimed the whole world depended, added <lb/>
            daily to his suspicions and watchful anger.</p>
          <p>5. And therefore it is reported he gave orders that <lb/>
            no one who was at any time sentenced to punishment <lb/>
            for these or similar offences should be readmitted to his <lb/>
            presence for the purpose of offering the usual testimonies <lb/>
            to his character, a thing which the most implacable princes <lb/>
            have been wont to permit. And thus deadly cruelty, <lb/>
            which in all other men at times grows cool, in him only <lb/>
            became more violent as he advanced in years, because the <lb/>
            court of flatterers which attended on him added continual <lb/>
            fuel to his stern obstinacy,</p>
          <p>6. Of this court a most conspicuous member was Paulus, <lb/>
            the secretary, a native of Spain, a man keeping his objects <lb/>
            hidden beneath a smooth countenance, and acute beyond <lb/>
            all men in smelling out secret ways to bring others into <lb/>
            danger. He, having been sent into Britain to arrest some <lb/>
            military officers who had dared to favour the conspiracy <lb/>
            of Magnentius, as they could not resist, licentiously <lb/>
            exceeded his commands, and like a flood poured with <lb/>
            sudden violence upon the fortunes of a great number <lb/>
            of people, making his path through manifold slaughter <lb/>
            and destruction, loading the bodies of free-born men with <lb/>
            chains, and crushing some with fetters, while patching <lb/>
            up all kinds of accusations far removed from the <lb/>
            truth. And to this man is owing one especial atrocity <lb/>
            which has branded the time of Constantius with indelible <lb/>
            infamy.</p>
          <p>7. Martinus, who at that time governed these provinces <lb/>
            as deputy, being greatly concerned for the sufferings in- <lb/>
            flicted on innocent men, and making frequent entreaties <pb n="14"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH. VI </note> <lb/>
            that those who were free from all guilt might be spared, <lb/>
            when he found that he could not prevail, threatened to <lb/>
            withdraw from the province, in the hope that this male- <lb/>
            volent inquisitor, Paulus, might be afraid of his doing so, <lb/>
            and so give over exposing to open danger men who had <lb/>
            combined only in a wish for tranquillity.</p>
          <p>8. Paulus, thinking that this conduct of Martinus was <lb/>
            a hindrance to his own zeal, being, as he was, a formidable <lb/>
            artist in involving matters, from which people gave him <lb/>
            the nickname of " the Chain," attacked the deputy him- <lb/>
            self while still engaged in defending the people whom he <lb/>
            was set to govern, and involved him in the dangers which <lb/>
            surrounded every one else, threatening that he would carry <lb/>
            him, with his tribunes and many other persons, as a pri- <lb/>
            soner to the emperor's court. Martinus, alarmed at this <lb/>
            threat, and seeing the imminent danger in which his life <lb/>
            was, drew his sword and attacked Paulus. But because <lb/>
            from want of strength in his hand he was unable to give <lb/>
            him a mortal wound, he then plunged his drawn sword <lb/>
            into his own side. And by this unseemly kind of death <lb/>
            that most just man departed from life, merely for having <lb/>
            dared to interpose some delay to the miserable calamities <lb/>
            of many citizens.</p>
          <p>9. And when these wicked deeds had been perpetrated, <lb/>
            Paulus, covered with blood, returned to the emperor's <lb/>
            camp, bringing with him a crowd of prisoners almost <lb/>
            covered with chains, in the lowest condition of squalor <lb/>
            and misery; on whose arrival the racks were prepared, <lb/>
            and the executioner began to prepare his hooks and other <lb/>
            engines of torture. Of these prisoners, many of them had <lb/>
            their property confiscated, others were sentenced to banish- <lb/>
            ment, some were given over to the sword of the exe- <lb/>
            cutioner. Nor is it easy to cite the acquittal of a single <lb/>
            person in the time of Constantius, where the slightest <lb/>
            whisper of accusation had been brought against him.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AT this time Orfitus was the governor of the Eternal <lb/>
            City, with the rank of prefect; and he behaved with a <lb/>
            degree of insolence beyond the proper limits of the dignity <lb/>
            thus conferred upon him. A man of prudence indeed, and <pb n="15"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            well skilled in all the forensic business of the city, but <lb/>
            less accomplished in general literature and in the fine arts <lb/>
            than was becoming in a nobleman. Under his adminis- <lb/>
            tration some very formidable seditions broke out in con- <lb/>
            sequence of the scarcity of wine, as the people, being <lb/>
            exceedingly eager for an abundant use of that article, were <lb/>
            easily excited to frequent and violent disorders.</p>
          <p>2. And since I think it likely that foreigners who may <lb/>
            read this account (if, indeed, any such should meet with <lb/>
            it) are likely to wonder how it is that, when my history <lb/>
            has reached the point of narrating what was done at Rome, <lb/>
            nothing is spoken of but seditions, and shops, and cheap- <lb/>
            ness, and other similarly inconsiderable matters, I will <lb/>
            briefly touch upon the causes of this, never intentionally <lb/>
            departing from the strict truth.</p>
          <p>3. At the time when Rome first rose into mundane <lb/>
            brillianey—that Rome which was fated to last as long as <lb/>
            mankind shall endure, and to be increased with a sublime <lb/>
            progress and growth-virtue and fortune, though com- <lb/>
            monly at variance, agreed upon a treaty of eternal peace, <lb/>
            as far as she was concerned. For if either of them had <lb/>
            been wanting to her, she would never have reached her <lb/>
            perfect and complete supremacy.</p>
          <p>4. Her people, from its very earliest infancy to the latest <lb/>
            moment of its youth, a period which extends over about <lb/>
            three hundred years, carried on a variety of wars with the <lb/>
            natives around its walls. Then, when it arrived at its <lb/>
            full-grown manhood, after many and various labours in <lb/>
            war, it crossed the Alps and the sea, till, as youth and man, <lb/>
            it had carried the triumphs of victory into every country <lb/>
            in the world.</p>
          <p>5. And now that it is declining into old age, and often <lb/>
            owes its victories to its mere name, it has come to a more <lb/>
            tranquil time of life. Therefore the venerable city, after <lb/>
            having bowed down the haughty necks of fierce nations, <lb/>
            and given laws to the world, to be the foundations and <lb/>
            eternal anchors of liberty, like a thrifty parent, prudent <lb/>
            and rich, intrusted to the Cæsars, as to its own children, <lb/>
            the right of governing their ancestral inheritance.</p>
          <p>6. And although the tribes are indolent, and the <lb/>
            countries peaceful, and although there are no contests for <lb/>
            votes, but the tranquillity of the age of Numa has returned, <pb n="16"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. VI </note> <lb/>
            nevertheless, in every quarter of the world Rome is still <lb/>
            looked up to as the mistress and the queen of the earth, <lb/>
            and the name of the Roman people is respected and <lb/>
            venerated.</p>
          <p>7. But this magnificent splendour of the assemblies and <lb/>
            councils of the Roman people is defaced by the inconside- <lb/>
            rate levity of a few, who never recollect where they have <lb/>
            been born, but who fall away into error and licentiousness, <lb/>
            as if a perfect impunity were granted to vice. For as the <lb/>
            lyric poet Simonides teaches us, the man who would live <lb/>
            happily in accordance with perfect reason, ought above all <lb/>
            things to have a glorious country.</p>
          <p>8. Of these men, some thinking that they can be handed <lb/>
            down to immortality by means of statues, are eagerly <lb/>
            desirous of them, as if they would obtain a higher reward <lb/>
            from brazen figures unendowed with sense than from a <lb/>
            consciousness of upright and honourable actions ; and they <lb/>
            even are anxious to have them plated over with gold, a <lb/>
            thing which is reported to have been first done in the in- <lb/>
            stance of Acilius Glabrio, who by his wisdom and valour <lb/>
            had subdued King Antiochus. But how really noble a <lb/>
            thing it is to despise all these inconsiderable and trifling <lb/>
            things, and to bend one's attention to the long and toilsome <lb/>
            steps of true glory, as the poet of Aserea1 has sung, and Cato <lb/>
            the Censor has shown by his example. For when he was <lb/>
            asked how it was that while many other nobles had statues <lb/>
            he had none, replied : " I had rather that good men should <lb/>
            marvel how it was that I did not earn one, than (what <lb/>
            would be a much heavier misfortune) inquire how it was <lb/>
            that I had obtained one."</p>
          <p>9. Others place the height ot glory in having a coach <lb/>
            higher than usual, or splendid apparel; and so toil and <lb/>
            sweat under a vast burden of cloaks, which are fastened <lb/>
            to their necks by many clasps, and blow about from the <lb/>
            excessive fineness of the material; showing a desire, by <lb/>
            the continual wriggling of their bodies, and especially by <lb/>
            the waving of the left hand, to make their long fringes and <lb/>
            tunics, embroidered in multiform figures of animals with <lb/>
            threads of various colours, more conspicuous.</p>
          <p>10. Others, with not any one asking them, put on a <note type="footnote">1 Hesiod. Ammianus refers to the passage in Hesiod's Op. et Dies, <lb/>
            289, beginning—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς δ᾽ ἀρετῆς ίδρῶτα θεοὶ προπάοοιθεν ἒθησαν</foreign>. </note> <pb n="17"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            feigned severity of countenance, and extol their patrimonial <lb/>
            estates in a boundless degree, exaggerating the yearly pro- <lb/>
            duce of their fruitful fields, which they boast of possessing <lb/>
            in numbers from east to west, being forsooth ignorant that <lb/>
            their ancestors, by whom the greatness of Rome was so <lb/>
            widely extended, were not eminent for riches ; but through <lb/>
            a course of dreadful wars overpowered by their valour all <lb/>
            who were opposed to them, though differing but little from <lb/>
            the common soldiers either in riches, or in their mode of life, <lb/>
            or in the costliness of their garments.</p>
          <p>11. This is how it happened that Valerius Publicola was <lb/>
            buried by the contributions of his friends, and that the <lb/>
            destitute wife of Regulus was, with her children, supported <lb/>
            by the aid of the friends of her husband, and that the <lb/>
            daughter of Scipio had a dowry provided for her out of the <lb/>
            public treasury, the other nobles being ashamed to see the <lb/>
            beauty of this full-grown maiden, while her moneyless <lb/>
            father was so long absent on the service of his country.</p>
          <p>12. But now if you, as an honourable stranger, should <lb/>
            enter the house of any one well off, and on that account <lb/>
            full of pride, for the purpose of saluting him, at first, <lb/>
            indeed, you will be hospitably received, as though your <lb/>
            presence had been desired; and after having had many <lb/>
            questions put to you, and having been forced to tell a <lb/>
            number of lies, you will wonder, since the man had never <lb/>
            seen you before, that one of high rank should pay such <lb/>
            attention to you who are but an unimportant individual; <lb/>
            so that by reason of this as a principal source of happiness, <lb/>
            you begin to repent of not having come to Rome ten years <lb/>
            ago.</p>
          <p>13. And when relying on this affability you do the <lb/>
            same thing the next day, you will stand waiting as one <lb/>
            utterly unknown and unexpected, while be who yester- <lb/>
            day encouraged you to repeat your visit, counts upon his <lb/>
            fingers who you can be, marvelling, for a long time, <lb/>
            whence you come, and what you want. But when at <lb/>
            length you are recognized and admitted to his acquaint- <lb/>
            ance, if you should devote yourself to the attention of <lb/>
            saluting him for three years consecutively, and after this <lb/>
            intermit your visits for an equal length of time, then if <lb/>
            you return to repeat a similar course, you will never be <lb/>
            questioned about your absence any more than if you had <note type="footnote">c </note> <pb n="18"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH. VI</note>. <lb/>
            been dead, and you will waste your whole life in submit- <lb/>
            ting to court the humours of this blockhead.</p>
          <p>14. But when those long and unwholesome banquets, <lb/>
            which are indulged in at certain intervals, begin to be pre- <lb/>
            pared, or the distribution of the usual dole-baskets takes <lb/>
            place, then it is discussed with anxious deliberation whether <lb/>
            when those to whom a return is due are to be entertained, <lb/>
            it is proper to invite also a stranger; and if, after the <lb/>
            matter has been thoroughly sifted, it is determined that it <lb/>
            may be done, that person is preferred who waits all night <lb/>
            before the houses of charioteers, or who professes a skill in <lb/>
            dice, or pretends to be acquainted with some peculiar secrets.</p>
          <p>15. Fur such entertainers avoid all learned and sober men <lb/>
            as unprofitable and useless; with this addition, that the <lb/>
            nomenclators1 also, who are accustomed to make a market <lb/>
            of these invitations and of similar favours, selling them for <lb/>
            bribes, do for gain thrust in mean and obscure men at these <lb/>
            dinners.</p>
          <p>16. The whirlpools of banquets, and the various allure- <lb/>
            ments of luxury, I omit, that I may not be too prolix, and <lb/>
            with the object of passing on to this fact, that some people, <lb/>
            hastening on without fear of danger, drive their horses, <lb/>
            as if they were post-horses, with a regular licence, as the <lb/>
            saying is, through the wide streets of the city, over the <lb/>
            roads paved with flint, dragging behind them large bodies of <lb/>
            slaves like bands of robbers; not leaving at home even <lb/>
            Sannio,2 as the comic poet says.</p>
          <p>17. And many matrons, imitating these men, gallop over <lb/>
            every quarter of the city with their heads covered, and in close <lb/>
            carriages. And as skilful conductors of battles place in the <lb/>
            van their densest and strongest battalions, then their light- <lb/>
            armed troops, behind them the darters, and in the extreme <lb/>
            rear troops of reserve, ready to join in the attack if necessity <lb/>
            should arise ; so, according to the careful arrangements of <lb/>
            the stewards of these city households, who are conspicuous <lb/>
            by wands fastened to their right hands, as if a regular <lb/>
            watchword had been issued from the camp, first of all, near <note type="footnote">1 A nomenclator was a slave who attended a great noble in his walk <lb/>

            the front of the carriage march all the slaves concerned in <lb/>
            spinning and working ; next to them come the blackened <lb/>
            crew employed in the kitchen; then the whole body of <lb/>
            slaves promiscuously mixed up with a gang of idle plebeians <lb/>
            from the neighbourhood; last of all, the multitude of <lb/>
            eunuchs, beginning with the old men and ending with the <lb/>
            boys, pale and unsightly from the distorted deformity of <lb/>
            their features; so that whichever way any one goes, seeing <lb/>
            troops of mutilated men, he will detest the memory of <lb/>
            Semiramis, that ancient queen who was the first person to <lb/>
            castrate male youths of tender age; doing as it were a <lb/>
            violence to nature, and forcing it back from its appointed <lb/>
            course, which at the very first beginning and birth of the <lb/>
            child, by a kind of secret law revealing the primitive foun- <lb/>
            tains of seed, points out the way of propagating posterity.</p>
          <p>18. And as this is the case, those few houses which were <lb/>
            formerly celebrated for the serious cultivation of becoming <lb/>
            studies, are now filled with the ridiculous amusements of <lb/>
            torpid indolence, re-echoing with the sound of vocal music <lb/>
            and the tinkle of flutes and lyres. Lastly, instead of a philo- <lb/>
            sopher, you find a singer ; instead of an orator, some teacher <lb/>
            of ridiculous arts is summoned ; and the libraries closed for <lb/>
            ever, like so many graves ; organs to be played by water- <lb/>
            power are made; and lyres of so vast a size, that they look <lb/>
            like waggons; and flutes, and ponderous machines suited <lb/>
            for the exhibitions of actors.</p>
          <p>19. Last of all, they have arrived at such a depth of un- <lb/>
            worthiness, that when, no very long time ago, on account <lb/>
            of an apprehended scarcity of food, the foreigners were <lb/>
            driven in haste from the oity; those who practised liberal <lb/>
            accomplishments, the number of whom was exceedingly <lb/>
            small, were expelled without a moment's breathing-time; <lb/>
            yet the followers of actresses, and all who at that time <lb/>
            pretended to be of such a class, were allowed to remain ; and <lb/>
            three thousand dancing-girls bad not even a question put <lb/>
            to them, but stayed unmolested with the members of their <lb/>
            choruses, and a corresponding number of dancing masters.</p>
          <p>20. And wherever you turn your eyes, you may see a <lb/>
            multitude of women with their hair curled, who, as far as <lb/>
            their ago goes, might, if they had married, been by this <lb/>
            time the mothers of three children, sweeping the pavements <lb/>
            with their feet till they are weary, whirling round in rapid <pb n="20"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            gyrations, while representing innumerable groups and <lb/>
            figures which the theatrical plays contain.</p>
          <p>21. It is a truth beyond all question, that, when at one <lb/>
            time Rome was the abode of all the virtues, many of the <lb/>
            nobles, like the Lotophagi, celebrated in Homer, who <lb/>
            detained men by the deliciousness of their fruit, allured <lb/>
            foreigners of free birth by manifold attentions of courtesy <lb/>
            and kindness.</p>
          <p>22. But now, in their empty arrogance, some persons <lb/>
            look upon everything as worthless which is born outside of <lb/>
            the walls of the city, except only the childless and the un- <lb/>
            married. Nor can it be conceived with what a variety of <lb/>
            obsequious observance men without children are courted <lb/>
            at Rome.</p>
          <p>23. And since among them, as is natural in a city so <lb/>
            great as to be the metropolis of the world, diseases attain <lb/>
            to such an insurmountable degree of violence, that all the <lb/>
            skill of the physician is ineffectual even to mitigate them ; <lb/>
            a certain assistance and means of safety has been devised, <lb/>
            in the rule that no one should go to see a friend in such a <lb/>
            condition, and to a few precautionary measures a fuither <lb/>
            remedy of sufficient potency has been added, that men <lb/>
            should not readmit into their houses servants who have <lb/>
            been sent to inquire how a man's friends who may have <lb/>
            been seized with an illness of this kind are, until they have <lb/>
            cleansed and purified their persons in the bath. So that a <lb/>
            taint is feared, even when it has only been seen with the <lb/>
            eyes of another.</p>
          <p>24. But nevertheless, when these rules are observed thus <lb/>
            stringently, some persons, if they be invited to a wedding, <lb/>
            though the vigour of their limbs be much diminished, yet, <lb/>
            when gold is offered1 in the hollow palm of the right hand, <lb/>
            will go actively as far as Spoletum. These are the customs <lb/>
            of the nobles.</p>
          <p>25. But of the lower and most indigent class of the popu- <lb/>
            lace some spend the whole night in the wine shops <lb/>
            Some lie concealed in the shady arcades of the theatres; <lb/>
            which Catulus was in his ædileship the first person to <note type="footnote">' It was customary on such solemnities, as also on the occasion of <lb/>

            raise, in imitation of the lascivious manners of Campania, or <lb/>
            else they play at dice so eagerly as to quarrel over them ; <lb/>
            snuffing up iheir nostrils and making unseemly noises by <lb/>
            drawing back their breath into their noses; or (and this is <lb/>
            their favourite pursuit of all others) from sunrise to even- <lb/>
            ing they stay gaping through sunshine or rain, examining <lb/>
            in the most careful manner the most sterling good or <lb/>
            bad qualities of the charioteers and horses.</p>
          <p>26. And it is very wonderful to see an innumerable <lb/>
            multitude of people with great eagerness of mind intent <lb/>
            upon the event of the contests in the chariot race. These <lb/>
            pursuits, and others of like character, prevent anything <lb/>
            worth mentioning or important from being done at Rome. <lb/>
            Therefore we must return to our original subject.</p>

          <p>§ 1. His licentiousness having now become more unbounded, <lb/>
            the Cæsar began to be burdensome to all virtuous men ; and <lb/>
            discarding all moderation, he harassed every part of the <lb/>
            East, sparing neither those who had received public <lb/>
            honours, nor the chief citizens of the different cities ; nor <lb/>
            the common people.</p>
          <p>2. At last by one single sentence he ordered all the <lb/>
            principal persons at Antioch to be put to death; being <lb/>
            exasperated because when he recommended that a low <lb/>
            price should be established in the market at an unsea- <lb/>
            sonable time, when the city was threatened with a scarcity, <lb/>
            they answered him with objections, urged with more <lb/>
            force than he approved; and they would all have been <lb/>
            put to death to a man, if Honoratus, who was at that time <lb/>
            count of the East, had not resisted him with pertinacious <lb/>
            constancy.</p>
          <p>3. This circumstance was also a proof, and that no <lb/>
            doubtful or concealed one, of the cruelty of his nature, <lb/>
            that he took delight in cruel sports, and in the circus he <lb/>
            would rejoice as if he had made some great gain, to see six <lb/>
            or seven gladiators killing one another in combats which <lb/>
            have often been forbidden.</p>
          <p>4. In addition to these things a certain worthless woman <lb/>
            inflamed his purpose of inflicting misery; for she, having <lb/>
            obtained admission to the palace, as she had requested, gave <pb n="22"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH. VII. </note> <lb/>
            him information that a plot was secretly laid against him <lb/>
            by a few soldiers of the lowest rank. And Constantina, <lb/>
            in her exultation, thinking that her husband's safety was <lb/>
            now fully secured, rewarded and placed this woman, in a <lb/>
            carriage, and in this way sent her out into the public <lb/>
            street through the great gate of the palace, in order, by such <lb/>
            a temptation, to allure others also to give similar or more <lb/>
            important information.</p>
          <p>5. After these events, Gallus being about to set out for <lb/>
            Hierapolis, in order, as far as appearance went, to take <lb/>
            part in the expedition, the common people of Antioeh <lb/>
            entreated him in a suppliant manner to remove their fear <lb/>
            of a famine which for many reasons (some of them difficult <lb/>
            to explain) it was believed was impending; Gallus, how- <lb/>
            ever, did not, as is the custom of princes whose power, <lb/>
            by the great extent of country over which it is diffused, is <lb/>
            able continually to remedy local distresses, order any dis- <lb/>
            tribution of food to be made, or any supplies to be brought <lb/>
            from the neighbouring countries ; but he pointed out to <lb/>
            them a man of consular rank, named Theophilus, the <lb/>
            governor of Syria, who happened to be standing by, re- <lb/>
            plying to the repeated appeals of the multitude, who were <lb/>
            trembling with apprehensions of the last extremities, that <lb/>
            no one could possibly want food if the governor were not <lb/>
            willing that they should be in want of it.</p>
          <p>6. These words increased the audacity of the lower <lb/>
            classes, and when the scarcity of provisions became more <lb/>
            severe, urged by hunger and frenzy, they set fire to and <lb/>
            burnt down the splendid house of a man of the name of <lb/>
            Eubulus, a man of great reputation among his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens; and they attacked the governor himself with <lb/>
            blows and kicks as one especially made over to them by <lb/>
            the judgment of the emperor, kicking him till he was <lb/>
            half dead, and then tearing him to pieces in a miserable <lb/>
            manner. And after his wretched death every one saw in <lb/>
            the destruction of this single individual a type of the <lb/>
            danger to which he was himself exposed, and, taught by <lb/>
            this recent example, feared a similar fate.</p>
          <p>7. About the same time Serenianus, who had previously <lb/>
            been duke1 of Phœnicia, to whose inactivity it was owing, <note type="footnote">1 The Latin is Dux. It is about this period that the title Duke and <lb/>
            Count, which we have already had, arose, indicating however at first </note> <pb n="23"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            as we have already related, that Celse in Phoenicia was <lb/>
            laid waste, was deservedly and legally accused of trea- <lb/>
            son, and no one saw how he could possibly be acquitted. <lb/>
            He was also manifestly proved to have sent an intimate <lb/>
            friend with a cap (with which he used to cover his own <lb/>
            head) which had been enchanted by forbidden acts to the <lb/>
            temple of prophecy,1 on purpose to ask expressly whether, <lb/>
            according to his wish, a firm enjoyment of the whole <lb/>
            empire was portended for him.</p>
          <p>8. And in these days a twofold misfortune occurred: <lb/>
            first, that a heavy penalty had fallen upon Theophilus who <lb/>
            was innocent; and, secondly, that Serenianus who deserved <lb/>
            universal exccration, was acquitted without the general <lb/>
            feeling being able to offer any effectual remonstrance.</p>
          <p>9. Constantius then hearing from time to time of these <lb/>
            transactions, and having been further informed of some <lb/>
            particular occurrences by Thalassius, who however had <lb/>
            now died by the ordinary course of nature, wrote courteous <lb/>
            letters to the Cæsar, but at the same time gradually with- <lb/>
            drew from him his support, pretending to be uneasy, least <lb/>
            as the leisure of soldiers is usually a disorderly time, the <lb/>
            troops might be conspiring to his injury: and he desired <lb/>
            him to content himself with the schools of the Palatine,2 <lb/>
            and with those of the Protectors, with the Scutarii, and <lb/>
            Gentiles. And he ordered Domitianus, who had formerly <lb/>
            been the Superintendent of the Treasury, but who was now <lb/>
            promoted to be a prefect, as soon as he arrived in Syria, to <lb/>
            address Gallus in persuasive and respectful language, ex- <lb/>
            horting him to repair with all speed to Italy, to which <lb/>
            province the emperor had repeatedly summoned him. <note type="footnote"> not territorial possessions, but military commands ; and it is worth <lb/>
            noticing that the rank of Count was the higher of the two. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Constantine, on his conversion to Christianity, had issued an edict <lb/>
            forbidding the consultation of oracles; but the practice was not wholly <lb/>

            wont to meet for any purpose, whether of study, of traffic, or of the <lb/>

            the cohorts of the guard. The " Protectors or Guards " were a body of <lb/>
            soldiers of higher rank, receiving also higher pay; called also " Domes- <lb/>
            tici or household troops," as especially set apart for the protection of the <lb/>
            imperial palace and person. The "Scutarii" (shield-bearers) belonged <lb/>
            to the Palatine schools ; and the Gentiles were troops enlisted from <lb/>
            among those nations which were still accounted barbarous. </note> <pb n="24"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [BK XIV. CH. VII. </note> 10. And when, with this object, Domitianus had reached <lb/>
            Antiocb, having travelled express, be passed by the gates <lb/>
            of the palace, in contempt of the Cæsar, whom, however, <lb/>
            be ought to have visited, and proceeded to the general's <lb/>
            camp with ostentatious pomp, and there pretended to bo <lb/>
            sick; he neither visited the palace, nor ever appeared in <lb/>
            public, but keeping himself private, he devised many things <lb/>
            to bring about the destruction of the Cæsar, adding many <lb/>
            superfluous circumstances to the relations which -he was <lb/>
            continually sending to the emperor.</p>
          <p>11. At last, being expressly invited by the Cæsar, and <lb/>
            being admitted into the prince's council-chamber, without <lb/>
            making the slightest preface he began in this inconsiderate <lb/>
            and light-minded manner: " Depart," said he, " as you <lb/>
            have been commanded, 0 Cæsar, and know this, that if you <lb/>
            make any delay I shall at once order all the provisions <lb/>
            allotted for the support of yourself and your court to be <lb/>
            carried away." And then, having said nothing more than <lb/>
            these insolent words, he departed with every appearance of <lb/>
            rage; and would never afterwards come into his sight <lb/>
            though frequently sent for.</p>
          <p>12. The Cæsar being indignant at this, as thinking he <lb/>
            had been unworthily and unjustly treated, ordered his <lb/>
            faithful protectors to take the prefect into custody; and <lb/>
            when this became known, Montius, who at that time was <lb/>
            quæstor, a man of deep craft indeed, but still inclined to <lb/>
            moderate measures,. taking counsel for the common good, <lb/>
            sent for the principal members of the Palatine schools and <lb/>
            addressed them in pacific words, pointing out that it was <lb/>
            neither proper nor expedient that such things should be <lb/>
            done; and adding also in a reproving tone of voice, that if <lb/>
            such conduct as this were approved of, then, after throwing <lb/>
            down the statues of Constantius the prefect would begin <lb/>
            to think how he might also with the greater security take <lb/>
            his life also.</p>
          <p>13. When this was known Gallus, like a serpent attacked <lb/>
            with stones or darts, being now reduced to the extremity <lb/>
            of despair, and eager to insure his safety by any possible <note type="footnote"> I Gibbon here proposes for lenitatem to read levitatem, fickleness; <lb/>

            means, ordered all his troops to be collected in arms, and <lb/>
            when they stood around him in amazement he gnashed his <lb/>
            teeth, and hissing with rage, said,-</p>
          <p>14. " You are present here as brave men, come to the <lb/>
            aid of me who am in one common danger with you. Mon- <lb/>
            tius, with a novel and unprecedented arrogance, accuses us <lb/>
            of rebellion and resistance to the majesty of the emperor, <lb/>
            by roaring out all these charges against us. Being offended <lb/>
            forsooth that, as a matter of precaution, I ordered a contu- <lb/>
            macious prefect, who pretended not to know what the state <lb/>
            of affairs required, to be arrested and kept in custody."</p>
          <p>15. On hearing these words the soldiers immediately, <lb/>
            being always on the watch to raise disturbances, first of all <lb/>
            attacked Montius, who happened to be living close at hand, <lb/>
            an old man of no great bodily strength, and enfeebled by <lb/>
            disease; and having bound his legs with coarse ropes, they <lb/>
            dragged him straddling, without giving him a moment to <lb/>
            take breath, as far as the general's camp.</p>
          <p>16. And with the same violence they also bound Domitia- <lb/>
            nus, dragging head first down the stairs; and then having <lb/>
            fastened the two men together, they dragged them through <lb/>
            all the spacious streets of the city at full speed. And, all <lb/>
            their limbs and joints being thus dislocated, they trampled <lb/>
            on their corpses after they were dead, and mutilated them <lb/>
            in the most unseemly manner ; and at last, having glutted <lb/>
            their rage, they threw them into the river.</p>
          <p>17. But there was a certain man named Luscus, the <lb/>
            governor of the city, who, suddenly appearing among the <lb/>
            soldiers, had inflamed them, always ready for mischief, <lb/>
            to the nefarious actions which they had thus committed; <lb/>
            exciting them with repeated cries, like the musician who <lb/>
            gives the tune to the mourners at funerals, to finish what <lb/>
            they had begun: and for this deed he was, not long after, <lb/>
            burnt alive.</p>
          <p>18. And because Montius, when just about to expire <lb/>
            under the hands of those who were tearing him to pieces, <lb/>
            repeatedly named Epigonius and Eusebius, without indi- <lb/>
            cating either their rank or their profession, a great deal <lb/>
            of trouble was taken to find out who they were; and, lest <lb/>
            the search should have time to cool, they sent for a philo- <lb/>
            sopher named Epigonius, from Lycia, and for Eusebius the <lb/>
            orator, surnamed Pittacos, from Emissa; though they were <pb n="26"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH. VII. </note> <lb/>
            not those whom Montius had meant, but some tribunes, <lb/>
            superintendents of the manufactures of arms, who had pro- <lb/>
            mised him information if they heard of any revolutionary <lb/>
            measures being agitated.</p>
          <p>19. About the same time Apollinaris, the son-in-law of <lb/>
            Domitianus, who a short time before had been the chief <lb/>
            steward of the Cæsar's palace, being sent to Mesopotamia <lb/>
            by his father-in-law, took exceeding pains to inquire among <lb/>
            the soldiers whether they had received any secret de- <lb/>
            spatches from the Cæsar, indicating his having meditated any <lb/>
            deeper designs than usual. And as soon as he heard of the <lb/>
            events which had taken place at Antioch, he passed through <lb/>
            the lesser Armenia and took the road to Constantinople ; <lb/>
            but he was seized on his journey by the Protectors, and <lb/>
            brought back to Antioch, and there kept in close confine- <lb/>
            ment.</p>
          <p>20. And while these things were taking place there was <lb/>
            discovered at Tyre a royal robe, which had been secretly <lb/>
            made, though it was quite uncertain who had placed it <lb/>
            where it was, or for whose use it had been made. And on <lb/>
            that account the governor of the province, who was at that <lb/>
            time the father of Apollinaris, and bore the same name, <lb/>
            was arrested as an accomplice in his guilt; and great num- <lb/>
            bers of other persons were collected from different cities, <lb/>
            who were all involved in serious accusations.</p>
          <p>21. And now, when the trumpets of internal war and <lb/>
            slaughter began to sound, the turbulent disposition of the <lb/>
            Caesar, indifferent to any consideration of the truth, began <lb/>
            also to break forth, and that not secretly as before. And <lb/>
            without making any solemn investigation into the truth of <lb/>
            the charges brought against the citizens, and without sepa- <lb/>
            rating the innocent from the guilty, he discarded all ideas <lb/>
            of right or justice, as if they had been expelled from the <lb/>
            seat of judgment. And while all lawful defence on trials <lb/>
            was silent, the torturer, and plunderer, and the executioner, <lb/>
            and every kind of confiscation of property, raged unrestrained <lb/>
            throughout the eastern provinces of the empire, which I <lb/>
            think it now a favourable moment to enumerate, with the <lb/>
            exception of Mesopotamia, which I have already described <lb/>
            when I was relating the Parthian wars; and also with the <lb/>
            exception of Egypt, which I am forced to postpone to <lb/>
            . another opportunity. <pb n="27"/>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER passing over the summit of Mount Taurus, which <lb/>
            towards the east rises up to a vast height, Cilicia spreads <lb/>
            itself out for a very great distance-a land rich in all valu- <lb/>
            able productions. It is bordered on its right by Isauria, <lb/>
            which is equally fertile in vines and in many kinds of <lb/>
            grain. The Calycadnus, a navigable river, flows through <lb/>
            the middle of Isaurus.</p>
          <p>2. This province, besides other towns, is particularly <lb/>
            adorned by two cities, Seleucia, founded by King Seleucus, <lb/>
            and Claudiopolis, which the Emperor Claudius Caesar esta- <lb/>
            blished as a colony. For the city of Isauria, which was <lb/>
            formerly too powerful, was in ancient times overthrown as <lb/>
            an incurable and dangerous rebel, and so completely de- <lb/>
            stroyed that it is not easy to discover any traces of its <lb/>
            pristine splendour.</p>
          <p>3. The province of Cilicia, which exults in the river <lb/>
            Cydnus, is ornamented by Tarsus, a city of great magni- <lb/>
            ficence. This city is said to have been founded by Perseus, <lb/>
            the son of Jupiter and Danaë ; or else, and more probably, <lb/>
            by a certain emigrant who came from Ethiopia, by name <lb/>
            Sandan, a man of great wealth and of noble birth. It is <lb/>
            also adorned by the city of Anazarbus, which bears the <lb/>
            name of its founder; and by Mopsuestia, the abode of the <lb/>
            celebrated seer Mopsus, who wandered from his comrades <lb/>
            the Argonauts when they were returning after having <lb/>
            carried off the Golden Fleece, and sti ayed to the African <lb/>
            coast, where he died a sudden death. His heroic remains, <lb/>
            though covered by Punic turf, have ever since that time <lb/>
            cured a great variety of diseases, and have generally re- <lb/>
            stored men to sound health.</p>
          <p>4. These two provinces being full of banditti were for- <lb/>
            merly subdued by the pro-consul Servilius, in a piratical <lb/>
            war, and were passed under the yoke, and made tributary <lb/>
            to the empire. These districts being placed, as it were, on <lb/>
            a prominent tongue of land, are cut .off from the main conti- <lb/>
            nent by Mount Amanus.</p>
          <p>5. The frontier of the East stretching straight forward <lb/>
            for a great distance, reached from the banks of the river <lb/>
            Euphrates to those of the Nile, being bounded on the <pb n="28"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            left by the tribes of the Saracens and on the right by the <lb/>
            sea.</p>
          <p>6. Nicator Seleucus, after he had occupied that dis- <lb/>
            trict, increased its prosperity to a wonderful degree, when, <lb/>
            after the death of Alexander, king of Macedonia, he <lb/>
            took possession of the kingdom of Persia by right of suc- <lb/>
            cession ; being a mighty and victorious king, as his sur- <lb/>
            name indicates. And making free use of his numerous <lb/>
            subjects, whom he governed for a long time in tranquil- <lb/>
            lity, ho changed groups of rustic habitations into regular <lb/>
            cities, important for their great wealth and power, the <lb/>
            greater part of which at the present day, although they <lb/>
            are called by Greek names which were given them by <lb/>
            the choice of their founder, have nevertheless not lost <lb/>
            their original appellations which the original settlers of <lb/>
            the villages gave them in the Assyrian language.</p>
          <p>7. After Osdroeno, which, as I have already said, I <lb/>
            intend to omit from this description, the first province to <lb/>
            bo mentioned is Commagena, now called Euphratensis, <lb/>
            which has arisen into importance by slow degrees, and is <lb/>
            remarkable for the splendid cities of Hicrapolis, the <lb/>
            ancient Ninus, and Samosata.</p>
          <p>8. The next province is Syria, which is spread over a <lb/>
            beautiful champaign country. This province is ennobled <lb/>
            by Antioch, a city known over the whole world, with <lb/>
            which no other can vie in respect of its riches, whether <lb/>
            imported or natural: and by Laodicea and Apameia, and <lb/>
            also by Soleucia, all cities which have ever been most <lb/>
            prosperous from their earliest foundation.</p>
          <p>9. After this comes Phœnicia, a province lying under <lb/>
            Mount Lebanon, full of beauty and elegance, and doco- <lb/>
            rated with cities of great size and splendour, among <lb/>
            which Tyro excels all in the beauty of its situation and in <lb/>
            its renown. And next come Sidon and Berytus, and on a <lb/>
            par with them Emissa and Damascus, cities founded in <lb/>
            remote ages.</p>
          <p>10. These provinces, which the river Orontes borders, <lb/>
            a river which passes by the foot of the celebrated and <lb/>
            lofty mountain Cassius, and at last falls into the Levant <lb/>
            near the Gulf of Issus, were added to the Roman dominion <lb/>
            by Cnæns Pompey, who, after he had conquered Tigranes, <lb/>
            separated them from the kingdom of Armenia. <pb n="29"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> 11. The last province of the Syrias is Palestine, a dis- <lb/>
            trict of great extent, abounding in well-cultivated and <lb/>
            beautiful land, and having several magnificent cities, all <lb/>
            of equal importance, and rivalling one another as it were, <lb/>
            in parallel lines. For instance, Cæsarea, which Herod built <lb/>
            in honour of the Prince Octavianus, and Eleutheropolis, <lb/>
            and Neapolis, and also Ascalon, and Gaza, cities built in <lb/>
            bygone ages.</p>
          <p>12. In these districts no navigable river is seen: in <lb/>
            many places, too, waters naturally hot rise out of the <lb/>
            ground well suited for the cure of various diseases. These <lb/>
            regions also Pompey formed into a Roman province after <lb/>
            he had subdued the Jews and taken Jerusalem: and he <lb/>
            made over their government to a local governor.</p>
          <p>13. Contiguous to Palestine is Arabia, a country which <lb/>
            on its other side joins the Nabathsei—a land full of the <lb/>
            most plenteous variety of merchandize, and studded with <lb/>
            strong forts and castles, which the watchful solicitude of its <lb/>
            ancient inhabitants has erected in suitable defiles, in order <lb/>
            to repress the inroads of the neighbouring nations. This <lb/>
            province, too, besides several towns, has some mighty <lb/>
            cities, such as Bostra, Gerasa, and Philadelphia, fortified <lb/>
            with very strong walls. It was the Emperor Trajan who <lb/>
            first gave this country the name of a Roman province, and <lb/>
            appointed a governor over it, and compelled it to obey our <lb/>
            laws, after having by repeated victories crushed the arro- <lb/>
            gance of the inhabitants, when he was carrying his glorious <lb/>
            arms into Media and Parthia.</p>
          <p>14. There is also the island of Cyprus, not very far from <lb/>
            the continent, and abounding in excellent harbours, which, <lb/>
            besides its many municipal towns, is especially famous for <lb/>
            two renowned cities, Salamis and Paphos, the one cele- <lb/>
            brated for its temple of Jupiter, the other for its temple of <lb/>
            Venus. This same Cyprus is so fertile, and so abounding <lb/>
            in riches of every kind, that without requiring any ex- <lb/>
            ternal assistance, it can by its own native resources build <lb/>
            a merchant ship from the very foundation of the keel up to <lb/>
            the top sails, and send it to sea fully equipped with <lb/>
            stores.</p>
          <p>15. It is not to be denied that the Roman people invaded <lb/>
            this island with more covetousness than justice. For <lb/>
            when Ptolemy, the king, who was connected with us by <pb n="30"/>
            <note type="margin"> BK. XIV. CH. IX. </note> <lb/>
            treaty, and was also our ally, was without any fault of his <lb/>
            own proscribed, merely on account of the necessities of our <lb/>
            treasury, and slew himself by taking poison, the island was <lb/>
            made tributary to us, and its spoils placed on board our <lb/>
            fleet, as if taken from an enemy, and carried to Rome <lb/>
            by Cato. We will now return to the actions of Constan- <lb/>
            tius in their due order.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AMID all these various disasters, Ursicinus, who was <lb/>
            the governor of Nisibis, an officer to whom the command <lb/>
            of the emperor had particularly attached me as a servant, <lb/>
            was summoned from that city, and in spite of his reluc- <lb/>
            tance, and of the opposition which he made to the clamorous <lb/>
            bands of flatterers, was forced to investigate the origin of <lb/>
            the pernicious strife which had arisen. He was indeed a <lb/>
            soldier of great skill in war, and an approved leader of <lb/>
            troops ; but a man who had always kept himself aloof from <lb/>
            the strife of the forum. He, alarmed at his own danger <lb/>
            when he saw the corrupt accusers and judges who were <lb/>
            associated with him, all emerging out of the same lurking- <lb/>
            places, wrote secret letters to Constantius informing him of <lb/>
            what was going on, both publicly and in secret; and im- <lb/>
            ploring such assistance as, by striking fear into Gallus, <lb/>
            should somewhat curb his notorious arrogance.</p>
          <p>2. But through excessive caution he had fallen into a <lb/>
            worse snare, as we shall relate hereafter, since his enemies <lb/>
            got the opportunity of laying numerous snares for him, to <lb/>
            poison the mind of Constantius against him; Constantius, <lb/>
            in other respects a prince of moderation, was severe and <lb/>
            implacable if any person, however mean and unknown, <lb/>
            whispered suspicion of danger into his ears, and in such <lb/>
            matters was wholly unlike himself.</p>
          <p>3. On the day appointed for this fatal examination, the <lb/>
            master of the horse took his scat under the pretence of <lb/>
            being the judge; others being also set as his assessors, <lb/>
            who were instructed beforehand what was to be done: <lb/>
            and there were present also notaries on each side of him, <lb/>
            who kept the Cæsar rapidly and continually informed of all <lb/>
            the questions which were put and all the answers which <lb/>
            were given; and by his pitiless orders, urged as he was by <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            the persuasions of the queen, who kept her ear at the <lb/>
            curtain, many were put to death without being permitted <lb/>
            to soften the accusations brought against them, or to say a <lb/>
            word in their own defence.</p>
          <p>4. The first persons who were brought before them were <lb/>
            Epigonius and Eusebius, who were ruined because of the <lb/>
            similarity of their names to those of other people; for we <lb/>
            have already mentioned that Montius, when just at the <lb/>
            point of death, had intended to inculpate the tribunes of <lb/>
            manufactures, who were called by these names, as men who <lb/>
            had promised to be his supports in some future enterprise.</p>
          <p>5. Epigonius was only a philosopher as far as his dress <lb/>
            went, as was evident, when, having tried entreaties <lb/>
            in vain, his sides having been torn with blows, and the <lb/>
            fear of instant death being presented to him, he affirmed <lb/>
            by a base confession that his companion was privy to <lb/>
            his plans, though in fact he had no plans; nor had he <lb/>
            ever seen or heard anything, being wholly unconnected <lb/>
            with forensic affairs. But Eusebius, confidently denying <lb/>
            what he was accused of, continued firm in unshaken con- <lb/>
            stancy, loudly declaring that it was a band of robbers <lb/>
            before whom he was brought, and not a court of justice.</p>
          <p>6. And when, like a man well acquainted with the law, <lb/>
            he demanded that his accuser should be produced, and <lb/>
            claimed the usual rights of a prisoner; the Cæsar, having <lb/>
            heard of his conduct, and looking on his freedom as pride, <lb/>
            ordered him to be put to the torture as an audacious <lb/>
            calumniator; and when Eusebius had been tortured so <lb/>
            severely that he had no longer any limbs left for torments, <lb/>
            imploring heaven for justice, and still smiling disdain- <lb/>
            fully, he remained immovable, with a firm heart, not <lb/>
            permitting his tongue to accuse himself or any one else. <lb/>
            And so at length, without having either made any con- <lb/>
            fession, or being convicted of anything, he was condemned <lb/>
            to death with the spiritless partner of his sufferings. He <lb/>
            was then led away to death, protesting against the ini <lb/>
            quity of the times ; imitating in his conduct the cele- <lb/>
            brated Stoic of old, Zeno, who, after he had been long <lb/>
            subjected to torture in order to extract from him some <lb/>
            false confession, tore out his tongue by the roots and threw <lb/>
            it, bloody as it was, into the face of the king of Cyprus, <lb/>
            who was examining him. <pb n="32"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. X</note> 7. After these events the affair of the royal robe was <lb/>
            examined into. And when those who were employed in <lb/>
            dyeing purple had been put to the torture, and had con- <lb/>
            fessed that they had woven a short tunic to cover the <lb/>
            chest, without sleeves, a certain person, by name Maras, <lb/>
            was brought in, a deacon, as the Christians call him ; <lb/>
            letters from whom were produced, written in the Greek <lb/>
            language +o the superintendent of the weaving manu- <lb/>
            factory at Tyre, which pressed him to have the beau- <lb/>
            tiful work finished speedily; of which work, however, <lb/>
            these letters gave no further description. And at last this <lb/>
            man also was tortured, to the danger of his life, but could <lb/>
            not be made to confess anything.</p>
          <p>8. After the investigation had been carried on with <lb/>
            the examination, under torture of many persons, when <lb/>
            some things appeared doubtful, and others it was plain <lb/>
            were of a very unimportant character, and after many <lb/>
            persons had been put to death, the two Apollinares, <lb/>
            father and son, were condemned to banishment; and <lb/>
            when they had come to a place which is called Cra- <lb/>
            teræ, a country house of their own, which is four-and- <lb/>
            twenty miles from Antioch, there, according to the order <lb/>
            which had been given, their legs were broken, and they <lb/>
            were put to death.</p>
          <p>9. After their death Gallus was not at all less ferocious <lb/>
            than before, but rather like a lion which has once tasted <lb/>
            blood, he made many similar investigations, all of which <lb/>
            it is not worth while to relate, lest I should exceed the <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILEthe East was thus for a long time suffering under <lb/>
            these calamities, at the first approach of open weather, <lb/>
            Constantius being in his seventh consulship, and the Cæsar <lb/>
            in his third, the emperor quitted Aries and went to <lb/>
            Valentia, with the intention of making war upon the <lb/>
            brothers Gundomadus and Vadomarius, chiefs of the <lb/>
            Allemanni; by whose repeated inroads the territories of <lb/>
            the Gauls, which lay upon their frontier, were continually <lb/>
            laid waste.</p>
          <p>2. And while he was staying in that district, as he did <pb n="33"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            for some time while waiting for supplies, the importation <lb/>
            of which from Aquitania was prevented by the spring <lb/>
            rains, which were this year more severe than usual, so that <lb/>
            the rivers were flooded by them, Herculanus arrived, a <lb/>
            principal officer of the guard, son of Hermogenes, who had <lb/>
            formerly been master of the horse at Constantinople, and <lb/>
            had been torn to pieces in a popular tumult as we have <lb/>
            mentioned before. And as he brought a faithful account <lb/>
            of what Gallus had done, the emperor, sorrowing over the <lb/>
            miseries that were passed, and full of anxious fear for the <lb/>
            future, for a time stilled the grief of his mind as well as <lb/>
            he could.</p>
          <p>3. But in the mean time all the soldiery being assembled <lb/>
            at Cabillon, 1 began to be impatient of delay, and to get <lb/>
            furious, being so much the more exasperated because they <lb/>
            had not sufficient means of living, the usual supplies not <lb/>
            yet having arrived.</p>
          <p>4. And in consequence of this state of things, Rufinus, <lb/>
            at that time prefect of the camp, was exposed to the most <lb/>
            imminent danger. For he himself was compelled to go <lb/>
            among the soldiers, whose natural ferocity was inflamed <lb/>
            by their want of food, and who on other occasions are <lb/>
            by nature generally inclined to be savage and bitter against <lb/>
            men of civil dignities. He was compelled, I say, to go <lb/>
            among them to appease them and explain on what account <lb/>
            the arrival of their corn was delayed.</p>
          <p>5. And the task thus imposed on him was very cun- <lb/>
            ningly contrived, in order that he, the uncle of Gallus, <lb/>
            might perish in the snare ; lest he, being a man of great <lb/>
            power and energy, should rouse his nephew to confidence, <lb/>
            and lead him to undertake enterprises which might be mis- <lb/>
            chievous. Great caution, however, was used to escape <lb/>
            this; and, when the danger was got rid of for a while, <lb/>
            Eusebius, the high chamberlain, was sent to Cabillon with <lb/>
            a large sum of money, which he distributed secretly among <lb/>
            the chief leaders of sedition : and so the turbulent and <lb/>
            arrogant disposition of the soldiers was pacified, and the <lb/>
            safety of the prefect secured. Afterwards food having <lb/>
            arrived in abundance the camp was struck on the day <lb/>
            appointed.</p>
          <p>6. After great difficulties had been surmounted, many <note type="footnote">1 Châlons sur Saône. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. X. </note> <lb/>
            of the roads being buried in snow, the army came near to <lb/>
            Rauracum1 on the banks of the Rhine, where the mul- <lb/>
            titude of the Allemanni offered great resistance, so that <lb/>
            by their fierceness the Romans were prevented from fixing <lb/>
            their bridge of boats, darts being poured upon them from <lb/>
            all sides like hail; and, when it seemed impossible to <lb/>
            succeed in that attempt, the emperor being taken by sur- <lb/>
            prise, and full of anxious thoughts, began to consider what <lb/>
            to do.</p>
          <p>7. When suddenly a guide well acquainted with the <lb/>
            country arrived, and for a reward pointed out a ford by <lb/>
            night, where the river could be crossed ; and the army <lb/>
            ciossing at that point, while the enemy had their attention <lb/>
            directed elsewhere, might without any one expecting such <lb/>
            a step, have and waste the whole country, if a few men <lb/>
            of the same nation to whom the higher posts in the Roman <lb/>
            army were intrusted had not (as some people believe) in- <lb/>
            formed their fellow-countrymen of the design by secret <lb/>
            messengers.</p>
          <p>8. The disgrace of this suspicion fell chiefly on Latinus, <lb/>
            a commander of the domestic guard, and on Agile, an <lb/>
            equerry, and on Scudilo, the commander of the Scutarii, <lb/>
            men who at that time were looked up to as those who sup- <lb/>
            ported the republic with their right hands.</p>
          <p>9. But the barbarians, though taking instant counsel <lb/>
            on such an emergency, yet either because the auspices <lb/>
            turned out unfavourable, or because the authority of the <lb/>
            sacrifices prohibited an instant engagement, abated their <lb/>
            energy, and the confidence with which they had hitherto <lb/>
            resisted; and sent some of their chiefs to beg pardon for <lb/>
            their offences, and sue for peace.</p>
          <p>10 Therefore, having detained for some time the envoys <lb/>
            of both the kings, and having long deliberated over the affair <lb/>
            in secret, the emperor, when he had decided that it was ex- <lb/>
            pedient to grant peace on the terms proposed, summoned his <lb/>
            army to an assembly with the intention of making them a <lb/>
            short speech, and mounting the tribunal, surrounded with a <lb/>
            staff of officers of high rank, spoke in the following manner:</p>
          <p>11. "I hope no one will wonder, after the long and <lb/>
            toilsome marches we have made, and the vast supplies <lb/>
            and magazines which have been provided, from the confi- <note type="footnote">1 Near Basle. </note> <pb n="35"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            dence which I felt in you, that now although we are close <lb/>
            to the villages of the barbarians, I have, as if I had sud- <lb/>
            denly changed my plans, adopted more peaceful counsels.</p>
          <p>12. "For if every one of you, having regard to his own <lb/>
            position and his own feelings, considers the case, he will <lb/>
            find this to be the truth: that the individual soldier in all <lb/>
            cases, however strong and vigorous he may be, regards and <lb/>
            defends nothing but himself and his own life; while the <lb/>
            general, looking on all with impartiality as the guardian <lb/>
            of their general safety, is aware that the common interest <lb/>
            of the people cannot be separated from his own safety; <lb/>
            and he is bound to seize with alacrity every remedy of <lb/>
            which the condition of affairs admits, as being put into his <lb/>
            hand by the favour of the gods.</p>
          <p>13. "That therefore I may in a few words set before <lb/>
            you and explain on what account I wished all of you, <lb/>
            my most faithful comrades, to assemble here, I entreat you <lb/>
            to listen attentively to what I will state with all the brevity <lb/>
            possible. For the language of truth is always concise and <lb/>
            simple.</p>
          <p>14. “The kings and people of the Allemanni, viewing <lb/>
            with apprehension the lofty steps of your glory (which <lb/>
            fame, increasing in magnificence, has diffused throughout <lb/>
            the most distant countries), now by their ambassadors <lb/>
            humbly implore pardon for their past offences, and peace. <lb/>
            And this indulgence I, as a cautious and prudent adviser <lb/>
            of what is useful, think expedient to grant them, if your <lb/>
            consent be not wanting: being led to this opinion by many <lb/>
            considerations, in the first place that so we may avoid the <lb/>
            doubtful issues of war; in the second place, that instead <lb/>
            of enemies we may have allies, as they promise we shall <lb/>
            find them; further, that without bloodshed we may pacify <lb/>
            their haughty ferocity, a feeling which is often mis- <lb/>
            chievous in our provinces; and last of all, recollecting <lb/>
            that the man who falls in battle, overwhelmed by supe- <lb/>
            rior weapons or strength, is not the only enemy who has <lb/>
            to be subdued; and that with much greater safety to the <lb/>
            state, even while the trumpet of war is silent, he is sub- <lb/>
            dued who makes voluntary submission, having learnt by <lb/>
            experience that we lack neither courage against rebels, nor <lb/>
            mercy towards suppliants.</p>
          <p>15. “To sum up, making you as it were the arbitrators, I <pb n="36"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH XI. </note> <lb/>
            wait to see what you determine; having no doubt myself, <lb/>
            as an emperor always desirous of peace, that it is best to <lb/>
            employ moderation while prosperity descends upon us. <lb/>
            For, believe me, this conduct which I recommend, and <lb/>
            which is wisely chosen, will not be imputed to want of <lb/>
            courage on your part, but to your moderation and huma- <lb/>
            nity."</p>
          <p>16. As soon as he had finished speaking, the whole <lb/>
            assembly being ready to agree to what the emperor de- <lb/>
            sired, and praising his advice, gave their votes for peace; <lb/>
            being principally influenced by this consideration, that <lb/>
            they had already learnt by frequent expeditions that the <lb/>
            fortune of the emperor was only propitious in times of civil <lb/>
            troubles; but that when foreign wars were undertaken <lb/>
            they had often proved disastrous. On this, therefore, <lb/>
            a treaty being made according to the customs of the <lb/>
            Allemanni, and all the solemnities being completed, the <lb/>
            emperor retired to Milan for the winter.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. AT Milan, having discarded the weight of other cares, <lb/>
            the emperor took into his consideration that most difficult <lb/>
            gordian knot, how by a mighty effort to uproot the Caesar. <lb/>
            And while he was deliberating on this matter with his <lb/>
            friends in secret conference by night, and considering <lb/>
            what force, and what contrivances might be employed for <lb/>
            the purpose, before Gallus in his audacity should more <lb/>
            resolutely set himself to plunging affairs into confusion, <lb/>
            it seemed best that Gallus should be invited by civil letters, <lb/>
            under pretence of some public affairs of an urgent nature <lb/>
            requiring his advice, so that, being deprived of all support, <lb/>
            he might be put to death without any hindrance.</p>
          <p>2. But as several knots of light-minded flatterers opposed <lb/>
            this opinion, among whom was Arbetio, a man of keen <lb/>
            wit and always inclined to treachery, and Eusebius, a man <lb/>
            always disposed to mischief, at that time the principal <lb/>
            chamberlain, they suggested that if the Caesar were to <lb/>
            quit those countries it would be dangerous to leave <lb/>
            Ursicinus in the East, with no one to check his designs, if <lb/>
            he should cherish ambitious notions.</p>
          <p>3. And these counsels were supported by the rest of the <pb n="37"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            royal eunuchs, whose avarice and covetousness at that <lb/>
            period had risen to excess. These men, while performing <lb/>
            their private duties about the court, by secret whispers <lb/>
            supplied food for false accusations; and by raising bitter <lb/>
            suspicions of Ursicinus, ruined a most gallant man, creating <lb/>
            by underhand means a belief that his grown-up sons began <lb/>
            to aim at supreme power; intimating that they were <lb/>
            youths in the flower of their age and of admirable per- <lb/>
            sonal beauty, skilful in the use of every kind of weapon, <lb/>
            well trained in all athletic and military exercises, and <lb/>
            favourably known for prudence and wisdom. They in- <lb/>
            sinuated also that Gallus himself, being by nature fierce <lb/>
            and unmanageable, had been excited to acts of additional <lb/>
            cruelty and ferocity by persons placed about him for that <lb/>
            purpose, to the end that, when he had brought upon him- <lb/>
            self universal detestation, the ensigns of power might be <lb/>
            transferred to the children of the master of the horse.</p>
          <p>4. When these and similar suspicions were poured <lb/>
            into the ears of Constantius, which were always open <lb/>
            to reports of this kind, the emperor, revolving different <lb/>
            plans in his mind, at last chose the following as the <lb/>
            most advisable course. He commanded Ursicinus in a <lb/>
            most complimentary manner to come to him, on the <lb/>
            pretence that the urgent state of certain affairs required <lb/>
            to be arranged by the aid of his counsel and concurrence, <lb/>
            and that he had need of such additional support in order <lb/>
            to crush the power of the Parthian tribes, who were <lb/>
            threatening war.</p>
          <p>5. And that he who was thus invited might not sus- <lb/>
            pect anything unfriendly, the Count Prosper was sent to <lb/>
            act as his deputy till he returned. Accordingly, when <lb/>
            Ursicinus had received the letters, and had obtained a <lb/>
            sufficient supply of carriages, and means of travelling, we1 <lb/>
            hastened to Milan with all speed.</p>
          <p>6. The next thing was to contrive to summon the Cæsar, <lb/>
            and to induce him to make the like haste. And to remove <lb/>
            all suspicion in his mind, Constantius used many hypocri- <lb/>
            tical endearments to persuade his own sister, Gallus's <lb/>
            wife, whom he pretended he had long been wishing <lb/>
            to see, to accompany him. And although she hesitated <note type="footnote">1 It will be observed that Ammianus here speaks of himself as <lb/>
            in attendance upon Ursicinus. </note> <pb n="38"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            from fear of her brother's habitual cruelty, yet, from a <lb/>
            hope that, as he was her brother, she might be able to <lb/>
            pacify him, she set out; but when she reached Bithynia, <lb/>
            at the station named Cæni Gallici, she was seized with a <lb/>
            sudden fever and died. And after her death, her husband, <lb/>
            considering that he had lost his greatest security and the <lb/>
            chief support on which he relied, hesitated, taking anxious <lb/>
            thought what lie should do.</p>
          <p>7. For amid the multiplicity of embarrassing. affairs <lb/>
            which distracted his attention, this point especially filled <lb/>
            his mind with apprehension, that Constantius, determining <lb/>
            everything according to his own sole judgment, was not a <lb/>
            man to admit of any excuse, or to pardon any error; but <lb/>
            being, as he was, more inclined to severity towards his <lb/>
            kinsmen than towards others, would be sure to put him to <lb/>
            death if he could get him into his power.</p>
          <p>8. Being therefore in this critical situation, and feeling <lb/>
            that he had to expect the worst unless he took vigilant <lb/>
            care, he embraced the idea of seizing on the supreme <lb/>
            power if he could find any opportunity: but for two <lb/>
            reasons he distrusted the good faith of his most intimate <lb/>
            councillors; both because they dreaded him as at once <lb/>
            cruel and fickle, and also because amid civil dissensions they <lb/>
            looked with awe upon the loftier fortune of Constantius.</p>
          <p>9. While perplexed with these vast and weighty anxieties <lb/>
            he received continual letters from the emperor, advising <lb/>
            and entreating him to come to him; and giving him hints <lb/>
            that the republic neither could nor ought to be divided; <lb/>
            but that every one was bound to the utmost of his power <lb/>
            to bring aid to it when it was tottering; alluding in this <lb/>
            to the devastations of the Gauls.</p>
          <p>10. And to this suggestion he added an example of no <lb/>
            great antiquity, that in the time of Diocletian and his <lb/>
            colleague,1 the Cæsars obeyed them as their officers, not <lb/>
            remaining stationary, but hastening to execute their orders <lb/>
            in every direction. And that even Galerius went in his <lb/>
            purple robe on foot for nearly a mile before the chariot of <lb/>
            Augustus* when he was offended with him.</p>
          <p>11. After many other messengers had been despatched to <lb/>
            him, Scudilo the tribune of the Scutarii arrived, a very cun- <lb/>
            ning master of persuasion under the cloak of a rude, blunt <note type="footnote">1 Maximianus Herculius. </note><note type="footnote">2 Diocletian. </note> <pb n="39"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            disposition. He, by mixing flattering language with his <lb/>
            serious conversation, induced him to proceed, when no one <lb/>
            else could do so, continually assuring him, with a hypo- <lb/>
            critical countenance, that his cousin was extremely desirous <lb/>
            to see him; that, like a clement and merciful prince, he <lb/>
            would pardon whatever errors had been committed through <lb/>
            thoughtlessness ; that he would make him a partner in his <lb/>
            own royal rank, and take him for his associate in those <lb/>
            toils which the northern provinces, long in a disturbed <lb/>
            state, imposed upon him.</p>
          <p>12. And as when the Fates lay their hand upon a man <lb/>
            his senses are wont to be blunted and dimmed, so Gallus, <lb/>
            being led on by these alluring persuasions to the expectation <lb/>
            of a better fortune, quitted Antioch under the guidance of <lb/>
            an unfriendly star, and hurried, as the old proverb has it, <lb/>
            out of the smoke into the flame;1 and having arrived at <lb/>
            Constantinople as if in great prosperity and security, at <lb/>
            the celebration of the equestrian games, he with his own <lb/>
            hand placed the crown on the head of the charioteer Corax, <lb/>
            when he obtained the victory.</p>
          <p>13. When Constantius heard this he became exaspe- <lb/>
            rated beyond all bounds of moderation; and lest by any <lb/>
            chance Gallus, feeling uncertain of the future, should <lb/>
            attempt to consult his safety by flight, all the garrisons <lb/>
            stationed in the towns which lay in his road were care- <lb/>
            fully removed.</p>
          <p>14. And at the same time Taurus, who was sent as <lb/>
            quæstor into Armenia, passed by without visiting or seei ng <lb/>
            him. Some persons, however, by the command of the <lb/>
            emperor, arrived under the pretence of one duty or another, <lb/>
            in order to take care that he should not be able to move, <lb/>
            or make any secret attempt of any kind. Among whom <lb/>
            was Leontius, afterwards prefect of the city, who was <lb/>
            sent as quæstor; and Lucillianus, as count of the domestic <lb/>
            guards, and a tribune of the Scutarii named Bainobaudes.</p>
          <p>15. Therefore after a long journey through the level <lb/>
            country, when he had reached Hadrianopolis, a city in the <lb/>
            district of Mount Hæmus, which had been formerly called <lb/>
            Uscudama, where he stayed twelve days to recover from his <lb/>
            fatigue, he found that the Theban legions, who were in <lb/>
            winter quarters in the neighbouring towns of those parts, <note type="footnote">1 As we say, Out of the frying-pan into the fire. </note> <pb n="40"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIV. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            had sent some of their comrades to exhort him by trust. <lb/>
            worthy and sure promises to remain there relying upon <lb/>
            them, since they were posted in great force among the <lb/>
            neighbouring stations ; but those about him watched him <lb/>
            with such diligent care that he could get no opportunity of <lb/>
            seeing them, or of hearing their message.</p>
          <p>16. Then, as letter after letter from the emperor urged <lb/>
            him to quit that city, he took ten public carriages, as he <lb/>
            was desired to do, and leaving behind him all his retinue, <lb/>
            except a few of his chamberlains and domestic officers, <lb/>
            whom he had brought with him, he was in this poor <lb/>
            manner compelled to hasten his journey, his guards forcing <lb/>
            aim to use all speed; while he from time to time, with <lb/>
            many regrets, bewailed the rashness which had placed <lb/>
            him in a mean and despised condition at the mercy of men <lb/>
            of the lowest class.</p>
          <p>17. And amid all these circumstances, in moments when <lb/>
            exhausted nature sought repose in sleep, his senses were <lb/>
            kept in a state of agitation by dreadful spectres making <lb/>
            unseemly noises about him; and crowds of those whom <lb/>
            he had slain, led on by Domitianus and Montius, seemed <lb/>
            to seize and torture him with all the torments of the <lb/>
            Furies.</p>
          <p>18. For the mind, when freed by sleep from its con- <lb/>
            nection with the body, is nevertheless active, and being <lb/>
            full of the thoughts and anxieties of mortal pursuits, en- <lb/>
            genders mighty visions which we call phantoms.</p>
          <p>19. Therefore his melancholy fate, by which it was <lb/>
            destined he should be deprived of empire and life, lead- <lb/>
            ing the way, he proceeded on his journey by continual <lb/>
            relays of horses, till he arrived at Petobio,1 a town in <lb/>
            Noricum. Hero all disguise was thrown off, and the <lb/>
            Count Barbatio suddenly made his appearance, with Apo- <lb/>
            demius. the secretary for the provinces, and an escort <lb/>
            of soldiers whom the emperor had picked out as men <lb/>
            bound to him by especial favours, feeling sure that they <lb/>
            could not be turned from their obedience either by bribes <lb/>
            or pity.</p>
          <p>20. And now the affair was conducted to its conclusion <lb/>
            without further disguise or deceit, and the whole portion of <lb/>
            the palace which is outside the walls was surrounded by <note type="footnote">1 The town of Pettau, on the Drave. </note> <pb n="41"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            armed men. Barbatio, entering the palace before day- <lb/>
            break, stripped the Cæsar of his royal robes, and clothed <lb/>
            him with a tunic and an ordinary soldier's garment, <lb/>
            assuring him with many protestations, as if by the especial <lb/>
            command of the emperor, that he should be exposed to no <lb/>
            further suffering; and then said to him, " Stand up at <lb/>
            once." And having suddenly placed him in a private car- <lb/>
            riage, he conducted him into Istria. near to the town of <lb/>
            Pola, where it is reported that Crispus, the SOIl of Constan- <lb/>
            tine, was formerly put to death.</p>
          <p>21. And while he was there kept in strict confine- <lb/>
            ment, being already terrified with apprehensions of his <lb/>
            approaching destruction, Eusebius, at that time the high <lb/>
            chamberlain, arrived in haste, and with him Pentadius <lb/>
            the secretary, and Mallobaudes the tribune of the guard, <lb/>
            who had the emperor's orders to compel him to explain, <lb/>
            case by case, on what accounts he had ordered each of the <lb/>
            individuals whom he had executed at Antioch to be put to <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>22. He being struck with a paleness like that of <lb/>
            Adrastus' at these questions, was only able to reply that <lb/>
            he had put most of them to death at the instigation of his <lb/>
            wife Constantina ; being forsooth ignorant that when the <lb/>
            mother of Alexander the Great urged him to put to death <lb/>
            some one who was innocent, and in the hope of prevailing <lb/>
            with him, repeated to him over and over again that she <lb/>
            had borne him nine months in her womb, and was his <lb/>
            mother, that emperor made her this prudent answer, " My <lb/>
            excellent mother, ask for some other reward ; for the life <lb/>
            of a man cannot be put in the balance with any kind of <lb/>
            service."</p>
          <p>23. When this was known, the emperor, giving way to <lb/>
            unchangeable indignation and anger, saw that his only <lb/>
            hope of establishing security firmly lay in putting the <lb/>
            Caesar to death. And having sent Serenianus, whom <lb/>
            we have already spoken of as having been accused of <lb/>
            treason, but acquitted by intrigue, and Pentadius the secre- <lb/>
            tart, and Apodemius the secretary for the provinces, he <lb/>
            commanded that they should put him to death. And <note type="footnote">1 A paleness such as overspread the countenance of Adrastus when <lb/>
            he saw his two sons-in-law, Pydeus and Polynices, slain at Thebes. <lb/>
            Virgil speaks of Adrasti pallentis imago, Æn. vi. 480. </note> <pb n="42"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIV. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            accordingly his hands were bound like those of some con- <lb/>
            victed thief, and he was beheaded, and his carcass, which <lb/>
            but a little while ago had been the object of dread to <lb/>
            cities and provinces, deprived of head and defaced: it was <lb/>
            then left on the ground.</p>
          <p>24. In this the supervision of the supreme Deity mani- <lb/>
            fested itself to be everywhere vigilant. For not only did <lb/>
            the cruelties of Gallus bring about his own destruction, but <lb/>
            they also who, by their pernicious flattery and instigation, <lb/>
            and charges supported by perjury, had led him to the <lb/>
            perpetration of many murders, not long afterwards died <lb/>
            miserably. Scudilo, being afflicted with a liver complaint <lb/>
            which penetrated to his lungs, died vomiting; while Bar- <lb/>
            batio, who had long busied himself in inventing false <lb/>
            accusations against Gallus, was accused by secret infor- <lb/>
            mation of aiming at some post higher than his command <lb/>
            of infantry, and being condemned, though unjustly, was <lb/>
            put to death, and so by his melancholy end made atonement <lb/>
            to the shade of the Caesar.</p>
          <p>25. These, and innumerable other actions of the same <lb/>
            kind, Adrastea, who is also called Nemesis, the avenger <lb/>
            of wicked and the re warder of good deeds, is continually <lb/>
            bringing to pass : would that she could always do so! <lb/>
            She is a kind of sublime agent of the powerful Deity, <lb/>
            dwelling, according to common belief, above the human <lb/>
            circle; or, as others define her, she is a substantial pro- <lb/>
            tection, presiding over the particular destinies of indi- <lb/>
            viduals, and feigned by the ancient theologians to be <lb/>
            the daughter of Justice, looking down from a certain <lb/>
            inscrutable eternity upon all terrestrial and mundane <lb/>
            affairs.</p>
          <p>26. She, as queen of all causes of events, and arbitress <lb/>
            and umpire in all affairs of life, regulates the urn which <lb/>
            contains the lots of men, and directs the alternations of <lb/>
            fortune which we behold in the world, frequently bringing <lb/>
            our undertakings to an issue different from what we in- <lb/>
            tended, and involving and changing great numbers of <lb/>
            actions. She also, binding the vainly swelling pride of <lb/>
            mankind by the indissoluble fetters of necessity, and sway- <lb/>
            ing the inclination of progress and decay according to her <lb/>
            will, sometimes bows down and enfeebles the stiff neck <lb/>
            of arrogance, and sometimes raises virtuous men from the <pb n="43"/>
             <unclear/><note type="margin">A.D. 353.] </note> <lb/>
            lowest depth, leading them to a prosperous and happy <lb/>
            life. And it is on this account that the fables of antiquity <lb/>
            have represented her with wings, that she may be sup- <lb/>
            posed to be present at all events with prompt celerity. <lb/>
            And they have also placed a rudder in her hand and given <lb/>
            her a wheel under her feet, that mankind may be aware <lb/>
            that she governs the universe, running at will through all <lb/>
            the elements.1</p>
          <p>27. In this untimely manner did the Cæsar, being himself <lb/>
            also already weary of life, die, in the twenty-ninth year of <lb/>
            his age, having reigned four years. He was born in the <lb/>
            country of the Etrurians, in the district of Veternum,2 <lb/>
            being the son of Constantius, the brother of the Emperor <lb/>
            Constantine; his mother was Galla, the sister of Rufinus <lb/>
            and Cerealis, men who had been ennobled by the offices of <lb/>
            consul and prefect.</p>
          <p>28. He was a man of splendid stature and great beauty <lb/>
            of person and figure, with soft hair of a golden colour, his <lb/>
            newly sprouting beard covering his cheeks with a tender <lb/>
            down, and in spite of his youth his countenance showed <lb/>
            dignity and authority. He differed as much from the tem- <lb/>
            perate habits of his brother Julian, as the sons of Vespasian, <lb/>
            Domitian and Titus, differed from each other.</p>
          <p>29. After he had been taken by the emperor as his <lb/>
            colleague, and raised to the highest eminence of power, he <lb/>
            experienced the fickle changeableness of fortune which <lb/>
            mocks mortality, sometimes raising individuals to the <note type="footnote">1 Ammianus here confounds Nemesis with Fortuna. Compare <lb/>
            Horace's description of the latter goddess, Lib. i. Od. 34 :— <lb/>
            "... Valet ima summis <lb/>
            Mutare, et insignia attenuat deus <lb/>
            Obscura promens : hinc apicem rapax <lb/>
            Fortuna cum stridore acuto <lb/>
            Sustulit; hie posuisse gaudet." <lb/>
            Or, as it is translated by Dr. Francis : — <lb/>
            " The hand of Jove can crush the proud <lb/>
            Down to the meanness of the crowd : <lb/>
            And raise the lowest in his stead: <lb/>
            But rapid Fortune pulls him down, <lb/>
            And snatches his imperial crown, <lb/>
            To place, not fix it, on another's head." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Near the modern city of Sienna. </note> <pb n="44"/>

            stars, at others sinking them to the lowest depths of <lb/>
            hell.</p>
          <p>30. And though the examples of such vicissitudes are <lb/>
            beyond number, nevertheless I will only enumerable a few <lb/>
            in a cursory manner. This changeable and fickle fortune <lb/>
            made Agathocles, the Sicilian, a king from being a potter, <lb/>
            and reduced Dionysius, formerly the terror of all nations, <lb/>
            to be the master of a grammar school. This same fortune <lb/>
            emboldened Andriscus of Adramyttium, who had been born <lb/>
            in a fuller's shop, to assume the name of Philip, and com- <lb/>
            pelled the legitimate son of Perseus to descend to the <lb/>
            trade of a blacksmith to obtain a livelihood. Again, for- <lb/>
            tune surrendered Maneinus2 to the people of Numantia, <lb/>
            after he had enjoyed the supreme command, exposed <lb/>
            Veturius8 to the cruelty of the Samnites, Claudius4 to <lb/>
            that of the Corsicans, and made Regulus' a victim to the <lb/>
            ferocity of the Carthaginians. Through the injustice of <lb/>
            fortune, Pompey,' after he had acquired the surname of <lb/>
            the Great by the grandeur of his exploits, was murdered <lb/>
            in AEgypt at the pleasure of some eunuchs, while a fellow <lb/>
            named Eunus, a slave who had escaped from a house <lb/>
            of correction, commanded an army of runaway slaves in <lb/>
            Sicily. How many men of the highest birth, through <lb/>
            the connivance of this same fortune, submitted to the <lb/>
            authority of Viriathus and of Spartacus! 7 How many <lb/>
            heads at which nations once trembled have fallen under <lb/>
            the deadly hand of the executioner! One man is thrown <lb/>
            into prison, another is promoted to unexpected power, <note type="footnote">1 See Plutarch's Life of Æmilius, c. 37. The name of the young <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. HAVING investigated the truth to the best of our power <lb/>
            we have hitherto related all the transactions which either <lb/>
            our age permitted us to witness, or which we could <lb/>
            learn from careful examination of those who were con- <lb/>
            cerned in them, in the order in which the several events <lb/>
            took place. The remaining facts, which the succeeding <lb/>
            books will set forth, we will, as far as our talent permits, <lb/>
            explain with the greatest accuracy, without fearing those <lb/>
            who may be inclined to cavil at our work as too long; <pb n="46"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. I </note> <lb/>
            for brevity is only to be praised when, while it puts an <lb/>
            end to unseasonable delays, it suppresses nothing which <lb/>
            is well authenticated.</p>
          <p>2. Gallus had hardly breathed his last in Noricum, when <lb/>
            Apodemius, who as long as he lived had been a fiery <lb/>
            instigator of disturbances, caught up his shoes and carried <lb/>
            them off, journeying, with frequent relays of horses, so <lb/>
            rapidly as even to kill some of them by excess of speed, <lb/>
            and no brought the first news of what had occurred to <lb/>
            Milan. And having made his way into the palace, he <lb/>
            threw down the shoes before the feet of Constantius, as if <lb/>
            he were bringing the spoils of a king of the Parthians <lb/>
            who had been slain. And when this sudden news arrived <lb/>
            that an affair so unexpected and difficult had been exe- <lb/>
            cuted with entire facility in complete accordance with <lb/>
            the wish of the emperor, the principal courtiers, accord- <lb/>
            ing to their custom, exerting all their zeal in the <lb/>
            path of flattery, extolled to the skies the virtue and <lb/>
            good fortune of the emperor, at whose nod, as if they <lb/>
            had been mere common soldiers, two prinees had thus <lb/>
            been deprived of their power, namely, Veteranio and <lb/>
            Gallus.</p>
          <p>3. And Constantius being exceedingly elated at the <lb/>
            exquisite taste of this adulation, and thinking that he him- <lb/>
            self for the future should be free from all the ordinary <lb/>
            inconveniences of mortality, now began to depart from <lb/>
            the path of justice so evidently that he even at times <lb/>
            laid claim to immortality; and in writing letters with his <lb/>
            own hand, would style himself lord of the whole world; <lb/>
            a thing which, if others had said, any one ought to <lb/>
            have been indignant at, who laboured with proper dili- <lb/>
            gence to form his life and habits in emulation of the con- <lb/>
            stitutional prinees who had preeeded him, as he professed <lb/>
            to do.</p>
          <p>4. For even if be bad under his power the infinities of <lb/>
            worlds landed by Demoeritus, as Alexander the Great, <lb/>
            under the promptings of Anaxarchus, did fancy, yet either <lb/>
            by reading, or by bearing others speak, he might have <lb/>
            considered that (as mathematicians unanimously agree) <lb/>
            the circumference of the whole earth, immense as it seems <lb/>
            to us, is nevertheless not bigger than a pin's point as com- <lb/>
            pared with the greatness of the universe. <pb n="47"/>

          <p>§ 1. AND now, after the pitiable death of the Cæsar, the <lb/>
            trumpet of judicial dangers sounded the alarm, and Ursi- <lb/>
            cinus was impeached of treason, envy gaining more and <lb/>
            more strength every day to attack his safety; envy which <lb/>
            is inimical to all powerful men.</p>
          <p>2. For he was overcome by this difficulty, that, while <lb/>
            the ears of the emperor were shut against all defences <lb/>
            which were reasonable and easy of proof, they were open <lb/>
            to all the secret whispers of calumniators, who pretended <lb/>
            that his name was almost disused among all the districts of <lb/>
            the East, and that Ursicinus was urged by them both <lb/>
            privately and publicly to be their commander, as one who <lb/>
            could be formidable to the Persian nation.</p>
          <p>3. But this magnanimous man stood his ground im- <lb/>
            movably against whatever might happen, only taking care <lb/>
            not to throw himself away in an abject manner, and <lb/>
            grieving from his heart that innocence had no safe founda- <lb/>
            tion on which to stand. And the more sad also for this <lb/>
            consideration, that before these events took place many of <lb/>
            his friends had gone over to other more powerful persons, <lb/>
            as in cases of official dignity the lictors go over to the <lb/>
            successors of former officers.</p>
          <p>4. His colleague Arbetio was attacking him by cajol- <lb/>
            ing words of feigned good-will, often publicly speaking <lb/>
            of .him as a virtuous and brave man; Arbetio being a man <lb/>
            of great cunning in laying snares for men of simple life, <lb/>
            and one who at that season enjoyed too much power. <lb/>
            For as a serpent that has its hole underground and hidden <lb/>
            from the sight of man observes the different passers-by, <lb/>
            and attacks whom it will with a sudden spring, so this man, <lb/>
            having been raised from being a common soldier of the <lb/>
            lowest class to the highest military dignities, without <lb/>
            having received any injury or any provocation, polluted <lb/>
            his conscience from an insatiable desire of doing mis- <lb/>
            chief.</p>
          <p>5. Therefore, having a few partners in his secrets for <lb/>
            accomplices, he had secretly arranged with the emperor <lb/>
            when he asked his opinion, that on the next night Ursicinus <lb/>
            should be seized and carried away from the sight of the <lb/>
            soldiers, and so be put to death uncondemned, just as <pb n="48"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XV. CH. I. </note> <lb/>
            formerly Domitius Corbulo, that faithful and wise defender <lb/>
            of our provinces, is said to have been slain in the miserable <lb/>
            period of Nero's cruelty.</p>
          <p>6. And after the matter had been thus arranged, while <lb/>
            the men destined for the service of seizing Ursicinus were <lb/>
            waiting for the appointed time, the emperor's mind changed <lb/>
            to mercy, and so this impious deed was put off for further <lb/>
            consideration.</p>
          <p>7. Then the engine of calumny was directed against <lb/>
            Julian, who had lately been brought to court; a prince <lb/>
            who afterwards became memorable, but who was now <lb/>
            attacked with a two-fold accusation, as the iniquity of his <lb/>
            enemies thought requisite. First, that he had gone from <lb/>
            the Park of Macellum, which lies in Cappadocia, into <lb/>
            Asia, from a desire of acquiring polite learning. Secondly, <lb/>
            that he had seen his brother as he passed through Con- <lb/>
            stantinople.</p>
          <p>8. And when he had explained away the charges thus <lb/>
            brought against him, and had proved that he had not done <lb/>
            either of these things without being ordered, he would <lb/>
            still have perished through the intrigues of the abandoned <lb/>
            court of flatterers, if he had not been saved by the favour of <lb/>
            the supreme Deity, with the assistance of Queen Eusebia. <lb/>
            By her intercession he obtained leave to be conducted to <lb/>
            the town of Como, in the neighbourhood of Milan; and <lb/>
            after he had remained there a short time he was permitted <lb/>
            to go to Greece for the purpose of cultivating his literary <lb/>
            tastes, as he was very eager to do.</p>
          <p>9. Nor were there wanting other incidents arising out of <lb/>
            these occurrences, which might be looked upon as events <lb/>
            under the direction of Providence, as some of them were <lb/>
            rightly punished, while others failed of their design, <lb/>
            proving vain and ineffective. But it occasionally happened <lb/>
            that rich men, relying on the protection of those in office, <lb/>
            and clinging to them as the ivy clings to lofty trees, bought <lb/>
            acquittals at immense prices; and that poor men who had <lb/>
            little or no means of purchasing safety were condemned out <lb/>
            of hand. And therefore truth was overshadowed by false- <lb/>
            hood, and sometimes falsehood obtained the authority of <lb/>
            truth.</p>
          <p>10. In these days Gorgonius also was summoned to <lb/>
            court, the man who had been the Cæsar's principal cham- <pb n="49"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 354.] </note> <lb/>
            berlain. And though it was made plain by his own con- <lb/>
            fession that he had been a partner in his undertakings, <lb/>
            and sometimes a chief instigator of them, yet through the <lb/>
            conspiracy of the eunuchs justice was overpowered by <lb/>
            dexterously arranged falsehoods, and he was acquitted and <lb/>
            so escaped the danger.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE these events were taking place at Milan, batta- <lb/>
            lions of soldiers were brought from the East to Aquileia, <lb/>
            with a number of members of the court, who, being broken <lb/>
            in spirit, while their limbs were enfeebled by the weight <lb/>
            of their chains, cursed the protraction of their lives which <lb/>
            were surrounded with every variety of misery. For they <lb/>
            were accused of having been the ministers of the ferocity <lb/>
            of Gallus, and it was believed to be owing to them that <lb/>
            Domitian had been torn to pieces, and that Montius and <lb/>
            others had been brought to destruction.</p>
          <p>2. Arboreus, and Eusebius, at that time high chamber- <lb/>
            lain, both men of insane arrogance, and equally unjust and <lb/>
            cruel, were appointed to try these men. And they, with- <lb/>
            out any careful examination, or making any distinction <lb/>
            between the innocent and the guilty, condemned some to <lb/>
            scourgings, others to torture and exile, some they adjudged <lb/>
            to serve in the lowest ranks of the army, and the rest they <lb/>
            condemned to death. And when they had thus filled the <lb/>
            sepulchres with dead bodies, they returned as if in triumph, <lb/>
            and brought an account of their exploits to the emperor, <lb/>
            who was notoriously severe and implacable against all <lb/>
            offences of the kind.</p>
          <p>3. After this, throughout the rest of his reign, Con- <lb/>
            stantius. as if resolved to reverse the prescribed arrangement <lb/>
            of the Fates, behaved with greater violence than ever, and <lb/>
            opened his heart to numbers of designing plotters. And <lb/>
            owing to this conduct, many men arose who watched <lb/>
            for all kinds of reports, at first attacking, as with the <lb/>
            appetite of wild beasts, those in the enjoyment of the <lb/>
            highest honours and rank, and afterwards both poor and <lb/>
            rich indiscriminately. Not like those Cibyratæ in the time <lb/>
            of Verres,' fawning on the tribunal of a single lieutenant, <note type="footnote">1 Tlepolemus and Hiero, whom Cicero, Verres iii. 11, calls Cibyratici <lb/>
            canes. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="50"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. III. </note> <lb/>
            but harassing the limbs of the whole republic by means of <lb/>
            all the evils that arose anywhere.</p>
          <p>4. Among these men Paul us and Mercurius were espe- <lb/>
            cially conspicuous, the first a Dacian born, the latter a <lb/>
            Persian. Mercurius was a notary, and Paulus had been <lb/>
            promoted from being a steward of the emperor's table to <lb/>
            a receivership in the provinces. Paulus, as I have already <lb/>
            mentioned, had been nicknamed The Chain, because in <lb/>
            weaving knots of calumnies he was invincible, scattering <lb/>
            around foul poisons and destroying people by various <lb/>
            means, as some skilful wrestlers are wont in their contests <lb/>
            to catch hold of their antagonists by the heel.</p>
          <p>5. Mercurius was nicknamed Count of Dreams, because <lb/>
            (as a do- fond of biting secretly fawns and wags his tail <lb/>
            while full of inward spite) he forced his way into feasts <lb/>
            and companies, and if any one in his sleep (when nature <lb/>
            roves about with an extraordinary degree of freedom) <lb/>
            communicated to a friend that he had seen anything, ex- <lb/>
            aggerated it, colouring it for the most part with envenomed <lb/>
            arts, and bore it to the open ears of the emperor. And for <lb/>
            such speeches men were attacked with formidable accusa- <lb/>
            tions, as if they had committed inexpiable crimes.</p>
          <p>6. The news of these events having got abroad, men <lb/>
            were so cautious of even relating nocturnal dreams, that, <lb/>
            in the presence of a stranger, they would scarcely con- <lb/>
            fess they had slept at all. And some accomplished men <lb/>
            lamented that they had not been born in the country of <lb/>
            Mount Atlas,' where it is said that dreams never occur, <lb/>
            though what the cause of such a fact is, we must leave to <lb/>
            those who are learned in such matters to decide.</p>
          <p>7. Amid all these terrible investigations and punish- <lb/>
            ments, another disaster took place in Illyricum, which <lb/>
            from some empty words involved many in danger. At an <lb/>
            entertainment given by Africanus, the governor of the <lb/>
            second Pannonia, at Sirmium, some men having drunk <lb/>
            rather too much, and thinking there was no witness of <lb/>
            their proceedings, spoke freely of the existing imperial <lb/>
            government, accusing it as most vexatious to the people. <lb/>
            And some of them expressed a hope that a change, such <lb/>
            as was wished for by all, might be at hand, affirming that <note type="footnote">1 Herodotus, iv. 184, records that in Africa, in the country about <lb/>
            Mount Atlas, dreams are unknown. </note> <pb n="51"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 354.] </note> <lb/>
            this was portended by omens, while some, with incredible <lb/>
            rashness, affirmed that the auguries of their ancestral house <lb/>
            promised the same thing.</p>
          <p>8. Among those present at the banquet was Gaudentius, <lb/>
            one of the secretaries, a stupid man, and of a hasty disposi- <lb/>
            tion. And he looking upon the matter as serious, reported <lb/>
            it to Rufinus, who was at that time the chief commander <lb/>
            of the guard of the praetorian prefecture, a man always <lb/>
            eager for the most cruel measures, and infamous for every <lb/>
            kind of wickedness.</p>
          <p>9. He immediately, as if borne on wings, flew to the <lb/>
            court of the emperor, and so bitterly inflamed him, always <lb/>
            easy of access and susceptible of impressions from sus- <lb/>
            picious circumstances of this kind, that without a moment's <lb/>
            deliberation he ordered Africanus and all who had been <lb/>
            partakers of his fatal banquet to be seized. And when <lb/>
            this was done, the wicked informer, always fond of what- <lb/>
            ever is contrary to popular manners, obtained what he most <lb/>
            coveted, a continuation of his existing office for two years.</p>
          <p>10. To arrest these men, Teutomeres, the chief of the <lb/>
            Protectores, was sent with his colleague ; and he loaded <lb/>
            them all with chains, and conducted them, as he had been <lb/>
            ordered, to the emperor's court. But when they arrived at <lb/>
            Aquileia, Marinus, who from having been a drillmaster <lb/>
            had been promoted to a tribuneship, but who at that <lb/>
            time had had no particular duty, being a man who had held <lb/>
            dangerous language, and who was in other respects of an <lb/>
            intemperate disposition, being left in an inn while things <lb/>
            necessary for the journey were being prepared, stabbed <lb/>
            himself with a knife which he accidentally found, and his <lb/>
            bowels gushed out, so that he died. The rest were con- <lb/>
            ducted to Milan, and subjected to torture; and having <lb/>
            been forced by their agony to confess that while at the <lb/>
            banquet they had used some petulant expressions, were <lb/>
            ordered to be kept in penal confinement, with some hope, <lb/>
            though an uncertain one, of eventual release. But Teuto- <lb/>
            meres and his colleague, being accused of having allowed <lb/>
            Marinus to kill himself, were condemned to banishment, <lb/>
            though they were afterwards pardoned through the inter- <lb/>
            cession of Arbetio. <pb n="52"/>

          <p>§ 1. SOON after this transaction had been thus terminated, <lb/>
            war was declared against the tribes of the Allemanni <lb/>
            around Lentia,l who had often made extensive incursions <lb/>
            into the contiguous Roman territories. The emperor him- <lb/>
            self set out on the expedition, and went as far as Rhætia, - <lb/>
            and the district of the Canini.' And there, after- long <lb/>
            and careful deliberation, it was decided to be both honour- <lb/>
            able and expedient that Arbetio, the master of the horse, <lb/>
            should march with a division of the troops, in fact with <lb/>
            the greater part of the army, along the borders of the lake <lb/>
            of Brigantia, with the object of coming to an immediate <lb/>
            engagement with the barbarians. And I will here describe <lb/>
            the character of the ground briefly, as well as I can.</p>
          <p>2. The Rhine rising among the defiles of lofty moun- <lb/>
            tains, and forcing its way with immense violence through <lb/>
            steep rocks, stretches its onward course without receiving <lb/>
            any foreign waters, in the same manner as the Nile pours <lb/>
            down with headlong descent through the cataracts. And <lb/>
            it is so abundantly full by its own natural riches that it <lb/>
            would be navigable up to its very source were it not like <lb/>
            a torrent rather than a stream.</p>
          <p>3. And soon after it has disentangled itself from its <lb/>
            defiles, rolling onward between high banks, it enters a <lb/>
            vast lake of circular form, which the Rhætian natives call <lb/>
            Brigantia,3 being four hundred and sixty furlongs in <lb/>
            length, and of nearly equal extent in breadth, unapproach- <lb/>
            able on account of a vast mass of dark woods, except where <lb/>
            the energy of the Romans has made a wide road through <lb/>
            them, in spite of the hostility of the barbarians, and the <lb/>
            unfavourable character both of the ground and the climate.</p>
          <p>4. The Rhine forcing its way into this pool, and roaring <lb/>
            with its foaming eddies, pierces the sluggish quiet of the <lb/>
            waters, and rushes through the middle from one end to <lb/>
            the other. And like an element separated from some <lb/>
            other element by eternal discord, without any increase or <lb/>
            diminution of the volume of water which it has brought <lb/>
            into the lake, it comes forth from it again with its old <note type="footnote">1 Lintz. </note><note type="footnote">2 The district around Bellinzona. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The Bodensee, more generally known as the Lake of Constance: <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> A.D. 354.] </note> <lb/>
            name and its unalloyed power, never having suffered from <lb/>
            the contact, and so proceeds till it mingles with the waves <lb/>
            of the sea.</p>
          <p>5. And what is exceedingly strange, the lake is not <lb/>
            moved at all by this rapid passage of the river through <lb/>
            it, nor is it affected by the muddy soil beneath the waters <lb/>
            of the lake; the two bodies of water being incapable of <lb/>
            mingling with each other. A thing which would be sup- <lb/>
            posed impossible, did not the very sight of the lake prove <lb/>
            the fact.</p>
          <p>6. In a similar manner, the Alpheus, rising in Arcadia, <lb/>
            being seized with a love for the fountain Arethusa,l passing <lb/>
            through the Ionian sea, as is related by the poets, proceeds <lb/>
            onward till it arrives at the neighbourhood of its beloved <lb/>
            fountain.</p>
          <p>7. Arbetio not choosing to wait till messengers arrived to <lb/>
            announce the approach of the barbarians, although he <lb/>
            knew the fierce way in which they begin their wars, <lb/>
            allowed himself to be betrayed into a hidden ambush, <lb/>
            where he stood without the power of moving, being <lb/>
            bewildered by the suddenness of his disaster.</p>
          <p>8. In the mean time the enemy, showing themselves, <lb/>
            sprang forth from their hiding-places and spared not one <lb/>
            who came in their way, but overwhelmed them with every <lb/>
            kind of weapon. For none of our men could offer the <lb/>
            smallest resistance, nor was there any hope of any of them <lb/>
            being able to save their lives except by a speedy flight. <lb/>
            Therefore, being intent only on avoiding wounds, our <lb/>
            soldiers, losing all order, ran almost at random in every <lb/>
            direction, exposing their backs to the blows of the enemy. <lb/>
            Nevertheless the greater part of them, scattering themselves <lb/>
            among narrow paths, were saved from danger by the <lb/>
            protecting darkness of the night, and at the return of day <lb/>
            recovered their courage and rejoined their different legions. <lb/>
            But still by this sad and unexpected disaster a vast <lb/>
            number of common soldiers and ten tribunes were slain.</p>
          <p>9. The Allemanni were greatly elated at this event, and <lb/>
            advanced with increased boldness, every day coming up to <lb/>
            the fortifications of the Romans while the morning mists <lb/>
            obscured the light; and drawing their swords roamed about <note type="footnote">1 The Arethusa is in Sicily, near Syracuse. </note> <pb n="54"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. IV. </note> <lb/>
            in every direction, gnashing their teeth, and threatening <lb/>
            us with haughty shouts. Then with a sudden sally our <lb/>
            Scutarii would rush forth, and after being stopped for a <lb/>
            moment by the resistance of the hostile squadrons, would <lb/>
            call out all their comrades to join them in the engage- <lb/>
            ment..</p>
          <p>10. But the greater part of our men were alarmed by <lb/>
            the recollection of their recent disaster, and Arbetio <lb/>
            hesitated, thinking everything pregnant with danger. <lb/>
            Upon this three tribunes at onee sallied forth, Arintheus <lb/>
            who was a lieutenant commander of the heavy troops, <lb/>
            Seniauehus who commanded the cavalry of the Comites,' <lb/>
            and Bappo who had the command of the Promoti2 and <lb/>
            of those troops who had been particularly intrusted to his <lb/>
            charge by the emperor.</p>
          <p>11. These men, looking on the common cause as their <lb/>
            own, resolved to repel the violence of the enemy aeeording <lb/>
            to the example of their ancient comrades. And pouring <lb/>
            down upon the foe like a torrent, not in a regular line of <lb/>
            battle, but in desultory attacks like those of banditti, they <lb/>
            put them all to flight in a disgraceful manner. Since <lb/>
            they, being in loose order and straggling, and hampered <lb/>
            by their endeavours to escape, exposed their unprotected <lb/>
            bodies to our weapons, and were slain by repeated blows <lb/>
            of sword and spear.</p>
          <p>12. Many too were slain with their horses, and seemed <lb/>
            as they lay on their backs to be so entangled as still to be <lb/>
            sitting on them. And when this was seen, all our men <lb/>
            who had previously hesitated to engage in battle with their <lb/>
            comrades, poured forth out of the eamp; and now, forget- <lb/>
            ful of all precautions, they drove before them the mob of <lb/>
            barbarians, except such as flight had saved from destruction, <lb/>
            trampling on the heaps of slain, and covered with gore.</p>
          <p>13. When the battle was thus terminated the emperor <lb/>
            in triumph and joy returned to Milan to winter quarters. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Comites were a picked body of troops, divided into several <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER these unhappy circumstances, accompanied as <lb/>
            they were with equal calamities in the provinces, a whirl- <lb/>
            wind of new misfortunes arose which seemed likely to <lb/>
            destroy the whole state at once, if Fortune, which regu- <lb/>
            lates the events of human life, had not terminated a slate <lb/>
            of affairs which all regarded with great apprehension, by <lb/>
            bringing the dangers to a speedy issue.</p>
          <p>2. From the long neglect with which these provinces <lb/>
            had been treated, the Gauls, having no assistance on which <lb/>
            to rely, had borne cruel massacres, with plunder and con- <lb/>
            flagration, from barbarians who raged throughout their <lb/>
            land with impunity. Silvanus, the commander of the <lb/>
            infantry, being a man well suited to correct these evils, <lb/>
            went thither at the command of the emperor, Arbetio at <lb/>
            the same time urging with all his power that this task <lb/>
            should be undertaken without delay, with the object of <lb/>
            imposing the dangerous burden of this duty on his absent <lb/>
            rival, whom he was vexed to see still in prosperity....</p>
          <p>3. There was a certain man named Dynamius, the super- <lb/>
            intendent of the emperor's beasts of burden, who had <lb/>
            begged of Silvanus recommendatory letters to his friends as <lb/>
            of one who was admitted to his most intimate friendship. <lb/>
            Having obtained this favour, as Silvanus, having no sus- <lb/>
            picion of any evil intention, had with great simplicity <lb/>
            granted what he was asked, Dynamius kept the letters, in <lb/>
            order at a future time to plan something to his injury.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, when the aforesaid commander had gone <lb/>
            to the Gauls in the service of the republic, and while he <lb/>
            was engaged in repelling the barbarians, who already <lb/>
            began to distrust their own power, and to be filled with <lb/>
            alarm, Dynamius, being restless, like a man of cunning and <lb/>
            practised deceitfulness, devised a wicked plot; and in <lb/>
            this it is said he had for his accomplices Lampadius, the <lb/>
            prefect of the praetorian guard, Eusebius, who had <lb/>
            been the superintendent of the emperor's privy purse, <lb/>
            and was known by the nickname of Mattyocopa,1 and <note type="footnote">1 From <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόπτω</foreign> to cut, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ματτύα</foreign> any delicate food; meant as <lb/>
            equivalent to our cheeseparer, or skinflint. </note> <pb n="56"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. V</note> <lb/>
            Ædesius, formerly keeper of the records, whom this <lb/>
            prefect had contrived to have elected consul, as being <lb/>
            his dearest friend. He then with a sponge effaced the <lb/>
            contents of the letters, leaving nothing but the address, <lb/>
            and inserted a text materially differing from the original <lb/>
            writing, as if Silvanus had asked, by indirect hints, and <lb/>
            entreated his friends who were within the palace and those <lb/>
            who had no office (among whom was Albinus of Etruria, <lb/>
            and many others), to aid him in projects of loftier am- <lb/>
            bition, as one who would soon attain the imperial throne. <lb/>
            This bundle of letters he thus made up, inventing at <lb/>
            his leisure, in order with them to endanger the life of this <lb/>
            innocent man.</p>
          <p>5. Dynamius was appointed to investigate these charges <lb/>
            on behalf of the emperor; and while he was artfully weaving <lb/>
            these and similar plans, he contrived to enter alone into <lb/>
            the imperial chamber, choosing his opportunity, and hoping <lb/>
            to entangle firmly in his meshes the most vigilant guardian <lb/>
            of the emperor's safety. And being full of wicked cun- <lb/>
            ning, after he had read the forged packet of letters in the <lb/>
            council chamber, the tribunes were ordered to be com- <lb/>
            mitted to custody, and also several private individuals <lb/>
            were commanded to be arrested and brought up from <lb/>
            the provinces, whose names were mentioned in those <lb/>
            letters.</p>
          <p>6. But presently Malarichus, the commander of the Gen- <lb/>
            tiles, being struck with the iniquity of the business, and <lb/>
            taking his colleagues to his counsel, spoke out loudly that <lb/>
            men devoted to the preservation of the emperor ought not to <lb/>
            be circumvented by factions and treachery. He accordingly <lb/>
            demanded that he himself, his nearest relations being left as <lb/>
            hostages, and Mallobaudes, the tribune of the heavy-armed <lb/>
            soldiers, giving bail that he would return, might be commis- <lb/>
            sioned to go with speed to bring back Silvanus, who he <lb/>
            was certain had never entertained the idea of any such <lb/>
            attempt as these bitter plotters had imputed to him. Or, as <lb/>
            an alternative, he entreated that he might become security <lb/>
            for Mallobaudes, and that their officers might be permitted <lb/>
            to go and do what he had proposed to take upon himself.</p>
          <p>7. For he affirmed that he knew beyond all question <lb/>
            that, if any stranger were sent, Silvanus, who was inclined <lb/>
            to be somewhat apprehensive of danger, even when no <pb n="57"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 355. </note> <lb/>
            circumstances were really calculated to alarm him, would <lb/>
            very likely throw matters into confusion.</p>
          <p>8. But, although the advice which he gave was useful <lb/>
            and necessary, he spoke as to the winds, to no purpose. <lb/>
            For by the counsels of Arbetio, Apodemius, who was a <lb/>
            persevering and bitter enemy to all good men, was sent <lb/>
            with letters to summon Silvanus to the presence. When <lb/>
            he had arrived in Gaul, taking no heed of the commission <lb/>
            with which he was charged, and caring but little for any- <lb/>
            thing that might happen, he remained inactive, without <lb/>
            either seeing Silvanus, or delivering the letters which <lb/>
            commanded him to appear at court. And having taken <lb/>
            the receiver of the province into his counsels, he began <lb/>
            with arrogance and malevolence to harass the clients and <lb/>
            servants of the master of the horse, as if that officer had <lb/>
            been already condemned and was on the point of being <lb/>
            executed.</p>
          <p>9. In the mean time, while the arrival of Silvanus was <lb/>
            looked for, and while Apodemius was throwing everything, <lb/>
            though quiet before, into commotion, Dynamius, that he <lb/>
            might by still more convincing proofs establish belief in <lb/>
            his wicked plots, had sent other forged letters (agreeing <lb/>
            with the previous ones which he had brought under the <lb/>
            emperor's notice by the agency of the prefect) to the <lb/>
            tribune of the factory at Cremona: these were written in <lb/>
            the names of Silvanus and Malarichus, in which the <lb/>
            tribune, as one privy to their secrets, was warned to lose <lb/>
            no time in having everything in readiness.</p>
          <p>10. But when this tribune had read the whole of the <lb/>
            letters, he was for some time in doubt and perplexity as <lb/>
            to what they could mean (for he did not recollect that <lb/>
            those persons whose letters he had thus received had <lb/>
            ever spoken with him upon private transactions of any <lb/>
            kind) ; and accordingly he sent the letters themselves, <lb/>
            by the courier who had brought them, to Malarichus, <lb/>
            sending a soldier also with him ; and entreated Malarichus <lb/>
            to explain in intelligible language what he wanted, and <lb/>
            not to use such obscure terms. For he declared that he, <lb/>
            being but a plain and somewhat rude man, had not in the <lb/>
            least understood what was intimated so obscurely.</p>
          <p>11. Malarichus the moment he received the letters, being <lb/>
            already in sorrow and anxiety, and alarmed for his own <pb n="58"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. <unclear>I</unclear> </note> <lb/>
            fate and that of his countryman Silvanus, called around <lb/>
            him the Franks, of whom at that time there was a great <lb/>
            multitude in the palaec, and in resolute language laid <lb/>
            open and proved the falsehood of the machinations by <lb/>
            whieh their lives were threatened, and was loud in his <lb/>
            complaints.</p>
          <p>12. When these things became known to the emperor, <lb/>
            he appointed the members of his secret council and the <lb/>
            chief officers of his army to make further investigation of <lb/>
            the matter. And when the judges appeared to make light <lb/>
            of it, Florentius the son of Nigridianus, who at that time <lb/>
            filled the post of master of the offices,1 having examined <lb/>
            the writings carefully, and detecting beneath them some <lb/>
            vestiges of the tops of the former words whieh had been <lb/>
            effaced, perceived, as was indeed the ease, that by inter- <lb/>
            polations of the original letter, matters very different from <lb/>
            any of which Silvanus was author had been written over <lb/>
            them, according to the fancy of the contriver of this <lb/>
            forgery.</p>
          <p>13. On this the eloud of treachery was dispersed, and <lb/>
            the emperor, informed of the truth by a faithful report, <lb/>
            recalled the powers granted to the prefect, and ordered <lb/>
            him to be submitted to an examination. Nevertheless <lb/>
            he was acquitted through the active combination of many <lb/>
            of his friends; while Eusebius, the former treasurer of the <lb/>
            emperor's secret purse, being put to the torture, confessed <lb/>
            that these things had been done with his privity.</p>
          <p>14. Ædesius, affirming with obstinate denial that he <lb/>
            had never known anything which had been done in the <lb/>
            matter, escaped, being adjudged innocent. And thus the <lb/>
            transaction was brought to an end, and all those who had <lb/>
            been accused in the original information were acquitted ; <lb/>
            and Dynamius, as a man of exceeding accomplishments <lb/>
            and -prudence, was appointed to govern Etruria with the <lb/>
            rank of corrector.</p>
          <p>15. While these affairs were proceeding, Silvanus was <lb/>
            living at Agrippina,2 and having learnt by continual <note type="footnote">1 This was a very important post; it seems to have united the func- <lb/>

            information sent to him by his friends what Apodemius <lb/>
            was doing with the hope of effecting his ruin; and <lb/>
            knowing also how impressible the mind of the feeble <lb/>

            being convicted of any crime, he might still be treated as a <lb/>
            criminal. And so, being placed in a situation of the <lb/>
            greatest difficulty, he began to think of trusting himself to <lb/>
            the good faith of the barbarians.</p>
          <p>16. But being dissuaded from this by Laniogaisus, at <lb/>
            that time a tribune, whom we have already spoken of as <lb/>
            the only person who was present with Constans when he <lb/>
            was dying, himself serving at that time as a volunteer; <lb/>
            and being assured by Laniogaisus that the Franks, of <lb/>
            whom he himself was a countryman, would put him to <lb/>
            death, or else betray him for a bribe, he saw no safety <lb/>
            anywhere in the present emergency, and so was driven to <lb/>
            extreme counsels. And by degrees, having secretly con- <lb/>
            ferred with the chiefs of the principal legions, and having <lb/>
            excited them by the magnitude of promised rewards, he <lb/>
            tore for use on this occasion the purple silk from the in- <lb/>
            signia of the dragons 1 and standards, and so assumed the <lb/>
            title of emperor.</p>
          <p>17. And while these events are passing in Gaul, one day, <lb/>
            a little before sunset, an unexpected messenger arrived at <lb/>
            Milan, relating fully that Silvanus, being ambitious to rise <lb/>
            above his place as commander of the infantry, had tampered <lb/>
            with the army, and assumed the imperial dignity.</p>
          <p>18. Constantius, at this amazing and unexpected event, <lb/>
            seemed as if struck by a thunderbolt of fate, and having <lb/>
            at once summoned a council to meet at the second watch, <lb/>
            all the nobles hastened to the palace. No one had either <lb/>
            mind to conceive or tongue to recommend what was best to <lb/>
            be done; but in suppressed tones they mentioned the <lb/>
            name of Ursicinus as a man eminent for skill in affairs of <lb/>
            war, and one who had been undeservedly exposed to most <lb/>
            injurious treatment. He was immediately sent for by the <lb/>
            principal chamberlain, which is the most honourable kind <lb/>
            of summons, and as soon as he entered the council-chamber <lb/>
            he was offered the purple to salute much more graciously <lb/>
            than at any former time. Diocletian was the first who in- <lb/>
            troduced the custom of offering reverence to the emperor <note type="footnote">1 The dragons were the effigies on some of the standards. </note> <pb n="60"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. V. </note> <lb/>
            after this foreign manner and royal pretension ; whereas <lb/>
            all former princes, as we read, had been saluted like judges.</p>
          <p>19. And so the man who a little while before, through <lb/>
            the malevolent persecution of certain of the courtiers, had <lb/>
            been termed the whirlpool of the East, and who had been <lb/>
            accused of a design to aim at the supreme power for his <lb/>
            sons, was now recommended as one who was a most skilful <lb/>
            general, who had been the comrade of the great Constan-. <lb/>
            tine, and as the only man capable of extinguishing the <lb/>
            threatened conflagration. And though the reasons for <lb/>
            which he was sent for were honest, they were not wholly <lb/>
            free from underhand motives. For while great anxiety <lb/>
            was felt that Silvanus should be destroyed as a most for- <lb/>
            midable rebel, yet, if that object miscarried, it was thought <lb/>
            that Ursicinus, being damaged by the failure, would him- <lb/>
            self easily be ruined; so that no scruple, which else was <lb/>
            to be feared, would interpose to save him from destruction.</p>
          <p>20. While arrangements were being made for acclerating <lb/>
            his journey, the general was preparing to repel the charges <lb/>
            which had been brought against him; but the emperor <lb/>
            prevented him, forbidding him in conciliatory language, <lb/>
            saying that this was not an opportunity suitable for under- <lb/>
            taking any controversy in defence of his cause, when the <lb/>
            imminent necessity of affairs rather prompted that no delay <lb/>
            should be interposed to the restoration of parties to their <lb/>
            pristine concord before the disunion got worse.</p>
          <p>21. Therefore, after a long deliberation about many <lb/>
            things, the first and most important matter in which con- <lb/>
            sultation was held, was by what means Silvanus could be <lb/>
            led to think the emperor still ignorant of his conduct. <lb/>
            And the most likely manner to confirm him in his con- <lb/>
            fidence appeared to be that he should be informed, in a <lb/>
            complimentary despatch, that Ursicinus was appointed his <lb/>
            successor, and that he was invited to return to court with <lb/>
            undiminished power.</p>
          <p>22. After this affair was arranged, the officer who had <lb/>
            brought the news to Milan was ordered to depart with <lb/>
            some tribunes and ten of the Protectores and domestic guard <lb/>
            as an escort, given to him at his own request, to aid him <lb/>
            in the discharge of his public duty. And of these I myseif <lb/>
            was one, with my colleague Verrinianus ; and all the rest <lb/>
            were either friends or relations of mine. <pb n="61"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 355.] </note> 23. And now all of us, fearing mainly for ourselves, <lb/>
            accompanied him a long distance on his journey; and <lb/>
            although we seemed as exposed to danger as gladiators <lb/>
            about to fight with wild beasts, yet considering in our <lb/>
            minds that evils are often the forerunners of good, we <lb/>
            recollected with admiration that expression of Cicero's, <lb/>
            uttered by him in accordance with the eternal maxims of <lb/>
            truth, which runs in these words:1—“ And although it is a <lb/>
            thing most desirable that one's fortune should always con- <lb/>
            tinue in a most flourishing condition; still that general <lb/>
            level state of life brings not so much sensation of joy as we <lb/>
            feel when, after having been surrounded by disasters or by <lb/>
            dangers, fortune returns into a happier condition.,,</p>
          <p>24. Accordingly we hastened onwards by forced journeys, <lb/>
            in order that the master of the horse, who was eager to <lb/>
            acquire the honour of suppressing the revolt, might make <lb/>
            his appearance in the suspected district before any rumour <lb/>
            of the usurpation of Silvanus had spread among the <lb/>
            Italians. But rapidly as we hastened, fame, like the <lb/>
            wind, had outstripped us, and had revealed some part of <lb/>
            the facts; and when we reached Agrippina we found <lb/>
            matters quite out of the reach of our attempts.</p>
          <p>25. For a vast multitude of people, assembled from all <lb/>
            quarters, were, with a mixture of haste and alarm, <lb/>
            strengthening the foundations of Silvanus's enterprise, and <lb/>
            a numerous military force was collected ; so that it seemed <lb/>
            more advisable, on the existing emergency, for our unfor- <lb/>
            tunate general to await the intentions and pleasure of the <lb/>
            new emperor, who was assuring himself by ridiculous omens <lb/>
            and signs that he was gaining accessions of strength. By <lb/>
            permitting his feelings of security to increase, by different <note type="footnote">1 There is no such passage in any extant work of Cicero, but a sen- <lb/>
            tence in his speech ad Pontifices resembles it: " For although it be <lb/>
            more desirable to end one's life without pain, and without injury, still <lb/>
            it tends more to an immortality of glory to be regretted by one's <lb/>
            countrymen, than to have been always free from injury." And a still <lb/>
            closer likeness to the sentiment is found in his speech ad Quirites post <lb/>
            reditum : " Although there is nothing more to be wished for by man <lb/>
            than prosperous, equal, continual good-fortune in life, flowing on in a <lb/>
            prosperous course, without any misadventure ; still, if all my life had <lb/>
            been tranquil and peaceful, I should have been deprived of the in- <lb/>
            credible and almost heavenly delight and happiness which I now <lb/>
            enjoy through your kindness.”—Orations, v. 2; Bohn, p. 491-2. </note> <pb n="62"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. V. </note> <lb/>
            pretences of agreement and flattery, Silvanus, it was <lb/>
            thought, might be relieved from all fear of hostility, and <lb/>
            so be the more easily deceived.</p>
          <p>26. But the accomplishment of such a design appeared <lb/>
            difficult. For it was necessary to use great care and <lb/>
            watchfulness to make our desires subordinate to our oppor- <lb/>
            tunities, and to prevent their either outrunning them, or <lb/>
            falling behind them; since if our wishes were allowed to <lb/>
            become known unseasonably, it was plain we should all bo <lb/>
            involved in one sentence of death.</p>
          <p>27. However our general was kindly received, and (the <lb/>
            very business itself forcing us to bend our necks), having <lb/>
            been compelled to prostrate himself with all solemnity <lb/>
            before the newly robed prince, still aiming at higher <lb/>
            power, was treated as a highly favoured and eminent friend; <lb/>
            having freedom of access and the honour of a seat at the <lb/>
            royal table granted to him in preference to every one else, <lb/>
            in order that he might be consulted with the more secrecy <lb/>
            about the principal affairs of state.</p>
          <p>28. Silvanus expressed his indignation that, while un- <lb/>
            worthy persons had been raised to the consulship and to <lb/>
            other high dignities, he and Ursicinus alone, after the fre- <lb/>
            quent and great toils which they had endured for the sake <lb/>
            of the republic, had been so despised that he himself had <lb/>
            been accused of treason in consequence of the examination <lb/>
            of some slaves, and had been exposed to an ignoble trial; <lb/>
            while Ursicinus had been brought over from the East, and <lb/>
            placed at the mercy of his enemies; and these were the <lb/>
            subjects of his incessant complaints both in public and in <lb/>
            private.</p>
          <p>29. While, however, he was holding this kind of lan- <lb/>
            guage, we were alarmed at the murmurs of our soldiers <lb/>
            who were now suffering from want, which surrounded <lb/>
            us on all sides; the troops showing every eagerness to <lb/>
            make a rapid march through the defiles of the Cottian <lb/>
            Alps.</p>
          <p>30. In this state of anxiety and agitation, we occu- <lb/>
            pied ourselves in secretly deliberating on the means of <lb/>
            arriving at our object; and at length, after our plans had <lb/>
            been repeatedly changed out of fear, it was determined <lb/>
            to use great industry in seeking out prudent agents, bind <lb/>
            ing them to secrecy by solemn oaths, in order to tamper <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 355.] </note> <lb/>
            with the Gallic soldiers whom we knew to be men of <lb/>
            doubtful fidelity, and at any time open to change for a <lb/>
            sufficient reward.</p>
          <p>31. Therefore, after we had secured our success by <lb/>
            the address of some agents among the common soldiers, <lb/>
            men by their very obscurity fitted for the accomplish- <lb/>
            ment of such a task, and now excited by the expecta- <lb/>
            tion of reward, at sunrise, as soon as the east began to <lb/>
            redden, a band of armed men suddenly sallied forth, and, <lb/>
            as is common in critical moments, behaving with more than <lb/>
            usual audacity. They slew the sentinels and penetrated <lb/>
            into the palace, and so having dragged Silvanus out of a <lb/>
            little chapel in which, in his terror, he had taken refuge on <lb/>
            his way to a conventicle devoted to the ceremonies of the <lb/>
            Christian worship, they slew him with repeated strokes of <lb/>
            their swords.</p>
          <p>32. In this way did a general of no slight merit perish, <lb/>
            through fear of false accusations heaped on him in his <lb/>
            absence by a faction of wicked men, and which drove <lb/>
            h m to the utmost extremities in order to preserve his <lb/>
            safety.</p>
          <p>33. For although he had acquired strong claims on the <lb/>
            gratitude of Constantius by his seasonable sally with his <lb/>
            troops before the battle of Mursa, and although he could <lb/>
            boast the valorous exploits of his father Bonitus, a man <lb/>
            of Frankish extraction, but who had espoused the party of <lb/>
            Constantine, and often in the civil war had exhibited <lb/>
            great prowess against the troops of Licinius, still he <lb/>
            always feared him as a prince of wavering and fickle cha- <lb/>
            racter.</p>
          <p>34. Now before any of these events had taken place in <lb/>
            Gaul, it happened that one day in the Circus Maximus at <lb/>
            Rome, the populace cried out with a loud voice, " Silvanus <lb/>
            is conquered." Whether influenced by instinct or by some <lb/>
            prophetic spirit, cannot be decided.</p>
          <p>35. Silvanus having been slain, as I have narrated, <lb/>
            at Agrippina, the emperor was seized with inconceivable <lb/>
            joy when he heard the news, and gave way to exceeding <lb/>
            insolence and arrogance, attributing this event also to the <lb/>
            prosperous course of his good fortune; giving the reins to <lb/>
            his habitual disposition which always led him to hate men <lb/>
            of brave conduct, as Domitian in former times had done, <pb n="64"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XV. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            and desiring at all times to destroy them by every act of <lb/>
            opposition.</p>
          <p>36. And he was so far from praising even his act of <lb/>
            diligence and fidelity, that he recorded in writing a <lb/>
            charge that Ursicinus had embezzled a part of the Gallic <lb/>
            treasures, which no one had ever touched. And he ordered <lb/>
            strict inquiry to be made into the fact, by an examination <lb/>
            of Remigius, who was at that time accountant-general to <lb/>
            Ursicinus in his capacity of commander of the heavy troops. <lb/>
            And long afterwards, in the time of Valentinian, this Remi- <lb/>
            gius hung himself on account of the trouble into which he <lb/>
            fell in the matter of his appointment as legate in Tripolis.</p>
          <p>37. And after this business was terminated, Constan- <lb/>
            tius, thinking his prosperity had now raised him to <lb/>
            an equality with the gods, and had bestowed on him <lb/>
            entire sovereignty over human affairs, gave himself up <lb/>
            to elation at the praises of his flatterers, whom he himself <lb/>
            encouraged, despising and trampling under foot all who <lb/>
            were unskilled in that kind of court. As we read that <lb/>
            Croesus, when he was king, drove Solon headlong from his <lb/>
            court because he would not fawn on him; and that Diony- <lb/>
            sius threatened the poet Philoxenus with death because, <lb/>
            when the king recited his absurd and unrhythmical verses, <lb/>
            he alone refused to fall into an ecstasy while all the rest of <lb/>
            the courtiers praised them.</p>
          <p>38. And this mischievous taste is the nurse of vices ; for <lb/>
            praise ought only to be acceptable in high places, where <lb/>
            blame also is permitted when things are not sufficiently <lb/>
            performed.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AND now, after the re-establishment of security, inves- <lb/>
            tigations as usual were set on foot, and many persons were <lb/>
            put in prison as guilty. For that infernal informer Paulus, <lb/>
            boiling over with delight, arose to exercise his poisonous <lb/>
            employment with increased freedom, and while the <lb/>
            members of the emperor's council and the military officers <lb/>
            were employed in the investigation of these affairs, as they <lb/>
            were commanded, Proculus was put to the torture, who <lb/>
            had been a servant of Silvan us, a man of weak body and <lb/>
            of ill health; so that every one was afraid lest the exceed- <pb n="65"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 355.] </note> <lb/>
            ing violence of his torture should prove too much for his <lb/>
            feeble limbs, so that he would expose numbers to be im- <lb/>
            plicated in the accusations of atrocious crimes. But the <lb/>
            result proved quite different to what had been expected.</p>
          <p>2. For remembering a dream in which he had been for- <lb/>
            bidden, while asleep, as he affirmed, to accuse any innocent <lb/>
            person, though he should be tortured till he was brought to <lb/>
            the very point of death, he neither informed against, nor <lb/>
            even named any one ; but, with reference to the usurpation <lb/>
            of Silvanus, he invariably asserted that he had been driven <lb/>
            to contemplate that act, not out of ambition, but from sheer <lb/>
            necessity; and he proved this assertion by evident argu- <lb/>
            ments.</p>
          <p>3. For he adduced one important excuse, which was <lb/>
            established by the testimony of many persons, that, five <lb/>
            days before he assumed the ensigns of imperial authority, <lb/>
            he addressed the soldiers, while distributing their pay to <lb/>
            them, in the name of Constantius, exhorting them to prove <lb/>
            always brave and loyal. From which it was plain that if <lb/>
            he had then been thinking of seizing on a loftier fortune, <lb/>
            he would have given them this money as if it had pro- <lb/>
            ceeded from himself.</p>
          <p>4. After Proculus, Pœmenius was condemned and put <lb/>
            to death ; he who, as we have mentioned before,. when the <lb/>
            Treveri had shut their gates against Cæsar Decentius, was <lb/>
            chosen to defend that people. After him, Asclepiodotus, <lb/>
            and Luto, and Maudio, all Counts, were put to death, and <lb/>
            many others also, the obdurate cruelty of the times seeking <lb/>
            for these and similar punishments with avidity.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the fatal disturbances of the state multi- <lb/>
            plied these general slaughters, Leontius, who was the <lb/>
            governor of Rome itself, gave many proofs of his deserv- <lb/>
            ing the character of an admirable judge; being prompt in <lb/>
            hearing cases, rigidly just in deciding them, and merciful <lb/>
            by nature, although, for the sake of maintaining lawful au- <lb/>
            thority, he appeared to some people to be severe. He was <lb/>
            also of a somewhat amorous temperament.</p>
          <p>2.. The first pretext for exciting any sedition against him <note type="footnote"> 1 In one of the lost books of this history. </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            was a most slight and trumpery one. For when an order <lb/>
            had been issued to arrest a charioteer, named Philoromus, <lb/>
            the whole populace followed him, as if resolved to defend <lb/>
            something of their own, and with terrible violence assailed <lb/>
            the prefect, presuming him to be timorous. But he re- <lb/>
            mained unmoved and upright, and sending his officers <lb/>
            among the crowd, arrested some and punished them, and <lb/>
            then, without any one venturing to oppose him, or even to <lb/>
            murmur, condemned them to banishment.</p>
          <p>3. A few days later the populace again became excited <lb/>
            to its customary frenzy, and alleging as a grievance the <lb/>
            scarcity of wine, assembled at the well-known place called <lb/>
            Septemzodium, where the Emperor Marcus built the <lb/>
            Nymphæum,1 an edifice of great magnificence. To that <lb/>
            place the prefect went forthwith, although he was earnestly <lb/>
            entreated by all his household and civil officers not to <lb/>
            trust himself among an arrogant and threatening multi- <lb/>
            tude, now in a state of fury equal to any of their former <lb/>
            commotions; but he, unsusceptible of fear, went right - <lb/>
            onwards, though many of his attendants deserted him, <lb/>
            when they saw him hastening into imminent danger.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, sitting in a carriage, with every appear- <lb/>
            ance of confidence, he looked with fierce eyes at the coun- <lb/>
            tenance of the tumultuous mobs thronging towards him <lb/>
            from all quarters, and agitating themselves like serpents. <lb/>
            And after suffering many bitter insults, at last, when he <lb/>
            had recognized one man who was conspicuous among all <lb/>
            the rest by his vast size and red hair, he asked him <lb/>
            whether his name was Petrus Valvomeres, as he had heard <lb/>
            it was; and when the man replied in a defiant tone that <lb/>
            it was so, Leontius, in spite of the outcries of many <lb/>
            around, ordered him to be seized as one who had long <lb/>
            since been a notorious ringleader of the disaffected, and <lb/>
            having his hands bound behind him, commanded him to <lb/>
            be suspended on a rack.</p>
          <p>5. And when he was seen in the air, in vain imploring <note type="footnote">1 The Nymphæum was a temple sacred to the Nymphs, deriving its <lb/>
            name of Septemzodium, or Septizonium (which it shared with more <lb/>
            than one other building at Rome), from the seven rows of pillars, one <lb/>
            above the other, and each row lessening both in circuit and in height, <lb/>
            with which the exterior was embellished. Another temple of this kind <lb/>

            the aid of his fellow-tribesmen, the whole mob, which <lb/>
            a little while before was so closely packed, dispersed at <lb/>
            once over the different quarters of the city, so as to offer <lb/>
            no hindrance to the punishment of this seditious leader, <lb/>
            who after having been thus tortured-with as little resist- <lb/>
            ance as if he had been in a secret dungeon of the court <lb/>
            -was transported to Picenum, where, on a subsequent <lb/>
            occasion, having offered violence to a virgin of high rank, <lb/>
            he was condemned to death by the judgment of Patruinus, <lb/>
            a noble of consular dignity.</p>
          <p>6. While Leontius governed the city in this manner, <lb/>
            Liberius, a priest of the Christian law, was ordered by <lb/>
            Constantius to be brought before the council, as one who <lb/>
            had resisted the commands of the emperor, and the decrees <lb/>
            of many of his own colleagues, in an affair which 1 will <lb/>
            explain briefly.</p>
          <p>7. Athanasius was at that time bishop of Alexandria; <lb/>
            and as he was a man who sought to magnify himself above <lb/>
            his profession, and to mix himself up with affairs which <lb/>
            did not belong to his province, as continual reports made <lb/>
            known, an assembly of many of his sect met together <lb/>
            —a synod, as they call it-and deprived him of the right of <lb/>
            administering the sacraments, which he previously enjoyed.</p>
          <p>8. For it was said that he, being very deeply skilled in <lb/>
            the arts of prophecy and the interpretation of auguries and <lb/>
            omens, had very often predicted coming events. And to <lb/>
            these charges were added others very inconsistent with <lb/>
            the laws of the religion over which he presided.</p>
          <p>9. So Liberius, being of the same opinion with those <lb/>
            who condemned these practices, was ordered, by the <lb/>
            sentence of the emperor, to expel Athanasius from his <lb/>
            priestly seat; but this he firmly refused to do, reiterat- <lb/>
            ing the assertion that it was the extremity of wicked- <lb/>
            ness to condemn a man who had neither been brought <lb/>
            before any court nor been heard in his defence, in this <lb/>
            openly resisting the commands of the emperor.</p>
          <p>10. For that prince, being always unfavourable to Atha- <lb/>
            nasius, although he knew that what he ordered had in <lb/>
            fact taken effect, yet was exceedingly desirous that it <lb/>
            should be confirmed by that authority which the bishops <lb/>
            of the Eternal City enjoy, as being of higher rank. And <lb/>
            as he did not succeed in this, Liberius was removed by <pb n="68"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XV. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            night; a measure which was not effected without great <lb/>
            difficulty, through the fear which his enemies had of the <lb/>
            people, among whom he was exceedingly popular.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VIlI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THESE events, then, took place at Rome, as I have <lb/>
            already mentioned. But Constantius was agitated by <lb/>
            frequent intelligence which assured him that the Gauls <lb/>
            were in a lamentable condition, since no adequate resist- <lb/>
            ance could be made to the barbarians who were now <lb/>
            carrying their devastations with fire and sword over the <lb/>
            whole country. And after deliberating a long time, in <lb/>
            great anxiety, what force he could employ to repel these <lb/>
            dangers (himself remaining in Italy, as he thought it very <lb/>
            dangerous to remove into so remote a country), he at last <lb/>
            determined on a wise plan, which was this: to associate <lb/>
            with himself in the cares of the empire his cousin Julian, <lb/>
            whom he had some time before summoned to court, and <lb/>
            who still retained the robe he had worn In the Greek <lb/>
            schools.</p>
          <p>2. And when, oppressed by the heavy weight of im- <lb/>
            pending calamities, he had confessed to his dearest friends <lb/>
            that by himself he was unequal to the burden of such <lb/>
            weighty and numerous difficulties—a thing which he had <lb/>
            never felt before—they, being trained to excessive flattery, <lb/>
            tried to fill him with foolish ideas, affirming that there <lb/>
            was nothing in the world so difficult but what his pre- <lb/>
            eminent virtue and his good fortune, equal to that of the <lb/>
            gods, would be able to overcome, as it always hitherto <lb/>
            had done. And many of them added further, being <lb/>
            stung by their consciousness of guilt, that henceforth he <lb/>
            ought to beware of conferring the title of Caesar on any <lb/>
            one, enumerating the deeds which had been done in the <lb/>
            time of Gallus.</p>
          <p>3. They therefore opposed his design resolutely, and it <lb/>
            was supported by no one but the queen, who, whether it <lb/>
            was that she feared a journey to a distant country, or that, <lb/>
            from her own natural wisdom, she saw the best course for <lb/>
            the common good, urged him that a relation like Julian <lb/>
            ought to be preferred to every one else. Accordingly, <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="margin"> ALD. 355.] </note> <lb/>
            after many undecided deliberations and long discussions, <lb/>
            his resolution was at last taken decidedly, and having <lb/>
            discarded all further vain debate, he resolved on asso <lb/>
            dating Julian with him in the empire.</p>
          <p>4. He was therefore summoned; and when he had ar- <lb/>
            rived, on a fixed day, the whole of his fellow-comrades who <lb/>
            were in the city were ordered to attend, and a tribunal <lb/>
            was erected on a lofty scaffolding, surrounded by the <lb/>
            eagles and standards. And Augustus, mounting it, and <lb/>
            holding Julian by the right hand, made this conciliatory <lb/>
            speech:-</p>
          <p>5. " We stand here before you, most excellent defenders <lb/>
            of the republic, to avenge with one unanimous spirit the <lb/>
            common dangers of the state. And how I propose to <lb/>
            provide for it I will briefly explain to you, as impartial <lb/>
            judges.</p>
          <p>6. “After the death of those rebellious tyrants whom <lb/>
            rage and madness prompted to engage in the enterprises <lb/>
            which they undertook, the barbarians, as if they meant <lb/>
            to sacrifice unto their wicked manes with Roman blood, <lb/>
            having violated the peace and invaded the territories of <lb/>
            the Gauls, are encouraged by this consideration, that our <lb/>
            empire, being spread over very remote countries, causes <lb/>
            us to be beset with great difficulties.</p>
          <p>7. “If, then, your decision and mine are mutual to en- <lb/>
            counter this evil, already progressing beyond the barriers <lb/>
            which were opposed to it, while there is still time to <lb/>
            check it, the necks of these haughty nations will learn to <lb/>
            humble their pride, and the borders of the empire will <lb/>
            remain inviolate. It remains for you to give, by your <lb/>
            strength, prosperous effect to the hopes which I entertain.</p>
          <p>8. “You all know my cousin Julian, whom I here present <lb/>
            to you; a youth endeared to us by his modesty as well as <lb/>
            by his relationship; a youth of virtue already proved, and <lb/>
            of conspicuous industry and energy. Him I have deter- <lb/>
            mined to raise to the rank of Cæsar, and hope, if this <lb/>
            seems expedient to you, to have my decision confirmed by <lb/>
            your consent."</p>
          <p>9. He was proceeding to say more, but was prevented <lb/>
            by the whole assembly interrupting him with friendly <lb/>
            shouts, declaring that his decision was the judgment of <lb/>
            the Supreme Deity, and not of any human mind; with <pb n="70"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XV. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            such certainty that one might have thought tnem inspired <lb/>
            with the spirit of prophecy.</p>
          <p>10. The emperor stood without moving till they re- <lb/>
            sumed silence, and then with greater confidence proceeded <lb/>
            to explain what he had to say further.</p>
          <p>" Because, therefore, your joyful acclamations show that <lb/>
            you look favourably on the design I have announced, let <lb/>
            this youth, of tranquil strength, whose temperate disposi- <lb/>
            tion it will be better to imitate than merely to praise, rise <lb/>
            up now to receive the honours prepared for him. His <lb/>
            excellent disposition, increased as it has been by all liberal <lb/>
            accomplishments, I will say no more of than is seen in <lb/>
            the fact that I have chosen him. Therefore, now, with <lb/>
            the manifest consent of the Deity, I will clothe him with <lb/>
            the imperial robe."</p>
          <p>11. This was his speech. And then, having immediately <lb/>
            clothed Julian with the purple robe of his ancestors, and <lb/>
            having pronounced him Caesar, to the great joy of the army, <unclear/> <lb/>
            he thus addressed him, though Julian himself appeared by <lb/>
            his grave countenance to be somewhat melancholy.</p>
          <p>12. "Most beloved of all my brothers, you thus in <lb/>
            early youth have received the splendid honour belonging <lb/>
            to your birth, not, I confess, without some addition to <lb/>
            my own glory ; who thus show myself as just in confer- <lb/>
            ring supreme power on a noble character nearly related <lb/>
            to me, as I appear also sublime by virtue of my own <lb/>
            power. Come thou, therefore, to be a partner in my <lb/>
            labours and dangers, and undertake the defence of the- <lb/>
            government of the Gauls, devoting thyself with all benefi- <lb/>
            cence to alleviate the calamities of those afflicted countries.</p>
          <p>13. "And if it should be necessary to engage with the <lb/>
            enemy in battle, do thou take thy place steadily among the <lb/>
            btandard-bearers themselves, as a prudent encourager of <lb/>
            daring at the proper opportunity ; exciting the warriors <lb/>
            by leading them on with caution, supporting any troops <lb/>
            which may be thrown into disorder by reserves, gently <lb/>
            reproving those who hang back, and being present as <lb/>
            a trustworthy witness of the actions of all, whether brave <lb/>
            or timid.</p>
          <p>14. " Think that a serious crisis is upon us, and so show <lb/>
            yourself a great man, worthy to command brave men. <lb/>
            We ourselves will stand by you in the energetic constancy <pb n="71"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 355.] </note> <lb/>
            of affection, or will join you in the labours of war, so that <lb/>
            we may govern together the whole world in peace, if <lb/>
            only God will grant us, as we pray he may, to govern <lb/>
            with equal moderation and piety. You will everywhere <lb/>
            represent me, and I also will never desert you in what- <lb/>
            ever task you may be engaged. To sum up: Go forth; <lb/>
            go forth supported by the friendly prayers of men of all <lb/>
            ranks, to defend with watchful care the station assigned <lb/>
            to you, it may be said, by the republic itself."</p>
          <p>15. After the emperor had thus ended his speech, no one <lb/>
            held his peace, but all the soldiers, with a tremendous <lb/>
            crash, rattled their shields against their knees (which is <lb/>
            an abundant indication of applause; while on the other <lb/>
            hand to strike the shield with the spear is a testimony of <lb/>
            anger and indignation), and it was marvellous with what <lb/>
            excessive joy they all, except a very few, showed their <lb/>
            approbation of the judgment of Augustus : and they re- <lb/>
            ceived the Cæsar with well-deserved admiration, brilliant <lb/>
            as he was with the splendour of the imperial purple.</p>
          <p>16. And while they gazed earnestly on his eyes, terrible <lb/>
            in their beauty, and his countenance more attractive than <lb/>
            ever by reason of his present excitement, they augured from <lb/>
            his looks what kind of ruler he was likely to prove, as if <lb/>
            they had been searching into those ancient volumes which <lb/>
            teach how to judge of a man's moral disposition by the <lb/>
            external signs on his person. And that he might be re- <lb/>
            garded with the greater reverence, they neither praised <lb/>
            him above measure, nor yet below his desert. And so the <lb/>
            voices raised in his favour were looked upon as the judg- <lb/>
            ment of censors, not of soldiers.</p>
          <p>17. After the ceremony was over, Julian was taken up <lb/>
            into the imperial chariot and received into the palace, and <lb/>
            was heard to whisper to himself this verse of Homer— <lb/>
            “Now purple death hath seized on me, <lb/>
            And powerful strength of destiny."</p>
          <p>These transactions took place on the sixth of November, <lb/>
            in the year of the consulship of Arbetio and Lollianus.</p>
          <p>18. A few days afterwards, Helen, the maiden sister of <lb/>
            Constantius, was also given in marriage to the Caesar. And <lb/>
            everything being got ready which the journey required, <lb/>
            he started on the first of December with a small retinue ; <pb n="72"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XV. CH. IX. </note> <lb/>
            and having been escorted on his way by Augustus himself <lb/>
            as far as the spot, marked by two pillars, which lies <lb/>
            between Laumellum and Ticinum, be proceeded straight <lb/>
            on to the country of the Taurini, where he received dis- <lb/>
            astrous intelligence, which had recently reached the em- <lb/>
            peror's court, but still had been intentionally kept back, lest <lb/>
            all the preparations made for his journey should be wasted.</p>
          <p>19. And this intelligence was that Colonia Agrippina,' <lb/>
            a city of great renown in lower Germany, had been <lb/>
            carried by a vigorous siege of the barbarians, who appeared <lb/>
            before it in great force, and bad utterly destroyed it.</p>
          <p>20. Julian being greatly distressed at this news, looking <lb/>
            on it as a kind of omen of misfortunes to come, was often <lb/>
            heard to murmur in querulous tones, " that he had gained <lb/>
            nothing except the fate of dying amid greater trouble and <lb/>
            employment than before."</p>
          <p>21. But when he arrived at Vienne, people of every age <lb/>
            and class went forth to meet him on his entrance to the <lb/>
            city, with a view to do him honour by their reception of him <lb/>
            as one who had been long wished for, and was now granted <lb/>
            to their prayers. And when he was seen in the distance <lb/>
            the whole population of the city and of the adjacent neigh- <lb/>
            bourhood, going before his chariot, celebrated his praises, <lb/>
            saluting him as Emperor, clement and prosperous, greet- <lb/>
            ing with eager joy this royal procession in honour of a <lb/>
            lawful prince. And they placed all their hopes of a <lb/>
            remedy for the evils which affected the whole province on <lb/>
            his arrival, thinking that now, when their affairs were in <lb/>
            a most desperate condition, some friendly genius had come <lb/>
            to shine upon them.</p>
          <p>22. And a blind old woman, when in reply to her ques- <lb/>
            tion " Who was entering the city ?" she received for <lb/>
            answer "Julian the Cæsar,” cried out that He would <lb/>
            restore the temples of the gods."</p>

          <p>§ 1. Now then, since, as the sublime poet of Mantua has <lb/>
            sung, " A greater series of incident rises to my view; in a <lb/>
            more arduous task I engage,”—I think it a proper.oppor- <note type="footnote"> , 1 Cologne. </note> <pb n="73"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 355.] </note> <lb/>
            tunity to describe the situation and different countries of <lb/>
            the Gauls, lest, among the narration of fiery preparations <lb/>
            and the various chances of battles, I should seem, while <lb/>
            speaking of matters not understood by every one, to <lb/>
            resemble those negligent sailors, who, when tossed about <lb/>
            by dangerous waves and storms, begin to repair their <lb/>
            sails and ropes which they might have attended to in calm <lb/>
            weather.</p>
          <p>2. Ancient writers, pursuing their investigations into <lb/>
            the earliest origin of the Gauls, left our knowledge of the <lb/>
            truth very imperfect; but at a later period, Timagenes, <lb/>
            a thorough Greek both in diligence and language, collected <lb/>
            from various writings facts which had been long unknown, <lb/>
            and guided by his faithful statements, we, dispelling all <lb/>
            obscurity, will now give a plain and intelligible relation <lb/>
            of them.</p>
          <p>3. Some persons affirm that the first inhabitants ever <lb/>
            seen in these legions were called Celts, after the name of <lb/>
            their king, who was very popular among them, and some- <lb/>
            times also Galatæ, after the name of his mother. For <lb/>
            Galatæ is the Greek translation of the Roman term Galli. <lb/>
            Others affirm that they are Dorians, who, following a more <lb/>
            ancient Hercules, selected for their home the districts <lb/>
            bordering on the ocean.</p>
          <p>4. The Druids affirm that a portion of the people was <lb/>
            really indigenous to the soil, but that other inhabitants <lb/>
            poured in from the islands on the coast, and from the dis- <lb/>
            tricts across the Rhine, having been driven from their <lb/>
            former abodes by frequent wars, and sometimes by inroads <lb/>
            of the tempestuous sea.</p>
          <p>5. Some again maintain that after the destruction of <lb/>
            Troy, a few Trojans fleeing from the Greeks, who were <lb/>
            then scattered over the whole world, occupied these dis- <lb/>
            tricts, which at that time had no inhabitants at all.</p>
          <p>6. But the natives of these countries affirm this more <lb/>
            positively than any other fact (and, indeed, we ourselves <lb/>
            have read it engraved on their monuments), that Hercules, <lb/>
            the son of Amphitryon, hastening to the destruction of <lb/>
            those cruel tyrants, Geryon and Tauriscus, one of whom <lb/>
            was oppressing the Gauls, and the other Spain, after he <lb/>
            had conquered both of them, took to wife some women of <lb/>
            noble birth in those countries, and became the father of <pb n="74"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XV. CH. X. </note> <lb/>
            many children; and that his sons called the districts of <lb/>
            which they became the kings after their own names.</p>
          <p>7. Also an Asiatic tribe coming from Phocæa in order to <lb/>
            escape the cruelty of Harpalus, the lieutenant of Cyrus the <lb/>
            king, sought to sail to Italy.' And a part of them founded <lb/>
            Velia, in Lucania, others settled a colony at Marseilles, in <lb/>
            the territory of Vienne; and then, in subsequent ages, <lb/>
            these towns increasing in strength and importance, founded <lb/>
            other cities. But we must avoid a variety of details which <lb/>
            are commonly apt to weary.</p>
          <p>8. Throughout these provinces, the people gradually <lb/>
            becoming civilized, the study of liberal accomplishments <lb/>
            flourished, having been first introduced by the Bards, the <lb/>
            Eubages,2 and the Druids. The Bards were accustomed to <lb/>
            employ themselves in celebrating the brave achievements <lb/>
            of their illustrious men, in epic verse, accompanied with <lb/>
            sweet airs on the lyre. The Eubages investigated the <lb/>
            system and sublime secrets of nature, and sought to explain <lb/>
            them to their followers. Between these two came the <lb/>
            Druids, men of loftier genius, bound in brotherhoods <lb/>
            according to the precepts and example of Pythagoras; and <lb/>
            their minds were elevated by investigations into secret <lb/>
            and sublime matters, and from the contempt which they <lb/>
            entertained for human affairs they pronounced the soul <lb/>
            immortal.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THIS country then of the Gauls was by reason of its <lb/>
            lofty mountain ranges perpetually covered with terrible <lb/>
            snows, almost unknown to the inhabitants of the rest of <lb/>
            the world, except where it borders on the ocean; vast <lb/>
            fortresses raised by nature, in the place of art, surrounding <lb/>
            it on all sides.</p>
          <p>2. On the southern side it is washed by the Etruscan <lb/>
            and Gallic sea: where it looks towards the north it is <lb/>
            separated from the tribes of the barbarians by the river <lb/>
            Rhine; where it is placed under the western star it is <lb/>
            bounded by the ocean, and the lofty chain of the Pyrenees; <note type="footnote">1 This story of the Phocæenses is told by Herodotus, i. 166, and <lb/>
            alluded to by Horace, Epod. xv. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Eubages. or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐατει̃ς</foreign>, as Strabo calls them, appear to have <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> A.D. 355.] </note> <lb/>
            where it has an eastern aspect it is bounded by the Cottian1 <lb/>
            Alps. In these mountains King Cottins. after the Gauls <lb/>
            had been subdued, lying by himself in their defiles, and <lb/>
            relying on the rugged and pathless character of the country; <lb/>
            long maintained his independence ; though afterwards he <lb/>
            abated his pride, and was admitted to the friendship of the <lb/>
            Emperor Octavianus. And subsequently he constructed <lb/>
            immense works to serve as a splendid gift to the emperor, <lb/>
            making roads over them, short, and convenient for <lb/>
            travellers, between other ancient passes of the Alps; on <lb/>
            which subject we will presently set forth what discoveries <lb/>
            have been made.</p>
          <p>3. In these Cottian Alps, which begin at the town of <lb/>
            Susa, one vast ridge rises up, scarcely passable by any one <lb/>
            without danger.</p>
          <p>4. For to travellers who reach it from the side of Gaul <lb/>
            it descends with a steepness almost precipitous, being <lb/>
            terrible to behold, in consequence of the bulk of its over- <lb/>
            hanging rocks. In the spring, when the ice is melting, <lb/>
            and the snow beginning to give way from the warm spring <lb/>
            breezes, if any one seeks to descend along the mountain, <lb/>
            men and beasts and wagons all fall together through the <lb/>
            fissures and clefts in the rocks, which yawn in every direc- <lb/>
            tion, though previously hidden by the frost. And the <lb/>
            only remedy ever, found to ward off entire destruction is to <lb/>
            have many vehicles bound together with enormous ropes, <lb/>
            with men or oxen hanging on behind, to hold them back <lb/>
            with great efforts; and so with a crouching step they get <lb/>
            down with some degree of safety. And this, as I have <lb/>
            said, is what happens in the spring.</p>
          <p>5. But in winter, the ground being covered over with a, <lb/>
            smooth crust of ice, and therefore slippery under foot, the <lb/>
            traveller is often plunged headlong; and the valleys, <lb/>
            which seem to open here and there into wide plains, which <lb/>
            are merely a covering of treacherous ice, sometimes <lb/>
            swallow up those who try to pass over them. On ac- <lb/>
            count of which danger those who are acquainted with <lb/>
            the country fix projecting wooden piles over the safest <lb/>
            spots, in order that a series of them may conduct the <note type="footnote">1 The Cottian Alps are Mont Genevre. It is unnecessary to point out <lb/>
            how Ammianus mistakes the true bearing of these frontiers of Gaul. </note> <pb n="76"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. X. </note> <lb/>
            traveller unhurt to his destination; though if these piles <lb/>
            get covered with snow and hidden, or thrown down by <lb/>
            melting torrents descending from the mountains, then it is <lb/>
            difficult for any one to pass, even if natives of the district <lb/>
            lead the way.</p>
          <p>6. But on the summit of this Italian mountain there is a <lb/>
            plain, seven miles in extent, reaching as far as the station <lb/>
            known by the name of Mars; and after that comes another <lb/>
            ridge, still more steep, and scarcely possible to be climbed, <lb/>
            which stretches on to the summit of Mons Matrona, named <lb/>
            so from an event which happened to a noble lady.</p>
          <p>7. From this point a path, steep indeed, but easily <lb/>
            passable, leads to the fortress of Virgantia.1 The sepulchre <lb/>
            of this petty prince whom we have spoken of as the maker <lb/>
            of these roads is at Susa, close to the walls; and his re- <lb/>
            mains are honoured with religious veneration for two <lb/>
            reasons: first of all, because he governed his people with <lb/>
            equitable moderation ; and secondly, because, by becoming <lb/>
            an ally of the Roman republic, he procured lasting tran- <lb/>
            quillity for his subjects.</p>
          <p>8. And although this road which I have been speaking <lb/>
            of runs through the centre of the district, and is shorter <lb/>
            and more frequented now than any other, yet other roads <lb/>
            also were made at much earlier periods, on different occa- <lb/>
            sions.</p>
          <p>9. The first of them, near the maritime alps, was made <lb/>
            by the Theban Hercules, when he was proceeding in a <lb/>
            leisurely manner to destroy Geryon and Tauriscus, as has <lb/>
            already been mentioned; and he it was who gave to these <lb/>
            alps the name of the Grecian Alps.' In the same way he <lb/>
            consecrated the citadel and port of Monæcus to keep alive <lb/>
            the recollection of his name for ever. And this was the <lb/>
            reason why, many ages afterwards, those alps were called <lb/>
            the Penine Alps.'</p>

            of Saguntum—celebrated for the distresses which they <lb/>
            endured, and for their loyalty to Rome, at the time when <lb/>
            they were besieged with great resolution by the Cartha- <lb/>
            ginians-led to the Spanish coast a fleet having on board a <lb/>
            numerous army. But after the city had been destroyed by <lb/>
            the valour of the Carthaginians, he, being unable to over- <lb/>
            take Hannibal, who had crossed the Rhone, and had <lb/>
            obtained three days' start of him in the march towards <lb/>
            Italy, crossed the sea, which at that point was not wide, <lb/>
            making a rapid voyage; and taking his station near Genoa, <lb/>
            a town of the Ligures, awaited his descent from the moun- <lb/>
            tains, so that, if chance should afford him an oppor- <lb/>
            tunity, he might attack him in the plain while still fatigued <lb/>
            with the ruggedness of the way by which he had come.</p>
          <p>11. But still, having regard to the interests of the <lb/>
            republic, he ordered Cnaeus Scipio, his brother, to go into <lb/>
            Spain, to prevent Hasdrubal from making a similar expedi- <lb/>
            tion from that country. But Hannibal, having received <lb/>
            information of their .design by some deserters, being also <lb/>
            a man of great shrewdness and readiness of resources, <lb/>
            obtained some guides from the Taurini who inhabited those <lb/>
            districts, and passing through the Tricastini and through <lb/>
            the district of the Vocontii, he thus reached the defiles of <lb/>
            the Tricorii.1 Then starting from this point, he made <lb/>
            another march over a line previously impassable. And <lb/>
            having cut through a rock of immense height, which he <lb/>
            melted by means of mighty fires, and pouring over it a <lb/>
            quantity of vinegar, he proceeded along, the Druentia, a <lb/>
            river full of danger from its eddies and currents, until he <lb/>
            reached the district of Etruria. This is enough to say of <lb/>
            the Alps; now let us return to our original subject.</p>

          <p>§ 1. IN former times, when these provinces were little <lb/>
            known, as being barbarous, they were considered to be <lb/>
            divided into three races:2 namely, the Celtæ, the same <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Livy's account of Hannibal's march, from which, wholly <lb/>
            erroneous as it is, this description seems to have been taken; not that <lb/>
            even Livy has made such a gross mistake about the Druentia, or <lb/>
            Durance, which falls into the Rhone. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cæsar’s account of his expedition begins with the statement that <lb/>
            “Gaul is divided into three provinces." </note> <pb n="78"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            who are also called Galli; the Aqnitani, and the Belgae : <lb/>
            all differing from each other in language, manners, and <lb/>
            laws.</p>
          <p>2. The Galli, who, as I have said, are the same as the <lb/>
            Celtæ, are divided from the Aquitani by the river Garonne, <lb/>
            which rises in the mountains of the Pyrenees; and after <lb/>
            passing through many towns, loses itself in the ocean.</p>
          <p>3. On the other side they are separated from the Belgians <lb/>
            by the Marne and the Seine, both rivers of considerable <lb/>
            size, which flowing through the tribe of the Lugdunenses, <lb/>
            after surrounding the stronghold of the Parisii named <lb/>
            Lutetia, so as to make an island of it, proceed onwards <lb/>
            together, and fall into the sea near the camp of Con- <lb/>
            stantius.</p>
          <p>4. Of all these people the Belgians are said by ancient <lb/>
            writers to be the most warlike, because, being more remote <lb/>
            from civilization, and not having been rendered effeminate <lb/>
            by foreign luxuries, they have been engaged in continual <lb/>
            wars with the Germans on the other side of the Rhine.</p>
          <p>5. For the Aquitanians, to whose shores, as being nearest <lb/>
            and also pacific, foreign merchandise is abundantly im- <lb/>
            ported, were easily brought under the dominion of the <lb/>
            Romans, because their character had become enervated.</p>
          <p>6. But from the time when the Gauls, after long and <lb/>
            repeated wars, submitted to the dictator Julius, all their <lb/>
            provinces were governed by Roman officers, the country <lb/>
            being divided into four portions; one of which was the <lb/>
            province of Narbonne ; containing the districts of Vienne <lb/>
            and Lyons: a second province comprehended all the <lb/>
            tribes of the Aquitanians; upper and lower Germany <lb/>
            formed a third jurisdiction, and the Belgians a fourth at <lb/>
            that period.</p>
          <p>7. But now the whole extent of the country is portioned <lb/>
            out into many provinces. The second ( or lower) Germany <lb/>
            is the first, if you begin on the western side, fortified by <lb/>
            Cologne and Tongres, both cities of great wealth and <lb/>
            importance.</p>
          <p>8. Next comes the first (or high) Germany, in which, <lb/>
            besides other municipal towns, there is Mayence, and <lb/>
            Worms, and Spiers, and Strasburg, a city celebrated for the <lb/>
            defeats sustained by the barbarians in its neighbourhood.</p>
          <p>9. After these the first Belgic province stretches as far <pb n="79"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 355.] </note> <lb/>
            as Metz and Treves, which city is the splendid abode of <lb/>
            the chief governor of the country.</p>
          <p>10. Next to that comes the second Belgic province, <lb/>
            where we find Amiens, a city of conspicuous magnificence, <lb/>
            and Chalons,' and Rheims.</p>
          <p>11. In the province of the Sequani, the finest cities <lb/>
            are Besançon and Basle. The first Lyonnese province <lb/>
            contains Lyons, Châlons,2 Sens, Bourges, and Autun, the <lb/>
            walls of which are very extensive and of great antiquity.</p>
          <p>12. In the second Lyonnese province are Tours, and <lb/>
            Rouen, Evreux, and Troyes. The Grecian and Penine <lb/>
            Alps have, besides other towns of less note, Avenche, a <lb/>
            city which indeed is now deserted, but which was formerly <lb/>
            one of no small importance, as even now is proved by its <lb/>
            half-ruinous edifices. These are the most important pro- <lb/>
            vinces, and most splendid cities of the Galli.</p>
          <p>13. In Aquitania, which looks towards the Pyrenees, <lb/>
            and that part of the ocean which belongs to the Spaniards, <lb/>
            the first province is Aquitanica, very rich in large and <lb/>
            populous cities; passing over others, I may mention as <lb/>
            pre-eminent, Bordeaux, Clermont, Saintes, and Poictiers.</p>
          <p>14. The province called the Nine Nations is enriched <lb/>
            by Ausch and Bazas. In the province of Narbonne, the <lb/>
            cities of Narbonne, Euses, and Toulouse are the principal <lb/>
            places of importance. The Viennese exults in the magni- <lb/>
            ficence of many cities, the chief of which are Vienne itself, <lb/>
            and Aries, and Valence ; to which may be added Marseilles, <lb/>
            by the alliance with and power of which we read that Rome <lb/>
            itself was more than once supported in monents of danger.</p>
          <p>15. And near to these cities is also Aix, Nice, Antibes, <lb/>
            and the islands of Hieres.</p>
          <p>16. And since we have come in the progress of our <lb/>
            work to this district, it would be inconsistent and absurd to <lb/>
            omit all mention of the Rhone, a river of the greatest <lb/>
            celebrity. The Rhone rises in the Penine Alps, from <lb/>
            sources of great abundance, and descending with headlong <lb/>
            impetuosity into the more champaign districts, it often <lb/>
            overruns its banks with its own waters, and then plunges <lb/>
            into a lake called Lake Leman, and though it passes <lb/>
            through it, yet it never mingles with any foreign waters, <lb/>
            but, rushing over the top of those which flow with less <note type="footnote">1 Châlons sur Marne. </note><note type="footnote">2 Châlons sur Saône. </note> <pb n="80"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            rapidity, in its search for an exit, it forces its own way by <lb/>
            the violence of its stream.</p>
          <p>17. And thus passing through that lake without any <lb/>
            damage, it runs through Savoy and the district of Francho <lb/>
            Comté; and, after a long course, it forms the boundary <lb/>
            between the Viennese on its left, and the Lyonnese on its <lb/>
            light. Then after many windings it receives the Sa6ne, <lb/>
            a river which rises in the first Germany, and this latter <lb/>
            river here merges its name in the Rhone. At this point is <lb/>
            the beginning of the Gauls. And from this spot the dis- <lb/>
            tances are measured not by miles but by leagues.</p>
          <p>18 From this point also, the Rhone, being now enriched <lb/>
            by other rivers, becomes navigable for large vessels, which <lb/>
            are often tossed about in it by gales of wind; and at last, <lb/>
            having finished the course which nature has marked out <lb/>
            for it, foaming on it joins the Gallic Sea in the wide gulf <lb/>
            which they call the Gulf of Lyons, about eighteen miles <lb/>
            from Aries. This is enough to say of the situation of the <lb/>
            province; I will now proceed to describe the appearance <lb/>
            and character of the inhabitants.</p>

          <p>§ 1. NEARLY all the Gauls are of a lofty stature, fair, and <lb/>
            of ruddy complexion; terrible from the sternness of their <lb/>
            eyes, very quarrelsome, and of great pride and insolence. <lb/>
            A whole troop of foreigners would not be able to with- <lb/>
            stand a single Gaul if he called his wife to his assistance, <lb/>
            who is usually very strong, and with blue eyes; es- <lb/>
            pecially when, swelling her neck, gnashing her teeth, <lb/>
            and brandishing her sallow arms of enormous size, she <lb/>
            begins to strike blows mingled with kicks, as if they were <lb/>
            so many missiles sent from the string of a catapult.</p>
          <p>2. The voices of the generality are formidable and <lb/>
            threatening, whether they are in good humour or angry : <lb/>
            they are all exceedingly careful of cleanliness and neatness, <lb/>
            nor in all the country, and most especially in Aquitania, <lb/>
            could any man or woman, however poor, be seen cither <lb/>
            dirty or ragged.</p>
          <p>3. The men of every age are equally inclined to war, <lb/>
            and the old man and the man in the prime of life answer <lb/>
            with equal zeal the call to arms, their bodies being <pb n="81"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 355.] </note> <lb/>
            hardened by their cold weather and by constant exercise <lb/>
            so that they are all inclined to despise dangers and terrors. <lb/>
            Nor has any one of this nation ever mutilated his thumb <lb/>
            from fear of the toils of war, as men have done in Italy, <lb/>
            whom in their district are called Murci.</p>
          <p>4. The nation is fond of wine, and of several kinds of <lb/>
            liquor which resemble wine. And many individuals of <lb/>
            the lower orders, whose senses have become impaired by <lb/>
            continual intoxication, which the apophthegm of Cato <lb/>
            defined to be a kind of voluntary madness, run about in <lb/>
            all directions at random so that there appears to be some <lb/>
            point in that saying which is found in Cicero's oration in <lb/>
            defence of Fonteius, “that henceforth the Gauls will drink <lb/>
            their wine less strong than formerly," because forsooth <lb/>
            they thought there was poison in it.</p>
          <p>5. These countries, and especially such parts of them <lb/>
            as border on Italy, fell gradually under the dominion <lb/>
            of the Romans without much trouble to their conquerors, <lb/>
            having been first attacked by Fulvius, afterwards weakened <lb/>
            in many trifling combats by Sextius, and at last entirely <lb/>
            subdued by Fabius Maximus; who gained an additional <lb/>
            surname from the complete accomplishment of this task, <lb/>
            after he had brought into subjection the fierce tribe of the <lb/>
            Allobroges.</p>
          <p>6. Cæsar finally subdued all the Gauls, except where <lb/>
            their country was absolutely inaccessible from its morasses, <lb/>
            as we learn from Sallust, after a war of ten years, in which <lb/>
            both nations suffered many disasters; and at last he united <lb/>
            them to us in eternal alliance by formal treaties. I have <lb/>
            digressed further than I had intended, but now I will <lb/>
            return to my original subject.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER Domitianus had perished by a cruel death, <lb/>
            Musonianus his successor governed the East with the <lb/>
            rank of praetorian prefect; a man celebrated for his <lb/>
            eloquence and thorough knowledge of both the Greek <lb/>
            and Latin languages; from which he reaped a loftier glory <lb/>
            than he expected.</p>
          <p>2. For when Constantine was desirous of obtaining a <note type="footnote"> O </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XV. CH. XIII. </note> <lb/>
            more accurate knowledge of the different sects in the <lb/>
            empire, the Manicheans and other similar bodies, and no <lb/>
            one could be found able sufficiently to explain them, <lb/>
            Musonianus was chosen for the task, having been recom- <lb/>
            mended as competent; and when he had discharged this <lb/>
            duty with skill, the emperor .gave him the name of Muso- <lb/>
            nianus, for he had been previously called Strategius. <lb/>
            After that he ran through many degrees of rank and <lb/>
            honour, and soon reached the dignity of prefect; being in <lb/>
            other matters also a man of wisdom, popular in the pro- <lb/>
            vinces, and of a mild and courteous disposition. But at <lb/>
            the same time, whenever he could find an opportunity, <lb/>
            especially in any controversies or lawsuits (which is most <lb/>
            shameful and wicked), he was greatly devoted to sordid <lb/>
            gain. Not to mention many other instances, this was es- <lb/>
            pecially exemplified in the investigations which were made <lb/>
            into the death of Theophilus, the governor of Syria, a man <lb/>
            of consular rank, who gave information against the Cæsar <lb/>
            Gallus, and who was torn to pieces in a tumult of the <lb/>
            people; for which several poor men were condemned, <lb/>
            who, it was clearly proved, were at a distance at the time <lb/>
            of the transaction, while certain rich men who were the <lb/>
            real authors of the crime were spared from all punish- <lb/>
            ment, except the confiscation of their property.</p>
          <p>3. In this he was equalled by Prosper, at that time <lb/>
            master of the horse in Gaul; a man of abject spirit and <lb/>
            great inactivity; and, as the comic poet has it, despising <lb/>
            the acts of secret robbing he plundered openly.1</p>
          <p>4. And, while these two officers were conniving to- <lb/>
            gether, and reciprocally helping each other to many means <lb/>
            of acquiring riches, the chiefs of the Persian nation who <lb/>
            lived nearest to the river, profiting by the fact that the <lb/>
            king was occupied in the most distant parts of his do- <lb/>
            minions, and that these commanders were occupied in <lb/>
            plundering the people placed under their authority, began <lb/>
            to harass our territories with predatory bands, making <lb/>
            audacious inroads, sometimes into Armenia, often also into <lb/>
            Mesopotamia. <note type="footnote"> 1 Ammianus refers to Plautus, Epidicus, Act. I., sc. i., line 10 :— <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. While the chain of destiny was bringing these events <lb/>
            to pass in the Roman world, Julian, being at Vienne, was <lb/>
            taken by the emperor, then in his own eighth consulship, <lb/>
            as a partner in that dignity; and, under the promptings of <lb/>
            his own innate energy, dreamt of nothing but the crash of <lb/>
            battles and the slaughter of the barbarians; preparing <lb/>
            without delay to re-establish the province, and to reunite <lb/>
            the fragments that had been broken from it, if only fortune <lb/>
            should be favourable to him.</p>
          <p>2. And because the great achievements which by his <lb/>
            valour and good fortune Julian performed in the Gauls, <lb/>
            surpass many of the most gallant exploits of the ancients, <lb/>
            I will relate them in order as they occurred, employing <lb/>
            all the resources of my talents, moderate as they are, in <lb/>
            the hope that they may suffice for the narrative.</p>
          <p>3. But what I am about to relate, though not embla- <lb/>
            zoned by craftily devised falsehood, and being simply a <lb/>
            plain statement of facts, supported by evident proofs, will <lb/>
            have all the effect of a studied panegyric.</p>
          <p>4. For it would seem that some principle of a more than <lb/>
            commonly virtuous life guided this young prince from his <pb n="84"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVI. CH. II. </note> <lb/>
            very cradle to his last breath. Increasing rapidly in every <lb/>
            desirable quality, he soon became so conspicuous both at <lb/>
            home and abroad, that in respect to his prudence he was <lb/>
            looked upon as a second Titus: in his glorious deeds of <lb/>
            war he was accounted equal to Trajan; in mercy he was <lb/>
            the prototype of Antoninus ; and in the pursuit and disco- <lb/>
            very of true and perfect wisdom, he resembled Marcus <lb/>
            Aurelius, in imitation of whom he formed all his actions <lb/>
            and character.</p>
          <p>5. And since, as we are taught by Cicero, that the lofti- <lb/>
            ness of great virtues delights us, as does that of high trees, <lb/>
            while we are not equally interested in the roots and <lb/>
            trunks; so, also, the first beginnings of his admirable dis- <lb/>
            position were kept concealed by many circumstances which <lb/>
            threw a cloud over them; though in fact they ought to be <lb/>
            preferred to many of his most marvellous actions of later <lb/>
            life, in that he, who in his early youth had been brought <lb/>
            up like Erectheus in the retirement sacred to Minerva, <lb/>
            nevertheless when he was drawn forth from the quiet <lb/>
            shades of the academy (and not from any military tent) <lb/>
            into the labours of war, subdued Germany, tranquillized <lb/>
            the districts of the frozen Rhine, routed the barbarian kings <lb/>
            breathing nothing but bloodshed and slaughter, and forced <lb/>
            them to submission.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THEREFORE while passing a toilsome winter in the city <lb/>
            aforesaid, he learnt, among the numerous reports which <lb/>
            were flying about, that the ancient city of Autun, the walls <lb/>
            of which, though of vast extent, were in a state of great <lb/>
            decay from age, was now besieged by the barbarians, who <lb/>
            had suddenly appeared before it in great force; and while <lb/>
            the garrison remained panic-stricken and inactive, the <lb/>
            town was defended by a body of veterans who were be- <lb/>
            having with great courage and vigilance; as it often <lb/>
            happens that extreme despair repulses dangers which <lb/>
            appear destructive of all hope or safety.</p>
          <p>2. Therefore, without relaxing his anxiety about other <lb/>
            matters, and putting aside all the adulation of the courtiers <lb/>
            with which they sought to divert his mind towards volup- <lb/>
            tuousness and luxury, he hastened his preparations, and <lb/>
            when everything was ready he set out, and on the 24th of <pb n="85"/>
            <note type="margin"> AD. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            June arrived at Autun; behaving like a veteran general <lb/>
            conspicuous alike for skill and prowess, and prepared to <lb/>
            fall upon the barbarians, who were straggling in every <lb/>
            direction over the country, the moment fortune afforded <lb/>
            him an opportunity.</p>
          <p>3. Therefore having deliberated on his plans, and con- <lb/>
            sulted those who were acquainted with the country as to <lb/>
            what would be the safest line of march for him to adopt, <lb/>
            after having received much information in favour of dif- <lb/>
            ferent routes, some recommending Arbois, others insisting <lb/>
            on it that the best way was by Saulieu and Cure.</p>
          <p>4. But as some persons affirmed that Silvanus, in com- <lb/>
            mand of a body of infantry, had, a short time before, made <lb/>
            his way with 8,000 men by a road shorter than either, but <lb/>
            dangerous as lying through many dark woods and defiles <lb/>
            suitable for ambuscades, Julian became exceedingly eager <lb/>
            to imitate the audacity of this brave man.</p>
          <p>5. And to prevent any delay, taking with him only his <lb/>
            cuirassiers and archers, who would not have been sufficient <lb/>
            to defend his person had he been attacked, he took the <lb/>
            same route as Silvanus; and so came to Auxerre.</p>
          <p>6. And there, having, according to his custom, devoted <lb/>
            a short time to rest, for the purpose of refreshing his men, <lb/>
            he proceeded onwards towards Troyes; and strengthened <lb/>
            his flanks that he might with the greater effect watch the <lb/>
            barbarians, who attacked him in numerous bodies, which he <lb/>
            avoided as well as he could, thinking them more numerous <lb/>
            than they really were. Presently, however, having occupied <lb/>
            some favourable ground, he descended upon one body of <lb/>
            them, and routed it, and took some prisoners whom their <lb/>
            own fears delivered to him; and then he allowed the rest, <lb/>
            who now devoted all their energies to flying with what <lb/>
            speed they could, to escape unattacked, as his men could <lb/>
            not pursue them by reason of the weight of their armour.</p>
          <p>7. This occurrence gave him more hope of being able <lb/>
            to resist any attack which they might make, and marching <lb/>
            forwards with this confidence, after many dangers he <lb/>
            reached Troyes so unexpectedly, that when he arrived at <lb/>
            the gates, the inhabitants for some time hesitated to give <lb/>
            him entrance into the city, so great was their fear of the <lb/>
            straggling multitudes of the barbarians.</p>
          <p>8. After a little delay, devoted to again refreshing his <lb/>
            weary troops, thinking that there was no time to waste -he <pb n="86"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVI. CH. III. </note> <lb/>
            proceeded to the city of Rheims, where he had ordered <lb/>
            his whole army, carrying-.... to assemble, and there to <lb/>
            await his presence. The army at Rheims was under the <lb/>
            command of Marcellus, the successor of Ursicinus ; and <lb/>
            Ursicinus himself was ordered to remain there till the <lb/>
            termination of the expedition.</p>
          <p>9. Again Julian took counsel, and after many opinions <lb/>
            of different purport had been delivered, it was determined <lb/>
            to attack the host of the Allemanni in the neighbourhood <lb/>
            of Dieuse ; and to that quarter the army now marched in <lb/>
            dense order, and with more than usual alacrity.</p>
          <p>10. And because the weather, being damp and misty, pre- <lb/>
            vented even what was near from being seen, the enemy, <lb/>
            availing themselves of their knowledge of the country, <lb/>
            came by an oblique road upon the Cæsar’s rear, and <lb/>
            attacked two legions while they were piling their arms; <lb/>
            and they would almost have destroyed them if the uproar <lb/>
            which suddenly arose had not brought the auxiliary troops <lb/>
            of the allies to their support.</p>
          <p>11. From this time forth Julian, thinking it impossible <lb/>
            to find any roads or any rivers free from ambuscades, <lb/>
            proceeded with consummate prudence and caution; qua- <lb/>
            lities which above all others in great generals usually bring <lb/>
            safety and success to armies.</p>
          <p>12. Hearing therefore that Strasburg, Bmmat, Saverne, <lb/>
            Spiers, Worms, and Mayence, were all in the hands of the <lb/>
            barbarians, who were established in their suburbs, for the <lb/>
            barbarians shunned fixing themselves in the towns them- <lb/>
            selves, looking upon them like graves surrounded with <lb/>
            nets, he first of all entered Brumat, and just as he reached <lb/>
            that place he was encountered by a body of Germans pre- <lb/>
            pared for battle.</p>
          <p>13. Having arranged his own army in the form of a <lb/>
            crescent, the engagement began, and the enemy were <lb/>
            speedily surrounded and utterly defeated. Some were <lb/>
            taken prisoners, others were slain in the heat of the <lb/>
            battle, the rest sought safety by rapid flight.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER this, meeting with no resistance, he determined <lb/>
            to proceed to recover Cologne, which had been destroyed <note type="footnote"> * The text is defective here, as it is wherever these marks occur. </note> <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            before his arrival in Gaul. In that district there is no city <lb/>
            or fortress to be seen except that near Confluentes; a <lb/>
            place so named because there the river Moselle becomes <lb/>
            mingled with the Rhine there is also the village of <lb/>
            Rheinmagen, and likewise a single tower near Cologne.</p>
          <p>2. After having taken possession of Cologne he did not <lb/>
            leave it till the Frank kings began, through fear of him, <lb/>
            to abate of their fury, when he contracted a peace with <lb/>
            them likely to be of future advantage to the republic. In <lb/>
            ,the mean time he put the whole city into a state of com- <lb/>
            plete defence.</p>
          <p>3. Then, auguring well from these first-fruits of victory, <lb/>
            he departed, passing through the district of Treves, with <lb/>
            the intention of wintering at Sens, which was a town very <lb/>
            suitable for that purpose. When bearing, so to say, the <lb/>
            weight of a world of wars upon his shoulders, he was <lb/>
            occupied by perplexities of various kinds, and among them <lb/>
            how to provide for establishing in places most exposed tc <lb/>
            danger the soldiers who had quitted their former posts; <lb/>
            how to defeat the enemies who had conspired together to <lb/>
            injure the Roman cause; and further, how to provide <lb/>
            supplies for the army while employed in so many different <lb/>
            quarters.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHILE he was anxiously revolving these things in his <lb/>
            mind, he was attacked by a numerous force of the enemy, <lb/>
            who had conceived a hope of being able to take the town. <lb/>
            And they were the more confident of success because, from <lb/>
            the information of deserters, they had learnt that he neither <lb/>
            had with him his Scutarii nor his Gentiles, both of which <lb/>
            bodies of troops had been distributed among the different <lb/>
            municipal towns in order that they might be the more <lb/>
            easily supplied with provisions.</p>
          <p>2. Therefore after the gates of the city had been barri- <lb/>
            caded, and the weakest portions of the walls carefully <lb/>
            strengthened, Julian was seen night and day on the <lb/>
            battlements and ramparts, attended by a band of armed <lb/>
            men, boiling over with anger and gnashing his teeth, <lb/>
            because, often as he wished to sally forth, he was pre- <note type="footnote">1 Coblenz. </note> <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVI. CH. V. </note> <lb/>
            vented from taking such a step by the scantiness of the <lb/>
            force which he had with him.</p>
          <p>3. At last, after thirty days, the barbarians retired <lb/>
            disappointed, murmuring that they had been so vain <lb/>
            and weak as to attempt the siege of such a city. It <lb/>
            deserves however to be remarked, as a most unworthy <lb/>
            circumstance, that when Julian was in great personal <lb/>
            danger, Marcellus, the master of the horse, who was posted <lb/>
            in the immediate neighbourhood, omitted to bring him any <lb/>
            assistance, though the danger of the city itself, even if the <lb/>
            prince had not been there, ought to have excited his en- <lb/>
            deavours to relieve it from the peril of a siege by so for- <lb/>
            midable an enemy.</p>
          <p>4. Being now delivered from this fear, Julian, ever <lb/>
            prudent and active, directed his anxious thoughts inces- <lb/>
            santly to the care of providing that, after their long <lb/>
            labours, his soldiers should have rest, which, however <lb/>
            brief, might be sufficient to recruit their strength. In <lb/>
            addition to the exhaustion consequent on their toils, they <lb/>
            were distressed by the deficiency of crops on the land, <lb/>
            which through the frequent devastations to which they <lb/>
            had been exposed afforded but little suitable for human food.</p>
          <p>5. But these difficulties he likewise surmounted by his <lb/>
            ever wakeful diligence, and a more confident hope of <lb/>
            future success opening itself to his mind, he rose with <lb/>
            higher spirits to accomplish his other designs.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. IN the first place (and this is a most difficult task <lb/>
            for every one), he imposed on himself a rigid temperance, <lb/>
            and maintained it as if he had been living under the <lb/>
            obligation of the sumptuary laws. These were originally <lb/>
            brought to Rome from the edicts of Lycurgus and the <lb/>
            tables of laws compiled by Solon, and were for a long <lb/>
            time strictly observed. When they had become some- <lb/>
            what obsolete, they were re-established by Sylla, who, <lb/>
            guided by the apophthegms of Democritus, agreed with <lb/>
            him that it is Fortune which spreads an ambitious table, <lb/>
            but that Virtue is content with a sparing one.</p>
          <p>2. And likewise Cato of Tusculum, who from his pure <lb/>
            and temperate way of life obtained the surname of the <pb n="89"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            Censor, said with profound wisdom on the same subject, <lb/>
            " When there is great care about food, there is very little <lb/>
            care about virtue."</p>
          <p>3. Lastly, though he was continually reading the little <lb/>
            treatise which Constantius, when sending him as his step- <lb/>
            son to prosecute his studies, had written for him with his <lb/>
            own hand, in which he made extravagant provision for the <lb/>
            dinner-expenses of the Cæsar, Julian now forbade phea- <lb/>
            sants, or sausages, or even sow's udder to be served up to <lb/>
            him, contenting himself with the cheap and ordinary food <lb/>
            of the common soldiers.</p>
          <p>4. Hereupon arose his custom of dividing his nights <lb/>
            into three portions, one of which he allotted to rest, one to <lb/>
            the affairs of the state, and one to the study of literature; <lb/>
            and we read that Alexander the Great had been accus- <lb/>
            tomed to do the same, though he practised the rule with <lb/>
            less self-reliance. For Alexander, having placed a brazen <lb/>
            shell on the ground beneath him, used to hold a silver <lb/>
            ball in his hand, which he kept stretched outside his bed, <lb/>
            so that when sleep pervading his whole body had relaxed <lb/>
            the rigour of his muscles, the rattling of the ball falling <lb/>
            might banish slumber from his eyes.</p>
          <p>5. But Julian, without any instrument, awoke whenever <lb/>
            he pleased; and always rising when the night was but half <lb/>
            spent, and that not from a bed of feathers, or silken cover- <lb/>
            lets shining with varied brilliancy, but from a rough <lb/>
            blanket or rug, would secretly offer his supplications to <lb/>
            Mercury, who, as the theological lessons which he had re- <lb/>
            ceived had taught him, was the swift intelligence of the <lb/>
            world, exciting the different emotions of the mind. And <lb/>
            thus removed from all external circumstances calculated to <lb/>
            distract his attention, he gave his whole attention to the <lb/>
            affairs of the republic.</p>
          <p>6. Then, after having ended this arduous and important <lb/>
            business, he turned and applied himself to the cultivation <lb/>
            of his intellect. And it was marvellous with what exces- <lb/>
            sive ardour he investigated and attained to the sublime <lb/>
            knowledge of the loftiest matters, and how, seeking as it <lb/>
            were some food for his mind which might give it strength <lb/>
            to climb up to the sublimest truths, he ran through <lb/>
            every branch of philosophy in profound and subtle discus- <lb/>
            sions. <pb n="90"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVL CH. V. </note> </p>
          <p>7. Nevertheless, while engaged in amassing knowledge <lb/>
            of this kind in all its fullness and power, he did not <lb/>
            despise the humbler accomplishments. He was tolerably <lb/>
            fond of poetry and rhetoric, as is shown by the invari- <lb/>
            able and pure elegance, mingled with dignity, of all his <lb/>
            speeches and letters. And he likewise studied the varied <lb/>
            history of our own state and of foreign countries. To all <lb/>
            these accomplishments was added a very tolerable degree <lb/>
            of eloquence in the Latin language.</p>
          <p>8. Therefore, if it be true, as many writers affirm, that <lb/>
            Cyrus the king, and Simonides the lyric poet, and Hippias <lb/>
            of Elis, the most <unclear>aculo</unclear> of the Sophists, excelled as they did <lb/>
            in memory because they had obtained that faculty through <lb/>
            drinking a particular medicine, we must also believe that <lb/>
            Julian in his early manhood had drunk the whole cask <lb/>
            of memory, if such a thing could ever be found. And these <lb/>
            are the nocturnal signs of his chastity and virtue.</p>
          <p>9. But as for the manner in which he passed his days, <lb/>
            whether in conversing with eloquence and wit, or in <lb/>
            making preparations for war, or in actual conflict of battle, <lb/>
            or in his administration of affairs of the state, correct- <lb/>
            ing all defects with magnanimity and liberality, these <lb/>
            things shall all be set forth in their proper place.</p>
          <p>10. When he was compelled, as being a prince, to apply <lb/>
            himself to the study of military discipline, having been <lb/>
            previously confined to lessons of philosophy, and when he <lb/>
            was learning the art of marching in time while the pipes <lb/>
            were playing the Pyrrhic air, he often, calling upon the <lb/>
            name of Plato, ironically quoted that old proverb, " A pack- <lb/>
            saddle is placed on an ox; this is clearly a burden which <lb/>
            does not belong to me."</p>
          <p>11. On one occasion, when some secretaries were intro- <lb/>
            duced into the council-chamber, with solemn ceremony, to <lb/>
            receive some gold, one of their company did not, as is the <lb/>
            usual custom, open his robe to receive it, but took it in the <lb/>
            hollow of both his hands joined together; on which Julian <lb/>
            said, secretaries only know how to seize things, not how to <lb/>
            accept them.</p>
          <p>12. Having been approached by the parents of a virgin <lb/>
            who had been ravished, seeking for justice, he gave sen- <lb/>
            tence that the ravisher, on conviction, should be banished; <lb/>
            and when the parents complained of this sentence as un- <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            equal to the crime, because the criminal had not been <lb/>
            condemned to death, he replied, " Let the laws blame my <lb/>
            clemency; but it is fitting that an emperor of a most <lb/>
            merciful disposition should be superior to all other laws."</p>
          <p>13. Once when he was about to set forth on an expedi- <lb/>
            tion, he was interrupted by several people complaining of <lb/>
            injuries which they had received, whom he referred for <lb/>
            a hearing to the governors of their respective provinces. <lb/>
            And after he had returned, he inquired what had been <lb/>
            done in each case, and with genuine clemency mitigated <lb/>
            the punishments which had been assigned to the offences.</p>
          <p>14. Last of all, without here making any mention of the <lb/>
            victories in which he repeatedly defeated the barbarians, <lb/>
            and the vigilance with which he protected his army from <lb/>
            all harm, the benefits which he conferred on the Galli, pre- <lb/>
            viously exhausted by extreme want, are most especially <lb/>
            evident from this fact, that when he first entered the <lb/>
            country he found that four-and-twenty pieces of gold were <lb/>
            exacted, under the name of tribute, in the way of poll-tax, <lb/>
            from each individual. But when he quitted the country <lb/>
            seven pieces only were required, which made up all the <lb/>
            payments due from them to the state. On which account <lb/>
            they rejoiced with festivals and dances, looking upon him <lb/>
            as a serene sun which had shone upon them after melan- <lb/>
            choly darkness.</p>
          <p>15. Moreover we know that up to the very end of his <lb/>
            reign and of his life, he carefully and with great benefit <lb/>
            observed this rule, not to remit the arrears of tribute by <lb/>
            edicts which they call indulgences. For he knew that by <lb/>
            such conduct he should be giving something to the rich, <lb/>
            whilst it is notorious everywhere that, the moment that <lb/>
            taxes are imposed, the poor are compelled to pay them all <lb/>
            at once without any relief.</p>
          <p>16. But while he was thus regulating and governing the <lb/>
            country in a manner deserving the imitation of all virtuous <lb/>
            princes, the rage of the barbarians again broke out more <lb/>
            violently than ever.</p>
          <p>17. And as wild beasts, which, owing to the carelessness <lb/>
            of the shepherds, have been wont to plunder their flocks, <lb/>
            even when these careless keepers are exchanged for more <lb/>
            watchful ones, still cling to their habit, and being furious <lb/>
            with hunger, will, without any regard for their own safety, <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVL CH. VII </note> <lb/>
            again attack the flocks and herds; so also the barbarians, <lb/>
            having consumed all their plunder, continued, under the <lb/>
            pressure of hunger, repeatedly to make inroads for the <lb/>
            sake of booty, though sometimes they died of want before <lb/>
            they could obtain any.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. These were the events which took place in Gaul <lb/>
            during this year; at first of doubtful issue, but in the end <lb/>
            successful. Meanwhile in the emperor's court envy con- <lb/>
            stantly assailed Arbetio, accusing him of having already <lb/>
            assumed the ensigns of imperial rank, as if designing soon. <lb/>
            to attain the supreme dignity itself. And especially was <lb/>
            he attacked by a count named Verissimus, who with great <lb/>
            vehemence brought forth terrible charges against him, <lb/>
            openly alleging that although he had been raised from <lb/>
            the rank of a. common soldier to high military office, he <lb/>
            was not contented, thinking little of what he had obtained, <lb/>
            and aiming at the highest place.</p>
          <p>2. And he was also vigorously attacked by a man named <lb/>
            Dorus, who had formerly been surgeon of the Scutarii, and <lb/>
            of whom we have spoken, when promoted in the time of <lb/>
            Magnentius to be inspector of the works of art at Rome, as <lb/>
            having brought accusations against Adelphius, the prefect <lb/>
            of the city, as forming ambitious designs.</p>
          <p>3. And when the matter was brought forward for judi- <lb/>
            cial inquiry, and all preliminary arrangements were made, <lb/>
            proof of the accusations which had been confidently looked <lb/>
            for was still delayed; when suddenly, as if the business <lb/>
            had been meant as a satire on the administration of justice, <lb/>
            through the interposition of the chamberlains, as rumour <lb/>
            affirmed, the persons who had been imprisoned as accom- <lb/>
            plices were released from their confinement: Dorus disap- <lb/>
            peared, and Verissimus kept silence for the future, as if the <lb/>
            curtain had dropped and the scene bad been suddenly <lb/>
            ' changed.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. ABOUT the same time, Constantius having learnt, from <lb/>
            common report, that Marcellus had omitted to carry assist- <lb/>
            ance to the Cæsar when he was besieged at Sens, cashiered <lb/>
            him, and ordered him to retire to his own house. And he, <pb n="93"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            as if he had received a great injury, began to plot against <lb/>
            Julian, relying upon the disposition of the emperor to open <lb/>
            his ears to every accusation.</p>
          <p>2. Therefore, when he departed, Eutherius, the chief <lb/>
            chamberlain, was immediately sent after him, that he might <lb/>
            convict him before the emperor if he propagated any false- <lb/>
            hoods. But Marcellus, unaware of this, as soon as he <lb/>
            arrived at Milan, began talking loudly, and seeking to <lb/>
            create alarm, like a vain chatterer half mad as he was. <lb/>
            And when he was admitted into the council-chamber, he <lb/>
            began to accuse Julian of being insolent, and of preparing <lb/>
            for himself stronger wings in order to soar to a greater <lb/>
            height. For this was his expression, agitating his body <lb/>
            violently as he uttered it.</p>
          <p>3. While he was thus uttering his imaginary charges with <lb/>
            great freedom, Eutherius being, at his own request, intro- <lb/>
            duced into the presence, and being commanded to say what <lb/>
            he wished, speaking with great respect and moderation <lb/>
            showed the emperor that the truth was being overlaid with <lb/>
            falsehood. For that, while the commander of the heavy- <lb/>
            armed troops had, as it was believed, held back on purpose, <lb/>
            the Cæsar having been long besieged at Sens, had by his <lb/>
            vigilance and energy repelled the barbarians. And he <lb/>
            pledged his own life that the Cæsar would, as long as he <lb/>
            lived, be faithful to the author of his greatness.</p>
          <p>4. The opportunity reminds me here to mention a few <lb/>
            facts concerning this same Eutherius, which perhaps will <lb/>
            hardly be believed; because if Numa Pompilius or Socrates <lb/>
            were to say anything good of a eunuch, and were to con- <lb/>
            firm what they said by an oath, they would be accused of <lb/>
            having departed from the truth. But roses grow up among <lb/>
            thorns, and among wild beasts some are of gentle disposi- <lb/>
            tion. And therefore I will briefly mention a few of his <lb/>
            most important acts which are well ascertained.</p>
          <p>5. He was born in Armenia, of a respectable family, and <lb/>
            having while a very little child been taken prisoner by the <lb/>
            enemies on the border, he was castrated and sold to some <lb/>
            Roman merchants, and by them conducted to the palace of <lb/>
            Constantine, where, while growing up to manhood, he <lb/>
            began to display good principles and good talents, becom- <lb/>
            ing accomplished in literature to a degree quite sufficient <lb/>
            for his fortune, displaying extraordinary acuteness in dis- <pb n="94"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVI. CH. VII. </note> <lb/>
            covering matters of a doubtful and difficult complexion; <lb/>
            being remarkable also for a marvellous memory, always <lb/>
            eager to do good, and full of wise and honest counsel. A <lb/>
            man, in short, who, if the Emperor Constantius had listened <lb/>
            to his advice, which, whether he gave it in youth or man- <lb/>
            hood, was always honourable and upright, would have <lb/>
            been prevented from committing any errors, or at least any <lb/>
            that were not pardonable.</p>
          <p>6. When he became high chamberlain he sometimes <lb/>
            also found fault even with Julian, who, as being tainted <lb/>
            with Asiatic manners, was apt to be capricious. Finally, <lb/>
            when he quitted office for private life, and again when he <lb/>
            was recalled to court, he was always sober and consistent, <lb/>
            cultivating those excellent virtues of good faith and con- <lb/>
            stancy to such a degree that he never betrayed any secret, <lb/>
            except for the purpose of securing another's safety; nor <lb/>
            was he ever accused of covetous or grasping conduct, as <lb/>
            the other courtiers were.</p>
          <p>7. From which it arose that, when at a late period he <lb/>
            retired to Rome, and fixed there the abode of his old age, <lb/>
            bearing with him the company of a good conscience, he <lb/>
            was loved and respected by men of all ranks, though men <lb/>
            of that class generally, after having amassed riches by <lb/>
            iniquity, love to seek secret places of retirement, just as <lb/>
            owls or moths, and avoid the sight of the multitude whom <lb/>
            they have injured.</p>
          <p>8. Though I have often ransacked the accounts of anti- <lb/>
            quity, I do not find any ancient eunuch to whom I can <lb/>
            compare him. There were indeed among the ancients <lb/>
            some, though very few, faithful and economical, but still <lb/>
            they were stained by some vice or other; and among the <lb/>
            chief faults which they had either by nature or habit, they <lb/>
            were apt to be either rapacious or else boorish, and on that <lb/>
            account contemptible ; or else ill-natured and mischievous; <lb/>
            or fawning too much on the powerful; or too elated with <lb/>
            power, and therefore arrogant. But of any one so univer- <lb/>
            sally accomplished and prudent, I confess I have neither <lb/>
            ever read nor heard, relying for the truth of this judgment <lb/>
            on the general testimony of the age.</p>
          <p>9. But if any careful reader of ancient histories should <lb/>
            oppose to us Menophilus, the eunuch of King Mithridates, <lb/>
            I would warn him to recollect that nothing is really known <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            of him except this single fact, that he behaved gloriously <lb/>
            in a moment of extreme danger.</p>
          <p>10. When the king above mentioned, having been <lb/>
            defeated by the Romans under the command of Pompey, <lb/>
            and fleeing to his kingdom of Colchis, left a grown-up <lb/>
            daughter, named Drypetina, who at the time was danger- <lb/>
            ously ill, in the castle of Synhorium, under the care of this <lb/>
            Menophilus, he completely cured the maiden by a variety <lb/>
            of remedies, and preserved her in safety for her father; and <lb/>
            when the fortress in which they were enclosed began to be <lb/>
            besieged by Manlius Priscus, the lieutenant of the general, <lb/>
            and when he became aware that the garrison were pro- <lb/>
            posing to surrender, he, fearing that, to the dishonour of <lb/>
            her father, this noble damsel might be made a prisoner and <lb/>
            be ravished, slew her, and then fell upon his sword himself. <lb/>
            Now I will return to the point from which I digressed.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. AFTER Marcellus had been foiled, as I have men- <lb/>
            tioned, and had returned to Serdica, which was his native <lb/>
            place, many great crimes were perpetrated in the camp of <lb/>
            Augustus, under pretence of upholding the majesty of the <lb/>
            emperor.</p>
          <p>2. For if any one had consulted any cunning soothsayer <lb/>
            about the squeak of a mouse, or the appearance of a weasel, <lb/>
            or any other similar portent, or had used any old woman's <lb/>
            chants to assuage any pain-a practice which the autho- <lb/>
            rity of medicine does not always prohibit-such a man was <lb/>
            at once informed against, without being able to conceive <lb/>
            by whom, and was brought before a court of law, and at <lb/>
            once condemned to death.</p>
          <p>3. About the same time an individual named Dame! <lb/>
            was accused by his wife of certain trifling acts, of which, <lb/>
            whether he was innocent or not is uncertain; but Rufinus <lb/>
            was his enemy, who, as we have mentioned, had given in- <lb/>
            formation of some matters which had been communicated <lb/>
            to him by Gaudentius, the emperor's secretary, causing <lb/>
            Africanus, then governing Pannonia with the rank of a <lb/>
            consul, to be put to death, with all his friends. This <lb/>
            Rufinus was now, for his devotion to the interests of the <lb/>
            emperor, the chief commander of the praetorian guard. <pb n="96"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [Bx. XVI. CH VIII </note> 4. He, being given to talking in a boastful manner, <lb/>
            after having seduced that easily deluded woman (the wife <lb/>
            of Dames) into an illicit connection with him, allured her <lb/>
            into a perilous fraud, and persuaded her by an accumu- <lb/>
            lation of lies to accuse her innocent husband of treason, <lb/>
            and to invent a story that he had stolen a purple garment <lb/>
            from the sepulchre of Diocletian, and, by the help of <lb/>
            some accomplices, still kept it concealed.</p>
          <p>5. When this story had been thus devised in a way to <lb/>
            cause the destruction of many persons, Rufinus himself, <lb/>
            full of hopes of some advantage, hastened to the camp of <lb/>
            the emperor, to spread his customary calumnies. And <lb/>
            when the transaction had been divulged, Manlius, at that <lb/>
            time the commander of the praetorian camp, a man of ad- <lb/>
            mirable integrity, received orders to make a strict inquiry <lb/>
            into the charge, having united to him, as a colleague in the <lb/>
            examination, Ursulus, the chief paymaster, a man likewise <lb/>
            of praiseworthy equity and strictness.</p>
          <p>6. There, after the matter had been rigorously inves- <lb/>
            tigated according to the fashion of that period, and when, <lb/>
            after many persons had been put to the torture, nothing <lb/>
            was found out, and the judges were in doubt and per- <lb/>
            plexity ; at length truth, long suppressed, found a respite, <lb/>
            and, under the compulsion of a rigorous examination, <lb/>
            the woman confessed that Rufinus was the author of <lb/>
            the whole plot, nor did she even conceal the fact of her <lb/>
            adultery with him. Reference was immediately made to <lb/>
            the law, and as order and justice required, the judges con- <lb/>
            demned them both to death.</p>
          <p>7. But as soon as this was known, Constantius became <lb/>
            greatly enraged, and lamenting Rufinus as if the champion <lb/>
            of his safety had been destroyed, he sent couriers on <lb/>
            horseback express, with threatening orders to Ursulus, <lb/>
            commanding him to return to court. Ursulus, disregard- <lb/>
            ing the remonstrances of those who advised him to dis- <lb/>
            obey, hastened fearlessly to the presence; and having <lb/>
            entered the emperor's council-chambers, with undaunted <lb/>
            heart and voice related the whole transaction; and this <lb/>
            confident behaviour of his shut the mouths of the flatterers, <lb/>
            and delivered both the prefect and himself from serious <lb/>
            danger.</p>
          <p>8. It was at this time also that an event took place in Aqui- <pb n="97"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            tania which was more extensively talked about. A certain <lb/>
            cunning person being invited to a splendid and sumptuous <lb/>
            banquet, which are frequent in that province, having seen <lb/>
            a pair of coverlets, with two purple borders of such width, <lb/>
            that by the skill of those who waited they seemed to be <lb/>
            but one; and beholding the table also covered with a <lb/>
            similar cloth, he took up one in each hand, and arranged <lb/>
            them so as to resemble the front of a cloak, representing them <lb/>
            as having formed the ornament of the imperial robe ; and <lb/>
            then searching over the whole house in order to find the <lb/>
            robe which he affirmed must be hidden there, he thus <lb/>
            caused the ruin of a wealthy estate.</p>
          <p>9. With similar malignity, a certain secretary in Spain, <lb/>
            who was likewise invited to a supper, hearing the servants, <lb/>
            while bringing in the evening candles, cry " let us con- <lb/>
            quer," affixing a malignant interpretation to that common <lb/>
            exclamation,- in like manner ruined a noble family.</p>
          <p>10. These and other evils increasing more and more, <lb/>
            because Constantius, being a man of a very timorous dis- <lb/>
            position, was always thinking that blows were being aimed <lb/>
            at him, like the celebrated tyrant of Sicily, Dionysius, <lb/>
            who, because of this vice of his, taught his daughters to <lb/>
            shave him, in order that he might not have to put his face <lb/>
            in a stranger's power; and surrounded the small chamber <lb/>
            in which he was accustomed to sleep with a deep ditch, <lb/>
            so placed that it could only be entered by a drawbridge ; <lb/>
            the loose beams and axles of which when he went to bed <lb/>
            he removed into his own chamber, replacing them when <lb/>
            about to go forth at daybreak.</p>
          <p>11. Moreover, those who had influence in the court pro- <lb/>
            moted the spread of these evils, with the hope of joining <lb/>
            to their own estates the forfeited possessions of those who <lb/>
            should be condemned; and thus becoming rich by the ruin <lb/>
            of their neighbours.</p>
          <p>12. For, as clear evidence has shown, if Constantine <lb/>
            was the first to excite the appetites of his followers, Con- <lb/>
            stantius was the prince who fattened them on the marrow <lb/>
            of the provinces.</p>
          <p>13. For under him the principal persons of every rank <lb/>
            burnt with an insatiable desire of riches, without any <lb/>
            regard for justice or right. And among the ordinary <lb/>
            judges, Rufinus, the chief prefect of the prætorium, was <note type="footnote">H </note> <pb n="98"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XTI. CH. IX. </note> <lb/>
            conspicuous for this avarice. And among the military <lb/>
            officers Arbetio, the master of the horse, and Eusebius, <lb/>
            the high chamberlain, ... Ard ... anus, the <lb/>
            quæstor, and in the city, the two Anicii, whose posterity, <lb/>
            treading in the steps of their fathers, could not be satisfied <lb/>
            even with possessions much larger than they themselves <lb/>
            had enjoyed.</p>

          <p>§ 1. BUT in the East, the Persians now practising pre- <lb/>
            datory inroads and forays, in preference to engaging in <lb/>
            pitched battles, as they had been wont to do before, carried <lb/>
            off continually great numbers of men and cattle : some- <lb/>
            times making great booty, owing to the unexpectedness of <lb/>
            their incursions, but at other times being overpowered by <lb/>
            superior numbers, they suffered losses. Sometimes, also, <lb/>
            the inhabitants of the districts which they had invaded had <lb/>
            removed everything which could be carried off.</p>
          <p>2. But Musonianus, the prefect of the prætorium, a man, <lb/>
            as we have already said, of many liberal accomplishments <lb/>
            but corrupt, and a person easily turned from the truth by <lb/>
            a bribe, acquired, by means of some emissaries who were <lb/>
            skilful in deceiving and obtaining information, a know- <lb/>
            ledge of the plans of the Persians; taking to his counsels <lb/>
            on this subject Cassianus, duke of Mesopotamia, a veteran <lb/>
            who had served many campaigns, and had become hard- <lb/>
            ened by all kinds of dangers.</p>
          <p>3. And when, by the concurrent report of spies, these <lb/>
            officers had become certain that Sapor was occupied in the <lb/>
            most remote frontier of his kingdom in repelling the hos- <lb/>
            tilities of the bordering tribes, which he could not accom- <lb/>
            plish without great difficulty and bloodshed, they sought <lb/>
            to tamper with Tamsapor, the general in command in the <lb/>
            district nearest our border. Accordingly they sent soldiers <lb/>
            of no renown to confer with him secretly, to engage him, if <lb/>
            opportunity served, to write to the king to persuade him to <lb/>
            make peace with the Roman emperor; whereby he, being <lb/>
            then secure on every side, might be the better able to <lb/>
            subdue the rebels who were never weary of exciting dis- <lb/>
            turbances.</p>
          <p>4. Tamsapor coincided with these wishes, and, trust- <lb/>
            ing to them, reported to the king that Constantius, <pb n="99"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            being involved in very formidable wars, was a suppliant <lb/>
            for peace. But it took a long time for these letters to <lb/>
            reach the country of the Chionites and the Euseni, on <lb/>
            whose borders Sapor had taken up his winter quarters.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE matters were thus proceeding in the eastern <lb/>
            regions and in the Gauls, Constantius, as if the temple of <lb/>
            Janus were now shut and hostilities everywhere at an end, <lb/>
            became desirous of visiting Rome, with the intention of <lb/>
            celebrating his triumph over Magnentius, to which he <lb/>
            could give no name, since the blood that he had spilt was <lb/>
            that of Roman foes.</p>
          <p>2. For indeed, neither by his own exertions, nor by <lb/>
            those of his generals did he ever conquer any nation that <lb/>
            made war upon him; nor did he make any additions to <lb/>
            the empire; nor at critical moments was he ever seen to <lb/>
            be the foremost or even among the foremost; but still he <lb/>
            was eager to exhibit to the people, now in the enjoyment <lb/>
            of peace, a vast procession, and standards heavy with gold, <lb/>
            and a splendid train of guards and followers, though the <lb/>
            citizens themselves neither expected nor desired any such <lb/>
            spectacle.</p>
          <p>3. He was ignorant, probably, that some of the ancient <lb/>
            emperors were, in time of peace, contented with their <lb/>
            lictors, and that when the ardour of war forbade all in- <lb/>
            activity, one,' in a violent storm, had trusted himself to a <lb/>
            fisherman's boat; another,2 following the example of the <lb/>
            Decii, had sacrificed his life for the safety of the republic ; <lb/>
            another8 had by himself, accompanied by only a few <lb/>
            soldiers of the lowest rank, gone as a spy into the camp of <lb/>
            the enemy: in short, that many of them had rendered <lb/>
            themselves illustrious by splendid exploits, in order to <lb/>
            hand down to posterity a glorious memory of themselves, <lb/>
            earned by their achievements. <note type="footnote"> 1 Julius Cæsar : the story of the frightened fisherman being en- <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XVI. CH. X. </note> 4. Accordingly, after long and sumptuous preparation, <lb/>
            ... in the second prefecture of Orfitus, Constantius, <lb/>
            elated with his great honours, and escorted by a formidable <lb/>
            array of troops, marching in order of battle, passed through <lb/>
            Ocricoli, attracting towards himself the astonished gaze <lb/>
            of all the citizens.</p>
          <p>5. And when he drew near to the city, contemplating <lb/>
            the salutations offered him by the senators, and the whole <lb/>
            body of fathers venerable from their likeness to their <lb/>
            ancestors, he thought, not like Cincas, the ambassador of <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, that a multitude of kings was here assembled <lb/>
            together, but that the city was the asylum of the whole <lb/>
            world.</p>
          <p>6. And when from them he had turned his eyes upon <lb/>
            the citizens, he marvelled to think with what rapidity the <lb/>
            whole race of mankind upon earth had come from all <lb/>
            quarters to Rome; and, as if he would have terrified the <lb/>
            Euphrates or the Rhine with a show of armed men, he <lb/>
            himself came on, preceded by standards on both sides, sit <lb/>
            ting alone in a golden chariot, shining with all kinds of <lb/>
            brilliant precious stones, which seemed to spread a flicker- <lb/>
            ing light all around.</p>
          <p>7. Numbers also of the chief officers who went before <lb/>
            him were surrounded by dragons embroidered on various <lb/>
            kinds of tissue, fastened to the golden or jewelled points of <lb/>
            spears, the mouths of the dragons being open so as to <lb/>
            catch the wind, which made them hiss as though they <lb/>
            were inflamed with anger; while the coils of their tails <lb/>
            were also contrived to be agitated by the breeze.</p>
          <p>8. After these marched a double row of heavy-armed <lb/>
            soldiers, with shields and crested helmets, glittering with <lb/>
            brilliant light, and clad in radiant breast-plates; and <lb/>
            among these were scattered cavalry with cuirasses, whom <lb/>
            the Persians call Clibanarii,1 protected by coverings of <lb/>
            iron breast-plates, and girdled with belts of iron, so that <lb/>
            you would fancy them statues polished by the hand of <lb/>
            Praxitelcs, rather than men. And the light circular plates <lb/>
            of iron which surrounded their bodies, and covered all <lb/>
            their limbs, were so well fitted to all their motions, that <lb/>
            in whatever direction they had occasion to move, the joints <note type="footnote">1 The word is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλιβανον</foreign>, an oven, and seems to mean <lb/>
            entirely clothed in iron. </note> <pb n="101"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            of their iron clothing adapted themselves equally to any <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>9. The emperor as he proceeded was saluted as Augustus <lb/>
            by voices of good omen, the mountains and shores re-echo- <lb/>
            ing the shouts of the people, amid which he preserved the <lb/>
            .same immovable countenance which he was accustomed tc <lb/>
            display in his provinces.</p>
          <p>10. For though he was very short, yet he bowed down <lb/>
            when entering high gates, and looking straight before him, <lb/>
            as though he had had his neck in a vice, he turned his <lb/>
            eyes neither to the right nor to the left, as If he had been <lb/>
            a statue : nor when the carriage shook him did he nod his <lb/>
            head, or spit, or rub his face or his nose ; nor was he ever <lb/>
            seen even to move a hand.</p>
          <p>11. And although this calmness was affectation, yet these <lb/>
            and other portions of his inner life were indicative of a <lb/>
            most extraordinary patience, as it may be thought, granted <lb/>
            to him alone.</p>
          <p>12. I pass over the circumstance that during the whole <lb/>
            of his reign he never either took up any one to sit with <lb/>
            him in his chariot, or admitted any private person to be <lb/>
            his partner in the consulship, as other emperors had done; <lb/>
            also many other things which he, being filled with elation <lb/>
            and pride, prescribed to himself as the justest of all rules <lb/>
            of conduct, recollecting that I mentioned those facts before, <lb/>
            as occasion served.</p>
          <p>13. As he went on, having entered Rome, that home of <lb/>
            sovereignty and of all virtues, when he arrived at the <lb/>
            rostra, he gazed with amazed awe on the Forum, the most <lb/>
            renowned monument of ancient power; and, being be- <lb/>
            wildered with the number of wonders on every side to <lb/>
            which he turned his eyes, having addressed the nobles in <lb/>
            the senate-house, and harangued the populace from the <lb/>
            tribune, he retired, with the good-will of all, into his <lb/>
            palace, where he enjoyed the luxury he had wished for. <lb/>
            And often, when celebrating the equestrian games, was he <lb/>
            delighted with the talkativeness of the common people, <lb/>
            who were neither proud, nor, on the other hand, inclined <lb/>
            to become rebellious from too much liberty, while he him- <lb/>
            self also reverently observed a proper moderation.</p>
          <p>14. For he did not, as was usually done in other cities, <lb/>
            allow the length of the gladiatorial contests to depend on <pb n="102"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVI. CH. X. </note> <lb/>
            his caprice ; but left it to be decided by various occurrences. <lb/>
            Then, traversing the summits of the seven hills, and the <lb/>
            different quarters of the city, whether placed on the slopes <lb/>
            of the hills or on the level ground, and visiting, too, the <lb/>
            suburban divisions, he was so delighted that whatever he <lb/>
            saw first he thought the most excellent of all. Admiring the <lb/>
            temple of the Tarpeian Jupiter, which is as much superior <lb/>
            to other temples as divine things are superior to those of <lb/>
            men ; and the baths of the size of provinces; and the <lb/>
            vast mass of the amphitheatre, so solidly erected of Tiber- <lb/>
            tine stone, to the top of which human vision can scarcely <lb/>
            reach; and the Pantheon with its vast extent, its imposing <lb/>
            height, and the solid magnifieenee of its arehes, and the <lb/>
            lofty niches rising one above another like stairs, adorned <lb/>
            with the images of former emperors; and the temple of <lb/>
            the city, and the forum of peace, and the theatre of <lb/>
            Pompey, and the odeum, and the racecourse, and the other <lb/>
            ornaments of the Eternal City.</p>
          <p>15. But when he came to the forum of Trajan, the most <lb/>
            exquisite structure, in my opinion, under the canopy of <lb/>
            heaven, and admired even by the deities themselves, he <lb/>
            stood transfixed with wonder, easting his mind over the <lb/>
            gigantic proportions of the place, beyond the power of <lb/>
            mortal to describe, and beyond the reasonable desire of <lb/>
            mortals to rival. Therefore giving up all hopes of attempt- <lb/>
            ing anything of this kind, he contented himself with say- <lb/>
            in- that he should wish to imitate, and could imitate the <lb/>
            horse of Trajan, which stands by itself in the middle of <lb/>
            the hall, bearing the emperor himself on his back.</p>
          <p>16. And the royal prince Hormisda, whose departure <lb/>
            from Persia we have already mentioned, standing by <lb/>
            answered, with the refinement of his nature, " But first, 0 <lb/>
            emperor, command such a stable to be built for him, if you <lb/>
            can, that the horse which you purpose to make may have <lb/>
            as fair a domain as this which we see." And when he was <lb/>
            asked what he thought of Rome, he said that " he was <lb/>
            particularly delighted with it because he had learnt that <lb/>
            men died also there."</p>
          <p>17. Now after he had beheld all these various objects <lb/>
            with awful admiration, the emperor complained of fame, <lb/>
            as either deficient in power, or else spiteful, because, <lb/>
            though it usually exaggerates everything, it fell very <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 356.] </note> <lb/>
            short in its praises cf the things which are at Rome ; and <lb/>
            having deliberated for some time what he should do, he <lb/>
            determined to add to the ornaments of the city by erecting <lb/>
            an obelisk in the Circus Maximus, the origin and form <lb/>
            of which I will describe when I come to the proper <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>18. At this time Eusebia, the queen, who herself was <lb/>
            barren all her life, began to plot against Helena, the sister <lb/>
            of Constantius, and wife of the Cæsar Julian, whom she <lb/>
            had induced to come to Rome under a pretence of affection, <lb/>
            and by wicked machinations she induced her to drink a <lb/>
            poison which she had procured, which should have the <lb/>
            effect, whenever Helena conceived, of producing abortion.</p>
          <p>19. For already, when in Gaul, she had borne a male <lb/>
            child, but that also had been dishonestly destroyed because <lb/>
            the midwife, having been bribed, killed it as soon as it was <lb/>
            born, by cutting through the navel-string too deeply; <lb/>
            such exceeding care was taken that this most gallant man <lb/>
            should have no offspring.</p>
          <p>20. But the emperor, while wishing to remain longer in <lb/>
            this most august spot of the whole world, in order to enjoy <lb/>
            a purer tranquillity and higher degree of pleasure, was <lb/>
            alarmed by repeated intelligence on which he could rely, <lb/>
            which informed him that the Suevi were invading the <lb/>
            Tyrol, that the Quadi were ravaging Valeria,' and that the <lb/>
            Sarmatians, a tribe most skilful in plunder, were laying <lb/>
            waste the upper Mœsia, and the second Pannonia. And <lb/>
            roused by these news, on the thirtieth day after he had <lb/>
            entered Rome, he again quitted it, leaving it on the 29th <lb/>
            of May, and passing through Trent he proceeded with all <lb/>
            haste towards Illyricum.</p>
          <p>21. And from that city he sent Severus to succeed <lb/>
            Marcellus, a man of great experience and ripe skill in war, <lb/>
            and summoned Ursicinus to himself. He, having gladly <lb/>
            received the letter of summons, came to Sirmium, with a <lb/>
            large retinue, and after a long deliberation on the peace <lb/>
            which Musonianus had reported as possible to be made <lb/>
            with the Persians, he was sent back to the East with the <lb/>
            authority of commander-in-chief, and the older officers of <lb/>
            our company having been promoted to commands over the <note type="footnote">1 Valeria was a division of Pannonia, so called from Valeria, the <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. BUT Julian, having passed his winter at Sens, amid <lb/>
            continual disturbance, in the ninth consulship of the em- <lb/>
            peror, and his own second, while the threats of the <lb/>
            Germans were raging on all sides, being roused by favour- <lb/>
            able omens, marched with speed to Hbeims, with the <lb/>
            greater alacrity and joy because Severus was in command <lb/>
            of the army there ; a man inclined to agree with him, <lb/>
            void of arrogance, but of proved propriety of conduct and <lb/>
            experience in war, and likely to follow his lawful au- <lb/>
            thority, obeying his general like a well-disciplined sol- <lb/>
            dier.</p>
          <p>2, In another quarter, Barbatio, who after the death of <lb/>
            Silvanus had been promoted to the command of the in- <lb/>
            fantry, came from Italy by the emperor's orders, to Augst, <lb/>
            with 25,000 heavy-armed soldiers.</p>
          <p>3. For the plan proposed and very anxiously prepared <lb/>
            was, that the Allemanni, who were in a state of greater <lb/>
            rage than ever, and were extending their incursions more <lb/>
            widely, should be caught between our two armies, as if <lb/>
            between the arms of a pair of pincers, and so driven into <lb/>
            a corner and destroyed.</p>
          <p>4. But while these well-devised plans were being <lb/>
            pressed forward, the barbarians, in joy at some success <lb/>
            which they had obtained, and skilful in seizing every <lb/>
            opportunity for plunder, passed secretly between the camps <lb/>
            of the armies, and attacked Lyons unexpectedly. And <lb/>
            having plundered the district around, they would have <lb/>
            stormed and burnt the city itself, if they had not found <lb/>
            the gates so strongly defended that they were repulsed; so <lb/>
            that they only destroyed all they could find outside the <lb/>
            city.</p>
          <p>5. When this disaster was known, Cæsar, with great <lb/>
            alacrity, despatched three squadrons of light cavalry, of <lb/>
            approved valour, to watch three lines of road, knowing <lb/>
            that beyond all question the invaders must quit the district <lb/>
            by one of them. <pb n="105"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> 6. Nor was he mistaken; for all who came by these <lb/>
            roads were slaughtered by our men, and the whole of the <lb/>
            booty which they were carrying off was recovered unhurt. <lb/>
            Those alone escaped in safety who passed by the camp of <lb/>
            Barbatio, who were suffered to escape in that direction <lb/>
            because Bainobaudes the tribune, and Valentinian (after <lb/>
            wards emperor), who had been appointed to watch that <lb/>
            pass with the squadrons of cavalry under their orders, were <lb/>
            forbidden by Cella (the tribune of the Scutarii, who had <lb/>
            been sent as colleague to Barbatio) to occupy that road, <lb/>
            though they were sure that by that the Germans would <lb/>
            return to their own country.</p>
          <p>7. The cowardly master of the horse, being also an <lb/>
            obstinate enemy to the glory of Julian, was not contented <lb/>
            with this, but being conscious that he had given orders <lb/>
            inconsistent with the interests of Rome (for when he was <lb/>
            accused of it Cella confessed what he had done), he made <lb/>
            a false report to Constantius, and told him that these same <lb/>
            tribunes had, under a pretence of the business of the state, <lb/>
            came thither for the purpose of tampering with the <lb/>
            soldiers whom he commanded. And owing to this state- <lb/>
            ment they were deprived of their commands, and returned <lb/>
            home as private individuals.</p>
          <p>8. In these days, also, the barbarians, alarmed at the <lb/>
            approach of our armies, which had established their sta- <lb/>
            tions on the left bank of the Rhine, employed some part <lb/>
            of their force in skilfully barricading the roads, naturally <lb/>
            difficult of access, and full of hills, by abattis constructed <lb/>
            of large trees cut down; others occupied the numerous <lb/>
            islands scattered up and down the Rhone, and with horrid <lb/>
            howls poured forth constant reproaches against the Romans <lb/>
            and the Cæsar; who, being now more than ever resolved to <lb/>
            crush some of their armies, demanded from Barbatio seven <lb/>
            of those boats which he had collected, for the purpose of <lb/>
            constructing a bridge with them, with the intention of <lb/>
            crossing the river. But Barbatio, determined that no as- <lb/>
            sistance should be got from him, burnt them all.</p>
          <p>9. Julian, therefore, having learnt from the report of <lb/>
            some spies whom he had lately taken prisoners, that, when <lb/>
            the drought of summer arrived, the river was fordable, <lb/>
            addressed a speech of encouragement to his light-armed <lb/>
            auxiliary troops, and sent them forward with Bainobaudes, <pb n="106"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVI. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            the tribune of the Cornuti, to try and perform some gallant <lb/>
            exploit, if they could find an opportunity. And they, <lb/>
            entering the shallow of the river, and sometimes, when <lb/>
            there was occasion for swimming, putting their shields <lb/>
            under them like canoes, reached a neighbouring island, <lb/>
            and having landed, killed every one they found on it, men <lb/>
            and women, without distinction of age, like so many sheep. <lb/>
            And having found some empty boats, though they were <lb/>
            not very safe, they crossed in them, forcing their way into <lb/>
            many places of the same land. When they were weary of <lb/>
            slaughter, and loaded with a rich booty, some of which, <lb/>
            however, they lost through the violence of the river, they <lb/>
            returned back to the camp without losing a man.</p>
          <p>10. And when this was known, the rest of the Germans, <lb/>
            thinking they could no longer trust the garrisons left in <lb/>
            the islands, removed their relations, and their magazines, <lb/>
            and their barbaric treasures, into the inland parts.</p>
          <p>11. After this Julian turned his attention to repair the <lb/>
            fortress known by the name of Saverne, which had a little <lb/>
            time before been destroyed by a violent attack of the <lb/>
            enemy, but which, while it stood, manifestly prevented <lb/>
            the Germans from forcing their way into the interior of <lb/>
            the Gauls, as they had been accustomed to do; and he <lb/>
            executed this work with greater rapidity than he expected, <lb/>
            and he laid up for the garrison which he intended to post <lb/>
            there sufficient magazines for a whole year's consump- <lb/>
            tion, which his army collected from the crops of the <lb/>
            barbarians, not without occasional contests with the <lb/>
            owners.</p>
          <p>12. Nor indeed was he contented with this, but he also <lb/>
            collected provisions for himself and his army sufficient for <lb/>
            twenty days. For the soldiers delighted in using the <lb/>
            food which they had won with their own right hands, <lb/>
            being especially indignant because, out of all the supplies <lb/>
            which had been recently sent them, they were not able to <lb/>
            obtain anything, inasmuch as Barbatio, when they were <lb/>
            passing near his camp, had with great insolence seized on <lb/>
            a portion of them, and had collected all the rest into a <lb/>
            heap and burnt them. Whether he acted thus out of his <lb/>
            own vanity and insane folly, or whether others were really <lb/>
            the authors of this wickedness, relying on the command of <lb/>
            the emperor himself, has never been known. <pb n="107"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> 13. However, as far as report went, the story commonly <lb/>
            was, that Julian had been elected Cæsar, not for the object <lb/>
            of relieving the distresses of the Gauls, but rather of being <lb/>
            himself destroyed by the formidable wars in which he was <lb/>
            sure to be involved ; being at that time, as was supposed, <lb/>
            inexperienced in war, and not likely to endure even the <lb/>
            sound of arms.</p>
          <p>14. While the works of the camp were steadily rising, <lb/>
            and while a portion of the army was being distributed <lb/>
            among the stations in the country districts, Julian occu- <lb/>
            pied himself in other quarters with collecting supplies, <lb/>
            operating with great caution, from the fear of ambuscades. <lb/>
            And in the mean time, a vast host of the barbarians, out- <lb/>
            stripping all report of their approach by the celerity of <lb/>
            their movements, came down with a sudden attack upon <lb/>
            Barbatio, and the army which (as I have already men- <lb/>
            tioned) he had under his command, separated from the <lb/>
            Gallic army of Severus only by a rampart; and having <lb/>
            put him to flight, pursued him as far as Augst, and beyond <lb/>
            that town too, as far as they could; and, having made booty <lb/>
            of the greater part of his baggage and beasts of burden, <lb/>
            and having carried off many of the sutlers as prisoners, <lb/>
            they returned to their main army.</p>
          <p>15. And Barbatio, as if he had brought his expectations <lb/>
            to a prosperous issue, now distributed his soldiers into <lb/>
            winter quarters, and returned to the emperor's court, to <lb/>
            forge new accusations against the Cæsar, according to his <lb/>
            custom.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHEN this disgraceful disaster had become known, <lb/>
            Chnodomarius and Vestralpus, the kings of the Allemanni, <lb/>
            and Urius and Ursicinus, with Serapion, and Suomarius, <lb/>
            and Hortarius, having collected all their forces into one <lb/>
            body, encamped near the city of Strasburg, thinking that <lb/>
            the Caesar, from fear of imminent danger, had retreated <lb/>
            at the very time that he was wholly occupied with com- <lb/>
            pleting a fortress to enable him to make a permanent <lb/>
            stand.</p>
          <p>2. Their confidence and assurance of success was in- <lb/>
            creased by one of the Scutarii who deserted to them, who, <pb n="108"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVI. CH. XII </note> <lb/>
            fearing punishment for some offence which he had com- <lb/>
            mitted, crossed over to them after the departure of Bar- <lb/>
            batio, and assured them that Julian had now only 13,000 <lb/>
            men remaining with him. For that was the number of <lb/>
            troops that he had now with him, while the ferocious <lb/>
            barbarians were stirring up attacks upon him from all <lb/>
            sides.</p>
          <p>3. And as he constantly adhered to the same story, they <lb/>
            were excited to more haughty attempts by the confidence <lb/>
            with which he inspired them, and sent ambassadors in an <lb/>
            imperious tone to Cæsar, demanding that he should retire <lb/>
            from the territory which they had acquired by their own <lb/>
            valour in arms. But he, a stranger to fear, and not liable <lb/>
            to be swayed either by anger or by disappointment, de- <lb/>
            spised the arrogance of the barbarians, and detaining the <lb/>
            ambassadors till he had completed the works of his camp, <lb/>
            remained immovable on his ground with admirable con- <lb/>
            stancy.</p>
          <p>4. But King Chnodomarius, moving about in every direc- <lb/>
            tion, and being always the first to undertake dangerous <lb/>
            enterprises, kept everything in continual agitation and <lb/>
            confusion, being full of arrogance and pride, as one whose <lb/>
            head was turned by repeated success.</p>
          <p>5. For he had defeated the Caesar Decentius in a pitched <lb/>
            battle, and he had plundered and destroyed many wealthy <lb/>
            cities, and he had long ravaged all Gaul at his own <lb/>
            pleasure without meeting with any resistance. And his <lb/>
            confidence was now increased by the recent retreat of a <lb/>
            general superior to him in the number and strength of his <lb/>
            forces.</p>
          <p>6. For the Allemanni, beholding the emblems on their <lb/>
            shields, saw that a few predatory bands- of their men had <lb/>
            wrested those districts from those soldiers whom they had <lb/>
            formerly never engaged but with fear, and by whom they <lb/>
            had often been routed with much loss. And these cir- <lb/>
            cumstances made Julian very anxious, because, after the <lb/>
            defection of Barbatio, he himself under the pressure of <lb/>
            absolute necessity was compelled to encounter very popu- <lb/>
            lous tribes, with but very few, though brave troops.</p>
          <p>7. And now, the sun being fully risen, the trumpets <lb/>
            sounded, and the infantry were led forth from the camp in <lb/>
            slow march, and on their flanks were arrayed thq <pb n="109"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            squadrons of cavalry, among which were both the cui- <lb/>
            rassiers and the archers, troops whose equipment was very <lb/>
            formidable.</p>
          <p>8. And since from the spot from which the Roman <lb/>
            standards had first advanced to the rampart of the bar- <lb/>
            barian camp were fourteen leagues, that is to say one-and- <lb/>
            twenty miles, Cæsar, carefully providing for the advantage <lb/>
            and safety of his army, called in the skirmishers who had <lb/>
            gone out in front, and having ordered silence in his usual <lb/>
            voice, while they all stood in battalions around him,' <lb/>
            addressed them in his natural tranquillity of voice.</p>
          <p>9. " The necessity of providing for our common safety, <lb/>
            to say the least of it, compels me, and I am no prince of <lb/>
            abject spirit, to exhort you, my comrades, to rely so much <lb/>
            on your own mature and vigorous valour, as to follow <lb/>
            my counsels in adopting a prudent manner of enduring or <lb/>
            repelling the evils which we anticipate, rather than resort <lb/>
            to an overhasty mode of action which must be doubtful in <lb/>
            its issue.</p>
          <p>10. " For though amid dangers youth ought to be ener- <lb/>
            getic and bold, so also in cases of necessity it should <lb/>
            show itself manageable and prudent. Now what I think <lb/>
            best to be done, if your opinion accords with mine, and <lb/>
            if your just indignation will endure it, I will briefly <lb/>
            explain.</p>
          <p>11. “Already noon is approaching, we are weary with <lb/>
            our march, and if we advance we shall enter upon rugged <lb/>
            paths where we can hardly see our way. As the moon is <lb/>
            waning the night will not be lighted up by any stars. <lb/>
            The earth is burnt up with the heat, and will afford us no <lb/>
            supplies of water. And even if by any contrivance we <lb/>
            could get over these difficulties comfortably, still, when <lb/>
            the swarms of the enemy fall upon us, refreshed as they <lb/>
            will be with rest, meat, and drink, what will become <lb/>
            of us ? What strength will there be in our weary limbs, <lb/>
            exhausted as we shall be with hunger, thirst, and toil, to <lb/>
            encounter them ?</p>
          <p>12. " Therefore, since the most critical difficulties are <lb/>
            often overcome by skilful arrangements, and since, after <lb/>
            good counsel has been taken in good part, divine-looking <lb/>
            remedies have often re-established affairs which seemed to <lb/>
            be tottering; I entreat you to let us here, surrounded as <pb n="110"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVI. CH. XII </note> <lb/>
            we are with fosse and rampart, take our repose, after first <lb/>
            parcelling out our regular watches, and then, having <lb/>
            refreshed ourselves with sleep and food as well as the time <lb/>
            will allow, let us, under the protection of God, with the <lb/>
            earliest dawn move forth our conquering eagles and <lb/>
            standards to reap a certain triumph."</p>
          <p>13. The soldiers would hardly allow him to finish his <lb/>
            speech, gnashing their teeth, and showing their eagerness <lb/>
            for combat by beating their shields with their spears; and <lb/>
            entreating at once to be led against the enemy already in <lb/>
            their sight, relying on the favour of the God of heaven, and <lb/>
            on their own valour, and on the proved courage of their <lb/>
            fortunate general. And, as the result proved, it was a <lb/>
            certain kind genius that was present with them thus <lb/>
            prompting them to fight while still under his inspiration.</p>
          <p>14. And this eagerness of theirs was further stimulated <lb/>
            by the full approval of the officers of high rank, and <lb/>
            especially of Florentius the prefect of the praetorian guard, <lb/>
            who openly gave his opinion for fighting at once, while <lb/>
            the enemy were in the solid mass in which they were now <lb/>
            arranged; admitting the danger indeed, but still thinking <lb/>
            it the wisest plan, because, if the enemy once dispersed, <lb/>
            it would be impossible to restrain the soldiers, at all times <lb/>
            inclined by their natural vehemence of disposition towards <lb/>
            sedition ; and they were likely to be, as he thought, so in- <lb/>
            dignant at being denied the victory they sought, as to be <lb/>
            easily tempted to the most lawless violence.</p>
          <p>15. Two other considerations also added to the con- <lb/>
            fidence of our men. First, because they recollected that <lb/>
            in the previous year, when the Romans spread themselves <lb/>
            in every direction over the countries on the other side of <lb/>
            the Rhine, not one of the barbarians stood to defend his <lb/>
            home, nor ventured to encounter them; but they contented <lb/>
            themselves with blockading the roads in every direction <lb/>
            with vast abattis, throughout the whole winter retiring into <lb/>
            the remote districts, and willingly endured the greatest <lb/>
            hardships rather than fight; recollecting also that, after <lb/>
            the emperor actually invaded their territories, the barba- <lb/>
            rians neither ventured to make any resistance, nor even <lb/>
            to show themselves at all, but implored peace in the most <lb/>
            suppliant manner, till they obtained it.</p>
          <p>16. But no one considered that the times were changed, <pb n="111"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            because the barbarians were at that time pressed with a <lb/>
            threefold danger. The emperor hastening against them <lb/>
            through the Tyrol, the Cæsar who was actually in their <lb/>
            country cutting off all possibility of retreat, while the <lb/>
            neighbouring tribes, whom recent quarrels had converted <lb/>
            into enemies, were all but treading on their heels; and <lb/>
            thus they were surrounded on all sides. But since that <lb/>
            time the emperor, having granted them peace, had returned <lb/>
            to Italy, and the neighbouring tribes, having all cause of <lb/>
            quarrel removed, were again in alliance with them; and <lb/>
            the disgraceful retreat of one of the Roman generals had <lb/>
            increased their natural confidence and boldness.</p>
          <p>17. Moreover there was another circumstance which at <lb/>
            this crisis added weight to the difficulties which pressed <lb/>
            upon the Romans. The two royal brothers, who had <lb/>
            obtained peace from Constantius in the preceding year, <lb/>
            being bound by the obligations of that treaty, neither <lb/>
            ventured to raise any disturbance, nor indeed to put them- <lb/>
            selves in motion at all. But a little after the conclusion <lb/>
            of that peace one of them whose name was Gundomadus, <lb/>
            and who was the most loyal and the most faithful to his <lb/>
            word, was slain by treachery, and then all his tribe joined <lb/>
            our enemies; and on this the tribe of Vadomarius also, <lb/>
            against his will, as he affirmed, ranged itself on the side of <lb/>
            the barbarians who were arming for war.</p>
          <p>18. Therefore, since all the soldiers of every rank, from <lb/>
            the highest to the lowest, approved of engaging instantly, <lb/>
            and would not relax the least from the rigour of their <lb/>
            determination, on a sudden the standard-bearer shouted <lb/>
            out, " Go forth, 0 Cæsar, most fortunate of all princes. <lb/>
            Go whither thy better fortune leads thee. At least we <lb/>
            have learnt by your example the power of valour and <lb/>
            military skill. Go on and lead us, as a fortunate and <lb/>
            gallant champion. You shall see what a soldier under the <lb/>
            eye of a warlike general, a witness of the exploits of each <lb/>
            individual, can do, and how little, with the favour of the <lb/>
            Deity, any obstacle can avail against him."</p>
          <p>19. When these words were heard, without a moment's <lb/>
            delay, the whole army advanced and approached a hill <lb/>
            of moderate height, covered with ripe corn, at no great <lb/>
            distance from the banks of the Rhine. On its summit <lb/>
            were posted three cavalry soldiers of the enemy as scouts, <pb n="112"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVI. CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            who at once hastened back to their comrades to announce <lb/>
            that the Roman army was at hand; but one infantry <lb/>
            soldier who was with them, not being able to keep up <lb/>
            with them, was taken prisoner by the activity of some of <lb/>
            our soldiers, and informed us that the Germans had been <lb/>
            passing over the river for three days and three nights.</p>
          <p>20. And when our generals beheld them now at no <lb/>
            great distance forming their men into solid columns, they <lb/>
            halted, and formed all the first ranks of their troops into <lb/>
            a similarly solid body, and with equal caution the enemy <lb/>
            likewise halted.</p>
          <p>21. And when in consequence of this halt, the enemy <lb/>
            saw (as the deserter I mentioned above had informed <lb/>
            them) that all our cavalry was ranged against them in <lb/>
            our right wing, then they posted all their own cavalry in <lb/>
            close order on their left wing. And with them they <lb/>
            mingled every here and there a few infantry, skirmishers <lb/>
            and light-armed soldiers, which indeed was a very wise <lb/>
            manoeuvre.</p>
          <p>22. For they knew that a cavalry soldier, however skilful, <lb/>
            if fighting with one of our men in complete armour, while <lb/>
            his hands were occupied with shield and bridle, so that he <lb/>
            could use no offensive weapon but the spear which he <lb/>
            brandished in his right hand, could never injure an enemy <lb/>
            wholly covered with iron mail; but that an infantry <lb/>
            soldier, amid the actual struggles of personal conflict, <lb/>
            when nothing is usually guarded against by a combatant <lb/>
            except that which is straight before him, may crawl <lb/>
            unperceivedly along the ground, and piercing the side of <lb/>
            the Roman soldier's horse, throw the rider down headlong, <lb/>
            rendering him thus an easy victim.</p>
          <p>23. When these dispositions had been thus made, the <lb/>
            barbarians also protected their right flank with secret <lb/>
            ambuscades and snares. Now the whole of these warlike <lb/>
            and savage tribes were on this day under the command of <lb/>
            Chnodomarius and Serapio, monarchs of more power than <lb/>
            any of their former kings.</p>
          <p>24. Chnodomarius was indeed the wicked instigator of <lb/>
            the whole war, and bearing on his head a helmet blazing <lb/>
            like fire, he led on the left wing with great boldness, <lb/>
            confiding much on his vast personal strength. And now <lb/>
            with great eagerness for the impending battle he mounted <pb n="113"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            a spirited horse, that by the increased height he might be <lb/>
            More conspicuous, leaning upon a spear of most formidable <lb/>
            size, and remarkable for the splendour of his arms. Being <lb/>
            indeed a prince who had on former occasions shown him- <lb/>
            self brave as a warrior and a general, eminent for skill <lb/>
            above his fellows.</p>
          <p>25. The right wing was led by Serapio, a youth whose <lb/>
            beard had hardly grown, but who was beyond his years <lb/>
            in courage and strength. He was the son of Mederichus <lb/>
            the brother of Chnodomarius, a man throughout his whole <lb/>
            life of the greatest perfidy; and he had received the name <lb/>
            of Scrapio because his father, having been given as a <lb/>
            hostage, had been detained in Gaul for a long time, and <lb/>
            had there learnt some of the mysteries of the Greeks, in <lb/>
            consequence of which he had changed the name of his son, <lb/>
            who at his birth was named Agenarichus, into that of <lb/>
            Serapio.</p>
          <p>26. These two leaders were followed by five other <lb/>
            kings who were but little inferior in power to themselves, <lb/>
            by ten petty princes, a vast number of nobles, and thirty- <lb/>
            five thousand armed men, collected from various nations <lb/>
            partly by pay, and partly by a promise of requiting their <lb/>
            service by similar assistance on a future day.</p>
          <p>27. The trumpets now gave forth a terrible sound; <lb/>
            Severus, the Roman general in command of the left wing, <lb/>
            when he came near the ditches filled with armed men, <lb/>
            from which the enemy bad arranged that those who were <lb/>
            there concealed should suddenly rise up, and throw the <lb/>
            Roman line into confusion, halted boldly, and suspecting <lb/>
            some yet hidden ambuscade, neither attempted to retreat <lb/>
            nor advance.</p>
          <p>28. Seeing this, Julian, always full of courage at the <lb/>
            moment of the greatest difficulty, galloped with an escort <lb/>
            of two hundred cavalry through the ranks of the infantry <lb/>
            at full speed, addressing them with words of encourage- <lb/>
            ment, as the critical circumstances in which they were <lb/>
            placed required.</p>
          <p>29. And as the extent of the space over which they were <lb/>
            spread and the denseness of the multitude thus collected <lb/>
            into one body, would not allow him to address the whole <lb/>
            army (and also because on other accounts he wished to <lb/>
            avoid exposing himself to malice and envy, as well as not <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVI. CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            to affect that which Augustus thought belonged exclusively <lb/>
            to himself), he, while taking care of himself as he passed <lb/>
            within reach of the darts of the enemy, encouraged all <lb/>
            whom his voice could reach, whether known or unknown <lb/>
            to him, to fight bravely, with these and similar words :-</p>
          <p>30. “Now, my comrades, the fit time for fighting has <lb/>
            arrived; the time which 1, as well as you, have long de- <lb/>
            sircd, and which you just now invited when, with gestures <lb/>
            of impatience, you demanded to be led on." Again, when <lb/>
            he came to those in the rear rank, who were posted in <lb/>
            reserve: " Behold," said he, " my comrades, the long- <lb/>
            wished-for day is at hand, which incites us all to wash out <lb/>
            former stains, and to restore to its proper brightness the <lb/>
            Roman majesty. These men before you are barbarians, <lb/>
            whom their own rage and intemperate madness have urged <lb/>
            forward to meet with the destruction of their fortunes, dc- <lb/>
            feated as they will now be by our might."</p>
          <p>31. Presently, when making better dispositions for the <lb/>
            array of some troops who, by long experience in war, had <lb/>
            attained to greater skill, he aided his arrangements by <lb/>
            these exhortations. " Let us rise up like brave men; let <lb/>
            us by our native valour repel the disgrace which has at <lb/>
            one time been brought upon our arms, from contemplating <lb/>
            which it was that after much delay I consented to take the <lb/>
            name of Cæsar.”</p>
          <p>32. But to any whom he saw inconsiderately demanding <lb/>
            the signal to be given for instant battle, and likely by their <lb/>
            rash movements to be inattentive to orders, he said, " I <lb/>
            entreat you not to be too eager in your pursuit of the <lb/>
            flying enemy, so as to risk losing the glory of the victory <lb/>
            which awaits us, and also never to retreat, except under <lb/>
            the last necessity.</p>
          <p>33. " For I shall certainly take no care of those who flee. <lb/>
            But among those who press on to the slaughter of the <lb/>
            enemy I shall be present, and share with you indiscrimi- <lb/>
            nately, provided only that your charge be made with <lb/>
            moderation and prudence."</p>
          <p>34. While repeatedly addressing these and similar ex- <lb/>
            hortations to the troops, he drew up the principal part of <lb/>
            his army opposite to the front rank of the barbarians. And <lb/>
            suddenly there arose from the Allemanni a great shout, <lb/>
            mingled with indignant cries, all exclaiming with one <pb n="115"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            voice that the princes ought to leave their horses and <lb/>
            fight in the ranks on equal terms with their men. lest if <lb/>
            any mischance should occur they should avail themselves <lb/>
            of the facility of escaping, and leave the mass of the army <lb/>
            in miserable plight.</p>
          <p>35. When this was known, Chnodomarius immediately <lb/>
            leapt down from his horse, and the rest of the princes fol- <lb/>
            lowed his example without hesitation. For indeed none of <lb/>
            them doubted but that their side would be victorious.</p>
          <p>36. Then the signal for battle being given as usual by <lb/>
            the sound of trumpets, the armies rushed to the combat <lb/>
            with all their force. First of all javelins were hurled, and <lb/>
            the Germans, hastening on with the utmost impetuosity, <lb/>
            brandishing their javelins in their right hands, dashed <lb/>
            among the squadrons of our cavalry, uttering fearful cries. <lb/>
            They had excited themselves to more than usual rage; <lb/>
            their flowing hair bristling with their eagerness, and fury <lb/>
            biasing from their eyes. While in opposition to them our <lb/>
            soldiers, standing steadily, protecting their heads with the <lb/>
            bulwark of their shields, and drawing their swords or <lb/>
            brandishing their javelins, equally threatened death to <lb/>
            their assailants.</p>
          <p>37. And while in the very conflict of battle, the cavalry <lb/>
            kept their gallant squadrons in close order, and the in- <lb/>
            fantry strengthened their flanks, standing shoulder to <lb/>
            shoulder with closely-locked shields, clouds of thick dust <lb/>
            arose, and the battle rocked to and fro, our men some- <lb/>
            times advancing, sometimes receding. Some of the most <lb/>
            powerful warriors among the barbarians pressed upon their <lb/>
            antagonists with their knees, trying to throw them down; <lb/>
            and in the general excitement men fought hand to hand, <lb/>
            shield pressing upon shield; while the heaven resounded <lb/>
            with the loud cries of the conquerors and of the dying. <lb/>
            Presently, when our left wing, advancing forward, had <lb/>
            driven back with superior strength the vast bands of <lb/>
            German assailants, and was itself advancing with loud <lb/>
            cries against the enemy, our cavalry on the right wing <lb/>
            unexpectedly retreated in disorder ; but when the leading <lb/>
            fugitives came upon those in the rear, they halted, perceiving <lb/>
            themselves covered by the legions, and renewed the battle.</p>
          <p>38. This disaster had arisen from the cuirassiers see ng <lb/>
            their commander slightly wounded, and one of their <pb n="116"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVI. CH. XII </note> <lb/>
            comrades crushed under the weight of his own arms, <lb/>
            and of his horse, which fell upon him while they were <lb/>
            changing their position, on which they all fled as each <lb/>
            could, and would have trampled down the infantry, and <lb/>
            thrown everything into confusion, if the infantry had not <lb/>
            steadily kept their ranks and stood immovable, supporting <lb/>
            each other. Julian, when from a distance he saw his <lb/>
            cavalry thus seeking safety in flight, spurred his horse <lb/>
            towards them, and himself stopped them like a barrier.</p>
          <p>39. For as he was at once recognized by his purple <lb/>
            standard of the dragon, which was fixed to the top of a long <lb/>
            spear, waving its fringe as a real dragon sheds its skin, <lb/>
            the tribune of one squadron halted, and turning pale with <lb/>
            alarm, hastened back to renew the battle.</p>
          <p>40. Then, as is customary in critical moments, Julian <lb/>
            gently reproached his men: “Whither," said he, " gallant <lb/>
            comrades, are ye retreating ? Are ye ignorant that flight, <lb/>
            which never insures safety, proves the folly of having <lb/>
            made a vain attempt? Let us return to our army, to be <lb/>
            partakers of their glory, and not rashly desert those who <lb/>
            are fighting for the republic."</p>
          <p>41. Saying these words in a dignified tone, he led them <lb/>
            all back to discharge their duties in the fight, imitating <lb/>
            in this the ancient hero Sylla, if we make allowances for <lb/>
            the difference of situation. For when Sylla, having led <lb/>
            his army against Archelaus, the general of Mithridates, <lb/>
            became exhausted by the violence of the conflict, and was <lb/>
            deserted by all his soldiers, he ran to the foremost rank, <lb/>
            and seizing a standard he turned it against the enemy, ex- <lb/>
            claiming, “Go I yc once chosen companions of my dangers ; <lb/>
            and when you are asked where I, your general, was left, <lb/>
            tell them this truth,-alone in Boeotia, fighting for us all, <lb/>
            to his own destruction."</p>
          <p>42. The Allemanni, when our cavalry had been thus <lb/>
            driven back and thrown into confusion, attacked the first <lb/>
            line of our infantry, expecting to find their spirit abated, <lb/>
            and to be able to rout them without much resistance.</p>
          <p>43. But when they came to close quarters with them, <lb/>
            they found they had met an equal match. The conflict <lb/>
            lasted long; for the Cornuti and Braccati,l veterans of <note type="footnote">1 Troops named from the fashion of their arms; the Cornuti having <lb/>
            projections like horns on their helmets, the Braccati wearing drawers. </note> <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            great experience in war, frightening even by their ges- <lb/>
            tures, shouted their battle cry, and the uproar, through <lb/>
            the heat of the conflict, rising up from a gentle murmur, <lb/>
            and becoming gradually louder and louder, grew fierce as <lb/>
            that of waves dashing against the rocks; the javelins <lb/>
            hissed as they flew hither and thither through the air; the <lb/>
            dust rose to the sky in one vast cloud, preventing all <lb/>
            possibility of seeing, and causing arms to fall upon arms, <lb/>
            man upon man.</p>
          <p>44. But the barbarians, in their undisciplined anger and <lb/>
            fury, raged like the flames; and with ceaseless blows of <lb/>
            their swords sought to pierce through the compact mass of <lb/>
            the shields with which our soldiers defended themselves, <lb/>
            as with the testudo.1</p>
          <p>45. And when this was seen, the Batavi, with the royal <lb/>
            legion, hastened to the support of their comrades, a for- <lb/>
            midable band, well able, if fortune aided them, to save <lb/>
            even those who were in the extremest danger. And amid <lb/>
            the fierce notes of their trumpets, the battle again raged <lb/>
            with undiminished ferocity.</p>
          <p>46. But the Allemanni, still charging forward impetu- <lb/>
            ously, strove more and more vigorously, hoping to bear <lb/>
            down all opposition by the violence of their fury. Darts, <lb/>
            spears, and javelins never ceased; arrows pointed with <lb/>
            iron were shot; while at the same time, in hand-to-hand <lb/>
            conflict, sword struck sword, breastplates were cloven, and <lb/>
            even the wounded, if not quite exhausted with loss of <lb/>
            blood, rose up still to deeds of greater daring.</p>
          <p>47. In some sense it may be said that the combatants <lb/>
            were equal. The Allemanni were the stronger and the <lb/>
            taller men; our soldiers by great practice were the more <lb/>
            skilful. The one were fierce and savage, the others com- <lb/>
            posed and wary; the one trusted to their courage, the <lb/>
            others to their physical strength.</p>
          <p>48. Often, indeed, the Roman soldier was beaten down <lb/>
            by the weight of his enemy's arms, but he constantly rose <lb/>
            again ; and then, on the other hand, the barbarian, finding <lb/>
            his knees fail under him with fatigue, would rest his left <note type="footnote">1 The testudo was properly applied to the manner in which they <lb/>
            locked their shields over their heads while advancing to storm a walled <lb/>
            town. </note> <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVI. CH. XII </note> <lb/>
            knee on the ground, and even in that position attack his <lb/>
            enemy, an act of extreme obstinacy.</p>
          <p>49. Presently there sprang forward with sudden vigour <lb/>
            a fiery band of nobles, among whom also were the princes of <lb/>
            the petty tribes, and, as the common soldiers followed <lb/>
            them in great numbers, they burst through our lines, and <lb/>
            forced a path for themselves up to the principal legion of <lb/>
            the reserve, which was stationed in the centre, in a posi- <lb/>
            tion called the praetorian camp; and there the soldiery, <lb/>
            being in closer array, and in densely serried ranks, stood <lb/>
            firm as so many towers, and renewed the battle with <lb/>
            increased spirit. And intent upon parrying the blows of <lb/>
            the enemy, and covering themselves with their shields as <lb/>
            the Mirmillos1 do, with their drawn swords wounded <lb/>
            their antagonists in the sides, which their too vehement <lb/>
            impetuosity left unprotected.</p>
          <p>50. And thus the barbarians threw away their lives in <lb/>
            their struggles for victory, while toiling to break the <lb/>
            compact array of our battalions. But still, in spite of <lb/>
            the ceaseless slaughter made among them by the Romans, <lb/>
            whose courage rose with their success, fresh barbarians <lb/>
            succeeded those who fell; and as the frequent groans of <lb/>
            the dying were heard, many became panic-stricken, and <lb/>
            lost all strength.</p>
          <p>51. At last, exhausted by their losses, and having no <lb/>
            strength for anything but flight, they sought to escape <lb/>
            with all speed by different roads, like as sailors and <lb/>
            traders, when the sea rages in a storm, are glad to flee <lb/>
            wherever the wind carries them. But any one then <lb/>
            present will confess that escape was a matter rather to be <lb/>
            wished than hoped for.</p>
          <p>52. And the merciful protection of a favourable deity <lb/>
            was present on our side, so that our soldiers, now slashing <lb/>
            at the backs of the fugitives, and finding their swords so <lb/>
            battered that they were insufficient to wound, used the <lb/>
            enemy's own javelins, and so slew them. Nor could any <lb/>
            one of the pursuers satiate himself enough with their <lb/>
            blood, nor allow his hand to weary with slaughter, nor did <lb/>
            any one spare a suppliant out of pity.</p>
          <p>53. Numbers, therefore, lay on the ground, mortally <note type="footnote">1 The Mirmillo was a gladiator opposed to a Retiarius, proteeting <lb/>
            himself by his oblong shield against the net of the latter. </note> <pb n="119"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            wounded, imploring instant death as a relief; others, half <lb/>
            dead, with failing breath turned their dying eyes to the <lb/>
            last enjoyment of the light. Of some the heads were <lb/>
            almost cut off by the huge weapons, and merely hung by <lb/>
            small strips to their necks; others, again, who had fallen <lb/>
            because the ground had been rendered slippery by the <lb/>
            blood of their comrades, without themselves receiving any <lb/>
            wound, were killed by being smothered in the mass of <lb/>
            those who fell over them.</p>
          <p>54. While these events were proceeding thus prosper- <lb/>
            ously for us, the conquerors pressed on vigorously, though <lb/>
            the edges of their weapons were blunted by frequent use, <lb/>
            and shining helmets and shields were trampled under foot. <lb/>
            At last, in the extremity of their distress, the barbarians, <lb/>
            finding the heaps of corpses block up all the paths, sought <lb/>
            the aid of the river, which was the only hope left to them, <lb/>
            and which they had now reached.</p>
          <p>55. And because our soldiers unweariedly and with <lb/>
            great speed pressed, with arms in their hands, upon the <lb/>
            fleeing bands, many, hoping to be able to deliver them- <lb/>
            selves from danger by their skill in swimming, trusted <lb/>
            their lives to the waves. And Julian, with prompt appre- <lb/>
            hension, seeing what would be the result, strictly forbade <lb/>
            the tribunes and captains to allow any of our men to <lb/>
            pursue them so eagerly as to trust themselves to the dan- <lb/>
            gerous currents of the river.</p>
          <p>56. In consequence of which order they halted on the <lb/>
            brink, and from it wounded the Germans with every kind <lb/>
            of missile ; while, if any of them escaped from death of <lb/>
            that kind by the celerity of their movements, they still <lb/>
            sunk to the bottom from the weight of their own arms.</p>
          <p>57. And as sometimes in a theatrical spectacle the cur- <lb/>
            tain exhibits marvellous figures, so here one could see <lb/>
            many strange things in that danger; some unconsciously <lb/>
            clinging to others who were good swimmers, others <lb/>
            who were floating were pushed off by those less encum- <lb/>
            bered as so many logs, others again, as if the violence of <lb/>
            the stream itself fought against them, were swallowed up <lb/>
            in the eddies. Some supported themselves on their shields, <lb/>
            avoiding the heaviest attacks of the opposing waves by <lb/>
            crossing them in an oblique direction, and so, after many <lb/>
            dangers, reached the opposite brink, till at last the foaming <pb n="120"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVI. CH. XII.</note> <lb/>
            river, discoloured with barbarian blood, was itself amazed <lb/>
            at the unusual increase it had received.</p>
          <p>58. And while this was going on, Chnodomarius, the <lb/>
            king, finding an opportunity of escaping, making his way <lb/>
            over the heaps of dead with a small escort, hastened with <lb/>
            exceeding speed towards the camp which he had made <lb/>
            near the two Roman fortresses of Alstatt and Lauterbourg, in <lb/>
            the country of the Tribocci, that he might embark in some <lb/>
            boats which had already been prepared in case of any <lb/>
            emergency, and so escape to some secret hiding-place in <lb/>
            which he might conceal himself.</p>
          <p>59. And because it was impossible for him to reach his <lb/>
            camp without crossing the Rhine, he hid his face that he <lb/>
            might not be recognized, and after that retreated slowly. <lb/>
            And when he got near the bank of the river, as he was <lb/>
            feeling his way round a marsh, partly overflowed, seeking <lb/>
            some path by which to cross it, his horse suddenly stumbled <lb/>
            in some soft and sticky place, and he was thrown down, <lb/>
            but though he was fat and heavy, he without delay reached <lb/>
            the shelter of a hill in the neighbourhood; there he was <lb/>
            recognized (for indeed he could not conceal who he was, <lb/>
            being betrayed by the greatness of his former fortune) : and <lb/>
            immediately a squadron of cavalry came up at full gallop <lb/>
            with its tribune, and cautiously surrounded the wooded <lb/>
            mound; though they feared to enter the thicket lest they <lb/>
            should fall into any ambuscade concealed among the trees.</p>
          <p>60. But when he saw them he was seized with extreme <lb/>
            terror, and of his own accord eame forth by himself and <lb/>
            surrendered; and his companions, two hundred in number, <lb/>
            and his three most intimate friends, thinking it would be a <lb/>
            crime in them to survive their king, or not to die for him <lb/>
            if occasion required, gave themselves up also as prisoners.</p>
          <p>61. And, as barbarians are naturally low spirited in <lb/>
            adverse fortune, and very much the reverse in moments of <lb/>
            prosperity, so now that be was in the power of another he <lb/>
            became pale and confused, his consciousness of guilt closing <lb/>
            his mouth ; widely different from him who lately, insulting <lb/>
            the ashes of the Gauls with ferocious and lamentable <lb/>
            violence, poured forth savage threats against the whole <lb/>
            empire.</p>
          <p>62. Now after these affairs were thus by the favour of <lb/>
            the deity brought to an end, the victorious soldiers were <pb n="121"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            recalled at the close of the day to their camp by the <lb/>
            signal of the trumpeter, and marched towards the bank of <lb/>
            the Rhine, and there erecting a rampart of shields piled <lb/>
            together in several rows, they refreshed themselves with <lb/>
            food and sleep.</p>
          <p>63. There fell in this battle, of Romans 243, and four <lb/>
            generals: Bainobaudes, the tribune of the Cornuti, and with <lb/>
            him Laipso, and Innocentius, who commanded the cuiras- <lb/>
            siers, and one tribune who had no particular command, <lb/>
            and whose name I forget. But of the Allemanni, there <lb/>
            were found 6000 corpses on the field, and incalculable num- <lb/>
            bers were carried down by the waves of the river.</p>
          <p>64. Then Julian, as one who was now manifestly ap- <lb/>
            proved by fortune, and was also greater in his merit than <lb/>
            even in his authority, was by unanimous acclamation hailed <lb/>
            as Augustus by the soldiers; but he sharply reprove.d them <lb/>
            for so doing, affirming with an oath that he neither wished <lb/>
            for such an honour, nor would accept it.</p>
          <p>65. In order to increase the joy at his recent success, <lb/>
            Julian ordered Chnodomarius to be brought before him at <lb/>
            his council; who at first bowing, and then like a sup- <lb/>
            pliant, prostrating himself on the ground, and imploring <lb/>
            pardon with entreaties framed after the fashion of his <lb/>
            nation, was bidden to take courage.</p>
          <p>66. A few days afterwards he was conducted to the court <lb/>
            of the emperor, and thence he was sent to Rome, where he <lb/>
            died of a lethargy in the foreign camp which is stationed on <lb/>
            Mons Cælius.</p>
          <p>67. Notwithstanding that these numerous and important <lb/>
            events were brought to so happy an issue, some persons in <lb/>
            the palace of Constantius, disparaging Julian in order to <lb/>
            give pleasure to the emperor, in a tone of derision called <lb/>
            him Victorinus, because he, modestly relating how often <lb/>
            he had been employed in leading the army, at the same <lb/>
            time related that the Germans had received many defeats.</p>
          <p>68. They at the same time, by loading the emperor with <lb/>
            empty praises, of which the extravagance was glaringly <lb/>
            conspicuous, so inflated an inherent pride, already beyond <lb/>
            all natural bounds, that he was led to believe that, what- <lb/>
            ever took place in the whole circumference of the earth <lb/>
            was owing to his fortunate auspices.</p>
          <p>69. So that, being inflated by the pompous language of <pb n="122"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVI. CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            his flatterers, he then, and at all subsequent periods, be- <lb/>
            came accustomed in all the edicts which he published to <lb/>
            advance many unfounded statements; assuming, that he <lb/>
            by himself had fought and conquered, when in fact he had <lb/>
            not been present at anything that had happened; often <lb/>
            also asserting that he had raised up the suppliant kings of <lb/>
            conquered nations. For instance, if while he was still in <lb/>
            Italy any of his generals had fought a brilliant campaign <lb/>
            against the Persians, the emperor would write triumphant <lb/>
            letters to the provinces without the slightest mention of <lb/>
            the general throughout its whole length, relating with <lb/>
            odious self-praise how he himself had fought in the front <lb/>
            ranks.</p>
          <p>70. Lastly, edicts of his are still extant, laid up among <lb/>
            the public records of the empire .... relating ....* <lb/>
            and extolling himself to the skies. A letter also is to <lb/>
            be found, though he was forty days' journey from Stras- <lb/>
            burg when the battle was fought, describing the engage- <lb/>
            ment, saying that he marshalled the army, stood among <lb/>
            the standard-bearers, and put the barbarians to the rout; <lb/>
            and with amazing falsehood asserting that Chnodomarius <lb/>
            was brought before him, without (oh shameful indignity!) <lb/>
            saying a single word about the exploits of Julian; which <lb/>
            he would have utterly buried in oblivion if fame had not <lb/>
            refused to let great deeds die, however many people may <lb/>
            try to keep them in the shade. <note type="footnote"> * The text is mutilated here, as in many other passages similarly <lb/>

          <p>I. Julian crosses the Rhine and plunders and burns the towns of the <lb/>
            Allemanni, repairs the fortress of Trajan, and grants the barbarians <lb/>
            a truce for ten months.—II. He hems in six hundred Franks <lb/>
            who are devastating the second Germania, and starves them into <lb/>
            surrender.—III. He endeavours to relieve the Gauls from some <lb/>
            of the tribute which weighs them down.—IV. By order of the <lb/>
            Emperor Constantius an obelisk is erected at Rome in the Circus <lb/>
            Maximus ;-some observations on obelisks and on hiroglyphies.- <lb/>
            V. Constantius and Sapor, king of the Persians, by means of <lb/>
            ambassadors and letters, enter into a vain negotiation for peace.- <lb/>
            VI. The Nethargi, an Alleman tribe, are defeated in the Tyrol, <lb/>
            which they were laying waste.-VII. Nicomedia is destroyed by <lb/>
            an earthquake; some observations on earthquakes—VIII. Julian <lb/>
            receives the surrender of the Salii, a Frankish tribe. He defeats <lb/>
            one body of the Chamari, takes another body prisoners, and grants <lb/>
            peace to the rest.-IX. He repairs three forts on the Mouse that <lb/>
            had been destroyed by the barbarians. His soldiers suffer from <lb/>
            want, and become discontented and reproachful.—X. Surmarius <lb/>
            and Hortarius, kings of. the Allemanni, surrender their prisoners <lb/>
            and obtain peace from Julian.-XI. Julian, after his successes in <lb/>
            Gaul, is disparaged at the court of Constantius by enviers of his <lb/>
            fame, and is spoken of as inactive and cowardly.-XII. The <lb/>
            Emperor Constantius compels the Sarmatians to give hostage, and <lb/>
            to restore their prisoners; and imposes a king on the Sarmatian <lb/>
            exiles, whom he restores to their country and to freedom.-XIII. He <lb/>
            compels the Limigantes, after defeating them with great slaughter, <lb/>
            to emigrate, and harangues his own soldiers.-XIV. The Roman <lb/>
            ambassadors, who had been sent to treat for peace, return from <lb/>
            Persia ; and Sapor returns into Armenia and Mesopotamia.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER the various affairs which we have described <lb/>
            were brought to a conclusion, the warlike young prince, <lb/>
            now that the battle of Strasburg had secured him the na- <lb/>
            vigation of the Rhine, felt anxious that the ill-omened <pb n="124"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH. I </note> <lb/>
            birds should not feed on the corpscs of the slain, and so <lb/>
            ordered them all to be buried without distinction. And <lb/>
            having dismissed the ambassadors whom we have men- <lb/>
            tioned as having come with some arrogant messages before <lb/>
            the battle, he returned to Saverne.</p>
          <p>2. From this place he ordered all the booty and the <lb/>
            prisoners to be brought to Metz, to be left there till his <lb/>
            return. Then departing for Mayence, to lay down a bridge <lb/>
            at that city and to seek the barbarians in their own terri- <lb/>
            tories, since he had left none of them in arms, he was at <lb/>
            first met by great opposition on the part of his army; but <lb/>
            addressing them with eloquence and persuasion he soon <lb/>
            won them to his opinion. For their affection for him, be- <lb/>
            coming strengthened by repeated experience, induced them <lb/>
            to follow one who shared in all their toils, and who, while <lb/>
            never surrendering his authority, was still accustomed, as <lb/>
            every one saw, to impose more labour on himself than on <lb/>
            his men. They soon arrived at the appointed spot, and, <lb/>
            crossing the river by a bridge they laid down, occupied <lb/>
            the territory of the enemy..</p>
          <p>3. The barbarians, amazed at the greatness of his enter- <lb/>
            prise, inasmuch as they had fancied they were situated in <lb/>
            a position in which they could hardly be disturbed, were <lb/>
            now led by the destruction of their countrymen to think <lb/>
            anxiously of their own future fate, and accordingly, pre- <lb/>
            tending to implore peace that they might escape from the <lb/>
            violence of his first invasion, they sent ambassadors to him <lb/>
            with a set message, offering a lasting treaty of agreement; <lb/>
            but (though it is not known what design or change of <lb/>
            circumstances altered their purpose) they immediately <lb/>
            afterwards sent off some others with all speed, to threaten <lb/>
            our troops with implacable war if they did not at once quit <lb/>
            their territories.</p>
          <p>4. And when this was known, the Cæsar, as soon as all <lb/>
            was quiet, at the beginning of night embarked 800 men in <lb/>
            some small swift boats, with the intention that they should <lb/>
            row with all their strength up stream for some distance, <lb/>
            and then land and destroy all they could find with fire <lb/>
            and sword.</p>
          <p>5. After he had made this arrangement, the barbarians <lb/>
            were seen at daybreak on the tops of the mountains, on <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            which our soldiers were led with speed to the higher <lb/>
            ground; and when no enemy was found there (since the <lb/>
            barbarians, divining their plan, immediately retreated to <lb/>
            a distance), presently large volumes of smoke were seen, <lb/>
            which indicated that our men had broken into the enemy's <lb/>
            territory, and were laying it waste.</p>
          <p>6. This event broke the spirit of the Germans, who, de- <lb/>
            serting the ambuscades which they had laid for our men <lb/>
            in narrow defiles full of lurking-places, they fled across <lb/>
            the river Maine to carry aid to their countrymen.</p>
          <p>7. For, as is often the case in times of uncertainty and <lb/>
            difficulty, they were panic-stricken by the incursion of our <lb/>
            cavalry on the one side, and the sudden attacks of our <lb/>
            infantry, conveyed in boats, on the other; and therefore, <lb/>
            relying on their knowledge of the country, they sought <lb/>
            safety in the rapidity of their flight; and, as their retreat <lb/>
            left the motions of our troops free, we plundcred the <lb/>
            wealthy farms of their crops and their cattle, sparing no <lb/>
            one. And having carried off a number of prisoners, we <lb/>
            set fire to, and burnt to the ground all their houses, which <lb/>
            in that district were built more carefully than usual, in <lb/>
            the Roman fashion.</p>
          <p>. 8. And when we had penetrated a distance of ten miles, <lb/>
            till we came near a wood terrible from the denseness of its <lb/>
            shade, our army halted for a while, and stayed its advance, <lb/>
            having learnt from information given by a deserter that <lb/>
            a number of enemies were concealed in some subterranean <lb/>
            passages and caverns with many entrances in the neigh- <lb/>
            bourhood, ready to sally forth when a favourable oppor- <lb/>
            tunity should appear.</p>
          <p>9. Nevertheless our men presently ventured to advance <lb/>
            in full confidence, and found the roads blockaded by oaks, <lb/>
            ashes, and pines, of great size, cut down and laid together. <lb/>
            And so they retreated with caution, perceiving that it was <lb/>
            impossible to advance except by long and rugged defilcs ; <lb/>
            though they could hardly restrain their indignation at <lb/>
            being compelled to do so.</p>
          <p>10. The weather too became very sever e, so that they <lb/>
            were enveloped in all kinds of toil and danger to no pur- <lb/>
            pose (forasmuch as it was now past the autumnal equinox, <lb/>
            and the snow, which had already fallen in those regions, <lb/>
            covered the mountains and the plains), and so, instead of <pb n="126"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVII. CH. I. </note> <lb/>
            proceeding, Julian undertook a work worthy of being <lb/>
            related.</p>
          <p>11. He repaired with great expedition, while there was <lb/>
            no one to hinder him, the fortress which Trajan had con- <lb/>
            structed in the territory of the Allemanni, and to which <lb/>
            he had given his own name, and which had lately been <lb/>
            attacked with great violence and almost destroyed. And <lb/>
            he placed there a temporary garrison, and also some maga- <lb/>
            zines, which he had collected from the barbarians.</p>
          <p>12. But when the Allemanni saw these preparations <lb/>
            made for their destruction, they assembled rapidly in great <lb/>
            consternation at what had already been done, and sent <lb/>
            ambassadors to implore peace, with prayers of extreme <lb/>
            humility. And the Cæsar, now that he had fully matured <lb/>
            and secured the success of all his designs, taking into con- <lb/>
            sideration all probabilities, granted them a truce for ten <lb/>
            months. In reality he was especially influenced by this <lb/>
            prudent consideration, that the camp which lie had thus <lb/>
            occupied without hindrance, in a way that could hardly <lb/>
            have been hoped for, required, nevertheless, to be fortified <lb/>
            with mural engines and other adequate equipments.</p>
          <p>13. Trusting to this trace, three of the most ferocious <lb/>
            of those kings who had sent reinforcements to their <lb/>
            countrymen when defeated at Strasburg, came to him, <lb/>
            though still in some degree of alarm, and took the oaths <lb/>
            according to the formula in use in their country, that they <lb/>
            would create no further disturbance, but that they would <lb/>
            keep the truce faithfully up to the appointed day, because <lb/>
            that had been the decision of our generals ; and that they <lb/>
            would not attack the fortress; and that they would even <lb/>
            bring supplies to it on their shoulders if the garrison <lb/>
            informed them that they were in want; all which they <lb/>
            -promised, because their fear bridled their treachery.</p>
          <p>14. In this memorable war, which deserves to be com- <lb/>
            pared with those against the Carthaginians or the Gauls, <lb/>
            yet was accompanied with very little loss to the republic, <lb/>
            Julian triumphed as a fortunate and successful leader. <lb/>
            The very smallness of his losses might have given some <lb/>
            colour to the assertions of his detractors, who declared <lb/>
            that he had only fought bravely on all occasions, because <lb/>
            he preferred dying gloriously to being put to death like <lb/>
            his brother Gallus, as a condemned malefactor, as they had <pb n="127"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            expected he would be, if he had not, after the death of <lb/>
            Constantius, continued to distinguish himself equally by <lb/>
            splendid exploits.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. Now when everything was settled in that country as <lb/>
            fairly as the case permitted, Julian, returning to his winter <lb/>
            quarters, found some trouble still left for him. Severus, <lb/>
            the master of the horse, being on the way to Rheims through <lb/>
            Cologne and Juliers, fell in with some strong battalions of <lb/>
            Franks, consisting of six hundred light-armed soldiers, who <lb/>
            were laying waste those places which were not defended <lb/>
            by garrisons. They had been encouraged to this audacious <lb/>
            wickedness by the opportunity afforded them when the <lb/>
            Cæsar was occupied in the remote districts of the Alle- <lb/>
            manni, thinking to obtain a rich booty without any hin- <lb/>
            drance. But in fear of the army which had now returned, <lb/>
            they occupied two fortresses which had been abandoned <lb/>
            for some time, and defended themselves there as long as <lb/>
            they could.</p>
          <p>2. Julian, amazed at the novelty of such an attempt, and <lb/>
            thinking it impossible to say how far such a spirit would <lb/>
            spread if he allowed it to pass without a check, halted <lb/>
            his soldiers, and gave orders to blockade the forts.... <lb/>
            The Meuse passes beneath them; and the blockade was <lb/>
            protracted for fifty-four days, through nearly the entire <lb/>
            months of December and January, the barbarians resisting <lb/>
            with incredible obstinacy and courage.</p>
          <p>3. Then the Cæsar, like an experienced general, fearing <lb/>
            that the barbarians might take advantage of some moonless <lb/>
            night to cross over the river, which was now thoroughly <lb/>
            frozen, ordered soldiers to go up and down the stream <lb/>
            every day in light boats, from sunset till daybreak, so as to <lb/>
            break the crust of ice and prevent any one from escaping <lb/>
            in that manner. Owing to this manoeuvre, the barbarians <lb/>
            were so exhausted by hunger, watching, and the extremity <lb/>
            of despair, that at last they voluntarily surrendered, and <lb/>
            were immediately sent to the court of the emperor.</p>
          <p>4. And a vast multitude of Franks, who had come to <lb/>
            their assistance, hearing that they were taken prisoners and <lb/>
            sent off, would not venture on any further enterprise, but <lb/>
            returned to their own country. And when this affair <pb n="128"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK XVII. CH. III. </note> <lb/>
            was finished, the Cæsar retired to Paris to pass the winter <lb/>
            there.</p>

          <p>§ 1. IT was now expected that a number of tribes would <lb/>
            unite in greater force, and therefore the prudent Julian, <lb/>
            bearing in mind the uncertainties of war, became very <lb/>
            anxious and full of care. And as he thought that the <lb/>
            truce lately made, though not free from trouble, and not <lb/>
            of long duration, still gave him opportunity to remedy <lb/>
            some things which were faulty, he began to remodel the <lb/>
            arrangements about tribute.</p>
          <p>2. And when Florentius, the prefect of the prætorium, <lb/>
            having taken an estimate of everything, affirmed that <lb/>
            whatever deficiency there might be in the produce of a <lb/>
            capitation tax he should be able to make good from what <lb/>
            he could levy by force, Julian, deprecating this prac- <lb/>
            tice, determined to loso his own life rather than permit <lb/>
            it.</p>
          <p>3. For he knew that the wounds inflicted by sueh ex- <lb/>
            tortions, or, as I should rather call them, confiscations, are <lb/>
            incurable, and have often reduced provinces to extreme <lb/>
            destitution. Indeed, sueh conduct, as will be related here- <lb/>
            after, utterly lost us Illyricum.</p>
          <p>4. And when, owing to this resolution of his, the <lb/>
            prætorian prefect exclaimed that it could not be endured <lb/>
            that he, to whom the emperor had intrusted the chief <lb/>
            authority in this matter, should be thus distrusted, Julian <lb/>
            attempted to appease him, showing by exact and accurate <lb/>
            calculations that the capitation tax was not only enough, <lb/>
            but more than enough to provide all the necessary <lb/>
            supplies.</p>
          <p>5. And when some time afterwards an edict for a <lb/>
            supplementary tax was nevertheless presented to him by <lb/>
            Florentius, he refused to sign or even to read it; and <lb/>
            threw it on the ground; and when warned by letters <lb/>
            from the emperor (written on receiving the prefect's <lb/>
            report) not to act in so embarrassing a manner, lest he <lb/>
            should seem to be diminishing the authority of Florentius, <lb/>
            Julian wrote in answer, that it was a matter to be <lb/>
            thankful for, if a province that had been devastated in <lb/>
            every direction could still pay its regular taxes, without <pb n="129"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            demanding from it any extraordinary contributions, which <lb/>
            indeed no punishments could extort from men in a state of <lb/>
            destitution : and then, and from that time forward, owing <lb/>
            to the firmness of one man, no one ever attempted to extort <lb/>
            anything illegal in Gaul beyond the regular taxes.</p>
          <p>G. The Caesar had also in another affair set an example <lb/>
            wholly unprecedented, entreating the prefect to intrust <lb/>
            to him the government of the second Belgic province, <lb/>
            which was oppressed by manifold evils; on the especial <lb/>
            and single condition that no officer, either belonging to the <lb/>
            prefect or to the garrison, should force any one to pay <lb/>
            anything. And the whole people whom he thus took <lb/>
            under his care, comforted and relieved by this mildness, <lb/>
            paid all the taxes due from them before the appointed day, <lb/>
            without any demand being made upon them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHILE Julian was thus beginning to put Gaul into <lb/>
            a better condition, and while Orfitus was still governor of <lb/>
            the second province, an obelisk was erected at Rome, in <lb/>
            the Circus Maximus, concerning which, as this seems a <lb/>
            convenient opportunity, I will mention a few particulars.</p>
          <p>2. The city of Thebes, in Egypt, built in remote ages, <lb/>
            with enormous walls, and celebrated also for entrances by <lb/>
            a hundred gates, was from this circumstance called by its <lb/>
            founders <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκατόμπλος</foreign> (Hecatompylos); and from the name of <lb/>
            this city the whole district is known as Thebais.</p>
          <p>.3. When Carthage began to rise in greatness, the Cartha- <lb/>
            ginian generals conquered and destroyed Thebes by a <lb/>
            sudden attack. And after it was rebuilt, Cambyses, the <lb/>
            celebrated king of Persia, who throughout his whole life <lb/>
            was covetous and ferocious, overran Egypt, and again <lb/>
            attacked this city that he might plunder it of its wealth, <lb/>
            which was enough to excite his envy; and. he spared not <lb/>
            even the offerings which had been made to the gods.</p>
          <p>4. And while he was in his savage manner moving to <lb/>
            and fro among his plunderers, he got entangled in his own <lb/>
            flowing robes, and fell on his face, and by the fall his <lb/>
            dagger, which he wore close to his thigh, got loose from <lb/>
            the scabbard, and he was mortally wounded and died.,</p>
          <p>5. And long afterwards, Cornelius Gallus, who was govcr <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK XVII. CH. IV. </note> <lb/>
            nor of Egypt at the time when Octavianus was emperor of <lb/>
            Rome, impoverished the city by plundering it of most of <lb/>
            its treasuries; and returning to Rome on being accused of <lb/>
            theft and of laying waste the province, he, from fear of the <lb/>
            nobles, who were bitterly indignant against him, as one to <lb/>
            whom the emperor had committed a most honourable task, <lb/>
            fell on his own sword and so died. If I mistake not, he is <lb/>
            the same person as Gallus the poet, whose loss Virgil de- <lb/>
            plores at the end of his Bucolics, celebrating his memory <lb/>
            in sweet verses.</p>
          <p>6. In this city of Thebes, among many works of art and <lb/>
            different structures recording the tales relating to the <lb/>
            Egyptian deities, we saw several obelisks in their places, <lb/>
            and others which had been thrown down and broken; <lb/>
            which the ancient kings, when elated at some victory or <lb/>
            at the general prosperity of their affairs, had caused to be <lb/>
            hewn out of mountains in distant parts of the world, and <lb/>
            erected in honour of the gods, to whom they solemnly <lb/>
            consecrated them.</p>
          <p>7. Now an obelisk is a rough stone, rising to a great <lb/>
            height, shaped like a pillar in the stadium ; and it tapers <lb/>
            upwards in imitation of a sunbeam, keeping its quadri- <lb/>
            lateral shape, till it rises almost to a point, being made <lb/>
            smooth by the hand of a sculptor</p>
          <p>8. On these obelisks the ancient authority of elementary <lb/>
            wisdom has caused innumerable marks of strange forms <lb/>
            all over them, which are called hieroglyphics.</p>
          <p>9. For the workmen, carving many kinds of birds and <lb/>
            beasts, some even such as must belong to another world, in <lb/>
            order that the recollection of the exploits which the obelisk <lb/>
            was designed to commemorate might reach to subsequent <lb/>
            ages, showed by them the accomplishment of vows which <lb/>
            the kings had made.</p>
          <p>10. For it was not the case then as it is now, that the <lb/>
            established number of letters can distinctly express what- <lb/>
            ever the human mind conceives; nor did the ancient Egyp- <lb/>
            tians write in such a manner; but each separate character <lb/>
            served for a separate noun or verb, and sometimes even <lb/>
            for an entire sense.</p>
          <p>11. Of which fact the two following may for the present <lb/>
            be sufficient instances: by the figure of a vulture they <lb/>
            indicate the name of nature; because naturalists declaie <pb n="131"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 357.] </note> <lb/>
            that no males are found in this class of bird. And by the <lb/>
            figure of a bee making honey they indicate a king; show- <lb/>
            ing by such a sign that stings as well as sweetness are <lb/>
            the characteristics of a ruler; and there are many similar <lb/>
            emblems.</p>
          <p>12. And because the flatterers, who were continually <lb/>
            whispering into the ear of Constantius, kept always affirm- <lb/>
            ing that when Augustus Octavianus had brought two obe- <lb/>
            lisks from Heliopolis, a city of Egypt, one of which was <lb/>
            placed in the Circus Maximus, and the other in the Campus <lb/>
            Martius, he yet did not venture to touch or move this <lb/>
            one which has just been brought to Rome, being alarmed <lb/>
            at the greatness of such a task; I would have those, who <lb/>
            do not know the truth, learn that the ancient emperor, <lb/>
            though he moved several obelisks, left this one untouched, <lb/>
            because it was especially dedicated to the Sun-god, and <lb/>
            was set up within the precincts of his magnificent temple, <lb/>
            which it was impious to profane; and of which it was the <lb/>
            most conspicuous ornament.</p>
          <p>13. But Constantine deeming that a consideration of no <lb/>
            importance, had it torn up from its place, and thinking <lb/>
            rightly that he should not be offering any insult to religion <lb/>
            if he removed a splendid work from some other temple to <lb/>
            dedicate it to the gods at Rome, which is the temple of the <lb/>
            whole world, let it lie on the ground for some time while <lb/>
            arrangements for its removal were being prepared. And <lb/>
            when it had been carried down the Nile, and landed at <lb/>
            Alexandria, a ship of a burden hitherto unexampled, re- <lb/>
            quiring three hundred rowers to propel it, was built to <lb/>
            receive it.</p>
          <p>14. And when these preparations were made, and after <lb/>
            the aforenamed emperor had died, the enterprise began <lb/>
            to cool. However, after a time it was at last put on board <lb/>
            ship, and conveyed over sea, and up the stream of the <lb/>
            Tiber, which seemed as it were frightened, lest its own <lb/>
            winding waters should hardly be equal to conveying a <lb/>
            present from the almost unknown Nile to the walls which <lb/>
            itself cherished. At last the obelisk reached the village <lb/>
            of Alexandria, three miles from the city; and then it was <lb/>
            placed in a cradle, and drawn slowly on, and brought <lb/>
            through the Ostran gate and the public fish-market to the <lb/>
            Circus Maximus. <pb n="132"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> (BK. XVII. CH. IV. </note> 15. The only work remaining to be done was to raise it, <lb/>
            which was generally believed to be hardly, if at all, practi- <lb/>
            cable. And vast beams having been raised on end in a <lb/>
            most dangerous manner, so that they looked like a grove <lb/>
            of machines, long ropes of huge size were fastened to <lb/>
            them, darkening the very sky with their density, as they <lb/>
            formed a web of innumerable threads ; and into them the <lb/>
            great stone itself,. covered over as it was with elements of <lb/>
            writing, was bound, and gradually raised into the empty <lb/>
            air, and long suspended, many thousands of men turning it <lb/>
            round and round like a millstone, till it was at last placed <lb/>
            in the middle of the square; and on it was placed a <lb/>
            brazen sphere, made brighter with plates of gold: and as <lb/>
            that was immediately afterwards struck by lightning, and <lb/>
            destroyed, a brazen figure like a torch was placed on it, <lb/>
            also plated with gold-to look as if the torch were fully <lb/>
            alight.</p>
          <p>16. Subsequent ages also removed other obelisks; one <lb/>
            of which is in the Vatican, a second in the garden of <lb/>
            Sallust: and two in the monument of Augustus.</p>
          <p>17. But the writing which is engraven on the old <lb/>
            obelisk in the Circus, we have set forth below in Greek <lb/>
            characters, following in this the work of Hermapion:— <lb/>

            this interpretation—“ The Sun to Ramestes the king—I <lb/>
            have given to thee to reign with joy over the whole <lb/>

          <p>19. The second line is-,, The mighty Apollo, who <lb/>

            has honoured Egypt by becoming its master, adorning <lb/>

            having greatly honoured the gods who have their shrines <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. IN the consulship of Datianus and Cerealis, when all <lb/>
            arrangements in Gaul were made with more careful zeal <lb/>
            than before, and while the terror caused by past events <pb n="134"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            still cl.ecked the outbreaks of the barbarians, the king of <lb/>
            the Persians, being still on the frontiers of those nations <lb/>
            which border on his dominions, and having made a treaty <lb/>
            of alliance with the Chionitæ and the Gelani, the most <lb/>
            warlike and indefatigable of all tribes, being about to <lb/>
            return to his own country, received the letters of Tamsapor <lb/>
            which announced to him that the Roman emperor was a <lb/>
            suppliant for peace.</p>
          <p>2. And he, suspecting that Constantius would never <lb/>
            have done so if the empire had not been weakened all over, <lb/>
            raised his own pretensions, and embracing the name indeed <lb/>
            of peace, offered very unwelcome conditions. And having <lb/>
            sent a man of the name of l'arses as ambassador with many <lb/>
            presents, he gave him letters to Constantius, in which he in <lb/>
            no respect abated of his natural pride. The purport of <lb/>
            these letters we have understood to be this :-</p>
          <p>3. " I, Sapor, king of kings, partner of the stars, brother <lb/>
            of the sun and moon, to Constantius Cæsar my brother send <lb/>
            much greeting. I am glad and am well pleased that at <lb/>
            last thou hast returned to the right way, and hast acknow- <lb/>
            ledged the incorruptible decree of equity, having gained <lb/>
            experience by facts, and having learnt what disasters an <lb/>
            obstinate covetousness of the property of others has often <lb/>
            caused.</p>
          <p>4. " Because therefore the language of truth ought to be <lb/>
            unrestrained and free, and because men in the highest <lb/>
            rank ought only to say what they mean, I will reduce my <lb/>
            propositions into a few words; remembering that I have <lb/>
            already often repeated what I am now about to say.</p>
          <p>5. “Even your own ancient records bear witness that <lb/>
            my ancestors possessed all the country up to the Strymon <lb/>
            and the frontier of Macedonia. And these lands it is <lb/>
            fitting that I who (not to speak arrogantly) am superior <lb/>
            to those ancient kings in magnificence, and in all eminent <lb/>
            virtues, should now reclaim. But I am at all times <lb/>
            thoughtful to remember that, from my earliest youth, I <lb/>
            have never done anything to repent of.</p>

            Armenia and Mesopotamia, which were wrested from my <lb/>
            ancestor by deliberate treachery. That principle was <lb/>
            never admitted by us which you with exultation assert, <lb/>

            sidering whether they were achieved by valour or by <lb/>
            treachery.</p>
          <p>7. “ Lastly, if you are willing to be guided by one who <lb/>
            gives you good advice, I would bid you despise a small <lb/>
            part of your dominions which is ever the parent of <lb/>
            sorrow and bloodshed, in order to reign in safety over the <lb/>

            apply cautery or amputation, and cut off portions of the <lb/>
            body that the patient may have good use of the rest of <lb/>
            his limbs. Nay, that even beasts do the same: since <lb/>
            when they observe on what account they are most espe- <lb/>
            cially hunted, they will of their own accord deprive them- <lb/>
            selves of that, in order henceforth to be able to live in <lb/>
            security.</p>
          <p>8. “ This, in short, I declare, that should my present <lb/>
            embassy return without having succeeded in its object, <lb/>
            after giving the winter season to rest I will gird myself up <lb/>
            with all my strength, and while fortune and justice give <lb/>
            me a well-founded hope of ultimate success, I will hasten <lb/>
            my march as much as Providence will permit."</p>
          <p>9. Having given long consideration to this letter, the <lb/>
            emperor with upright and wise heart, as the saying is, <lb/>
            made answer in this manner :-</p>
          <p>10. “ Constantius, always august, conqueror by land and <lb/>
            sea, to my brother Sapor much health. I congratulate <lb/>
            thee on thy safety, as one who is willing to be a friend to <lb/>
            thee if thou wilt. But I greatly blame thy insatiable <lb/>
            covetousness, now more grasping than ever.</p>
          <p>11. “ Thou demandest Mesopotamia as thine own, and <lb/>
            then Armenia. And thou biddest me cut off some members <lb/>
            from my sound body in order to place its health on a <lb/>
            sound footing: a demand which is to be rejected at once <lb/>
            rather than to be encouraged by any consent. Receive <lb/>
            therefore the truth, not covered with any pretences, but <lb/>
            clear, and not to be shaken by any threats.</p>
          <p>12. “ The prefect of my praetorian guard, thinking to <lb/>
            undertake an affair which might be beneficial to the state, <lb/>
            without my knowledge discoursed about peace with thy <lb/>
            generals, by the agency of some low persons. Peace we <lb/>
            should neither regret nor refuse-let it only come with <lb/>
            credit and honour, in such a way as to impair neither our <lb/>
            self-respect nor our dignity. <pb n="136"/>

            any of its objects; and indeed no other reply could be <lb/>
            given to the unbridled covetousness of the king. And a <lb/>
            few days afterwards, Count Prosper followed, and Spectatus <lb/>
            the tribune and secretary; and also, by the suggestion of <lb/>
            Musonianus, Eustathius the philosopher, as one skilful in <lb/>

            presents, with a view to induce Sapor to suspend his pre- <lb/>

          <p>3. In this battle Nevita, who afterwards became consul, <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. THIS year also some terrible earthquakes took place in <lb/>
            Macedonia, Asia Minor, and Pontus, and their repeated <lb/>
            shocks overthrew many towns, and even mountains. But <lb/>
            the most remarkable of all the manifold disasters which <lb/>
            they caused was the entire ruin of Nicomedia, the metro- <lb/>
            polis of Bithynia ; which I will here relate with truth and <lb/>
            brevity.</p>
          <p>2. On the 23rd of August, at daybreak, some heavy black <lb/>
            clouds suddenly obscured the sky, which just before was <lb/>
            quite fair. And the sun was so wholly concealed that it <lb/>
            was impossible to see what was near or even quite close, <lb/>
            so completely did a thick lurid darkness settle on the <lb/>
            ground, preventing the least use of the eyes.</p>
          <p>3. Presently, as if the supreme deity were himself <lb/>
            letting loose his fatal wrath, and stirring up the winds <lb/>
            from their hinges, a violent raging storm descended, by <lb/>
            the fury of which the groaning mountains were struck, <lb/>
            and the crash of the waves on the shore was heard to a <lb/>
            vast distance. And then followed typhoons and whirlwinds <lb/>
            with a horrid trembling of the earth, throwing down <lb/>
            the whole city and its suburbs.</p>
          <p>4. And as most of the houses were built on the slopes of <lb/>
            the hills, they now fell down one over the other, while all <lb/>
            around resounded with the vast crash of their fall. In <lb/>
            the mean time the tops of the hills re-echoed all sorts of <lb/>
            noises, as well as outcries of men seeking their wives and <lb/>
            children, and other relations.</p>
          <p>5. At last, after two hours, or at least within three, <lb/>
            the air became again clear and serene, and disclosed <lb/>
            the destruction which till then was unseen. Some, <lb/>
            overwhelmed by the enormous masses of ruins which had <lb/>
            fallen upon them, were crushed to death. Some were <pb n="138"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVII. CH. VII. </note> <lb/>
            buried up to the neck, and might have been saved if there <lb/>
            had been any timely help at hand, but perished for want of <lb/>
            assistance ; others were transfixed by the points of beams <lb/>
            projecting forth, on which they hung suspended.</p>
          <p>6. Here was seen a crowd of persons slain by one blow; <lb/>
            there a promiscuous heap of corpses piled in various ways <lb/>
            -some were buried beneath the roofs of falling houses, <lb/>
            which leant over so as to protect them from any actual <lb/>
            blows, but reserved them for an agonizing death by starva- <lb/>
            tion. Among whom was Aristænetus, who, with the <lb/>
            authority of deputy, governed Bithynia, which had been <lb/>
            recently erected into a province; and to which Constantius <lb/>
            had given the name of Piety, in honour of his wife Eusebia, <lb/>
            (a Greek word, equivalent to Pietas in Latin); and he <lb/>
            perished thus by a lingering death.</p>
          <p>7. Others who were overwhelmed by the sudden fall of <lb/>
            vast buildings, are still lying entombed beneath the im- <lb/>
            movable masses. Some with their skulls fractured, or <lb/>
            their shoulders or legs cut through, lay between life and <lb/>
            death, imploring aid from others suffering equally with <lb/>
            themselves; but in spite of their entreaties they were <lb/>
            abandoned.</p>
          <p>8. Not but what the greater part of the temples and <lb/>
            buildings and of the citizens also would have escaped <lb/>
            unhurt, if a fire had not suddenly broken out, which <lb/>
            raged with great violence for fifty days and nights, and <lb/>
            destroyed all that remained.</p>
          <p>9. I think this a good opportunity to enumerate a few of <lb/>
            the conjectures which the ancients have formed about <lb/>
            earthquakes. For as to any accurate knowledge of their <lb/>
            causes, not only has that never been attained by the <lb/>
            ignorance of the common people, but they have equally <lb/>
            eluded the long lucubrations and subtle researches of <lb/>
            natural philosophers.</p>
          <p>10. And on this account in all priestly ceremonies, <lb/>
            whether ritual or pontifical, care is taken not at such <lb/>
            times to name one god more than another, for fear of <lb/>
            impiety, since it is quite uncertain which god causes these <lb/>
            visitations.</p>
          <p>11. But as the various opinions, among which Aristotle <lb/>
            wavers and hesitates, suggest, earthquakes are engendered <lb/>
            either in small caverns under the earth, which the Greeks <pb n="139"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            call <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύριγγες</foreign>, because of the waters pouring through them <lb/>
            with a more rapid motion than usual, or, as Anaxagoras <lb/>
            affirms, they arise from the force of the wind penetrating <lb/>
            the lower parts of the earth, which, when they have got <lb/>
            down to the encrusted solid mass, finding no vent-holes, <lb/>
            shake those portions in their solid state, into which they <lb/>
            have got entrance when in a state of solution. And this <lb/>
            is corroborated by the observation that at such times no <lb/>
            breezes of wind are felt by us above ground, because the <lb/>
            winds are occupied in the lowest recesses of the earth.</p>
          <p>12. Anaximander says that the earth when burnt up by <lb/>
            excessive heat and drought, and also after excessive rains, <lb/>
            opens larger fissures than usual, which the upper air pene- <lb/>
            trates with great force and in excessive quantities, and the <lb/>
            earth, shaken by the furious blasts which penetrate those <lb/>
            fissures, is disturbed to its very foundations; for which <lb/>
            reason these fearful events occur either at times of great <lb/>
            evaporation or else at those of an extravagant fall of rain <lb/>
            from heaven. And therefore the ancient poets and theo- <lb/>
            logians gave Neptune the name of Earthshaker,1 as being <lb/>
            the power of moist substance.</p>
          <p>13. Now earthquakes take place in four manners: <lb/>
            either they are brasmatiœ,2 which raise up the ground in a <lb/>
            terrible manner, and throw vast masses up to the surface, <lb/>
            as in Asia, Delos arose, and Hiera; and also Anaphe and <lb/>
            Rhodes, which has at different times been called Ophiusa <lb/>
            and Pelagia, and was once watered with a shower of <lb/>
            gold;3 and Eleusis in Boeotia, and the Hellenian islands in <lb/>
            the Tyrrhenian sea, and many other islands. Or they are <lb/>
            climatiœ,4 which, with a slanting and oblique blow, level <lb/>
            cities, edifices, and mountains. Or chasmatiae,5 which sud- <lb/>
            denly, by a violent motion, open huge mouths, and so <lb/>
            swallow up portions of the earth, as in the Atlantic sea, <note type="footnote">1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ενοσίχθων, Σεισίχθων</foreign>, ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εννοσιγδαιος</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑνόθω</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σείω</foreign>, to shake, <lb/>

              up, and in the Crissæan Gulf, Helice and Bura,2 and in <lb/>
              Italy, in the Ciminian district, the town of Saccumum3 was <lb/>
              swallowed up in a deep gulf and hidden in everlasting <lb/>
              darkness. And among these three kinds of earthquakes, <lb/>
              myœmotiœ4 are heard with a threatening roar, when the <lb/>
              elements either spring apart, their joints being broken, or <lb/>
              again resettle in their former places, when the earth also <lb/>
              settles back; for then it cannot be but that crashes and <lb/>
              roars of the earth should resound with bull-like bellowings. <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. CÆSAR, passing his winter among the Paris!!, was <lb/>
            eagerly preparing to anticipate the Allemanni, who were <lb/>
            not yet assembled in one body, but who, since the battle <lb/>
            of Strasburg, were working themselves up to a pitch of <lb/>
            insane audacity and ferocity. And he was waiting with <lb/>
            great impatience for the month of July, when the Gallic <lb/>
            campaigns usually begin. For indeed he could not march <lb/>
            before the summer had banished the frost and cold, and <lb/>
            allowed him to rcceive supplies from Aquitania.</p>
          <p>2. But as diligence overcomes almost all difficulties, he, <lb/>
            revolving many plans of all kinds in his mind, at last con- <lb/>
            ceived the idea of not waiting till the crops were ripe, <lb/>
            but falling on the barbarians before they expccted him. <lb/>
            And having resolved on that plan, he caused his men to <lb/>
            take corn for twenty days' consumption from what they <lb/>
            had in store, and to make it into biscuit, so that it might <lb/>
            keep longer ; and this enabled the soldiers to carry it, <lb/>
            which they did willingly. And relying on this provision, <lb/>
            and setting out as before, with favourable auspices, he <lb/>
            reckoned that in the course of five or six months he might <lb/>
            finish two urgent and indispensable expeditions.</p>
          <p>3. And when all his preparations were made, he first <note type="footnote">1 This is a tale told by Plato in the Timæus (which is believed to <lb/>

            marched against the Franks, that is against that tribe of <lb/>
            them usually called Salii, who some time before had <lb/>
            ventured with great boldness to fix their habitations on the <lb/>
            Roman soil near Toxandria.' But when he had reached <lb/>
            Tongres, he was met by an embassy from this tribe, who <lb/>
            expected still to find him in his winter quarters, offering <lb/>
            him peace on condition of his leaving them unattacked and <lb/>
            unmolested, as if the ground they had seized were right- <lb/>
            fully their own. Julian comprehended the whole affair, <lb/>
            and having given the ambassadors an ambiguous reply, <lb/>
            and also some presents, sent them back again, leaving <lb/>
            them to suppose he would remain in the same place till <lb/>
            they returned.</p>
          <p>4. But the moment they had departed he followed <lb/>
            them, sending Severus along the bank of the river, and <lb/>
            suddenly came upon the whole settlement like a thunder- <lb/>
            bolt ; and availing himself of his victory to make a reason- <lb/>
            able exhibition of clemency, as indeed they met him with <lb/>
            entreaties rather than with resistance, he received the <lb/>
            submission of them and their children.</p>
          <p>5. He then attacked the Chamavi, who had been guilty <lb/>
            of similar audacity, and through the same celerity of move- <lb/>
            ment he slew one portion of them, and another who made <lb/>
            a vigorous resistance he took prisoners, while others who <lb/>
            fled precipitately he allowed to escape unhurt to their <lb/>
            own territories, to avoid exhausting his soldiers with a <lb/>
            long campaign. And when ambassadors were afterwards <lb/>
            sent by them to implore his pardon, and generally to do <lb/>
            what they could for them, when they prostrated them- <lb/>
            selves before him, he granted them peace on condition of <lb/>
            retiring to their own districts without doing any mischief.</p>

          <p>§ 1. EVERYTHING thus succeeding according to his wish, <lb/>
            Julian, always on the watch to establish by every means <lb/>
            in his power the security of the provinces on a solid foun- <lb/>
            dation, determined to put in as good repair as the time <lb/>
            permitted those fortresses erected in a line on the banks of <lb/>
            the Meuse, which some time before had been destroyed by <note type="footnote"> 1 Toxandria was in Belgium, on the Scheldt. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Chamari were a tribe at the mouth of the Rhine. </note> <pb n="142"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH. IX </note> <lb/>
            an attack of the barbarians. And accordingly he desisted <lb/>
            for a while from all other operations, and restored them.</p>
          <p>2. And that he might by a prudent rapidity insure <lb/>
            their safety, he took a part of the seventeen days' pro- <lb/>
            visions, which troops, when going on an expedition, carry <lb/>
            on their backs, and stored in those forts, hoping to replace <lb/>
            what he thus took from the soldiers by seizing the crops <lb/>
            of the Chamavi.</p>
          <p>3. But he was greatly disappointed. For as the crops <lb/>
            were not yet ripe, the soldiers when they had consumed <lb/>
            what they had with them were unable to find food, and <lb/>
            began to utter violent threats against Julian, mingled with <lb/>
            fierce cries and reproaches, calling him Asiatic, Greek, a <lb/>
            cheat, and a fool pretending to be wise. And as it is com- <lb/>
            monly the case among soldiers that some men are found of <lb/>
            remarkable fluency of speech, they poured forth such <lb/>
            harangues as this :—</p>
          <p>4. " Whither are we being dragged, having lost all hope <lb/>
            of good fortune ? We formerly, indeed, suffered terrible <lb/>
            hardships in the snow, and cruel biting frost; but now <lb/>
            (oh, shame!), when we have the fate of the enemy in our <lb/>
            hands, we are wasting away with famine, the most miser- <lb/>
            able of all deaths. Let no one think that we are stirrers up <lb/>
            of tumults; we declare that we are speaking for our very <lb/>
            lives. We do not ask for gold or silver, which it is long <lb/>
            since we have touched or seen, and which are as much <lb/>
            denied to us as if we had been convicted of having en- <lb/>
            countered all our toils and perils in the service of the <lb/>
            enemies of the republic."</p>
          <p>5. And their complaints were just. For after all his <lb/>
            gallant exploits and all his doubtful changes and dangers, <lb/>
            the soldiers were exhausted by his Gallic campaigns, with- <lb/>
            out even receiving either donation or pay from the time that <lb/>
            Julian was sent to take the command; because he himself <lb/>
            had nothing to give, nor would Constantius permit any- <lb/>
            thing to be drawn for that purpose from the treasury, as <lb/>
            had been the custom.</p>
          <p>6. And at a later period it was manifest that this was <lb/>
            owing more to ill-will than to parsimony, because when <lb/>
            Julian had given so me small coin to one of the common <lb/>
            soldiers, who, as was the custom, had asked for some to get <lb/>
            shaved with, he was attacked for it with most insulting <pb n="143"/>
            <note type="margin"> A. D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            calumnies by Gaudentius, the secretary, who had long <lb/>
            remained in Gaul as a spy upon his actions, and whom he <lb/>
            himself subsequently ordered to be put to death, as will be <lb/>
            related in its fitting place.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHEN at length their discontent was appeased by <lb/>
            various kinds of caresses, and when the Rhine had been <lb/>
            crossed by a bridge of boats, which was thrown over it, <lb/>
            Severus, the master of the horse, up to that time a brave <lb/>
            and energetic soldier, suddenly lost all his vigour.</p>
          <p>2. And he who had frequently been used to exhort the <lb/>
            troops, both in bodies and as individuals, to gallant acts, <lb/>
            now seemed a base and timid skulker from battle, as if he <lb/>
            feared the approach of death. As we read in the books of <lb/>
            Tages1 that those who are fated to be soon struck by light- <lb/>
            ning, so lose their senses that they cannot hear thunder, <lb/>
            or even greater noises. And he marched on in a lazy way, <lb/>
            not natural to him, and even threatened with death the <lb/>
            guides, who were leading on the army with a brisk step, if <lb/>
            they would not agree to say that they were wholly igno- <lb/>
            rant of the road any further. So they, fearing his power, <lb/>
            and being forbidden to show the way any more, advanced <lb/>
            no further.</p>
          <p>3. But amid this delay, Suomarius, king of the Alle- <lb/>
            manni, arrived unexpectedly with his suite ; and he who <lb/>
            had formerly been fierce and eager for any injury to the <lb/>
            Romans, was now inclined to regard it as an unexpected <lb/>
            gain to be permitted to retain his former possessions. And <lb/>
            because his looks and his gait showed him to be a sup- <lb/>
            pliant, he was received as a friend, and desired to be of <lb/>
            good cheer. But still he submitted himself to Julian's <lb/>
            discretion, and implored peace on his bended knees. And <lb/>
            peace was granted him, with pardon for the past, on con- <lb/>
            dition of giving up our prisoners and of supplying our <lb/>
            soldiers with food, whenever it was required, receiving, <lb/>
            like any ordinary purveyor, security for payment of what <note type="footnote"> . 1 Tages was an Etruscan, the son, it is said. of a genius, Jovialis, and <lb/>
            grandson of Jupiter, who rose out of the ground as a man named <lb/>
            Tarchon was ploughing near Tarquinii, and instructed the auspices in <lb/>
            divination. Cf. Cic. Div. ii. 23. </note> <pb n="144"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVIL CH. X </note> <lb/>
            he provided. But he was at the same time warned, that if <lb/>
            he did not furnish the required supplies in time he would <lb/>
            be liable to be called in question for his. former hostility.</p>
          <p>5. And that which had been discreetly planned was car- <lb/>
            ried out without hindrance. Julian desiring to reach a <lb/>
            town belonging to another chieftain, named Hortarius, to- <lb/>
            wards which object nothing seemed wanting but guides, <lb/>
            gave orders to Nestica, a tribune of the Scutarii, and to Cha- <lb/>
            riettoa, a man of marvellous courage, to take great pains <lb/>
            to capture a prisoner and to bring him to him. A youth <lb/>
            of the Allemanni was speedily caught and brought before <lb/>
            him, who, on condition of obtaining his freedom, pro- <lb/>
            mised to show the road. The army, following him as its <lb/>
            guide, was soon obstructed by an abattis of lofty trees, <lb/>
            which had been cut down; but by taking long and cir- <lb/>
            cuitous paths, they at last came to the desired spot, and <lb/>
            the soldiers in their rage laid waste the fields with fire, <lb/>
            carried off the cattle and the inhabitants, and slew all who <lb/>
            resisted without mercy.</p>
          <p>6. The king, bewildered at this disaster, seeing the nume- <lb/>
            rous legions, and the remains of his burnt villages, and look- <lb/>
            in- upon the last calamities of fortune as impending over <lb/>
            him, of his own accord implored pardon, promising to do all <lb/>
            that should be commanded him, and binding himself on <lb/>
            oath to restore all his prisoners. For that was the object <lb/>
            about which Julian was the most anxious. But still he <lb/>
            restored only a few, and detained the greater part of them.</p>
          <p>7. When Julian knew this, he was filled with just indig- <lb/>
            nation, and when the king came to receive the customary <lb/>
            presents, the Cæsar refused to release his four companions, <lb/>
            on whose support and fidelity the king principally relied, <lb/>
            till all the prisoners were restored.</p>
          <p>8. But when the king was summoned by the Cæsar to a <lb/>
            conference, looking up at him with trembling eyes, he was <lb/>
            overcome by the aspect of the conqueror, and overwhelmed <lb/>
            by a sense of his own embarrassing condition, and especially <lb/>
            by the compulsion under which he was now (since it was <lb/>
            reasonable that after so many successes of the Romans that <lb/>
            the cities which had been destroyed by the violence of the <lb/>
            barbarians should be rebuilt) to supply waggons and <lb/>
            materials from his own stores and those of his subjects.</p>
          <p>9. And after he had promised to do so, and had bound him- <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            self with an oath to consent to die if he were guilty of any <lb/>
            treachery, he was permitted to return to his own country. <lb/>
            For he could not be compelled to furnish provisions like <lb/>
            Suomarius, because his land had been so utterly laid waste <lb/>
            that nothing could be found on it for him to give.</p>
          <p>10. Thus those kings who were formerly so proud and <lb/>
            accustomed to grow rich by the plunder of our citizens, <lb/>
            were now brought under the Roman yoke; and as if they <lb/>
            had been born and brought up among our tributaries, they <lb/>
            submitted to our commands, though with reluctance. And <lb/>
            when these events were thus brought to a conclusion, the <lb/>
            Cæsar distributed his army among its usual stations, and <lb/>
            returned to his winter quarters.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHEN these transactions presently became known in <lb/>
            the court of Constantius—for the knowledge of them could <lb/>
            not be concealed, since the Cæsar, as if he had been <lb/>
            merely an officer of the emperor's, referred to him on all <lb/>
            occasions-those who had the greatest influence in the <lb/>
            palace, being skilful professors of flattery, turned all Julian's <lb/>
            well-arranged plans and their successful accomplishment <lb/>
            into ridicule; continually uttering such malicious sayings <lb/>
            as this, “ We have had enough of the goat and his victo- <lb/>
            ries sneering at Julian because of his beard, and calling <lb/>
            him a chattering mole, a purple-robed ape, and a Greek <lb/>
            pedant. And pouring forth numbers of sneers of the same <lb/>
            kind, acceptable to the emperor, who liked to hear them, <lb/>
            they endeavoured with shameless speeches to overwhelm <lb/>
            Julian's virtues, slandering him as a lazy, timid, carpet- <lb/>
            knight, and one whose chief care was to set off his exploits <lb/>
            by fine descriptions ; it not being the first time that such <lb/>
            a thing had been done.</p>
          <p>2. For the greatest glory is always exposed to envy. <lb/>
            So we read in respect of the illustrious generals of old, <lb/>
            that, though no fault could be found in them, still the <lb/>
            malignity which found offence in their greatest actions was <lb/>
            constantly inventing false charges and accusations against <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>3. In the same manner Cimon the son of Miltiades, who <lb/>
            destroyed a vast host of the Persians on the Eurymedon, a <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            river in Pamphylia, and compelled a nation always insolent <lb/>
            and arrogant to beg for peace most humbly, was accused <lb/>
            of intemperance; and again Scipio Æmilianus, by whose <lb/>
            indomitable vigilance two1 most powerful cities, which had <lb/>
            made great efforts to injure Rome, were both destroyed, <lb/>
            was disparaged as a mere drone.</p>
          <p>4. Moreover, wicked detractors, scrutinizing the cha <lb/>
            racter of Pompey, when no pretext for finding fault with <lb/>
            him could be discovered, remarked two qualities in which <lb/>
            they could raise a laugh against him; one that he had a <lb/>
            sort of natural trick of scratching his head with one <lb/>
            finger: another that for the purpose of concealing an un- <lb/>
            sightly sore, he used to bind one of his legs with a white <lb/>
            bandage. Of which habits, the first they said showed a <lb/>
            dissolute man; the second, one eager for a change of <lb/>
            government; contending, with a somewhat meagre argu- <lb/>
            ment, that it did not signify what part of his body he <lb/>
            clothed with a badge of royal dignity; so snarling at <lb/>
            that man of whom the most glorious proofs show that no <lb/>
            braver and truer patriot ever lived.</p>
          <p>5. During these transactions, Artemius, the deputy go- <lb/>
            vernor of Rome, succeeded Bassus in the prefecture also; <lb/>
            for Bassus, who had lately been promoted to be prefect of <lb/>
            the city, had since died. His administration had been <lb/>
            marked by turbulent sedition, but by no other events suffi- <lb/>
            ciently memorable to deserve mention.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. IN the mean time, while the emperor was passing the <lb/>
            winter quietly at Sirmium, he received frequent and trust- <lb/>
            worthy intelligence that the Sarmatians and the Quadi, <lb/>
            two tribes contiguous to each other, and similar in man- <lb/>
            ners and mode of warfare, were conjointly overrunning <lb/>
            Pannonia and the second province of Mœsia, in straggling <lb/>
            detachments.</p>
          <p>2. These tribes are more suited to predatory incur- <lb/>
            sions than to regular war; they carry long spears, and wear <lb/>
            breastplates made of horn scraped and polished, let into <lb/>
            linen jackets, so that the layers of horn are like the feathers <note type="footnote"> 1 Carthage and Numantia. </note> <pb n="147"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            of a bird. Their horses are chiefly geldings, lest at the <lb/>
            sight of mares they should be excited and run away, or, <lb/>
            when held back in reserve, should betray their riders by <lb/>
            their fierce neighing.</p>
          <p>3. They cover vast spaces in their movements, whether <lb/>
            in pursuit or in retreat, their horses being swift and very <lb/>
            manageable; and they lead with them one or sometimes, <lb/>
            two spare chargers apiece, in order that the change may <lb/>
            keep up the strength of their cattle, and that their vigour <lb/>
            may be preserved by alternations of rest.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, after the vernal equinox was past, the <lb/>
            emperor, having collected a strong body of soldiers, <lb/>
            marched forth under the guidance of propitious fortune. <lb/>
            Having arrived at a suitable place, he crossed the Danube, <lb/>
            which was now flooded from the melting of the snow, by <lb/>
            a bridge of boats, and descended on the lands of the <lb/>
            barbarians, which he began to lay waste. They, being <lb/>
            taken by surprise through the rapidity of his march, and <lb/>
            seeing that the battalions of his warlike army were at <lb/>
            their throats, when they had not supposed it possible that <lb/>
            such a force could be collected for a year, had no courage <lb/>
            to make a stand, but, as the only means of escaping un- <lb/>
            expected destruction, took to flight.</p>
          <p>5. When many had been slain, fear fettering their <lb/>
            steps, those whose speed had saved them from death hid <lb/>
            themselves among the secret defiles of the mountains, and <lb/>
            from thence beheld their country destroyed by the sword, <lb/>
            which they might have delivered if they had resisted with <lb/>
            as much vigour as they fled.</p>
          <p>6. These events took place in that part of Sarmatia <lb/>
            which looks towards the second Pannonia. Another mili- <lb/>
            tary expedition, conducted with equal courage, routed <lb/>
            the troops of the barbarians in Valeria, who were plunder- <lb/>
            ing and destroying everything within their reach.</p>
          <p>7. Terrified at the greatness of this disaster, the Sar- <lb/>
            matians, under pretext of imploring peace, planned to <lb/>
            divide their force into three bodies, and to attack our <lb/>
            army while in a state of fancied security; so that they <lb/>
            should neither be able to prepare their weapons, nor <lb/>
            avoid wounds, nor (which is the last resource in a despe- <lb/>
            rate case) take to flight.</p>
          <p>8. There were with, the Sarmatians likewise on this <pb n="148"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVII. CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            occasion, as partners in their danger, the Quadi,1 who <lb/>
            had often before taken part in the injuries inflicted on us; <lb/>
            but their prompt boldness did not help them on this <lb/>
            occasion, rushing as they did into open danger.</p>
          <p>9. For many of them were slain, and the survivors <lb/>
            escaped among the hills, with which they were familiar. <lb/>
            And as this event raised the spirits and courage of our <lb/>
            army, they united. in solid columns, and marched with <lb/>
            speed into the territories of the Quadi; who, having <lb/>
            learnt by the past to dread the evils which impended over <lb/>
            them, came boldly into the emperor's presence to implore <lb/>
            peace as suppliants, since he was inclined to be merciful <lb/>
            in such cases. On the day appointed for settling the <lb/>
            conditions, one of their princes named Zizais, a young man <lb/>
            of great stature, marshalled the ranks of the Sarmatians to <lb/>
            offer their entreaties of peace in the fashion of an army; <lb/>
            and as soon as they came within sight, he threw away his <lb/>
            arms, and fell like one dead, prostrating himself on his <lb/>
            breast before the emperor; his very voice from fear <lb/>
            refusing its office, when he ought to have uttered his en- <lb/>
            treaties, he awakened the more pity, making many attempts, <lb/>
            and being scarcely able from the violence of his sobs to <lb/>
            give utterance to his wishes.</p>
          <p>10. At last, having recovered himself, and being bidden <lb/>
            to rise up, he knelt, and having regained the use of his <lb/>
            tongue, he implored pardon for his offences. His followers <lb/>
            also, whose mouths had been closed by fear while the fate <lb/>
            of their leader was still doubtful, were admitted to offer <lb/>
            the same petition, and when he, being commanded to rise, <lb/>
            gave them the signal which they had been long expecting, <lb/>
            to present their petition, they all threw away their javelins <lb/>
            and their shields, and held out their hands in an attitude <lb/>
            of supplication, striving to surpass their prince in the <lb/>
            humility of their entreaties.</p>
          <p>11. Among the other Sarmatians the prince had brought <lb/>
            with him three chiefs of tribes, Rumo, Zinafer, and Fragi- <lb/>
            ledus, and many nobles who came to offer the same petition <lb/>
            with earnest hope of success. And they, being elated at <lb/>
            the promise of safety, undertook to make amends for their <lb/>
            former deeds of hostility by performing the conditions now <lb/>
            imposed on them; giving up willingly into the power <note type="footnote">1 The Quad! occupied a part of Hungary. </note> <pb n="149"/>
            <note type="margin"> A. D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            Of the Romans themselves, their wives and children, and <lb/>
            all their possessions. The kindness of the emperor, united <lb/>
            with justice, subdued them; and he bidding them be of <lb/>
            good cheer and return to their homes, they restored <lb/>
            our prisoners. They also brought the hostages who were <lb/>
            demanded of them, and promised prompt obedience to all <lb/>
            the emperor's commands.</p>
          <p>12. Then, encouraged by this example, of our clemency, <lb/>
            other chieftains came with all their tribe, by name Ara- <lb/>
            harius and Usafer, men of distinction among the nobles, <lb/>
            and at the head of a great force of their country- <lb/>
            men ; one of them being chief of a portion of the Quadi <lb/>
            who dwelt beyond the mountains, and the other of a <lb/>
            division of the Sarmatians : the two being united by the <lb/>
            proximity of their territories, and their natural ferocity. <lb/>
            But the emperor, fearing the number of their followers, <lb/>
            lest, while pretending to make a treaty, they should sud- <lb/>
            denly rise up in arms, separated them; ordering those <lb/>
            who were acting for the Sarmatians to retire for a while, <lb/>
            while he was examining into the affairs of Araharius and <lb/>
            the Quadi.</p>
          <p>13. And when they presented themselves before him, <lb/>
            bowing according to their national custom, as they were <lb/>
            not able to clear themselves of heavy charges, so, fearing <lb/>
            extreme punishment, they gave the hostages which were <lb/>
            demanded, though they had never before been compelled <lb/>
            to give pledges for their fidelity.</p>
          <p>14. These matters being thus equitably and successfully <lb/>
            settled, Usafer was admitted to offer his petition, though <lb/>
            Araharius loudly protested against this, and maintained <lb/>
            that the peace ratified with him ought to comprehend <lb/>
            Usafer also, as an ally of his though of interior rank, and <lb/>
            subject to his command.</p>
          <p>15. But when the question was discussed, the Sarma- <lb/>
            tians were pronounced independent of any other power, <lb/>
            as having been always vassals of the Roman empire ; and <lb/>
            they willingly embraced the proposal of giving hostages as <lb/>
            a pledge of the maintenance of tranquillity.</p>
          <p>. 16. After this there came a vast number of nations <lb/>
            and princes, flocking in crowds, when they heard that <lb/>
            Araharius had been allowed to depart in safety, imploring <lb/>
            us to withdraw the sword which was at their throats; and <pb n="150"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            they also obtained the peace which they requested cn <lb/>
            similar terms, and without any delay gave as hostages the <lb/>
            sons of their nobles whom they brought from the interior <lb/>
            of the country; and they also surrendered, as we insisted, <lb/>
            all their prisoners, from whom they parted as unwillingly <lb/>
            as from their own relations.</p>
          <p>17. When these arrangements were completed, the <lb/>
            emperor's anxiety was transferred to the Sarmatians, who <lb/>
            were objects of pity rather than of anger. It is incredible <lb/>
            how much prosperity our connection with their affairs had <lb/>
            brought them, so as to give grounds for really believing, <lb/>
            what some persons do imagine, that Fate may be either <lb/>
            overcome or created at the will of the emperor.</p>
          <p>18. There were formerly many natives of this kingdom, <lb/>
            of high birth and great power, but a secret conspiracy <lb/>
            armed their slaves against them; and as among barbarians <lb/>
            all right consists in might, they, as they were equal to <lb/>
            their masters in ferocity, and superior in number, com- <lb/>
            pletely overcame them.</p>
          <p>19. And these native chiefs, losing all their wisdom in <lb/>
            their fear, fled to the Victohali,' whose settlements were <lb/>
            at a great distance, thinking it better in the choice of <lb/>
            evils to become subject to their protectors than slaves to <lb/>
            their own slaves. But afterwards, when they had obtained <lb/>
            pardon from us, and had been received as faithful allies, <lb/>
            they deplored their hard fate, and invoked our direct pro- <lb/>
            tection. Moved by the undeserved hardship of their lot, <lb/>
            the emperor, when they were assembled before him, ad- <lb/>
            dressed them with kind words in the presence of his army, <lb/>
            and commanded them for the future to own no master but <lb/>
            himself and the Roman generals.</p>
          <p>20. And that the restoration of their liberty might carry <lb/>
            with it additional dignity, he made Zizais their king, a <lb/>
            man, as the event proved, deserving the rewards of eminent <lb/>
            fortune, and faithful. After these glorious transactions, <lb/>
            none of the Sarmatians were allowed to depart till all our <lb/>
            prisoners had returned, as we had before insisted.</p>
          <p>21. When these matters had been concluded in the <lb/>
            territories of the barbarians, the camp was moved to <lb/>
            Szœni,2 that there also the emperor might, by subjugation <note type="footnote">1 The Victohali were a tribe of Goths. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Szoeni, called by Ammianus Bregetio, is near Cormom. </note> <pb n="151"/>

            or slaughter, terminate the war with the Quad!, who were <lb/>
            keeping that district in a state of agitation. Their prince <lb/>
            Vitrodorus, the son of king Viduarius, and Agilimundus, <lb/>
            an inferior chieftain, with the other nobles and judges who <lb/>
            governed the different tribes, as soon as they saw the im- <lb/>
            perial army in the bosom of their kingdom and of their <lb/>
            native land, threw themselves at the feet of the soldiers, <lb/>
            and having obtained pardon, promised obedience; and gave <lb/>
            their children as hostages for the performance of the con- <lb/>
            ditions imposed upon them; and drawing their swords, <lb/>
            which they worship as deities, they swore to remain <lb/>
            faithful.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. These matters then, as has been related, having been <lb/>
            thus successfully terminated, the public interests required <lb/>
            that the army should at once march against the Limigantes, <lb/>
            the revolted slaves of the Sarmatians, who had perpetrated <lb/>
            many atrocities with impunity. For, as soon as the <lb/>
            countrymen of free blood had attacked us, they also, forget- <lb/>
            ful of their former condition, thinking to take advantage <lb/>
            of a favourable opportunity, burst through the Roman <lb/>
            frontier, in this wickedness alone agreeing with their <lb/>
            masters and enemies.</p>
          <p>2. But on deliberation we determined that their offence <lb/>
            also should be punished with more moderation than its <lb/>
            greatness deserved; and that vengeance should limit itself <lb/>
            to removing them to a distance where they could no longer <lb/>
            harass our territories. The consciousness of a long series <lb/>
            of crimes made them fearful of danger.</p>
          <p>3. And therefore, suspecting that the weight of war was <lb/>
            about to fall upon them, they were prepared, as exigency <lb/>
            might require, to resort to stratagem, arms, or entreaties. <lb/>
            But at the first sight of our army they became as it were <lb/>
            panic-stricken; and being reduced to despair, they begged <lb/>
            their lives, offering a yearly tribute, and a body of their <lb/>
            chosen youths for our army, and promising perpetual obedi- <lb/>
            ence. But they were prepared to refuse if they were <lb/>
            ordered to emigrate (as they showed by their gestures and <lb/>
            countenances), trusting to the strength of the place where,: <lb/>
            after they had expelled their masters, they had fixed thefr <lb/>
            abode. <pb n="152"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH. XIII </note> 4. For the Parthiscus1 waters this land, proceeding with <lb/>
            oblique windings till it falls into the Danube. But while it <lb/>
            flows unmixed, it passes through a vast extent of country, <lb/>
            which, near its junction with the Danube, it narrows into <lb/>
            a very small corner, so that over on the side of the Danube <lb/>
            those who live in that district are protected from the <lb/>
            attack of the Romans, and on the side of the Parthiscus <lb/>
            they are secured from any irruptions of the barbarians. <lb/>
            Since along its course the greater part of the ground is <lb/>
            frequently under water from the floods, and always swampy <lb/>
            and full of osiers, so as to be quite impassable to strangers; <lb/>
            and besides the mainland there is an island close to the <lb/>
            mouth of the river, which the stream itself seems to have <lb/>
            separated into its present state.</p>
          <p>5. Accordingly, at the desire of the emperor, they came <lb/>
            with native arrogance to our bank of the river, not, as the <lb/>
            result showed, with the intention of obeying his commands, <lb/>
            but that they might not seem alarmed at the presence of <lb/>
            his soldiers. And there they stood, stubbornly showing <lb/>
            that they had come bent on resistance.</p>
          <p>6. And as the emperor had foreseen that this might <lb/>
            happen, he secretly divided his army into several squadrons, <lb/>
            and by the rapidity of their movements hemmed in the <lb/>
            barbarians between his own lines. And then, standing on <lb/>
            a mound, with a few of his officers and a small body-guard, <lb/>
            he gently admonished them not to give way to ferocity.</p>
          <p>7. But they, wavering and in doubt, were agitated by <lb/>
            various feelings, and mingling craft with their fury, they <lb/>
            had recourse to arms and to prayers at the same time. <lb/>
            And meditating to make a sudden attack on those of our <lb/>
            men who were nearest, they threw their shields some <lb/>
            distance before them, with the intent that while they <lb/>
            made some steps forward to recover them, they might thus <lb/>
            steal a little ground without giving any indication of their <lb/>
            purpose.</p>
          <p>8. And as it was now nearly evening, and the departing <lb/>
            light warned us to avoid further delay, our soldiers raised <lb/>
            their standards and fell upon them with a fiery onset <lb/>
            And they, in close order, directed all their force against <lb/>
            the mound on which (as has been already said) the em- <note type="footnote">1 The Theiss. </note> <pb n="153"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            peror himself was standing, fixing their eyes on him, and <lb/>
            uttering fierce outcries against him.</p>
          <p>9. Our army was indignant at such insane audacity, and <lb/>
            forming into a triangle, to which military simplicity has <lb/>
            given the name of " the boar's head," with a violent charge <lb/>
            they scattered the barbarians now pressing vigorously <lb/>
            upon the emperor; on the right our infantry slew their <lb/>
            infantry, and on the left our cavalry dashed among their <lb/>
            squadrons of light horsemen.</p>
          <p>10. The praetorian cohort, carefully guarding the em- <lb/>
            peror, spared neither the breasts of those who attacked nor <lb/>
            the backs of those who fled, and the barbarians, yielding <lb/>
            in their stubbornness to death alone, showed by their <lb/>
            horrid cries that they grieved not so much at their own <lb/>
            death as at the triumph of our army. And, beside the <lb/>
            dead, many lay with their legs cut off, and so deprived of <lb/>
            the resource of flight, others had lost their hands; some <lb/>
            who had received no wound were crushed by the weight <lb/>
            of those who fell upon them, and bore their torments in <lb/>
            profound silence.</p>
          <p>11. Nor, amid all their sufferings, did any one of them <lb/>
            ask for mercy, or throw away his sword, or implore a <lb/>
            speedy death, but clinging resolutely to their arms, <lb/>
            wounded as they were, they thought it a lesser evil to <lb/>
            be subdued by the strength of another than by their own <lb/>
            consciences, and at times they were heard to grumble that <lb/>
            what had happened was the work of fortune, not of their <lb/>
            deserts. And so this whole battle was brought to an end <lb/>
            in half an hour, in which such numbers of barbarians fell <lb/>
            that nothing but the fact of our victory proved that there <lb/>
            had been any battle at all.</p>
          <p>12. Those in arms had scarcely been routed when the <lb/>
            relations of the dead, of every age and sex, were brought <lb/>
            forward in crowds, having been dragged from their humble <lb/>
            dwellings. And all their former pride being now gone, <lb/>
            they descended to the lowest depths of servile obedience, <lb/>
            and after a very short time nothing but barrows of the <lb/>
            dead and bands of captives were beheld.</p>
          <p>13. So, the heat of strife and the excitement of victory <lb/>
            stimulating our men, they rose up to destroy all who had <lb/>
            escaped the battle, or who were lying hidden in their <lb/>
            dwellings. And when, eager for the blood of the bar- <pb n="154"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH. XIII </note> <lb/>
            barians, our soldiers had reached the spot, they tore to <lb/>
            pieces the slight straw-thatched huts ; nor could even the <lb/>
            strongest-built cottages, or the stoutest beams save any <lb/>
            one from death.</p>
          <p>14. At last, when everything was set on fire, and when <lb/>
            no one could be concealed any longer, since every protec- <lb/>
            tion for their lives was destroyed, they either perished <lb/>
            obstinately in the flames, or else, if they avoided the fire <lb/>
            and sallied out, they only escaped that destruction to fall <lb/>
            beneath the sword of their enemies.</p>
          <p>15. Some, however, did escape from the weapons of the <lb/>
            enemy and from the spreading flames, and committed <lb/>
            themselves to the stream, trusting to their skill in swim- <lb/>
            ming to enable them to reach the further bank; but many <lb/>
            of them were drowned, and others were transfixed by our <lb/>
            javelins, so that the winding stream of the vast river was <lb/>
            discoloured with blood, and thus, by the agency of both <lb/>
            elements, did the indignation and valour of the conquerors <lb/>
            destroy the Sarmatians.</p>
          <p>16. After these events it was determined to leave <lb/>
            the barbarians no hope nor comfort of life; and after <lb/>
            burning their houses and carrying off their families, an <lb/>
            order was given to collect boats in order to hunt out <lb/>
            those who, being on the opposite bank of the river, had <lb/>
            escaped the attack of our men.</p>
          <p>17. And immediately, that the alacrity of our warriors <lb/>
            might have no time to cool, some light-armed troops were <lb/>
            embarked in boats, and led by secret paths to occupy the <lb/>
            retreats of the Sarmatians. The barbarians at first were <lb/>
            deceived by seeing only the boats of their own country, <lb/>
            and crews with whom they were acquainted.</p>
          <p>18. But when the weapons glittered in the distance, <lb/>
            and they perceived that what they feared was upon them, <lb/>
            they sought refuge in their accustomed marshes. And our <lb/>
            soldiers pursuing them with great animosity, slew numbers <lb/>
            of them, and gained a victory in a place where it had not <lb/>
            been supposed that any soldier could find a footing, much <lb/>
            less do any bold action.</p>
          <p>19. After the Anicenses1 had thus been routed and <lb/>
            almost destroyed, we proceeded at once to attack the <lb/>
            Picenses. who are so called from the regions which they <note type="footnote">1 The Anicenses and Piccnses were Dacian tribes. </note> <pb n="155"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            inhabit, which border on one another; and these tribes had <lb/>
            fancied themselves the more secure from the disasters of <lb/>
            their allies, which they had heard of by frequent rumours; <lb/>
            To crush them (for it was an arduous task for those who <lb/>
            did not know the country to follow men scattered in <lb/>
            many directions as they were) the aid of Taifali' and of <lb/>
            the free-born Sarmatians was sought.</p>
          <p>20. And as the nature of the ground separated the <lb/>
            auxiliary battalions from each other, our own troops took <lb/>
            the ground nearest Mœsia, the Taifali that nearest to their <lb/>
            own settlements, while the free Sarmatians occupied that in <lb/>
            front of their original position.</p>
          <p>21. The Limigantes, alarmed at the still fresh examples <lb/>
            of nations subdued and crushed by us, for a long time <lb/>
            hesitated and wavered whether they should attack us or ask <lb/>
            for peace, having arguments of no small weight for either <lb/>
            line of conduct. But at last, through the influence of the <lb/>
            council of the elders, the idea of surrender prevailed; and <lb/>
            the submission also of those who had dared to attack their <lb/>
            free-born masters was added to our numerous victories; <lb/>
            and the rest of them, who had previously despised their <lb/>
            masters, thinking them unwarlike and easily subdued, <lb/>
            now finding them stronger than themselves, submitted to <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>22. Accordingly, having received pledges of their safety, <lb/>
            and having quitted the defence of their mountains, the <lb/>
            greater portion of them came with speed to the Roman <lb/>
            camp, and they spread over a vast extent of ground, <lb/>
            bringing with them their parents, their children, their <lb/>
            wives, and all the movable treasures which their rapid <lb/>
            motions had allowed them to carry off.</p>
          <p>23. And those who it had been supposed would rather <lb/>
            lose their lives than quit their country, while they mistook <lb/>
            their mad licentiousness for liberty, now submitted to <lb/>
            obey our orders, and to take up another abode in peace <lb/>
            and good faith, so as to be undisturbed for the future by <lb/>
            wars or seditions. And having been thus accepted as <lb/>
            subjects, in accordance with their own wish as it was <lb/>
            believed, they remained quiet for a time ; but afterwards <lb/>
            they broke out in destructive wickedness, as shall be <lb/>
            related at the proper time. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Taifali were a tribe of the Western Goths. </note> <pb n="156"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH. XIII </note> 24. While our affairs were thus prospering, Illyricum <lb/>
            was put in a state of twofold security, since the emperor, <lb/>
            in endeavouring by two means to accomplish this object, <lb/>
            succeeded in both. He brought back and established in <lb/>
            their ancient homes the people who had been banished, <lb/>
            whom, although they were objects of suspicion from their <lb/>
            natural fickleness, he believed would go on more mode- <lb/>
            rately than of old. And to crown this kindness, he set <lb/>
            over them as a king, not one of low birth, but the <lb/>
            very man whom they themselves had formerly chosen, as <lb/>
            eminent for all the virtues of mind and body.</p>
          <p>25. After such a wise action, Constantius, being now <lb/>
            raised above all fear, and having received from the -una- <lb/>
            nimous consent of his soldiers the title of Sarmaticus, from <lb/>
            the name of the nation which he had subdued; and being <lb/>
            now about to leave the army, summoned all his cohorts <lb/>
            and centuries and maniples, and mounting the tribune, <lb/>
            surrounded by the standards and eagles, and by a great <lb/>
            number of soldiers of all ranks, he addressed the troops in <lb/>
            these words, choosing his topics as usual so as to gain <lb/>
            the favour of all.</p>
          <p>26. “The recollection of our glorious exploits, the <lb/>
            dearest of all feelings to brave men, encourages me to <lb/>
            repeat, though with great moderation, what, in our heaven- <lb/>
            granted victories, and before battle, and in the very heat <lb/>
            of the strife, we, the most faithful champions of the Roman <lb/>
            state, have conducted to a deservedly prosperous issue. <lb/>
            For what can be so honourable or so justly worthy to be <lb/>
            handed down to the recollection of posterity as the exult- <lb/>
            ation of the soldier in his brave deeds, and of the general <lb/>
            in his wise plans ?</p>
          <p>27. " The rage of our enemies, in their arrogant pride <lb/>
            thinking to profit by our absence, while we were pro- <lb/>
            tecting Italy and Gaul, was overrunning Illyricum, and <lb/>
            with continual sallies they were ravaging even the districts <lb/>
            beyond our frontiers; crossing the rivers, sometimes in <lb/>
            boats made of hollow trees, sometimes on foot; not relying <lb/>
            on combats, nor on their arms and strength, but being <lb/>
            accustomed to secret forays, and having been from the <lb/>
            very earliest era of their nation an -object of fear to our <lb/>
            ancestors, from their cunning and the variety of their- <lb/>
            manoeuvres, which we in dee d, being at a great distance, <pb n="157"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            bore as long as we could, thinking that the vigour of our <lb/>
            generals would be able to protect us from even slight <lb/>
            injury.</p>
          <p>28. " But when their licentiousness led them on to <lb/>
            bolder attempts, and to inflict great and frequent injury <lb/>
            on our provinces, we, having first fortified the passes of <lb/>
            the Tyrol, and having secured the safety of the Gauls by <lb/>
            watchful care, leaving no danger behind us, have marched <lb/>
            into Pannonia, in order, with the favour of the everlasting <lb/>
            deity, to strengthen our tottering interests in that country. <lb/>
            And after everything was prepared, we set forth, as you <lb/>
            know, at the end of the spring, and undertook a great <lb/>
            enterprise; first of all taking care that the countless darts <lb/>
            of the enemy should not prevent us from making a bridge. <lb/>
            And when, with no great trouble, this had been ac- <lb/>
            complished, after we had set our foot upon the enemy's <lb/>
            territories, we defeated, with very little loss to ourselves, <lb/>
            the Sarmatians, who with obstinate courage set themselves <lb/>
            to resist us to the death. And we also crushed the Quadi, <lb/>
            who were bringing reinforcements to the Sarmatians, and <lb/>
            who with similar courage attacked our noble legions.</p>
          <p>29. " These tribes, after heavy losses sustained in their <lb/>
            attacks, and their stubborn and toilsome resistance, have <lb/>
            at length learnt the power of our valour, and throwing <lb/>
            away their arms, have allowed their hands, prepared for <lb/>
            fighting, to be bound behind their backs; and seeing that <lb/>
            their only hope of safety is in prayer, have fallen at the <lb/>
            feet of your merciful emperor, whose wars they found <lb/>
            are usually successful. Having got rid of these enemies, <lb/>
            we with equal courage defeated the Limigantes, and after <lb/>
            we had put numbers of them to the sword, the rest found <lb/>
            their only means of escaping danger lay in fleeing to their <lb/>
            hiding-places in the marshes.</p>
          <p>30. " And when these things were successfully ter- <lb/>
            minated, it seemed to be a seasonable opportunity for <lb/>
            mercy. So we compelled the Limigantes to remove to <lb/>
            very distant lands, that they might not be able any more <lb/>
            to move to our injury ; and we spared the greatest part of <lb/>
            them. And we made Zizais king over the free-born por- <lb/>
            tion of them, sure that he would be faithful to us, and <lb/>
            thinking it more honour to create a king for the barbarians <lb/>
            than to take one from them, the dignity being increased by <pb n="158"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVII. CH. XIV </note> <lb/>
            this honourable consideration, that the ruler whom we <lb/>
            thus gave them had before been elected and accepted by <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>31. "So we and the republic have in one campaign <lb/>
            obtained a fourfold reward: first, vengence on our guilty <lb/>
            assailants; next, abundance of captive slaves from the <lb/>
            enemy, for valour is entitled to those rewards which it has <lb/>
            earned with its toil and prowess.</p>
          <p>32. " Thirdly, we have ample resources and great <lb/>
            treasures of wealth; our labour and courage having pre- <lb/>
            served the patrimony of each of us undiminished. This, <lb/>
            in the mind of a good sovereign, is the best fruit of pros- <lb/>
            perity.</p>
          <p>. 33. “ Lastly, I myself have the well-won spoil of a <lb/>
            surname derived from the enemy-the title of Sarmaticus <lb/>
            -which you unanimously have (if I may say so without <lb/>
            arrogance) deservedly conferred on me."</p>
          <p>34. After he had made an end of speaking, the whole <lb/>
            assembly, with more alacrity than usual, since its hope of <lb/>
            booty and gain was increased, rose up with joyful voices <lb/>
            in praise of the emperor; and, as usual, calling God to <lb/>
            witness that Constantius was invincible, returned with joy <lb/>
            to their tents. And the emperor was conducted back to <lb/>
            his palace, and having rested two days, re-entered Sir- <lb/>
            mium with a triumphal procession; and the troops re- <lb/>
            turned to their appointed stations.</p>

          <p>§ 1. ABOUT this time Prosper and Spectatus and Eus- <lb/>
            tathius, who, as has been mentioned above, had been sent <lb/>
            as ambassadors to the Persians, found the Persian king at <lb/>
            Ctesiphon, on his return from his campaign, and they <lb/>
            delivered the emperor's letters and presents, and requested <lb/>
            peace while affairs were still in their existing state. And <lb/>
            mindful of what had been enjoined them, they never <lb/>
            forgot the interests nor the dignity of the Roman empire, <lb/>
            maintaining that the peace ought to be made on the con- <lb/>
            dition that no alteration should be made in the state of <lb/>
            Armenia or Mesopotamia.</p>
          <p>2. And having remained for some time, when they saw <pb n="159"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 358.] </note> <lb/>
            that the king was obstinate, and resolute not to admit of <lb/>
            peace unless the absolute dominion of those regions was <lb/>
            assigned to him, they returned without having completed <lb/>
            their business.</p>
          <p>3. After which, Lucillianus, a count, and Procopius, at <lb/>
            that time secretary, were sent to obtain the same condi- <lb/>
            tions, with equal powers. Procopius being the same man <lb/>
            who afterwards, under the pressure of violent necessity, <lb/>
            committed himself to a revolutionary movement.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THESE events took place in the different parts of the <lb/>
            world in one and the same year. But while the affairs in <lb/>
            Gaul were in a better state; and while titles of consul, <pb n="160"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK: XVIII: CH: II </note> <lb/>
            were ennobling the brothers Eusebius and Hypatius, <lb/>
            Julian, illustrious for his uninterrupted successes, now <lb/>
            in his winter quarters, being relieved for a while from <lb/>
            his warlike anxieties, was devoting equal care to many <lb/>
            points connected with the welfare of the provinces. <lb/>
            Taking anxious care that no one should be oppressed by <lb/>
            the burden of taxation ; that the power of the officers <lb/>
            should not be stretched into extortion; that those who <lb/>
            increase their property by the public distresses, should <lb/>
            have no sanction, and that no judge should violate justice <lb/>
            with impunity.</p>
          <p>2. And he found it easy to correct what was wrong <lb/>
            on this head, because he himself decided all causes in <lb/>
            which the persons concerned were of any great importance; <lb/>
            and showed himself a most impartial discerner of right <lb/>
            and wrong.</p>
          <p>3. And although there are many acts of his in deciding <lb/>
            these disputes worthy of praise, it will be sufficient to <lb/>
            mention one, on the model of which all his other words <lb/>
            and actions were framed.</p>
          <p>4. Numerius, a native of Narbonne, had a little time <lb/>
            before been accused before the governor as a thief, and <lb/>
            Julian, by an unusual exercise of the censor's power, heard <lb/>
            his cause in public; admitting into the court all who <lb/>
            sought entrance. And when Numerius denied all that Was <lb/>
            charged against him, and could not be convicted on any <lb/>
            point, Delphidius the orator, who was assailing him with <lb/>
            great bitterness, being enraged at the failure of his charges, <lb/>
            exclaimed, “ But, great Cæsar, will any one ever be found <lb/>
            guilty if it be enough to deny the charge ?" To whom <lb/>
            Julian, with seasonable wisdom, replied, " Can any one be <lb/>
            judged innocent if it be enough to make a charge ?" And <lb/>
            he did many similar actions in his civil capacity.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. BUT when he was about to set out on an important <lb/>
            expedition against some tribes of the Allemanni whom he <lb/>
            considered hostile, and likely to proceed to acts of atrocious <lb/>
            daring if they were not defeated in a way to be an example <lb/>
            to the rest, he hesitated in great anxiety, since a report <lb/>
            of his intentions had gone before him, what force he could <pb n="161"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            employ, and how he could be quick enough to take them <lb/>
            by surprise the first moment that circumstances should <lb/>
            afford him an opportunity.</p>
          <p>2. But after he had meditated on many different plans, <lb/>
            he decided on trying one, which the result proved to be <lb/>
            good, without any one being aware of it. He bad sent <lb/>
            Hariobaudes, a tribune who at that time had no particular <lb/>
            command, a man of honour, loyalty, and courage, under <lb/>
            pretext of an embassy, to Hortarius the king who was now <lb/>
            in a state of friendship with us ; in order that from his <lb/>
            court Hariobaudes might easily proceed to the frontiers of <lb/>
            the enemy whom he was proposing to attack ; and so <lb/>
            ascertain what they were about, being thoroughly skilled <lb/>
            in the language of the barbarians.</p>
          <p>3. And when he had gone boldly on this commission, <lb/>
            Julian himself, as it was now a favourable time of the year, <lb/>
            assembled his soldiers from all quarters for the expedition, <lb/>
            and set out; thinking it above all things desirable, before <lb/>
            the war had got warm, to effect his entrance into the cities <lb/>
            which had been destroyed some time before, and having <lb/>
            recovered them to put them in a state of defence; and <lb/>
            also to establish granaries in the place of those which had <lb/>
            been burnt, in which to store the corn usually imported <lb/>
            from Britain.</p>
          <p>4. Both these objects were accomplished, and that more <lb/>
            speedily than could have been looked for. For the store- <lb/>
            houses were rapidly built, and abundance of provisions <lb/>
            laid up in them; and seven cities were occupied. The <lb/>
            camp of Hercules, Quadriburgium,' Kellen, Nuys, Bonn, <lb/>
            Andernach, and Bingen. At which last city, by exceedingly <lb/>
            good fortune, Florentius the prefect also arrived unex- <lb/>
            pectedly, bringing with him a division of soldiers, and a <lb/>
            supply of provisions sufficient to last a long time.</p>
          <p>5. After this, the next measure of urgent necessity was <lb/>
            to repair the walls of the recovered cities, while as yet no <lb/>
            one raised any hindrance ; and it is abundantly plain that <lb/>
            at that time the barbarians did out of fear what was com- <lb/>
            manded them for the public interests, while the Romans <lb/>
            did it for love of their ruler.</p>
          <p>6. According to the treaty made in the preceding year, <note type="footnote"> I It is not known what towns are meant by Castra Herculis and <lb/>
            Quadriburgium. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XVIII. CH. II </note> <lb/>
            the kings sent their own waggons with many articles <lb/>
            useful for building. And the auxiliary soldiers whe <lb/>
            always hold themselves above employments of this kind, <lb/>
            being won over by Julian's caresses to diligent obedience, <lb/>
            now carried beams fifty feet long and more on their <lb/>
            shoulders, and gave the greatest aid to the labours of the <lb/>
            architect.</p>
          <p>7. And while all this was being done with diligence and <lb/>
            speed, Hariobaudes, having learnt all he wanted, returned <lb/>
            and related what he had ascertained. And after his <lb/>
            arrival the army marched with all speed, and soon reached <lb/>
            Mayence, where, though Florentius and Lupicinus, who <lb/>
            succeeded Severus, insisted vehemently that they might <lb/>
            cross by the bridge laid down at that town, the Cæsar <lb/>
            strenuously objected, maintaining that it was not well to <lb/>
            trample on the lands of those who were brought into a <lb/>
            state of tranquillity and friendship ; lest the treaty made <lb/>
            with them should be brought to an abrupt end, as had <lb/>
            often happened through the discourtesy of the soldiers ra- <lb/>
            vaging everything that came in their way.</p>
          <p>8. But all the Allemanni who were the objects of our <lb/>
            attack, seeing the danger now on their borders, with many <lb/>
            threats urged Surmarius their king, who by a previous <lb/>
            treaty was on friendly terms with us, to prevent the <lb/>
            Romans from crossing the river. For their villages were <lb/>
            on the eastern bank of the Rhine. But when Surmarius <lb/>
            affirmed that he by himself was unable to offer effectual <lb/>
            resistance, the barbarian host assembled in a body, and <lb/>
            came up to Mayence, intending by main force to prevent <lb/>
            our army from crossing the river.</p>
          <p>9. So that Cæsar's advice now seemed best in two points, <lb/>
            both not to ravage the lands of our friends ; and also, not <lb/>
            in the teeth of the opposition of a most warlike people, to <lb/>
            risk the loss of many lives in order to make a bridge, even <lb/>
            in a spot the most favourable for such a work.</p>
          <p>10. And the enemy, watching his movements with great <lb/>
            skill, marched slowly along the opposite bank, and when <lb/>
            they saw our men pitching their tents at a distance, they <lb/>
            still watched all night, exerting the most sleepless vigi- <lb/>
            lance to prevent the passage of the river from being <lb/>
            attempted.</p>
          <p>11. Bun when our men reached the spot intended, they <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            surrounded their camp with a rampart and ditch, and took <lb/>
            their rest; and the Cæsar, having taken counsel with <lb/>
            Lupicinus, ordered some of the tribunes to get ready three <lb/>
            hundred light-armed soldiers with stakes, without letting <lb/>
            them know what was to be done, or whither they were going.</p>
          <p>12. They being collected, when the night was well <lb/>
            advanced, and being all embarked on board of forty light <lb/>
            boats, which were all that were at hand, were ordered to <lb/>
            go down the stream so silently as not to use even their <lb/>
            oars, lest the noise should rouse the barbarians, and <lb/>
            then using all activity both of mind and body, to force a <lb/>
            landing on the opposite bank, within the frontier of the <lb/>
            enemy, while they were still watching the camp-fires of <lb/>
            our men.</p>
          <p>13. While these orders were being performed with great <lb/>
            promptness, King Hortarius, who had been previously <lb/>
            bound to us by treaties, and was without any intention of <lb/>
            revolting, kept on friendly terms with the bordering tribes, <lb/>
            having invited all their kings, princes, and chieftains to a <lb/>
            banquet, detained them to the third watch, the banquet <lb/>
            being prolonged so late according to the custom of his <lb/>
            nation. And as they were departing, our men chanced to <lb/>
            come upon them suddenly, but could neither stay nor <lb/>
            capture any of them owing to the darkness of the night <lb/>
            and the fleetness of their horses, on which they fled at <lb/>
            random in all directions. A number of sutlers and slaves, <lb/>
            however, who were following them on foot, our men slew; <lb/>
            the few who escaped being likewise protected by the dark- <lb/>
            ness of the hour.</p>
          <p>14. When it became known that the Romans had <lb/>
            crossed the river (and they then as well as in all former <lb/>
            expeditions accounted it a great relief to their labours <lb/>
            when they could find the enemy), the kings and their <lb/>
            people, who were watching zealously to prevent the <lb/>
            bridge from being made, were alarmed, and being panic- <lb/>
            stricken fled in all directions, and their violent fury being <lb/>
            thus cooled, they hastened to remove their relations and their <lb/>
            treasures to a distance. And as all difficulties were now <lb/>
            surmounted, the bridge was at once made, and before the <lb/>
            barbarians could expect it, the Roman army appeared in <lb/>
            their territories, and passed through the dominions of <lb/>
            Hortarius without doing any injury. <pb n="164"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XVIII. CH. II. </note> 15. But when they reached the lands of those kings who <lb/>
            were still hostile, they went on invincibly through the <lb/>
            midst of their rebellious country, laying waste with fire <lb/>
            and sword, and plundering everything. And after their <lb/>
            frail houses were destroyed by fire, and a vast number of <lb/>
            men had been slain, and the army, having nothing to <lb/>
            face but corpses and suppliants, had arrived in the region <lb/>
            called Capellatum, or Palas, where there are boundary <lb/>
            stones marking the frontiers of the Allemanni and the <lb/>
            Burgundians; the army pitched its camp, in order that <lb/>
            Macrianus and Hariobaudus, brothers, and both kings, might <lb/>
            be received by us, and delivered from their fears. Since <lb/>
            they, thinking their destruction imminent, were coming <lb/>
            with great anxiety to sue for peace.</p>
          <p>16. And immediately after them King Vadomarius also <lb/>
            came, whose abode was opposite Augst: and having pro- <lb/>
            duced some letters of the Emperor Constantius, in which <lb/>
            he was strictly recommended to the protection of the <lb/>
            Romans, he was courteously received, as became one who <lb/>
            had been admitted by the emperor as a client of the <lb/>
            Roman empire.</p>
          <p>17. And Macrianus and his brother, being admitted <lb/>
            among our eagles and standards, marvelled at the imposing <lb/>
            appearance of our arms, and various resources which they <lb/>
            had never seen before. And they offered up petitions on <lb/>
            behalf of their people. But Vadomarius, who had met us <lb/>
            before, since he was close to our frontier, admired indeed <lb/>
            the appointments of our daring expedition, but remembered <lb/>
            that he had often seen such before, ever since his child- <lb/>
            hood.</p>
          <p>18. At last, after long deliberation, with the unanimous <lb/>
            consent of all, peace was granted to Macrianus and Hario- <lb/>
            baudus ; but an answer could not be given to Vadomarius, <lb/>
            who had come to secure his own safety, and also as an <lb/>
            ambassador to intercede for the kings Urius, Ursicinus, <lb/>
            and Vestralpus, imploring peace for them also; lest, as the <lb/>
            barbarians are men of wavering faith, they might recover <lb/>
            their spirits when our army was withdrawn, and refuse <lb/>
            adherence to conditions procured by the agency of <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>19. But when they also, after their crops and houses <lb/>
            had been burnt, and many of their soldiers had been slain <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> AD. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            or taken prisoners, sent ambassadors of their own, and <lb/>
            sued for mercy as if they had been guilty of similar vio- <lb/>
            lence to our subjects, they obtained peace on similar terms; <lb/>
            of which that most rigorously insisted on was that they <lb/>
            should restore all the prisoners which they had taken in <lb/>
            their frequent incursions.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the god-like wisdom of the Cæsar was thus <lb/>
            successful in Gaul, great disturbances arose in the court of <lb/>
            the emperor, which from slight beginnings increased to <lb/>
            grief and lamentations. Some bees swarmed on the house <lb/>
            of Barbatio, at that time the commander of the infantry. <lb/>
            And when he consulted the interpreters of prodigies on <lb/>
            this event, he received for an answer, that it was an omen <lb/>
            of great danger; the answer being founded on the idea <lb/>
            that these animals, after they have fixed their abode, and <lb/>
            laid up their stores, are usually expelled by smoke and <lb/>
            the noisy din of cymbals.</p>
          <p>2. Barbatio's wife was a woman called Assyria, neither <lb/>
            silent nor prudent. And when he had gone on an expe- <lb/>
            dition which caused her much alarm, she, because of the <lb/>
            predictions which she recollected to have been given <lb/>
            her, and being full of female vanity, having summoned a <lb/>
            handmaid who was skilful in writing, and of whom she <lb/>
            had become possessed by inheritance from her father <lb/>
            Silvanus, sent an unseasonable letter to her husband, full <lb/>
            of lamentations, and of entreaties that after the approach- <lb/>
            ing death of Constantius, if he himself, as she hoped, was <lb/>
            admitted to a share in the empire, he would not despise <lb/>
            her, and prefer to marry Eusebia, who was Constantius's <lb/>
            empress, and who was of a beauty equalled by few <lb/>
            women.</p>
          <p>3. She sent this letter as secretly as she could; but the <lb/>
            maid, when the troops had returned from their expedition <lb/>
            at the beginning of the night, took a copy of the letter <lb/>
            which she had written at the dictation of her mistress, to <lb/>
            Arbetio, and being eagerly admitted by him, she gave him <lb/>
            the paper.</p>
          <p>4. He, relying on this evidence, being at all times a man <lb/>
            eager to bring forward accusations, conveyed it to the <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVIII CH. II. </note> <lb/>
            emperor. As was usual, no delay was allowed, and Bar- <lb/>
            batio, who confessed that he had received the letter, and <lb/>
            his wife, who was distinetly proved to have written it, <lb/>
            were both beheaded.</p>
          <p>5. After this execution, investigations were carried <lb/>
            further, and many persons, innocent as well as guilty, were <lb/>
            brought into question?. Among whom was Valentinus, <lb/>
            who having lately been an offieer of the proteetores, had <lb/>
            been promoted to be a tribune; and he with many others <lb/>
            was put to the torture as having been privy to the affair, <lb/>
            though he was wholly ignorant of it. But he survived his <lb/>
            sufferings; and as some compensation for the injury done <lb/>
            to him, and for his danger, he received the rank of duke of <lb/>
            Illyricum.</p>
          <p>6. This same Barbatio was -a man of rude and arrogant <lb/>
            manners, and very unpopular, because while captain of the <lb/>
            protcetores of the household, in the time of Gallus Cæsar, <lb/>
            he was a false and treacherous man; and after he had <lb/>
            attained the higher rank he became so elated that he <lb/>
            invented calumnies against the Cæsar Julian, and, though <lb/>
            all good men hated him, whispered many wicked lies into <lb/>
            the ever-ready ears of the emperor.</p>
          <p>7. Being forsooth ignorant of the wise old saying of <lb/>
            Aristotle, who when he sent CaHisthenes, his pupil and <lb/>
            relation, to the king Alexander, warned him to say as <lb/>
            little as he could, and that only of a pleasant kind, before <lb/>
            a man who carried the power of life and death on the tip <lb/>
            of his tongue.</p>
          <p>8. We should not wonder that mankind, whose minds <lb/>
            we look upon as akin to those of the gods, can sometimes <lb/>
            disecrn what is likely to be beneficial or hurtful to them, <lb/>
            when even animals devoid of reason sometimes secure <lb/>
            their own safety by profound silence, of which the follow- <lb/>
            ing is a notorious instance :—</p>
          <p>9. When the wild geese leave the East because of the <lb/>
            heat, and seek a western climate, as soon as they reach <lb/>
            Mount Taurus, which is full of eagles, fearing those war- <lb/>
            like birds, they stop up their own beaks with stones, that <lb/>
            not even the hardest necessity may draw a ery from them; <lb/>
            they fly more rapidly than usual across that range, and <lb/>
            when they have passed it they throw away the stones, and <lb/>
            then proceed more securely. <pb n="167"/>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHILE these investigations were being carried oil <lb/>
            with great diligence at Sirmium, the fortune of the East <lb/>
            sounded the terrible trumpet of danger. For the king of <lb/>
            Persia, being strengthened by the aid of the fierce nations <lb/>
            whom he had lately subdued, and being above all men <lb/>
            ambitious of extending his territories, began to prepare <lb/>
            men and arms and supplies, mingling hellish wisdom <lb/>
            with his human counsels, and consulting all kinds of <lb/>
            soothsayers about futurity. And when he had collected <lb/>
            everything, he proposed to invade our territories at the <lb/>
            first opening of the spring.</p>
          <p>2. And when the emperor learnt this, at first by report, <lb/>
            but subsequently by certain intelligence, and while all <lb/>
            were in suspense from dread of the impending danger, the <lb/>
            dependents of the court, hammering on the same anvil day <lb/>
            and night (as the saying is), at the prompting of the <lb/>
            eunuchs, held up Ursicinus as a Gorgon's head before the <lb/>
            suspicious and timid emperor, continually repeating that, <lb/>
            because on the death of Silvanus, in a dearth of better men, <lb/>
            he had been sent to defend the eastern districts, he had <lb/>
            become ambitious of still greater power.</p>
          <p>3. And by this base compliance many tried to purchase <lb/>
            the favour of Eusebius, at that time the principal chamber- <lb/>
            lain, with whom (if we are to say the real truth) Con- <lb/>
            stantius had great influence, and who was now a bitter <lb/>
            enemy of the safety of the master of the horse, Ursicinus, <lb/>
            on two accounts; first, because he was the only person <lb/>
            who did not need his assistance, as others did; and secondly, <lb/>
            because he would not give up his house at Antioch, which <lb/>
            Eusebius greatly coveted.</p>
          <p>4. So this latter, like a snake abounding in poison, and <lb/>
            exciting its offsping as soon as they can crawl to do mis- <lb/>
            chief, stirred up the other chamberlains, that they, while <lb/>
            performing their more private duties about the prince's <lb/>
            person, with their thin and boyish voices, might damage <lb/>
            the reputation of a brave man by pouring into the too <lb/>
            open ears of the emperor accusations of great odium. And <lb/>
            they soon did what they were commanded.</p>
          <p>5. Disgust at this and similar events leads one to praise <pb n="168"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVIII. CH.V. </note> <lb/>
            Domitian, who although, by the unalterable detestation he <lb/>
            incurred, has ever stained the memory of his father and <lb/>
            his brother,' still deserved credit for a most excellent law, <lb/>
            by which he forbade with severe threats any one to castrate <lb/>
            any boy within the limits of the Roman jurisdiction. For <lb/>
            if there were no such edict, who could endure the swarms of <lb/>
            such creatures as would exist, when it is so difficult to bear <lb/>
            even a few of them ?</p>
          <p>6. However, they proceeded with caution, lest, as <lb/>
            Eusebius suggested, if Ursicinus were again sent for, he <lb/>
            should take alarm and throw everything into confusion; <lb/>
            but it was proposed that on the first casual opportunity <lb/>
            he should be put to death.</p>
          <p>7. While they were waiting for this chance, and full of <lb/>
            doubt and anxiety; and while we2 were tarrying a short <lb/>
            time at Samosata, the greatest city of what had formerly <lb/>
            been the kingdom of Commagene, we suddenly received <lb/>
            frequent and consistent reports of some new commotions, <lb/>
            which I will now proceed to relate.</p>

          <p>§ 1. A CERTAIN man named Antoninus, who from having <lb/>
            been a wealthy merchant had become superintendent of <lb/>
            the accounts of the duke of Mesopotamia, and after that <lb/>
            entered the corps of the protectores, a man of experience <lb/>
            and wisdom, and very well known in all that country. <lb/>
            Being through the avarice of certain persons involved in <lb/>
            heavy losses, and perceiving that while defending actions <lb/>
            against men of influence ho was being sunk lower and <lb/>
            lower through injustice, since the judges who had to decide <lb/>
            on his affairs sought to gratify people in power, he, not <lb/>
            wishing to kick against the pricks, bent himself to ob- <lb/>
            sequious caresses; and confessing that he owed what <lb/>
            was claimed of him, the claim, by collusion, was trans- <lb/>
            ferred to the treasury. He now, having resolved on a <lb/>
            flagitious plan, began secretly to look into the secrets of <lb/>
            the whole republic; and being acquainted with both <lb/>
            languages, he devoted his attention to the accounts; re- <note type="footnote"> 1 Vespasian and Titus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ammianus was still in attendance on Ursicinus. </note> <pb n="169"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            marking the amount, quality, and situation of the different <lb/>
            divisions of the army, and the employment of them on any <lb/>
            expeditions; inquiring also with unwearied diligence into <lb/>
            the extent of the supplies of arms and provisions, and <lb/>
            other things likely to be needful in war.</p>
          <p>2. And when he had made himself acquainted with all <lb/>
            the internal circumstances of the East, and had learnt that <lb/>
            a great portion of the troops and of the money for their <lb/>
            pay was distributed in Illyricum, where the emperor him- <lb/>
            self was detained by serious business ; as the day was now <lb/>
            approaching which had been fixed for the payment of the <lb/>
            money for which he had been constrained by fear to give <lb/>
            an acknowledgment of his bond; and as he saw that he <lb/>
            must be overwhelmed by disasters on all sides, since the <lb/>
            chief treasurer was devoted to the interests of his adversary; <lb/>
            he conceived the audacious design of crossing over to the <lb/>
            Persians with his wife and children, and his whole nume- <lb/>
            rous family of relations.</p>
          <p>3. And to elude the observation of the soldiers at. their <lb/>
            different stations, he bought for a small price a farm <lb/>
            in Hiaspis, a district on the banks of the Tigris. And, <lb/>
            relying on this pretext, since no one would venture to ask <lb/>
            why a landed proprietor should go to the extreme frontier <lb/>
            of the Roman territory, as many others did the same, by <lb/>
            the agency of some trusty friends who were skilful <lb/>
            swimmers, he carried on frequent secret negotiations with <lb/>
            Tamsapor, who was at that time governing the country on <lb/>
            the other side of the river with the rank of duke, and with <lb/>
            whom he was already acquainted. And at last, having <lb/>
            received from the Persian camp an escort of well-mounted <lb/>
            men, he embarked in some boats, and crossed over at night <lb/>
            with all his family, in the same manner as Zopyrus, the <lb/>
            betrayer of Babylon, had formerly done, only with an <lb/>
            opposite object.</p>
          <p>4. While affairs in Mesopotamia were in this state, the <lb/>
            hangers-on of the palace, always singing the same song <lb/>
            for our destruction, at last found a handle to injure the <lb/>
            gallant Ursicinus; the gang of eunuchs being still the <lb/>
            contrivers and promoters of the plot; since they are <lb/>
            always sour tempered and savage, and having no relations, <lb/>
            cling to riches as their dearest kindred.</p>
          <p>5. The design now adopted was to send Sabinianus, a <lb/>
            withered old man of great wealth, but infirm and timid, <pb n="170"/>
            <note type="margin"> BK. XVIII. CH. V. </note> <lb/>
            and from the lowness of his birth far removed from any <lb/>
            office of command, to govern the districts of the East; <lb/>
            while Ursicinus should be recalled to court, to command <lb/>
            the infantry, as successor to Barbatio. And then he, this <lb/>
            greedy promoter of revolution, as they called him, being <lb/>
            within their reach, could easily be attacked by his bitter <lb/>
            and formidable enemies.</p>
          <p>6. While these things were going on in the camp <lb/>
            of Constantius, as at a festival or a theatre, and while <lb/>
            the dispensers of rank which was bought and sold were <lb/>
            distributing the price agreed upon among the influential <lb/>
            houses, Antoninus, having reached Sapor's winter quarters, <lb/>
            was received with gladness; and being ennobled by the <lb/>
            grant of a turban, an honour which gives admission to the <lb/>
            royal table, and also that of assisting at and delivering <lb/>
            one's opinion in the councils of the Persians, went onwards, <lb/>
            not with a punt pole or a tar rope, as the proverb is <lb/>
            (that is to say, not by any tedious or circuitous path), but <lb/>
            with flowing sails into the conduct of state affairs, and <lb/>
            stirring up Sapor, as formerly Maharbal roused the sluggish <lb/>
            Hannibal, was always telling him that he knew how to <lb/>
            conquer, but not how to use a victory.</p>
          <p>7. For having been bred up in active life, and being a <lb/>
            thorough man of business, he got possession of the feelings <lb/>
            of his hearers, who like what tickles their cars, and who <lb/>
            do not utter their praises aloud, but, like the Phæacians <lb/>
            in Homer, admire in silence,' while he recounted the <lb/>
            events of the last forty years; urging that, after all these <lb/>
            continual wars, and especially the battles of Hileia and <lb/>
            Singara,2 where that fierce combat by night took place, in <lb/>
            which we lost a vast number of our men, as if some fecial <lb/>
            had interposed to stop them, the Persians, though victo- <lb/>
            rious, had never advanced as far as Edessa or the bridges <lb/>
            over the Euphrates. Though with their warlike power <note type="footnote"> I Homer, Od. xiii. 1; translated by Pope- <lb/>

            and splendid success, they might have pushed their advan- <lb/>
            tages, especially at that moment, when in consequence of <lb/>
            the protracted troubles of their civil wars the blood of the <lb/>
            Romans was being poured out on all sides.</p>
          <p>8. By these and similar speeches the deserter, pie- <lb/>
            serving his sobriety at the banquets, where, after the <lb/>
            fashion of the ancient Greeks, the Persians deliberate on <lb/>
            war and other important affairs, stimulated the fiery <lb/>
            monarch, and persuaded him to rely upon the greatness of <lb/>
            his fortune, and to take up arms the moment that the <lb/>
            winter was over, and he himself boldly promised his assist- <lb/>
            ance in many important matters.</p>

          <p>§ 1. ABOUT this time Sabinianus, being elated at the <lb/>
            power which he had suddenly acquired, and having arrived <lb/>
            in Cilicia, gave his predecessor letters from the emperor, <lb/>
            desiring him to hasten to court to be invested with higher <lb/>
            dignities. In fact the affairs of Asia were in such a <lb/>
            state that, even if Ursicinus had been at Ultima Thule <lb/>
            their urgency would have required him to be summoned <lb/>
            thence to set them right, since he was a man of the <lb/>
            ancient discipline, and from long experience especially <lb/>
            skilful in the Persian manner of conducting war.</p>
          <p>2. But when the report of this reached the provinces, <lb/>
            all ranks of the citizens and agricultural population, by <lb/>
            formal edicts and by unanimous outcries, endeavoured <lb/>
            to detain him, almost forcibly, as the public defender of <lb/>
            their country, remembering that though for ten years <lb/>
            he had been left to his own resources with a scanty and <lb/>
            unwarlike force, he had yet incurred no loss ; and fearing <lb/>
            for their safety if at so critical a time he should be <lb/>
            removed and a man of utter inactivity assume the rule in <lb/>
            his stead.</p>
          <p>3. We believe, and indeed there is no doubt of it, that fame <lb/>
            flies on wings through the paths of the air; and she it was <lb/>
            who now gave information of these events to the Persians <lb/>
            while deliberating on the entire aspect of affairs. At last, <lb/>
            after many arguments pro and con, they determined, on <lb/>
            the advice of Antoninus, that as Ursicinus was removed, <lb/>
            and as the new governor was contemptible, they might <pb n="172"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVIII. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            venture to neglect laying siege to cities, an operation <lb/>
            which would cause a mischievous loss of time, and at once <lb/>
            cross the Euphrates, and advance further, in order, out- <lb/>
            stripping all rumour of their march, to occupy those pro- <lb/>
            vinces which, throughout all our wars, had always been <lb/>
            safe (except in the time of Gallicnus), and which, from <lb/>
            their long enjoyment of peace, were very wealthy. And <lb/>
            in this enterprise, with the favour of God, Antoninus of- <lb/>
            fered himself as a most desirable guide.</p>
          <p>4. His advice, therefore, being unanimously praised and <lb/>
            adopted, and the attention of the whole nation being <lb/>
            directed to the speedy collection of those things which <lb/>
            were required, supplies, soldiers, arms, and equipments, <lb/>
            the preparation of everything for the coming campaign <lb/>
            was continued the whole winter.</p>
          <p>5. In the mean time, we, hastening at the emperor's com- <lb/>
            mand towards Italy, after having been detained a short <lb/>
            time on the western side of Mount Taurus, reached the <lb/>
            river Hebrus, which descends from the mountains of the <lb/>
            Odrysæ1, and there we received letters from the emperor, <lb/>
            ordering us, without the least delay, to return to Meso- <lb/>
            potamia, without any officers, and having, indeed, no im- <lb/>
            portant duty to discharge, since all the power had been <lb/>
            transferred to another.</p>
          <p>6. And this had been arranged by those mischievous <lb/>
            meddlers in the government, in order that if the Persians <lb/>
            failed and returned to their own country, our success <lb/>
            might be attributed to the valour of the new governor; <lb/>
            while, if our affairs turned out ill, Ursicinus might be <lb/>
            impeached as a traitor to the republic.</p>
          <p>7. Accordingly we, being tossed about without any <lb/>
            reason, after much time had been lost, returned, and found <lb/>
            Sabinianus, a man full of pride, of small stature, and of a <lb/>
            petty and narrow mind, scarcely able without fear to <lb/>
            encounter the slight noise of a beast, much less to face the <lb/>
            crash of battle.</p>
          <p>8. Nevertheless, since our spies brought positive and <lb/>
            consistent intelligence that all kind of preparations were <lb/>
            going on among the enemy, and since their report was <lb/>
            confirmed by that of the deserters, while this manikin <lb/>
            was in a state of perplexity, we hastened to Nisibis to <note type="footnote">1 The Maritza, rising in Mount Hæmus, now the Balkan. </note> <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            make such preparation as seemed requisite, lest the Persians, <lb/>
            while concealing their intention to besiege it, should come <lb/>
            upon it by surprise.</p>
          <p>9. And while all things necessary were being pressed <lb/>
            forward within the walls, continued fires and columns of <lb/>
            smoke being seen on the other side of the Tigris, near <lb/>
            the town called the Camp of the Moors, and Sisara, and <lb/>
            the other districts on the Persian frontier, and spreading up <lb/>
            to the city itself, showed that the predatory bands of the <lb/>
            enemy had crossed the river, and entered our territories.</p>
          <p>10. And therefore we hastened forwards with a forced <lb/>
            march, to prevent the roads from being occupied; and <lb/>
            when we had advanced two miles, we saw a fine boy of <lb/>
            about eight years old, as we guessed, wearing a necklace, of <lb/>
            noble appearance, standing on the top of a small hillock, <lb/>
            and crying out, stating himself to be the son of a man of <lb/>
            noble birth, whom his mother, while fleeing in her alarm <lb/>
            at the approach of the enemy, had left in her panic in <lb/>
            order to be less encumbered. We pitied him, and at the <lb/>
            command of our general, I put him on my horse, in front <lb/>
            of me, and took him back to the city, while the predatory <lb/>
            bands of the enemy, having blockaded the city, were <lb/>
            ravaging all around.</p>
          <p>11. And because I was alarmed at the difficulties in <lb/>
            which we should be placed by a blockade, I put the child <lb/>
            in at a half-open postern gate, and hastened back with <lb/>
            all speed to my troop. And I was very nearly taken <lb/>
            prisoner; for a tribune named Abdigidus, accompanied <lb/>
            by a groom, was fleeing, pursued by a squadron of <lb/>
            cavalry, and though the master escaped the servant was <lb/>
            taken. And as I was passing by rapidly, they, examining <lb/>
            the servant, inquired of him who was the chief who had <lb/>
            advanced against them• and when they heard that Ursi- <lb/>
            cinus had a little while before entered the city, and was <lb/>
            on his way to Mount Izala, they put their informant to <lb/>
            death, and then, forming into one body, pursued us with <lb/>
            ceaseless speed.</p>
          <p>12. But I outstripped them by the speed of my horse, <lb/>
            and finding my comrades reposing securely under the walls <lb/>
            of a slight fort, called Amudis, with their horses dispersed <lb/>
            over the grass, I waved my hand, and raising the hem of <lb/>
            my cloak: by this usual signal I gave notice that the <pb n="174"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVIII. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            enemy was at hand, and then joining them we retreated <lb/>
            together, though my horse was greatly fatigued.</p>
          <p>13. Our alarm was increased by the brightness of the <lb/>
            night, as the moon was full, and by the even level of the <lb/>
            plain, which, if our danger should become worse, afforded <lb/>
            no possible hiding-place, as having neither trees, nor <lb/>
            bushes, nor anything but low herbage.</p>
          <p>14. Accordingly we adopted the following plan : we lit <lb/>
            a lamp and fastened it tightly on a horse, which we <lb/>
            turned loose without a rider, and let go where it pleased <lb/>
            to our left, while we marched towards the high ground on <lb/>
            our right, in order that the Persians might fancy the light <lb/>
            a torch held before the general as he proceeded slowly <lb/>
            forwards, and so keep on in that direction. And unless <lb/>
            we had adopted this precaution we should have been cir- <lb/>
            cumvented, and have fallen as prisoners into the power of <lb/>
            the enemy.</p>
          <p>15. Being delivered from this danger, when we had <lb/>
            come to a woody spot, full of vines and fruit-bearing <lb/>
            trees, called Meiacarire, a name derived from the coot <lb/>
            springs found there, we found that the inhabitants had all <lb/>
            fled, and there was only a single soldier remaining behind, <lb/>
            concealed in a remote comer. And when he was brought <lb/>
            before our general, and through fear told all kinds of <lb/>
            different stories, and so became an object of suspicion; at <lb/>
            last, under the compulsion of our threats, he told the real <lb/>
            truth, that he was a native of Gaul, and had been born <lb/>
            among the Parisii, that he had served in our cavalry, but <lb/>
            that fearing punishment for some offence he had deserted <lb/>
            to the Persians; that he had since married a wife of ex- <lb/>
            cellent character, and had a family, and that having been <lb/>
            frequently sent as a spy to our camp, he had always <lb/>
            brought the Persians true intelligence. And now he <lb/>
            said he had been sent by the nobles Tamsapor and <lb/>
            Nohodares, who were in command of the predatory bands, <lb/>
            to bring them such intelligence as he could collect. After <lb/>
            telling us this, and also that he knew of the operations <lb/>
            of the enemy, he was put to death.</p>
          <p>16. Afterwards, as our anxiety increased, we proceeded <lb/>
            from thence with as much speed as we could make to <lb/>
            Amida, a city celebrated at a later period for the disaster <lb/>
            which befcl it. And when our scouts had rejoined us there <pb n="175"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            we found in one of their scabbards a scrap of parchment <lb/>
            written in cipher, which they had been ordered to convey <lb/>
            to us by Procopius, whom I have already spoken of as <lb/>
            ambassador to the Persians with the Count Lucillianus; <lb/>
            its terms were purposely obscure, lest if the bearers should <lb/>
            be taken prisoners, and the sense of the writing under- <lb/>
            stood, materials should be found for fatal mischief.</p>
          <p>17. The purport was, " The ambassadors of the Greeks, <lb/>
            having been rejected, and being perhaps to be put to death, <lb/>
            the aged king, not contented with the Hellespont, will <lb/>
            throw bridges over the Granicus and the Rhyndacus, and <lb/>
            invade Asia Minor with a numerous host, being by his own <lb/>
            natural disposition irritable and fierce; and being now <lb/>
            prompted and inflamed by him who was formerly the suc- <lb/>
            cessor of the Roman emperor Hadrian,1 it is all over with <lb/>
            the Greeks if they do not take care."</p>
          <p>18. The meaning of this was that the Persian king, <lb/>
            having crossed the rivers Anzaba and Tigris, at the <lb/>
            prompting of Antoninus was aiming at the sovereignty of <lb/>
            the entire East. When it had been interpreted with diffi- <lb/>
            culty, from its great obscurity, a wise plan was decided <lb/>
            on.</p>
          <p>19. The satrap of Corduena, a province under the au- <lb/>
            thority of the Persians, was a man named Jovinianus, who <lb/>
            had grown up to manhood in the Roman territories, and <lb/>
            was secretly friendly to us, because he had been detained <lb/>
            as a hostage in Syria, and being now allured by the love of <lb/>
            liberal studies, he was exceedingly desirous to return <lb/>
            among us.</p>
          <p>20. To this man I, being sent with a faithful centurion, <lb/>
            for the purpose of learning with greater certainty what was <lb/>
            being done, reached' him by travelling over pathless <lb/>
            mountains, and dangerous denies. And when he saw and <lb/>
            recognized me, he received me courteously, and I avowed <lb/>
            to him alone the reason of my coming; and having received <lb/>
            from him a silent guide, well acquainted with the country, <lb/>
            I was sent to some lofty rocks at a distance, from which, <lb/>
            if one's eyes did not fail, one could see even the most <lb/>
            minute object fifty miles off.</p>
          <p>21. There we remained two whole days; and on the <lb/>
            morning of the third day we saw all the circuit of the <note type="footnote">1 Antoninus is meant, as Hadrian was succeeded by Antoninus Piua </note> <pb n="176"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVII. CH. VII </note> <lb/>
            earth, which we call the horizon, filled with countless hosts <lb/>
            of men, and the king marching before them glittering with <lb/>
            the brilliancy of his robes. And next to him on his left <lb/>
            hand marched Grumbates, king of the Chionitæ, a man of <lb/>
            middle age, and wrinkled limbs, but of a grand spirit, <lb/>
            and already distinguished for many victories. On his <lb/>
            right hand was the king of the Albani, of equal rank and <lb/>
            spendour. After them came various generals, renowned <lb/>
            for their rank and power, who were followed by a multi- <lb/>
            tude of all classes, picked from the flower of the neighbour- <lb/>
            ing nations, and trained by long hardship to endure any <lb/>
            toil or danger.</p>

            of Doriscus,l the Thracian town, and of the army counted <lb/>
            there in battalions in a fenced space, when we careful, or <lb/>
            to speak more truly, cautious historians, exaggerate nothing, <lb/>
            and merely record what is established by evidence neither <lb/>
            doubtful nor uncertain!</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER the kings had passed by Nineveh, an important <lb/>
            city of the province of Adiabena, they offered a sacrifice <lb/>
            in the middle of the bridge over the Anzaba, and as the <lb/>
            omens were favourable, they advanced with great joy; <lb/>
            while we, calculating that the rest of their host could <lb/>
            hardly pass over in three days, returned with speed to <lb/>
            the satrap, and rested, refreshing ourselves by his hospi- <lb/>
            table kindness.</p>
          <p>2. And returning from thence through a deserted and <lb/>
            solitary country, under the pressure of great necessity, and <lb/>
            reaching our army more rapidly than could have been <lb/>
            expected, we brought to those who were hesitating the <lb/>
            certain intelligence that the kings had crossed over the <lb/>
            river by a bridge of boats, and were marching straight <lb/>
            towards us.</p>
          <p>3. Without delay, therefore, horsemen with horses of <lb/>
            picked speed were sent to Cassianus, duke of Mesopotamia, <lb/>
            and to Euphronius, at that time the governor of the <lb/>
            province, to compel the residents in the country to retire <note type="footnote">1 Doriscus was the town where Xerxes reviewed and counted his <lb/>
            army, as is related by Herodotus, vii. 60. </note> <pb n="177"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            with their families and all their flocks to a safer place ; and <lb/>
            to quit at once the town of Carræ, which was defended <lb/>
            by very slight walls; and further, to burn all the stand <lb/>
            ing crops, that the enemy might get no supplies from the <lb/>
            land.</p>
          <p>4. And when these orders had been executed, as they <lb/>
            were without delay, and when the fire was kindled, the <lb/>
            violence of the raging element so completely destroyed all <lb/>
            the corn,' which was just beginning to swell and turn <lb/>
            yellow, and all the young herbage, that from the Euphrates <lb/>
            to the Tigris nothing green was to be seen. And many <lb/>
            wild beasts were burnt, and especially lions, who infest <lb/>
            these districts terribly, but who are often destroyed or <lb/>
            blinded in this manner.</p>
          <p>5. They wander in countless droves among the beds of <lb/>
            rushes on the banks of the rivers of Mesopotamia, and in <lb/>
            the jungles; and lie quiet all the winter, which is very <lb/>
            mild in that country. But when the warm weather <lb/>
            returns, as these regions are exposed to great heat, they <lb/>
            are forced out by the vapours, and by the size of the <lb/>
            gnats, with swarms of which every part of that country <lb/>
            is filled. And these winged insects attack the eyes, as <lb/>
            being both moist and sparkling, sitting on and biting the <lb/>
            eyelids; the lions, unable to bear the torture, are either <lb/>
            drowned in the rivers, to which they flee for refuge, or <lb/>
            else by frequent scratchings tear their eyes out themselves <lb/>
            with their claws, and then become mad. And if this did <note type="footnote">1 “Ammianus has marked the chronology of this year by three <lb/>
            signs which do not perfectly coincide with each other, or with the <lb/>
            series of the history:—1. The corn was ripe when Sapor invaded <lb/>
            Mesopotamia, ‘cum jura stipulâ, flavento turgerent’—a circumstance <lb/>
            which, in the latitude of Aleppo, would naturally refer us to the <lb/>
            month of April or May. 2. The progress of Sapor was checked by the <lb/>
            overflowing of the Euphrates, which generally happens in July and <lb/>
            August. 3. When Sapor had taken Amida, after a siege of seventy- <lb/>
            three days, the autumn was far advanced. ' Autumno præcipiti hsedo- <lb/>
            rumque improbo sidere exorto.' To reconcile these apparent contra- <lb/>
            dictions, we must allow for some delay in the Persian king, some <lb/>
            inaccuracy in the historian, and some disorder in the seasons.”—Gibbon, <lb/>
            cap. xix.; ed. Bohn, vol. ii. 320. " Clinton, F. R., i. 442, sees no such <lb/>
            difficulty as Gibbon has here supposed; he makes Sapor to have passed <lb/>
            the Tigris in May, reached the Euphrates July 8th, arrived before <lb/>
            Amida July 27th, and stormed the place October 7th.”—Editor of <lb/>
            Bohn's ed. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>

            not happen the whole of the East would be overrun with <lb/>
            beasts of this kind.</p>
          <p>6. While the plains were thus being laid waste by fire, <lb/>
            as I have described, the tribunes, who were sent with a <lb/>
            body of protectores, fortified all the western bank of the <lb/>
            Euphrates with castles and sharp palisades and every <lb/>
            kind of defence, fixing also large engines for hurling <lb/>
            missiles on those spots where the more tranquil condition <lb/>
            of the river made it likely that the enemy might attempt <lb/>
            to cross.</p>
          <p>7. While these things were being expeditiously done, <lb/>
            Sabinianus, chosen in the hurried moment of general <lb/>
            danger as the fittest conductor of an internecine war, was <lb/>
            living luxuriously, according to his custom, at the tombs of <lb/>
            Edessa,1 as if he had established peace with the dead, <lb/>
            and had nothing to fear: and he took especial pleasure <lb/>
            in breaking the silence of the place with the sounding <lb/>
            measures of the martial pyathicari, instead of the usual <lb/>
            theatrical exhibitions ; a fancy, considering the place, preg- <lb/>
            nant with omens. Since these and similar gloomy scenes <lb/>
            foreshow future commotions, as we learn in the progress <lb/>
            of time, all good men ought to avoid them.</p>
          <p>8. In the mean time, passing by Nisibis as of no import- <lb/>
            ance, while the conflagration increased through the dry- <lb/>
            ness of the crops, the kings, dreading a scarcity of food, <lb/>
            marched through the grassy valleys at the foot of the <lb/>
            mountains.</p>
          <p>9. When they had arrived at a small place called <lb/>
            Bebase (from which place to the town of Constantina, <lb/>
            which is one hundred miles distant, the whole country is <lb/>
            an arid desert, except where a little water is found in <lb/>
            some wells), they hesitated for some time, doubting what <lb/>
            to do; and at last resolving to proceed in reliance on the <lb/>
            endurance of their men, they learnt from a trusty spy that <lb/>
            the Euphrates was swollen by the melting of the snow, and <lb/>
            was now extensively inundating the adjacent lands, and <lb/>
            so could not possibly be forded.</p>
          <p>10. Therefore they turned to see what opportunities <lb/>
            chance might afford them, being now cut off unexpectedly <lb/>
            from the hope which they had conceived. And in the <note type="footnote">1 That is, in the suburbs of Edessa, as cemeteries in ancient times <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> A.D. 369 </note> <lb/>
            present emergency a council was held, at which Antoninus <lb/>
            was requested to give his advice : and he counselled them <lb/>
            to direct their march to the right, so that by a longer circuit <lb/>
            they might reach the two strong forts of Barzala and Lau- <lb/>
            dias, to which he could guide them through a region fertile <lb/>
            in everything, and still undestroyed, since the march of the <lb/>
            army was expected to. be made in a straight line. And <lb/>
            the only river on their road was one small and narrow, to <lb/>
            be passed near its source, before it was increased by any <lb/>
            other streams, and easily fordable.</p>
          <p>11. When they had heard this, they praised their <lb/>
            adviser, and bidding him lead the way, the whole army <lb/>
            turned from its previously appointed line, and followed his <lb/>
            guidance.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHEN our generals received intelligence of this from <lb/>
            their spies, we settled to march in haste to Samosata, in <lb/>
            order to cross the river at that point, and destroying the <lb/>
            bridges at Zeugma and Capersana, to check the invasion of <lb/>
            the enemy if we could find a favourable chance for attack- <lb/>
            ing them.</p>
          <p>2. But we met with a sad disaster, worthy to be buried <lb/>
            in profound silence. For two squadrons of cavalry, of <lb/>
            about seven hundred men, who had just been sent from <lb/>
            lllyricum to Mesopotamia as a reinforcement, and who <lb/>
            were guarding the passes; becoming enervated and timid, <lb/>
            and fearing a surprise by night, withdrew from the public <lb/>
            causeways in the evening, a time above all others when <lb/>
            they most required watching.</p>
          <p>3. And when it was remarked that they were all sunk in <lb/>
            wine and sleep, about twenty thousand Persians, under the <lb/>
            command of Tamsapor and Nohodares, passed without any <lb/>
            one perceiving them, and fully armed as they were, con- <lb/>
            cealed themselves behind the high ground in the neigh- <lb/>
            bourhood of Amida.</p>
          <p>4. Presently, when (as has been said) we started before <lb/>
            daybreak on our march to Samosata, our advanced guard, <lb/>
            on reaching a high spot which commanded a more distant <lb/>
            view, was suddenly alarmed by the glitter of shining <lb/>
            arms; and cried out in a hurried manner that the enemy <pb n="180"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVIII. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            were at hand. Upon this the signal for battle was given, <lb/>
            and we halted in a solid column, never thinking of <lb/>
            fleeing, since, indeed, those who would have pursued us <lb/>
            were in sight; nor to engage in battle with an enemy <lb/>
            superior to us in numbers, and especially in cavalry; but <lb/>
            seeing the necessity for caution in the danger of certain <lb/>
            death which lay before us.</p>
          <p>5. At last, when it seemed clear that a battle could not <lb/>
            be avoided, and while we were still hesitating what to do, <lb/>
            some of our men rashly advanced as skirmishers, and were <lb/>
            slain. And then, as each side pressed onwards, Antoninus, <lb/>
            ambitiously marching in front of the enemy, was recognized <lb/>
            by Ursicinus, and addressed by him in a tone of reproach, <lb/>
            and called a traitor and a scoundrel; till at last, taking off <lb/>
            the tiara which he wore on his head as a badge of honour, <lb/>
            he dismounted from his horse, and bending down till his <lb/>
            face nearly touched the ground, he saluted the Roman <lb/>
            general, calling him patron and master; and holding his <lb/>
            hands behind his back, which among the Assyrians is a <lb/>
            gesture of supplication, he said, " Pardon me, most noble <lb/>
            count, who have been driven to this guilt by necessity, <lb/>
            not by my own will. My creditors, as you know, drove <lb/>
            me headlong into it: men whose avarice even your high <lb/>
            authority, which tried to support me in my distress, could <lb/>
            not overcome." Having said this, he withdrew without <lb/>
            turning his back upon him, but retiring backwards in a <lb/>
            respectful manner, with his face towards him.</p>
          <p>6. And while this was taking place, which did not <lb/>
            occupy above half an hour, our second rank, which <lb/>
            occupied the higher ground, cried out that another body of <lb/>
            cuirassiers appeared behind, and was coming on with great <lb/>
            speed.</p>
          <p>7. And then, as is often the case at critical moments, <lb/>
            doubting which enemy we ought, or even could resist, and <lb/>
            being pressed on all sides by an overwhelming mass, wo <lb/>
            dispersed in every direction, each fleeing where he could. <lb/>
            And while every one was trying to extricate himself from <lb/>
            the danger, we were brought, without any order, face to <lb/>
            face with the enemy.</p>
          <p>8. And so struggling vigorously while giving up all <lb/>
            desire of saving our lives, we were driven back to the <lb/>
            high banks of the Tigris. Some of our men, driven into <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            the water where it was shallow, locked their arms, and so <lb/>
            made a stand ; others were carried off by the current and <lb/>
            drowned; some, still fighting with the enemy, met with <lb/>
            various fortune, or, panic-stricken at the numbers of the <lb/>
            barbarians, sought the nearest defiles of Mount Taurus. <lb/>
            Among these was the general himself, who was recognized <lb/>
            and surrounded by a vast body of the enemy; but he <lb/>
            escaped with the tribune Aiadalthes and one groom, being <lb/>
            saved by the swiftness of his horse.</p>
          <p>9. I myself was separated from my comrades, and <lb/>
            while looking round to see what to do, I met with one <lb/>
            of the protect ores named Verennianus, whose thigh was <lb/>
            pierced through by an arrow, and while at his entreaty I <lb/>
            was trying to pull it out, I found myself surrounded on all <lb/>
            sides by Persians, some of whom had passed beyond me. I <lb/>
            therefore hastened back with all speed towards the city, <lb/>
            which, being placed on high ground, is only accessible <lb/>
            by one very narrow path on the side on which we were <lb/>
            attacked; and that path is made narrower still by escarp- <lb/>
            ments of the rocks, and barriers built on purpose to make <lb/>
            the approach more difficult.</p>
          <p>10. Here we became mingled with the Persians, who were <lb/>
            hastening with a run, racing with us, to make themselves <lb/>
            masters of the higher ground: and till the dawn of the <lb/>
            next day we stood without moving, so closely packed, that <lb/>
            the bodies of those who were slain were so propped up <lb/>
            by the mass that they could not find room to fall to the <lb/>
            ground ; and a soldier in front of me, whose head was <lb/>
            cloven asunder into equal portions by a mighty sword- <lb/>
            blow, still stood upright like a log, being pressed upon all <lb/>
            sides.</p>
          <p>11. And although javelins were incessantly hurled from <lb/>
            the battlements by every kind of engine, yet we were pro- <lb/>
            tected from that danger by the proximity of the walls. <lb/>
            And at last I got in at the postern gate, which I found <lb/>
            thronged by a multitude of both sexes flocking in from the <lb/>
            neighbouring districts. For it happened by chance on <lb/>
            these very days that it was the time of a great annual fair <lb/>
            which was held in the suburbs, and which was visited by <lb/>
            multitudes of the country people.</p>
          <p>12. In the mean time all was in disorder with every <lb/>
            kind of noise; some bewailing those whom they had lost; <pb n="182"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XVIII CH. IX. </note> <lb/>
            others being mortally wounded ; and many calling on their <lb/>
            different relations whom the crowd prevented them from <lb/>
            discovering.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THIS city had formerly been a very small one, till <lb/>
            Constantius while Cæsar, at the same time that he built <lb/>
            another town called Antinopolis, surrounded Amida also <lb/>
            with strong towers and stout walls, that the people in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood might have a safe place of refuge. And <lb/>
            he placed there a store of mural engines, making it for- <lb/>
            midable to the enemy, as he wished it to be called by his <lb/>
            own name.</p>
          <p>2. On the southern side it is watered by the Tigris, <lb/>
            which passes close to it, making a kind of elbow: on the <lb/>
            east it looks towards the plains of Mesopotamia, on the <lb/>
            north it is close to the river Nymphaeus, and is over- <lb/>
            shadowed by the chain of Mount Taurus, which sepa- <lb/>
            rates the nations on the other side of the Tigris from <lb/>
            Armenia. On the west it borders on the province of <lb/>
            Gumathena, a fertile and well-cultivated district, in which <lb/>
            is a village known as Abarne, celebrated for the healing <lb/>
            properties of its hot springs. But in the very centre of <lb/>
            Amida, under the citadel, there rises a rich spring of water, <lb/>
            drinkable indeed, but often tainted with hot vapours.</p>
          <p>3. In the garrison of this town, the fifth or Parthian <lb/>
            legion was always located with a considerable squadron <lb/>
            of native cavalry. But at that time six legions, by forced <lb/>
            marches, had outstripped the Persian host in its advance, <lb/>
            and greatly strengthened the garrison: they were the <lb/>
            Magnentian and Decentian legions whom, after the end of <lb/>
            the civil war, the emperor had sent as mutinous and dis- <lb/>
            contented to the East, since there the only danger was <lb/>
            from foreign wars: the tenth, and the thirteenth legion <lb/>

            we have already! spoken, as sallying out from Singara at <lb/>
            the instigation of this same Ælian, then only one of the <lb/>
            guard, and slaying a great number of Persians whom they <lb/>
            had surprised in their sleep.</p>
          <p>4. There was also the greater part of the force called <lb/>
            companion archers, being squadrons of cavalry so named, <lb/>
            in which all the freeborn barbarians serve, and who are <lb/>
            conspicuous among all others for the splendour of their <lb/>
            arms and for their prowess.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the first onset of the Persians was by its unex- <lb/>
            pected vehemence throwing these troops into disorder, <lb/>
            the king, with his native and foreign troops, having after <lb/>
            leaving Debase turned his march to the right, according to <lb/>
            the advice of Antoninus, passed by Horre and Meiacarire <lb/>
            and Charcha, as if he meant also to pass by Amida. And <lb/>
            when he had come near the Roman forts, one of which is <lb/>
            called Reman, and the other Busan, he learnt from some <lb/>
            deserters that many persons had removed their treasures <lb/>
            there for protection, trusting to their lofty and strong <lb/>
            walls; and it was also added that there was there, with a <lb/>
            great many valuables, a woman of exquisite beauty, the <lb/>
            wife of a citizen of Nisibis named Craugasius, of great con- <lb/>
            sideration by birth, character, and influence; with her little <lb/>
            daughter.</p>
          <p>2. Sapor, eager to seize what belonged to another, <lb/>
            hastened on, and attacked the castle with force; and the <lb/>
            garrison, being seized with a sudden panic at the variety of <lb/>
            arms of the assailants, surrendered themselves, and all who <lb/>
            had fled to them for protection ; and -at the first summons <lb/>
            gave up the keys of the gates. Possession being taken, all <lb/>
            that was stored there was ransacked; women bewildered <lb/>
            with fear were dragged forth; and children clinging to <lb/>
            their mothers were taught bitter suffering at the very <lb/>
            beginning of their infancy.</p>
          <p>3. And when Sapor, by asking each whose wife she was, <lb/>
            had found that of Craugasius trembling with fear of <lb/>
            violence, he allowed her to come in safety to him, and <lb/>
            when he saw her, veiled as she was with a black veil <lb/>
            to her lips, he kindly encouraged her with a promise that <note type="footnote">1 In one of the earlier books which has been lost.</note> <pb n="184"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIX. </note> <lb/>
            she should recover her husband, and that her honour <lb/>
            should be preserved inviolate. For hearing that her <lb/>
            husband was exceedingly devoted to her, he thought that <lb/>
            by this bribe he might win him over to betray Nisibis.</p>
          <p>4. And he also extended his protection to other virgins <lb/>
            who, according to Christian rites, had been formally con- <lb/>
            secrated to the service of God, ordering that they should <lb/>
            be kept uninjured, and be allowed to perform the offices of <lb/>
            religion as they had been accustomed. Affecting clemency <lb/>
            for a time, in order that those who were alarmed at his <lb/>
            former ferocity and cruelty might now discard their fears, <lb/>
            and come to him of their own accord, learning from these <lb/>
            recent examples that he tempered the greatness of his suc- <lb/>
            cess with humanity and courtesy.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THE king, rejoicing at this our disaster and captivity, <lb/>
            and expecting other successes, advanced from this castle, <lb/>
            and marching slowly, on the third day came to Amida.</p>
          <p>2. And at daybreak, everything, as far as we could see, <lb/>
            glittered with shining arms; and an iron cavalry filled the <lb/>
            plains and the hills.</p>
          <p>3. And he himself, mounted on his charger, and being <lb/>
            taller than the rest, led his whole army, wearing instead <lb/>
            of a crown a golden figure of a ram's head inlaid with <lb/>
            jewels; being also splendid from the retinue of men of high <lb/>
            rank and of different nations which followed him. And it <lb/>
            was evident that his purpose was merely to try the garrison <lb/>
            of the walls with a parley, as, in following out the counsel <lb/>
            of Antoninus, he was hastening to another quarter.</p>
          <p>4. But the deity of heaven, mercifully limiting the dis- <lb/>
            asters of the empire within the compass of one region, led <lb/>
            on this king to such an extravagant degree of elation, that <lb/>
            he seemed to believe that the moment he made his appear- <lb/>
            ance the besieged would be suddenly panic-stricken, and <lb/>
            have recourse to supplication and entreaty.</p>
          <p>5. He rode up to the gates, escorted by the cohort of <lb/>
            his royal guard; and while pushing on more boldly, so <lb/>
            that his very features might be plainly recognized, his <lb/>
            ornaments made him such a mark for arrows and other <lb/>
            missiles, that he would have been slain, if the dust had not <lb/>
            hindered the sight of those who were shooting at him; so <lb/>
            that after a part of his robe had been cut off by a blow of <lb/>
            a javelin, he escaped to cause vast slaughter at a future <lb/>
            time.</p>
          <p>6. After this, raging as if against sacrilegious men who <lb/>
            had violated a temple, he cried out that the lord of so many <lb/>
            monarchs and nations had been insulted, and resolved to <lb/>
            use all his efforts to destroy the city. But at the entreaty <lb/>
            of his choicest generals not to break the example of mercy <lb/>
            which he had so gloriously set, by indulging in anger, he <lb/>
            was pacified, and the next day ordered the garrison to be <lb/>
            summoned to surrender.</p>
          <p>7. Therefore, at daybreak, Grumbates, king of the Chi- <lb/>
            onitæ, went boldly up to the walls to effect that object, <pb n="186"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIX. CH. II. </note> <lb/>
            with a brave body of guards ; and when a skilful recon- <lb/>
            noitrer had noticed him coming within shot, he let fly his <lb/>
            balista, and struck down his son in the flower of his youth, <lb/>
            who was at his father's side, piercing through his breast- <lb/>
            plate, breast and all; and he was a prince who in stature <lb/>
            and beauty was superior to all his comrades.</p>
          <p>8. At his death all his countrymen took to flight, but <lb/>
            presently returning in order to prevent his body from being <lb/>
            carried off, and having roused with their dissonant cla- <lb/>
            mours various tribes to their aid, a stern conflict arose, the <lb/>
            arrows flying on both sides like hail.</p>
          <p>9. The deadly struggle having been continued till the <lb/>
            close of day, it was nightfall before the corpse of the <lb/>
            young prince, which had been so stubbornly defended, was <lb/>
            extricated from the heap of dead and streams of blood, <lb/>
            amid the thick darkness ; as formerly at Troy, the armies <lb/>
            fought in furious combat for the comrade of the Thessalian <lb/>
            chieftain.1</p>
          <p>10. At his death the count was sad, and all the nobles as <lb/>
            well as his father were distressed at his sudden loss; and <lb/>
            a cessation of arms having been ordered, the youth, so <lb/>
            noble and beloved, was mourned after the fashion of his <lb/>
            nation. He was carried out in the arms he was wont to <lb/>
            wear, and placed on a spacious and lofty pile; around him <lb/>
            ten couches were dressed, bearing effigies of dead men, so <lb/>
            carefully laid out, that they resembled corpses already <lb/>
            • buried; and for seven days all the men in the companies <lb/>
            and battalions celebrated a funeral feast, dancing, and sing- <lb/>
            ing melancholy kinds of dirges in lamentation for the royal <lb/>
            youth.</p>
          <p>11. And the women, with pitiable wailing, deplored with <lb/>
            their customary weepings the hope of their nation thus cut <lb/>
            off in the early bloom of youth; as the worshippers of <lb/>
            Venus are often seen to do in the solemn festival of Adonis, <lb/>
            which the mystical doctrines of religion show to be some <lb/>
            sort of image of the ripened fruits of the earth.</p>

            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHEN the body was burnt and the bones collected in <lb/>
            a silver urn, which his father had ordered to be carried <note type="footnote"> 1 Patroclus, the companion of Achilles. </note> <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            back to his native land, to be there buried beneath the <lb/>
            earth, Sapor, after taking counsel, determined to propitiate <lb/>
            the shade of the deceased prince by making the destroyed <lb/>
            city of Amida his monument. Nor indeed was Grumbates <lb/>
            willing to move onward while the shade of his only son <lb/>
            remained unavenged.</p>
          <p>2. And having given two days to rest, and sent out <lb/>
            large bodies of troops to ravage the fertile and well- <lb/>
            cultivated fields which were as heavy with crops as in the <lb/>
            time of peace, the enemy surrounded the city with a line <lb/>
            of heavy-armed soldiers five deep; and at the begin- <lb/>
            ning of the third day the brilliant squadrons filled every <lb/>
            spot as far as the eye could see in every direction, and the <lb/>
            ranks marching slowly, took up the positions appointed to <lb/>
            each by lot.</p>
          <p>3. All the Persians were employed in surrounding the <lb/>
            walls; that part which looked eastward, where that youth <lb/>
            so fatal to us was slain, fell to the Chionitæ. The Vertæ <lb/>
            were appointed to the south; the Albani watched the <lb/>
            north ; while opposite to the western gate were posted the <lb/>
            Segestani, the fiercest warriors of all, with whom were <lb/>
            trains of tall elephants, horrid with their wrinkled skins, <lb/>
            which marched on slowly, loaded with armed men, terrible <lb/>
            beyond the savageness of any other frightful sight, as we <lb/>
            have often said.</p>
          <p>4. When we saw these countless hosts thus deliberately <lb/>
            collected for the conflagration of the Roman world, and <lb/>
            directed to our own immediate destruction, we despaired <lb/>
            of safety, and sought only how to end our lives gloriously, <lb/>
            as we all desired.</p>
          <p>5. From the rising of the sun to its setting, the enemy's <lb/>
            lines stood immovable, as if rooted to the ground, without <lb/>
            changing a step or uttering a sound; nor was even the <lb/>
            neigh of a horse heard ; and the men having withdrawn in <lb/>
            the same order as they had advanced, after refreshing <lb/>
            themselves with food and sleep, even before the dawn, <lb/>
            returned, led by the clang of brazen trumpets, to surround <lb/>
            the city, as if fated to fall with their terrible ring.</p>
          <p>6. And scarcely had Grumbates, like a Roman fecial, <lb/>
            hurled at us a spear stained with blood, according to his <lb/>
            native fashion, than the whole army, rattling their arms, <lb/>
            mounted up to the walls, and instantly the tumult of <pb n="188"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK XIX. CH. II. </note> <lb/>
            war grew fierce, while all the squadrons hastened with <lb/>
            speed and alacrity to the attack, and our men on their <lb/>
            side opposed them with equal fierceness and resolution.</p>
          <p>7. Soon many of the enemy fell with their heads crushed <lb/>
            by vast stones hurled from scorpions, some were pierced <lb/>
            with arrows, others were transfixed with javelins, and <lb/>
            strewed the ground with their bodies; others, wounded, <lb/>
            fled back in haste to their comrades.</p>
          <p>8. Nor was there less grief or less slaughter in the city, <lb/>
            where the cloud of arrows obscured the air, and the vast <lb/>
            engines, of which the Persians had got possession when <lb/>
            they took Singara, scattered wounds everywhere.</p>
          <p>9. For the garrison, collecting all their forces, returning <lb/>
            in constant reliefs to the combat, in their eagerness to <lb/>
            defend the city, fell wounded, to the hindrance of their <lb/>
            comrades, or, being sadly torn as they fell, threw down <lb/>
            those who stood near them, or if still alive, sought the <lb/>
            aid of those skilful in extracting darts which had become <lb/>
            fixed in their bodies.</p>
          <p>10. So slaughter was met by slaughter, and lasted till <lb/>
            the close of day, being scarcely stopped by the darkness of <lb/>
            evening, so great was the obstinacy with which both sides <lb/>
            fought.</p>
          <p>11. And the watches of the night were passed under <lb/>
            arms, and the hills resounded with the shouts raised on both <lb/>
            sides, while our men extolled the valour of Constantius <lb/>
            Cæsar as lord of the empire and of the world, and the <lb/>
            Persians styled Sapor Saansas and Pyroses, which appella- <lb/>
            tions mean king of kings, and conqueror in wars.</p>
          <p>12. The next morning, before daybreak, the trumpet <lb/>
            gave the signal, and countless numbers from all sides <lb/>
            flocked like birds to a contest of similar violence ; and in <lb/>
            every direction, as far as the eye could reach, nothing <lb/>
            could be seen in the plains and valleys but the glittering <lb/>
            arms of these savage nations.</p>
          <p>13. And presently a shout was raised, and as the enemy <lb/>
            rushed forward all at once, they were met by a dense <lb/>
            shower of missiles from the walls; and as may be con- <lb/>
            jectured, none were hurled in vain, falling as they did <lb/>
            among so dense a crowd. For while so many evils sur- <lb/>
            rounded us, we fought as I have said before, with the hope, <lb/>
            not of procuring safety, but of dying bravely; and from <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            dawn to eventide the battle was evenly balanced, both, <lb/>
            fighting with more ferocity than method, and there arose <lb/>
            the shouts of men striking and falling, so that from the <lb/>
            eagerness of both parties there was scarcely any one who <lb/>
            did not give or receive wounds.</p>
          <p>14. At last, night put an end to the slaughter, and the <lb/>
            losses on both sides caused a longer truce. For when the <lb/>
            time intended for rest was allowed to us, continual sleep- <lb/>
            less toil still exhausted our little remaining strength, in <lb/>
            spite of the dread, caused by the bloodshed and the pallid <lb/>
            faces of the dying, whom the scantiness of our room did <lb/>
            not permit us even the last solace of burying; since with- <lb/>
            in the circuit of a moderate city there were seven legions, <lb/>
            and a vast promiscuous multitude of citizens and strangers <lb/>
            of both sexes, and other soldiers, so that at least twenty, <lb/>
            thousand men were shut up within the walls.</p>
          <p>15. So each attended to his own wounds as well as he <lb/>
            could, availing himself of whatever assistance or remedies, <lb/>
            came in his way. While some, being severely wounded,, <lb/>
            died of loss of blood; and some, pierced through by swords, <lb/>
            lay on the ground, and breathed their last in the open air ; <lb/>
            others who were pierced through and through the skilful <lb/>
            refused to touch, in order not to pain them further by <lb/>
            inflicting useless sufferings; some, seeking the doubtful <lb/>
            remedy of extracting the arrows, only incurred agonies <lb/>
            worse than death.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the war was going on in this manner around <lb/>
            Amida, Ursicinus, vexed at being'dependent on the will <lb/>
            of another, gave continual warning to Sabinianus, who <lb/>
            had superior authority over the soldiers, and who still <lb/>
            remained in the quarter of the tombs, to collect all his <lb/>
            light-armed troops, and hasten by secret paths along the <lb/>
            foot of the mountain chain, with the idea that by the aid <lb/>
            of this light force, if chance should aid them, they might <lb/>
            surprise some of the enemy's outposts, and attack with suc- <lb/>
            cess the night watches of the army, which, with its vast cir- <lb/>
            cuit, was surrounding the walls, or else by incessant attacks <lb/>
            might harass those who clung resolutely to the blockade.</p>
          <p>2. But Sabinianus rejected this proposal as mischievous, <pb n="190"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIX. CH. IV. </note> <lb/>
            and produced some letters from the emperor, expressly <lb/>
            enjoining that all that could be done was to be done with- <lb/>
            out exposing the troops to any danger; but his own secret <lb/>
            motive he kept in his own bosom, namely, that he had been <lb/>
            constantly recommended while at court to refuse his pre- <lb/>
            decessor, who was very eager for glory, every opportunity <lb/>
            of acquiring renown, however much it might be for the, <lb/>
            interest of the republic.</p>
          <p>3. Extreme pains were taken, even to the ruin of the <lb/>
            provinces, to prevent the gallant Ursicinus from being <lb/>
            spoken of as the author of or partner in any memorable <lb/>
            exploit. Therefore, bewildered with these misfortunes, <lb/>
            Ursicinus, seeing that, though constantly sending spies to <lb/>
            us (although from the strict watch that was set it was not <lb/>
            easy for any one to enter the city), and proposing many <lb/>
            advantageous plans, he did no good, seemed like a lion, <lb/>
            terrible for his size and fierceness, but with his claws cut <lb/>
            and his teeth drawn, so that he could not dare to save from <lb/>
            danger his cubs entangled in the nets of the hunters.</p>

          <p>§ 1. BUT in the city, where the number of the corpses <lb/>
            which lay scattered over the streets was too great for any <lb/>
            one to perform the funeral rites over them, a pestilence <lb/>
            was soon added to the other calamities of the citizens ; the <lb/>
            carcases becoming full of worms and corruption, from the <lb/>
            evaporation caused by the heat, and the various diseases of <lb/>
            the people ; and here I will briefly explain whence diseases <lb/>
            of this kind arise.</p>
          <p>, 2. Both philosophers and skilful physicians agree that <lb/>
            excess of cold, or of heat, or of moisture, or of drought, <lb/>
            all cause pestilences; on which account those who dwell <lb/>
            in marshy or wet districts are subject to coughs and com- <lb/>
            plaints in the eyes, and other similar maladies : on the <lb/>
            other hand, those who dwell in hot climates are liable to <lb/>
            fevers and inflammations. But since fire is the most power- <lb/>
            ful of all elements, so drought is the quickest at killing.</p>
          <p>3. On this account it is that when the Greeks were <lb/>
            toiling at the ten years' war,' to prevent a foreigner from <note type="footnote"> 1 The Trojan war. See the account of the pestilence, Home <lb/>
            Il. i. 50. </note> <pb n="191"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359] </note> <lb/>
            profiting by his violation of a royal marriage, a pestilence <lb/>
            broke out among them, and numbers died by the darts of <lb/>
            Apollo, who is the same as the Sun.</p>
          <p>4. Again, as Thucydides relates, that pestilence which <lb/>
            at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war harassed the <lb/>
            Athenians with a most cruel kind of sickness, came by <lb/>
            slow steps from the burning plains of Ethiopia to Attica.</p>
          <p>5. Others maintain that the air and the water, becoming <lb/>
            tainted by the smell of corpses, and similar things, takes <lb/>
            away the healthiness of a place, or at all events that the <lb/>
            sudden change of temperature brings forth slighter sick- <lb/>
            nesses.</p>
          <p>6. Some again affirm that the air becomes heavier by <lb/>
            emanations from the earth, and kills some individuals by <lb/>
            checking the perspiration of the body, for which reason <lb/>
            we learn from Homer, that, besides men, the other living <lb/>
            creatures also died ; and we know by many instances, that <lb/>
            in such plagues this does occur.</p>
          <p>7. Now the first species of pestilence is called pandemic; <lb/>
            this causes those who live in dry places to be attacked by <lb/>
            frequent heats. The second is called epidemic, which <lb/>
            gets gradually more violent, dims the sight of the eyes, <lb/>
            and awakens dangerous humours. The third is called <lb/>
            lœmodes,1 which is also temporary, but still often kills <lb/>
            with great rapidity.</p>
          <p>8. We were attacked by this deadly pestilence from the <lb/>
            excessive heat, which our numbers aggravated, though but <lb/>
            few died: and at last, on the night after the tenth day <lb/>
            from the first attack, the heavy and dense air was softened <lb/>
            by a little rain, and the health of the garrison was restored <lb/>
            and preserved.</p>

          <p>§ 1. IN the mean time the restless Persians were sur- <lb/>
            rounding the city with a fence of wicker-work, and <lb/>
            mounds were commenced; lofty towers also were con- <lb/>
            structed with iron fronts, in the top of each of which <lb/>
            a balista was placed, in order to drive down the garri- <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e., <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοιμώδης</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοιμὸς</foreign>, pestilence. Pandemic means “ attack- <lb/>
            ing the whole people." Epidemic, spreading from individual to <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIX. CH. V. </note> <lb/>
            son from the battlements ; but during the whole time the <lb/>
            shower of missiles from the archers and slingers never <lb/>
            ceased for a moment.</p>
          <p>2. We had with us two of the legions which had served <lb/>
            under Magnentius, and which, as we have said, had lately <lb/>
            been brought from Gaul, composed of brave and active <lb/>
            men well adapted for conflicts in the plain; but not only <lb/>
            useless for such a kind of war as that by which we wore <lb/>
            now pressed, but actually in the way. For as they had no <lb/>
            skill either in working the engines, or in constructing <lb/>
            works, but were continually making foolish sallies, and <lb/>
            fighting bravely, they always returned with diminished <lb/>
            numbers; doing just as much good, as the saying is, as a <lb/>
            bucket of water brought by a single hand to a general <lb/>
            conflagration.</p>
          <p>3. At last, when the gates were completely blocked, and <lb/>
            they were utterly unable to get out, in spite of the entrea- <lb/>
            ties of their tribunes, they became furious as wild beasts. <lb/>
            But on subsequent occasions their services became con- <lb/>
            spicuous, as we shall show.</p>
          <p>4. In a remote part of the walls on the southern side, <lb/>
            which looks down on the Tigris, there was a high tower, <lb/>
            below which yawned an abrupt precipice, which it was <lb/>
            impossible to look over without giddiness. From this <lb/>
            by a hollow subterranean passage along the foot of the <lb/>
            mountain some steps were cut with great skill, which led <lb/>
            up to the level of the city, by which water was secretly <lb/>
            obtained from the river, as we have seen to be the case <lb/>
            in all the fortresses in that district which are situated on <lb/>
            any river.</p>
          <p>5. This passage was dark, and because of the precipitous <lb/>
            character of the rock was neglected by the besiegers, till, <lb/>
            under the guidance of a deserter who went over to them, <lb/>
            seventy Persian archers of the royal battalion, men of emi- <lb/>
            nent skill and courage, being protected by the remoteness <lb/>
            of the spot which prevented their being heard, climbed up <lb/>
            by the steps one by one at midnight, and reached the third <lb/>
            story of the tower. There they concealed themselves till <lb/>
            daybreak, when they held out a scarlet cloak as a signal for <lb/>
            commencing an assault, when they saw that the city was <lb/>
            entirely surrounded by the multitude of their comrades ; <lb/>
            and then they emptied their quivers and threw them down <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            at their feet, and with loud cries shot their arrows among <lb/>
            the citizens with prodigious skill.</p>
          <p>6. And presently the whole of the mighty host of the <lb/>
            enemy assaulted the city with more ferocity than ever. <lb/>
            And while we stood hesitating and perplexed to know <lb/>
            which danger to oppose first, whether to make head against <lb/>
            the foe above us, or against the multitude who were <lb/>
            scaling the battlements with ladders, our force was <lb/>
            divided; and five of the lighter balistæ were brought <lb/>
            round and placed so as to attack our tower. They shot <lb/>
            out heavy wooden javelins with great rapidity, sometimes <lb/>
            transfixing two of our men at one blow, so that many <lb/>
            of them fell to the ground severely wounded, and somo <lb/>
            jumped down in haste from fear of the creaking engines, <lb/>
            and being terribly lacerated by the fall, died.</p>
          <p>7. But by measures promptly taken, the walls were <lb/>
            again secured on that side, and the engines replaced in <lb/>
            their former situation.</p>
          <p>8. And since the crime of desertion had increased the <lb/>
            labours of our soldiers, they, full of indignation, moved <lb/>
            along the battlements as if on level ground, hurling <lb/>
            missiles of all kinds, and exerting themselves so strenu- <lb/>
            ously that the Virtæ, who were attacking on the south <lb/>
            side, were repulsed covered by wounds, and retired in <lb/>
            consternation to their tents, having to lament the fall of <lb/>
            many of their number.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THUS fortune showed us a ray of safety, granting us <lb/>
            one day in which we suffered but little, while the enemy <lb/>
            sustained a heavy loss; the remainder of the day was given <lb/>
            to rest in order to recruit our strength ; and at the dawn of <lb/>
            the next morning we saw from the citadel an innumera- <lb/>
            ble multitude, which, after the capture of the fort called <lb/>
            Ziata, was being led to the enemy's camp. For a promis- <lb/>
            cuous multitude had taken refuge in Ziata on account of <lb/>
            its size and strength ; it being a place ten furlongs in cir- <lb/>
            cumference.</p>
          <p>2. In those days many other fortresses also were stormed <lb/>
            and burnt, and many thousands of men and women carried <lb/>
            off from them into slavery; among whom were many men <note type="footnote"> o </note> <pb n="194"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIX. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            and women, enfeebled by age, who, fainting from different <lb/>
            causes, broke down under the length of the journey, gave <lb/>
            up all desire of life, and were hamstrung and left behind.</p>
          <p>3. The Gallic soldiers beholding these wretched crowds, <lb/>
            demanded by a natural but unseasonable impulse to be led <lb/>
            against the forces of the enemy, threatening their tribunes <lb/>
            and principal centurions with death if they refused them <lb/>
            leave.</p>
          <p>4. And as wild beasts kept in cages, being rendered <lb/>
            more savage by the smell of blood, dash themselves against <lb/>
            their movable bars in the hope of escaping, so these men <lb/>
            smote the gates, which we have already spoken of as being <lb/>
            blockaded, with their swords; being very anxious not to <lb/>
            be involved in the destruction of the city till they had <lb/>
            done some gallant exploit; or, if they ultimately escaped <lb/>
            from their dangers, not to be spoken of as having done <lb/>
            nothing worth speaking of, or worthy of their Gallic <lb/>
            courage. Although when they had sallied out before, as <lb/>
            they had often done, and had inflicted some loss on the <lb/>
            raisers of the mounds, they had always experienced equal <lb/>
            loss themselves.</p>
          <p>5. We, at a loss what to do, and not knowing what <lb/>
            resistance to oppose to these furious men, at length, having <lb/>
            with some difficulty won their consent thereto, decided, <lb/>
            since the evil could be endured no longer, to allow them to <lb/>
            attack the Persian advanced guard, which was not much <lb/>
            beyond bow-shot; and then, if they could force their line, <lb/>
            they might push their advance further. For it was plain <lb/>
            that if they succeeded in this, they would cause a great <lb/>
            slaughter of the enemy.</p>
          <p>6. And while the preparations for this sally were <lb/>
            being made, the walls were still gallantly defended with <lb/>
            unmitigated labour and watching, and planting engines <lb/>
            for shooting stones and darts in every direction. But <lb/>
            two high mounds had been raised by the Persian in- <lb/>
            fantry, and the blockade of the city was still pressed <lb/>
            forward by gradual operations; against which our men, <lb/>
            exerting themselves still more vigorously, raised also im- <lb/>
            mense structures, topping the highest works of the enemy ; <lb/>
            and sufficiently strong to support the immense weight of <lb/>
            their defenders.</p>
          <p>7. In the mean time the Gallic troops, impatient of delay. <pb n="195"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            armed with their axes and swords, went forth from the <lb/>
            open postern gate, taking advantage of a dark and moonless <lb/>
            night. And imploring the Deity to be propitious, and <lb/>
            repressing even their breath when they got near the <lb/>
            enemy, they advanced with quick step and in close order, <lb/>
            slew some of the watch at the outposts, and the outer <lb/>
            sentinels of the camp (who were asleep, fearing no such <lb/>
            event), and entertained secret hopes of penetrating even to <lb/>
            the king's tent if fortune assisted them.</p>
          <p>8. But some noise, though slight, was made by them in <lb/>
            their march, and the groans of the slain aroused many from <lb/>
            sleep; and while each separately raised the cry " to arms," <lb/>
            our soldiers halted and stood firm, not venturing to move <lb/>
            any further forward. For it would not have been prudent, <lb/>
            now that those whom they sought to surprise were <lb/>
            awakened, to hasten into open danger, while the bands <lb/>
            of Persians were now heard to be flocking to battle from all <lb/>
            quarters.</p>
          <p>9. Nevertheless the Gallic troops, with undiminished <lb/>
            strength and boldness, continued to hew down their foes <lb/>
            with their swords, though some of their own men were also <lb/>
            slain, pierced by the arrows which were flying from all <lb/>
            quarters; and they still stood firm, when they saw the whole <lb/>
            danger collected into one point, and the bands of the enemy <lb/>
            coming on with speed; yet no one turned his back: and <lb/>
            they withdrew, retiring slowly as if in time to music, and <lb/>
            gradually fell behind the pales of the camp, being unable <lb/>
            to sustain the weight of the battalions pressing close upon <lb/>
            them, and being deafened by the clang of the Persian <lb/>
            trumpets.</p>
          <p>10. And while many trumpets in turn poured out their <lb/>
            clang from the city, the gates were opened to receive our <lb/>
            men, if they should be able to reach them: and the engines <lb/>
            for missiles creaked, though no javelins were shot from <lb/>
            them, in order that the captains of the advanced guard of <lb/>
            the Persians, ignorant of the slaughter of their comrades, <lb/>
            might be terrified by the noise into falling back, and so <lb/>
            allowing our gallant troops to be admitted in safety.</p>
          <p>11. And owing to this manoeuvre, the Gauls about day- <lb/>
            break entered the gate although with diminished numbers; <lb/>
            many of them severely and others slightly wounded. <lb/>
            They lost four hundred men this night, when if they had <pb n="196"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIX. CH. VII </note> <lb/>
            not been hindered by more formidable obstacles, they would <lb/>
            have slain in his very tent not Rhesus nor Thracians sleep- <lb/>
            ing before the walls of Troy, but the king of Persia, sur- <lb/>
            rounded by one hundred thousand armed men.</p>
          <p>12. To their leaders, as champions of valiant actions, the <lb/>
            emperor, after the fall of the city, ordered statues in <lb/>
            armour to be erected at Edessa in a frequented spot. And <lb/>
            those statues are preserved up to the present time unhurt.</p>
          <p>13. When the next day showed the slaughter which had <lb/>
            been made, nobles and satraps were found lying amongst <lb/>
            the corpses, and all kinds of dissonant cries and tears indi- <lb/>
            cated the changed posture of the Persian host: everywhere <lb/>
            was heard wailing; and great indignation was expressed by <lb/>
            the princes, who thought that the Romans had forced their <lb/>
            way through the sentries in front of the walls. A truce was <lb/>
            made for three days by the common consent of both armies, <lb/>
            and we gladly accepted a little respite in which to take <lb/>
            breath.</p>

            novelty of this attempt, and rendered by it more savage <lb/>
            than ever, discarding all delay, determined to proceed with <lb/>
            their works, since open assaults availed them but little. <lb/>
            And with extreme warlike eagerness they all now hastened <lb/>
            to die gloriously, or else to propitiate the souls of the dead <lb/>
            by the ruin of the city.</p>
          <p>2. And now, the necessary preparations having been <lb/>
            completed by the universal alacrity, at the rising of the <lb/>
            day-star all kinds of structures and iron towers were <lb/>
            brought up to the walls; on the lofty summits of which <lb/>
            balistæ were fitted, which beat down the garrison who were <lb/>
            placed on lower ground.</p>
          <p>3. And when day broke the iron coverings of the bodies <lb/>
            of the foe darkened the whole heaven, and the dense lines <lb/>
            advanced without any skirmishers in front, and not in an <lb/>
            irregular manner as before, but to the regular and soft <lb/>
            music of trumpets; protected by the roofs of the engines, <lb/>
            and holding before them wicker shields.</p>
          <p>4. And when they came within reach of our missiles, the <note type="footnote">1 Ammian alludes to the expedition of Ulysses and Diomed. related <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> A.D 359.] </note> <lb/>
            Persian infantry, holding their shields in front of them, and <lb/>
            even then having difficulty in avoiding the arrows which <lb/>
            were shot from the engines on the walls, for scarcely any <lb/>
            kind of weapon found an empty space, they broke their <lb/>
            line a little; and even the cuirassiers were checked and <lb/>
            began to retreat, which raised the spirits of our men.</p>
          <p>5. Still the balistæ of the enemy, placed on their iron <lb/>
            towers, and pouring down missiles with great power from <lb/>
            their high ground on those in a lower position, spread a <lb/>
            great deal of slaughter in our ranks. At last, when evening <lb/>
            came on, both sides retired to rest, and the greater part of <lb/>
            the night was spent by us in considering what device could <lb/>
            be adopted to resist the formidable engines of the enemy.</p>
          <p>6. At length, after we had considered many plans, we <lb/>
            determined on one which the rapidity with which it could <lb/>
            be executed made the safest-to oppose four scorpions to the <lb/>
            four balistæ; which were carefully moved (a very difficult <lb/>
            operation) from the place in which they were; but before <lb/>
            this work was finished, day arrived, bringing us a mournful <lb/>
            sight, inasmuch-as it showed us the formidable battalions <lb/>
            of the Persians, with their trains of elephants, the noise and <lb/>
            size of which animals are such that nothing more terrible <lb/>
            pan be presented to the mind of man.</p>
          <p>7. And while we were-pressed on all sides with the vast <lb/>
            masses of arms, and works, and beasts, still our scorpions <lb/>
            were kept at work with their iron slings, hurling huge <lb/>
            round stones from the battlements, by which the towers of <lb/>
            the enemy were crushed and the balistæ and those who <lb/>
            worked them were dashed to the ground, so that many were <lb/>
            desperately injured, and many crushed by the weight of the <lb/>
            falling structures. And the elephants were driven back <lb/>
            with violence, and surrounded by the flames which we <lb/>
            poured forth against them, the moment that they were <lb/>
            wounded retired, and could not be restrained by their <lb/>
            riders. The works were all burnt, but still there was no <lb/>
            cessation from the conflict.</p>
          <p>8. For the king of the Persians himself, who is never ex- <lb/>
            pected to mingle in the fight, being indignant at these dis- <lb/>
            asters, adopting a new and unprecedented mode of action, <lb/>
            sprang forth like a common soldier among his own dense <lb/>
            columns; and as the very number of his guards made him <lb/>
            the more conspicuous to us who looked from afar on the <pb n="198"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIX. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            scene, he was assailed by numerous missiles, and was forced <lb/>
            to retire after he had lost many of his escort, while his troops <lb/>
            fell back by echellons; and at the end of the day, though <lb/>
            frightened neither by the sad sight of the slaughter nor of <lb/>
            the wounds, he at length allowed a short period to be given <lb/>
            to rest.</p>

          <p>§ 1. Night had put an end to the combat; and when a <lb/>
            slight rest had been procured from sleep, the moment that <lb/>
            the dawn, looked for as the harbinger of better fortune, <lb/>
            appeared, Sapor, full of rage and indignation, and per- <lb/>
            fectly reckless, called forth his people to attack us. And <lb/>
            as his works were all burnt, as we have related, and the <lb/>
            attack had to be conducted by means of their lofty mounds <lb/>
            raised close to our walls, we also from mounds within <lb/>
            the walls, as fast as we could raise them, struggled in <lb/>
            spite of all our difficulties, with all our might, and with <lb/>
            equal courage, against our assailants.</p>
          <p>2. And long did the bloody conflict last, nor was any one <lb/>
            of the garrison driven by fear of death from his resolution <lb/>
            to defend the city. The conflict was prolonged, till at last, <lb/>
            while the fortune of the two sides was still undecided, the <lb/>
            structure raised by our men, having been long assailed and <lb/>
            shaken, at last fell, as if by an earthquake.</p>
          <p>3. And the whole space which was between the wall <lb/>
            and the external mound being made level as if by a cause- <lb/>
            way or a bridge, opened a passage to the enemy, which <lb/>
            was no longer embarrassed by any obstacles; and numbers <lb/>
            of our men, being crushed or enfeebled by their wounds, <lb/>
            gave up the struggle. Still men flocked from all quarters <lb/>
            to repel so imminent a danger, but from their eager haste <lb/>
            they got in one another's way, while the boldness of the <lb/>
            enemy increased with their success.</p>
          <p>4. By the command of the king all his troops now has- <lb/>
            tened into action, and a hand-to-hand engagement ensued. <lb/>
            Blood ran down from the vast slaughter on both sides: the <lb/>
            ditches were filled with corpses, and thus a wider path was <lb/>
            opened for the besiegers. And the city, being now filled <lb/>
            with the eager crowd which forced its way in, all hope of <lb/>
            defence or of escape was cut off, and armed and unarmed <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            without any distinction of age or sex were slaughtered like <lb/>
            sheep.</p>
          <p>5. It was full evening, when, though fortune had proved <lb/>
            adverse, the bulk of our troops was still fighting in good <lb/>
            order; and I, having concealed myself with two corn- <lb/>
            panions in an obscure corner of the city, now under cover <lb/>
            of darkness, made my escape by a postern gate where <lb/>
            there was no guard; and aided by my own knowledge of <lb/>
            the country and by the speed of my companions, I at last <lb/>
            reached the tenth milestone from the city.</p>
          <p>6. Here, having lightly refreshed ourselves, I tried to <lb/>
            proceed, but found myself, as a noble unaccustomed to <lb/>
            such toil, overcome by fatigue of the march. I happened <lb/>
            to fall in, however, with what, though a most unsightly <lb/>
            object, was to me, completely tired out, a most seasonable <lb/>
            relief.</p>
          <p>7. A groom riding a runaway horse, barebacked and <lb/>
            without a bridle, in order to prevent his falling had <lb/>
            knotted the halter by which he was guiding him tightly <lb/>
            to his left hand, and presently, being thrown, and unable <lb/>
            to break the knot, he was torn to pieces as he was <lb/>
            dragged over the rough ground and through the bushes, <lb/>
            till at last the weight of his dead body stopped the tired <lb/>
            beast; I caught him, and mounting him, availed myself of <lb/>
            his services at a most seasonable moment, and after much <lb/>
            suffering arrived with my companions at some sulphur- <lb/>
            ous springs of naturally hot water.</p>
          <p>8. On account of the heat we had suffered greatly from <lb/>
            thirst, and had been crawling about for some time in <lb/>
            search of water; and now when we came to this well it <lb/>
            was so deep that .we could not descend into it, nor had <lb/>
            we any ropes; but, taught by extreme necessity, we tore up <lb/>
            the linen clothes which we wore into long rags, which we <lb/>
            made into one great rope, and fastened to the end of it a <lb/>
            cap which one of us wore beneath his helmet; and letting <lb/>
            that down by the rope, and drawing up water in it like <lb/>
            a sponge, we easily quenched our thirst.</p>
          <p>9. From hence we proceeded rapidly to the Euphrates, <lb/>
            intending to cross to the other side in the boat which <lb/>
            long custom had stationed in that quarter, to convey men <lb/>
            and cattle across.</p>
          <p>10. When lo! we see at a distance a Roman force with <pb n="200"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIX. CH IX </note> <lb/>
            cavalry standards, scattered and pursued by a division of <lb/>
            Persians, though we did not know from what quarter it <lb/>
            had come so suddenly on them in their march.</p>
          <p>11. This example showed us that what men call in- <lb/>
            digenous people are not sprung from the bowels of the <lb/>
            earth, but merely appear unexpectedly by reason of the <lb/>
            speed of their movements: and because they were seen <lb/>
            unexpectedly in various places, they got the name of <lb/>
            Sparti,1 and were believed to have sprung from the ground, <lb/>
            antiquity exaggerating their renown in a fabulous manner, <lb/>
            as it does that of other things.</p>
          <p>12. Roused by this sight, since our only hope of safety <lb/>
            lay in our speed, we drew off through the thickets and <lb/>
            woods to the high mountains; and from thence we went <lb/>
            to Melitina, a town of the Lesser Armenia, where we found <lb/>
            our chief just on the point of setting off, in whose company <lb/>
            we went on to Antioch.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. IN the mean time Sapor and the Persians began to <lb/>
            think of returning home, because they feared to penetrate <lb/>
            more inland with their prisoners and booty, now that the <lb/>
            autumn was nearly over, and the unhealthy star of the <lb/>
            Kids had arisen.</p>
          <p>2. But amid the massacres and plunder of the destroyed <lb/>
            city, Ælian the count, and the tribunes by whose vigour <lb/>
            the walls of Amida had been defended, and the losses of <lb/>
            the Persians multiplied, were wickedly crucified; and <lb/>
            Jacobus and Cæsias, the treasurers of the commander of <lb/>
            the cavalry, and others of the band of protectores, were led <lb/>
            as prisoners, with their hands bound behind their backs ; <lb/>
            and the people of the district beyond the Tigris, who were <lb/>
            diligently sought for, were all slain without distinction of <lb/>
            rank or dignity.</p>
          <p>3. But the wife of Craugasius, who, preserving her <lb/>
            chastity inviolate, was treated with the respect clue to a <lb/>
            high-born matron, was mourning as if she were to be <lb/>
            carried to another world without her husband, although <note type="footnote">1 Ammianus is wrong here; it was only the Thebans who were called <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359 ] </note> <lb/>
            she had indications afforded her that she might hope for a <lb/>
            higher future.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, thinking of her own interests, and having <lb/>
            a wise forecast of the future, she was torn with a twofold <lb/>
            anxiety, loathing both widowhood and the marriage she <lb/>
            saw before her. Accordingly, she secretly sent off a <lb/>
            friend of sure fidelity, and well acquainted with Mesopo- <lb/>
            tamia, to pass by Mount Izala, between the two forts <lb/>
            called Maride and Lome, and so to effect his entrance into <lb/>
            Nisibis, calling upon her husband, with urgent entreaties <lb/>
            and the revelation of many secrets of her own private <lb/>
            condition, after hearing what the messenger could tell <lb/>
            him, to come to Persia and live happily with her there.</p>
          <p>5. The messenger, travelling with great speed through <lb/>
            jungle roads and thickets, reached Nisibis, pretending that <lb/>
            he had never seen his mistress, and that, as in all likeli- <lb/>
            hood she was slain, he had availed himself of an accidental <lb/>
            opportunity to make his escape from the enemy's camp. <lb/>
            And so, being neglected as one of no importance, he got <lb/>
            access to Craugasius, and told him what had happened. <lb/>
            And having received from him an assurance that, as soon <lb/>
            as he could do so with safety, he would gladly rejoin his <lb/>
            wife, he departed, bearing the wished-for intelligence to <lb/>
            the lady. She, when she received it, addressed herself, <lb/>
            through the medium of Tamsapor, to the king, entreating <lb/>
            him that, if the opportunity offered before he quitted the <lb/>
            Roman territories, he would order her husband to be <lb/>
            restored to her.</p>
          <p>6. But the fact of this stranger having departed thus <lb/>
            unexpectedly, without any one suspecting it, after his <lb/>
            secret return, raised suspicions in the mind of Duke Cas- <lb/>
            sianus and the other nobles who had authority in the city, <lb/>
            who addressed severe menaces to Craugasius, insisting <lb/>
            that the man could neither have come nor have gone with- <lb/>
            out his privity.</p>
          <p>7. And he, fearing the charge of treason, and being very <lb/>
            anxious lest the flight of the deserter should cause a sus- <lb/>
            picion that his wife was still alive and was well treated by <lb/>
            the enemy, feigned to court a marriage with another <lb/>
            virgin of high rank. And having gone out to a villa <lb/>
            which he had eight miles from the city, as if with the <lb/>
            object of making the necessary preparations for the wed- <pb n="202"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIX. CH.X. </note> <lb/>
            ding feast, he mounted a horse, and fled at full speed to a <lb/>
            predatory troop of Persians which he had learnt was in <lb/>
            the neighbourhood, and being cordially received, when it <lb/>
            was seen from what he said who he was, he was delivered <lb/>
            over to Tamsapor on the fifth day, and by him he was <lb/>
            introduced to the king, and recovered not only his wife, <lb/>
            but his family and all his treasures, though he lost his <lb/>
            wife only a few months afterwards. And he was esteemed <lb/>
            only second to Antoninus, though as a great poet has said, <lb/>
            “ Longo proximus intervallo.’1</p>
          <p>8. For Antoninus was eminent both for genius and <lb/>
            experience in affairs, and had useful counsels for every <lb/>
            enterprise that could be proposed, while Craugasius was <lb/>
            of a less subtle nature, though also very celebrated. And <lb/>
            all these events took place within a short time after the <lb/>
            fall of Amida.</p>
          <p>9. But the king, though showing no marks of anxiety <lb/>
            on his countenance, and though he appeared full of exult- <lb/>
            ation at the fall of the city, still in the depths of his heart <lb/>
            was greatly perplexed, recollecting that in the siege he <lb/>
            had frequently sustained severe losses, and that he had lost <lb/>
            more men, and those too of more importance than any <lb/>
            prisoners whom he had taken from us, or than we had lost <lb/>
            in all the battles that had taken place; as indeed had also <lb/>
            been the case at Singara, and at Nisibis. In the seventy- <lb/>
            three days during which he had been blockading Amida, <lb/>
            he had lost thirty thousand soldiers, as was reckoned a few <lb/>
            days later by Discenes, a tribune and secretary; the cal- <lb/>
            culation being the more easily made because the corpses <lb/>
            of our men very soon shrink and lose their colour, so that <lb/>
            their faces can never be recognized after four days; but the <lb/>
            bodies of the Persians dry up like the trunks of trees, so <lb/>
            that nothing exudes from them, nor do they suffer from any <lb/>
            suffusion of blood, which is caused by their more sparing <lb/>
            diet, and by the dryness and heat of their native land.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE these events and troubles were proceeding <lb/>
            rapidly in the remote districts of the East, the Eternal <note type="footnote"> 1 A quotation from the description of the foot-race in Virgil, Æn. <lb/>

            City was fearing distress from an impending scarcity of <lb/>
            corn ; and the violence of the common people, infuriated <lb/>
            by the expectation of that worst of all evils, was vented <lb/>
            upon Tertullus, who at that time was prefect of the city. <lb/>
            This was unreasonable, since it did not depend upon <lb/>
            him that the provisions were embarked in a stormy season <lb/>
            in ships which, through the unusually tempestuous state <lb/>
            of the sea, and the violence of contrary winds, were <lb/>
            driven into any ports they could make, and were unable <lb/>
            to reach the port of Augustus, from the greatness of the <lb/>
            dangers which threatened them.</p>
          <p>2. Nevertheless, Tertullus was continually troubled by <lb/>
            the seditious movements of the people, who worked them- <lb/>
            selves up to great rage, being excited by the imminent <lb/>
            danger of a famine; till, having no hope of preserving his <lb/>
            own safety, he wisely brought his little boys out to the <lb/>
            people, who, though in a state of tumultuous disorder, were <lb/>
            often influenced by sudden accidents, and with tears ad- <lb/>
            dressed them thus :-</p>
          <p>3. "Behold your fellow-citizens, who (may the gods <lb/>
            avert the omen), unless fortune should take a more favour- <lb/>
            able turn, will be exposed to the same sufferings as your- <lb/>
            selves. If then you think that by destroying them you <lb/>
            will be saved from all suffering, they are in your power." <lb/>
            The people, of their own nature inclined to mercy, were <lb/>
            propitiated by this sad address, and made no answer, but <lb/>
            awaited their impending fate with resignation.</p>
          <p>4. And soon, by the favour of the deity who has <lb/>
            watched over the growth of Rome from its first origin, <lb/>
            and who promised that it should last for ever, while <lb/>
            Tertullus was at Ostia, sacrificing in the temple of Castor <lb/>
            and Pollux, the sea became calm, the wind changed to a <lb/>
            gentle south-east breeze, and the ships in full sail entered <lb/>
            the port, laden with corn to fill the granaries.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE these perplexing transactions were taking place, <lb/>
            intelligence full of importance and danger reached Constan- <lb/>
            tius who was reposing in winter quarters at Sirmium, in- <lb/>
            forming him (as he had already greatly feared) that the <lb/>
            Sarmatian Limigantes, who, as we have before related, had <pb n="204"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIX. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            expelled their masters from their hereditary homes, had <lb/>
            learnt to despise the lands which had been generously al- <lb/>
            lotted to them in the preceding year, in order to prevent so <lb/>
            fickle a class from undertaking any mischievous enterprise, <lb/>
            and had seized on the districts over the border; that they <lb/>
            were straggling, according to their national custom, with <lb/>
            great licence over the whole country, and would throw <lb/>
            everything into disorder if they were not put down.</p>
          <p>2. The emperor, judging that any delay would increase <lb/>
            their insolence, collected from all quarters a strong force <lb/>
            of veteran soldiers, and before the spring was much ad- <lb/>
            vanced, set forth on an expedition against them, being <lb/>
            urged to greater activity by two considerations; first, <lb/>
            because the army, having acquired great booty during the <lb/>
            last summer, was likely to be encouraged to successful <lb/>
            exertion in the hope of similar reward ; and secondly, <lb/>
            because, as Anatolius was at that time prefect of Illyricum, <lb/>
            everything necessary for such an expedition could be <lb/>
            readily provided without recourse to any stringent measures.</p>
          <p>3. For under no other prefect's government (as is agreed <lb/>
            by all), up to the present time, had the northern provinces <lb/>
            ever been so flourishing in every point of view; all abuses <lb/>
            being corrected with a kind and prudent hand, while the <lb/>
            people were relieved from the burden of transporting the <lb/>
            public stores (which often caused such losses as to ruin <lb/>
            many families), and also from the heavy income tax. So <lb/>
            that the natives of those districts would have been free <lb/>
            from all damage and cause of complaint, if at a later period <lb/>
            some detestable collectors had not come among them, <lb/>
            extorting money, and exaggerating accusations, in order to <lb/>
            build up wealth and influence for themselves, and to <lb/>
            procure their own safety and prosperity by draining the <lb/>
            natives; carrying their severities to the proscription and <lb/>
            even execution of many of them.</p>
          <p>4. To apply a remedy to this insurrection, the emperor <lb/>
            set out, as I have said, with a splendid staff, and reached <lb/>
            Valeria, which was formerly' a part of Pannonia, but which <lb/>
            had been established as a separate province, and received <lb/>
            its new name in honour of Valeria, the daughter of Dio- <lb/>
            cletian. And having encamped his army on the banks of <lb/>
            the Danube, he watched the movements of the barbarians, <lb/>
            who, before his arrival, had been proposing, under friendly <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            pretences, to enter Pannonia, meaning to lay it waste <lb/>
            during the severity of the winter season, before the snow <lb/>
            had been melted by the warmth of spring and the river <lb/>
            had become passable, and while our people were unable <lb/>
            from the cold to bear bivouacking in the open air.</p>
          <p>5. He at once therefore sent two tribunes, each ac- <lb/>
            companied by an interpreter, to the Limigantes, to inquire <lb/>
            mildly why they had quitted the homes which at their <lb/>
            own request had been assigned to them after the conclusion <lb/>
            of the treaty of peace, and why they were now straggling <lb/>
            in various directions, and passing their boundaries in con- <lb/>
            tempt of his prohibitions.</p>
          <p>6. They made vain and frivolous excuses, fear compelling <lb/>
            them to have recourse to lies, and implored the emperor's <lb/>
            pardon, beseeching him to discard his displeasure, and to <lb/>
            allow them to cross the river and come to him to explain <lb/>
            the hardships under which they were labouring; alleging <lb/>
            their willingness, if required, to retire to remoter lands, <lb/>
            only within the Roman frontier, where, enjoying lasting <lb/>
            peace and worshipping tranquillity as their tutelary deity, <lb/>
            they would submit to the name and discharge the duties of <lb/>
            tributary subjects.</p>
          <p>7. When the tribunes returned and related this, the <lb/>
            emperor, exulting that an affair which appeared full of <lb/>
            inextricable difficulties was likely to be brought to a con- <lb/>
            clusion without any trouble, and being eager to add to his <lb/>
            acquisitions, admitted them all to his presence. His eager- <lb/>
            ness for acquiring territory was fanned by a swarm of <lb/>
            flatterers, who were incessantly saying that when all <lb/>
            distant districts were at peace, and when tranquillity was <lb/>
            established everywhere, he would gain many subjects, and <lb/>
            would be able to enlist powerful bodies of recruits, thereby <lb/>
            relieving the provinces, which would often rather give <lb/>
            money than personal service (though this expectation has <lb/>
            more than once proved very mischievous to the state).</p>
          <p>8. Presently he pitched his camp near Acimincum,l where <lb/>
            a lofty mound was raised to serve for a tribune; and <lb/>
            some boats, loaded with soldiers of the legions, without <lb/>
            their baggage, under command of Innocentius, an engineer <lb/>
            who had suggested the measure, were sent to watch the <note type="footnote">1 Salankemen, in Hungary </note> <pb n="206"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIX. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            channel of the river, keeping close under the bank; so <lb/>
            that, if they perceived the barbarians in disorder, they <lb/>
            might eome upon them and surprise their rear, while <lb/>
            their attention was directed elsewhere.</p>
          <p>9. The Limigantes became aware of the measures thus <lb/>
            promptly taken, but still employed no other means of <lb/>
            defence than humility and entreaty ; though secretly they <lb/>
            cherished designs very different from those indicated by <lb/>
            their words and gestures.</p>
          <p>10. But when they saw the emperor on his high mound <lb/>
            preparing a mild harangue, and about to address them as <lb/>
            men who would prove obedient in future, one of them, <lb/>
            seized with a sudden fury, hurled his shoe at the tribune, <lb/>
            and cried out, "Marha, Marha!" which in their language <lb/>
            is a signal of war; and a disorderly mob following him, <lb/>
            suddenly raised their barbaric standard, and with fieree <lb/>
            howls rushed upon the emperor himself.</p>
          <p>11. And when he, looking down from his high position, <lb/>
            saw the whole plaee filled with thousands of men running <lb/>
            to and fro, and their drawn swords and rapiers threatening <lb/>
            him with immediate destruction, he descended, and min- <lb/>
            gling both with the barbarians and his own men, without <lb/>
            any one perceiving him or knowing whether he was an <lb/>
            officer or a common soldier ; and sinee there was no time <lb/>
            for delay or inaction, he mounted a speedy horse, and <lb/>
            galloped away, and so escaped.</p>
          <p>12. But his few guards, while endeavouring to keep <lb/>
            back the mutineers, who rushed on with the fiereeness of <lb/>
            fire, were all killed, either by wounds, or by being <lb/>
            crushed beneath the weight of others who fell upon them; <lb/>
            and the royal throne, with its golden cushion, was torn to <lb/>
            pieces without any one making an effort to save it.</p>
          <p>13. But presently, when it became known that the emperor, <lb/>
            after having been in the most imminent danger of his life, <lb/>
            was still in peril, the army, feeling it to be the most <lb/>
            important of all objects to assist him, for they did not yet <lb/>
            think him safe, and confiding in their prowess, though from <lb/>
            the suddenness of the attack they were only half formed, <lb/>
            threw themselves, with loud and warlike cries upon the <lb/>
            bands of the barbarians, fearlessly braving death.</p>
          <p>14. And because in their fiery valour our men were <lb/>
            resolved to wipe out disgrace by glory, and were full o <pb n="207"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            anger at the treachery of the foe, they slew every one <lb/>
            whom they met without mercy, trampling all under foot, <lb/>
            living, wounded, and dead alike; so that heaps of dead <lb/>
            were piled up before their hands were weary of the <lb/>
            slaughter. For the rebels were completely overwhelmed, <lb/>
            some being slain, and others fleeing In fear, many of <lb/>
            whom implored their lives with various entreaties, but <lb/>
            were slaughtered with repeated wounds. And when, after <lb/>
            they were all destroyed, the trumpets sounded a retreat, <lb/>
            it was found that only a very few of our men were killed, <lb/>
            and these had either been trampled down at first, or had <lb/>
            perished from the insufficiency of their armour to resist <lb/>
            the violence of tho enemy.</p>
          <p>15. But the most glorious death was that of Cella, the <lb/>
            tribune of the Scutarii, who at the beginning of the <lb/>
            uproar set the example of plunging first into the middle of <lb/>
            the Sarmatian host.</p>
          <p>16. After these blood-stained transactions, Constantius <lb/>
            took what precautions prudence suggested for the security <lb/>
            of his frontiers, and then returned to Sirmium, having <lb/>
            avenged himself on the perfidity of his enemies. And <lb/>
            having there settled everything which the occasion re- <lb/>
            quired, he quitted Sirmium and went to Constantinople, <lb/>
            that by being nearer to the East, he might remedy the <lb/>
            disasters which had been sustained at Amida, and having <lb/>
            reinforced his army with new levies, he might check the <lb/>
            attempts of the king of Persia with equal vigour; as it <lb/>
            was clear that Sapor, if Providence and some more pressing <lb/>
            occupation did not prevent him, would leave Mesopotamia <lb/>
            and bring the war over the plains on this side of that <lb/>
            country.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. BUT amid these causes of anxiety, as if in accordance <lb/>
            with old-established custom, instead of the signal for civil <lb/>
            war, the trumpet sounded groundless charges of treason, <lb/>
            and a secretary, whom we shall often have to speak of, <lb/>
            named Paulus, was sent to inquire into these charges. He <lb/>
            was a man skilful in all the contrivances of cruelty, making <lb/>
            gain and profit of tortures and executions, as a master of <lb/>
            gladiators does of his fatal games.</p>
          <p>2. For as he was firm and resolute in his purpose of <pb n="208"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XIX. CH. XII </note> <lb/>
            injuring people, he did not abstain even from theft, and <lb/>
            invented all kinds of causes for the destruction of innocent <lb/>
            men, while engaged in this miserable campaign.</p>
          <p>3. A slight and trivial circumstance afforded infinite <lb/>
            material for extending his investigations. There is a town <lb/>
            called Abydum in the most remote corner of the Egyptian <lb/>
            Thebais, where an oracle of the god, known in that region <lb/>
            by the name of Besa, had formerly enjoyed some celebrity <lb/>
            for its prophecies, and had sacred rites performed at it <lb/>
            with all the ceremonies anciently in use in the neigh- <lb/>
            bouring districts.</p>
          <p>4. Some used to go themselves to consult this oracle, <lb/>
            some to send by others documents containing their wishes, <lb/>
            and with prayers couched in explicit language inquired <lb/>
            the will of the deities; and the paper or parchment on <lb/>
            which their wants were written, after the answer had been <lb/>
            given, was sometimes left in the temple.</p>
          <p>5. Some of these were spitefully sent to the emperor, <lb/>
            and he, narrow minded as he was, though often deaf to <lb/>
            other matters of serious consequence, had, as the proverb <lb/>
            says, a soft place in his ear for this kind of information ; and <lb/>
            being of a suspicious and petty temper, became full of gall <lb/>
            and fury ; and immediately ordered Paulus to repair with <lb/>
            all speed to the East, giving him authority, as to a chief of <lb/>
            great eminence and experience, to try all the causes as he <lb/>
            pleased.</p>
          <p>6. And Modestus also, at that time count of the East, a <lb/>
            man well suited for such a business, was joined with him <lb/>
            in this commission. For Hermogenes of Pontus, at that <lb/>
            time prefect of the prætorium, was passed over as of too <lb/>
            gentle a disposition.</p>
          <p>7. Paulus proceeded, as he was ordered, full of deadly <lb/>
            eagerness and rage; inviting all kinds of calumnies, so <lb/>
            that numbers from every part of the empire were brought <lb/>
            before him, noble and low born alike; some of whom were <lb/>
            condemned to imprisonment, others to instant death.</p>
          <p>8. The city which was chosen to witness these fatal <lb/>
            scenes was Scythopolis in Palestine, which for two reasons <lb/>
            seemed the most suitable of all places; first, because it <lb/>
            was little frequented and secondly, because it was half- <lb/>
            way between Antioch and Alexandria, from which city <lb/>
            many of those brought before this tribunal came. <pb n="209"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> 9. One of the first persons accused was Simplicius, the <lb/>
            son of Philip; a man who, after having been prefect and <lb/>
            consul, was now impeached on the ground that he was <lb/>
            said to have consulted the oracle how to obtain the empire. <lb/>
            He was sentenced to the torture by the express command <lb/>
            of the emperor, who in these cases never erred on the side <lb/>
            of mercy ; but by some special fate he was saved from it, <lb/>
            and with uninjured body was condemned to distant banish- <lb/>
            ment.</p>
          <p>10. The next victim was Parnasius, who had been pre- <lb/>
            fect of Egypt, a man of simple manners, but now in danger <lb/>
            of being condemned to death, and glad to escape with <lb/>
            exile; because long ago he had been heard to say that <lb/>
            when he left Patræ in Achaia. the place of his birth, with <lb/>
            the view of procuring some high office, he had in a dream <lb/>
            seen himself conducted on his road by several figures in <lb/>
            tragic robes.</p>
          <p>11. The next was Andronicus, subsequently celebrated <lb/>
            for his liberal accomplishments and his poetry; he was <lb/>
            brought before the court without having given any real <lb/>
            ground for suspicion of any kind, and defended himself so <lb/>
            vigorously that he was acquitted.</p>
          <p>12. There was also Demetrius, surnamed Chytras, a <lb/>
            philosopher, of great age, but still firm in mind and body; <lb/>
            he, when charged with having frequently offered sacrifices <lb/>
            in the temple of his oracle, could not deny it; but affirmed <lb/>
            thai, for the sake of propitiating the deity, he had con- <lb/>
            stantly done so from his early youth, and not with any <lb/>
            idea of aiming at any higher fortune by his questions; nor <lb/>
            had he known any one who had aimed at such. And <lb/>
            though he was long on the rack he supported it with great <lb/>
            constancy, never varying in his statement, till at length <lb/>
            he was acquitted and allowed to retire to Alexandria, where <lb/>
            he was born.</p>
          <p>13. These and a few others justice, coming to the aid of <lb/>
            truth, delivered from their imminent dangers. But as <lb/>
            accusations extended more widely, involving numbers <lb/>
            without end in their snares, many perished; some with <lb/>
            their bodies mangled on the rack; others were condemned <lb/>
            to death and confiscation of their goods; while Paulus kept <lb/>
            on inventing groundless accusations, as if he had a store <lb/>
            of lies on which to draw, and suggesting various pretences <note type="footnote">p </note> <pb n="210"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XIX. CH. XII. </note> <lb/>
            for injuring people, so that on his nod, it may be said, <lb/>
            the safety of every one in the place depended.</p>
          <p>14. For if any one wore on his neck a charm against the <lb/>
            quartan ague or any other disease, or if by any information <lb/>
            laid by his ill-wishers he was accused of having passed by, <lb/>
            a sepulehre at nightfall, and therefore of being a sorcerer, <lb/>
            and one who dealt in the horrors of tombs and the vain <lb/>
            mockeries of the shades which haunt them, he was found <lb/>
            guilty and condemned to death.</p>
          <p>1 5. And the affairs went on as if people had been con- <lb/>
            sulting Claros, or the oaks at Dodona, or the Delphic <lb/>
            oracles of old fame, with a view to the destruction of the <lb/>
            emperor.</p>
          <p>16. Meantime, the crowd of courtiers, inventing every <lb/>
            kind of deceitful flattery, affirmed that he would be free from <lb/>
            all common misfortunes, asserting that his fate had always <lb/>
            shone forth with vigour and power in destroying all who <lb/>
            attempted anything injurious to him.</p>
          <p>17. That indeed strict investigation should be made into <lb/>
            such matters, no one in his senses will deny; nor do we <lb/>
            question that the safety of our lawful prince, the cham- <lb/>
            pion and defender of the good, and on whom the safety of <lb/>
            all other people depends, ought to be watched over by the <lb/>
            combined zeal of all men; and for the sake of insuring this <lb/>
            more completely, when any treasonable enterprise is dis- <lb/>
            covered, the Cornelian laws have provided that no rank <lb/>
            shall be exempted even from torture if necessary for the <lb/>
            investigation.</p>
          <p>18. But it is not decent to exult unrestrainedly in <lb/>
            melancholy events, lest the subjects should seem to be <lb/>
            governed by tyranny, not by authority. It is better to <lb/>
            imitate Cicero, who, when he had it in his power either to <lb/>
            spare or to strike, preferred, as he tells us himself, to seek <lb/>
            occasions for pardoning rather than for punishing, which <lb/>
            is characteristic of a prudent and wise judge.</p>
          <p>19. At that time a monster, horrible both to see and to <lb/>
            describe, was produced at Daphne, a beautiful and cele- <lb/>
            brated suburb of Antioch; namely, an infant with two <lb/>
            mouths, two sets of teeth, two heads, four eyes, and only <lb/>
            two very short ears. And such a mis-shapen offspring was <lb/>
            an omen that the republic would become deformed.</p>
          <p>20. Prodigies of this kind are often produced, presaging <pb n="211"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 359.] </note> <lb/>
            events of various kinds; but as they are not now publicly <lb/>
            expiated, as they were among the ancients, they are un- <lb/>
            heard of and unknown to people in general.</p>

          <p>§ 1. DURING this period the Isaurians, who had been tran- <lb/>
            quil for some time after the transactions already mentioned, <lb/>
            and the attempt to take the city of Seleucia, gradually <lb/>
            reviving, as serpents come out of their holes in the <lb/>
            warmth of spring, descended from their rocky and path- <lb/>
            less jungles, and forming into large troops, harassed their <lb/>
            neighbours with predatory incursions ; escaping, from their <lb/>
            activity as mountaineers, all attempts of the soldiers to <lb/>
            take them, and from long use moving easily over rocks and <lb/>
            through thickets.</p>
          <p>2. So Lauricius was sent among them as governor, with <lb/>
            the additional title of count, to reduce them to order <lb/>
            by fair means or foul. He was a man of sound civil <lb/>
            wisdom, correcting things in general by threats rather <lb/>
            than by severity, so that while he governed the province, <lb/>
            which he did for some time, nothing happened deserving <lb/>
            of particular notice.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THESE were the events which took place in Illyricum and <lb/>
            in the East. But the next year, that of Constantius's tenth <lb/>
            and Julian's third consulship, the affairs of Britain became <lb/>
            troubled, in consequence of the incursions of the savage <lb/>
            nations of Picts and Scots, who breaking the peace to which <lb/>
            they had agreed, were plundering the districts on their <lb/>
            borders, and keeping in constant alarm the provinces ex- <lb/>
            hausted by former disasters, Cæsar, who was wintering at <lb/>
            Paris, having his mind divided by various cares, feared to <lb/>
            go to the aid of his subjects across the channel (as we <lb/>
            have related Constans to have done), lest he should leave <lb/>
            the Gauls without a governor, while the Allemanni were <lb/>
            still full of fierce and warlike inclinations.</p>
          <p>2. Therefore, to tranquillize these districts by reason or <lb/>
            by force, it was decided to send Lupicinus, who was at that <lb/>
            time commander of the forces; a man of talent in war, and <lb/>
            especially skilful in all that related to camps, but very <lb/>
            haughty, and smelling, as one may say, of the tragic bus- <lb/>
            kin, while parts of his conduct made it a. question which <lb/>
            predominated-his avarice or his cruelty.</p>
          <p>3. Accordingly, an auxiliary force of light-armed troops, <lb/>
            Heruli and Batavi, with two legions from Mœsia, were <lb/>
            in the very depth of winter put under the command of this <lb/>
            general, with which he marched to Boulogne, and having <lb/>
            procured some vessels and embarked his soldiers on them, <lb/>
            he sailed with a fair wind, and reached Richborough on the <lb/>
            opposite coast, from which place he proceeded to London, <lb/>
            that he might there deliberate on the aspect of affairs, and <lb/>
            take immediate measures for his campaign. <pb n="213"/>

          <p>§ 1. IN the mean time, after the fall of Ami da, and after <lb/>
            Ursicinus had returned as commander of the infantry to <lb/>
            the emperor's camp (for we have already mentioned that <lb/>
            he had been appointed to succeed Barbatio), he was at <lb/>
            once attacked by slanderers; who at first tried to whisper <lb/>
            his character away, but presently openly brought forward <lb/>
            false charges against him.</p>
          <p>2. And the emperor, listening to them, since be com- <lb/>
            monly formed his opinions on vain conjecture, and was <lb/>
            always ready to yield his judgment to crafty persons, <lb/>
            appointed Arbetio and Florentius, the chief steward, as <lb/>
            judges to inquire how it was that the town was destroyed. <lb/>
            They rejected the plain and easily proved causes of the <lb/>
            disaster, fearing that Eusebius, at that time high chain- <lb/>
            berlain, would be offended if they admitted proofs which <lb/>
            showed undeniably that what had happened was owing to <lb/>
            the obstinate inactivity of Sabinianus; and so distorting <lb/>
            the truth, they examined only some points of no conse- <lb/>
            quence, and having no bearing on the transaction.</p>
          <p>3. Ursicinus felt the iniquity of this proceeding; and <lb/>
            said, " Although the emperor despises me, still the import- <lb/>
            ance of this affair is such that it cannot be judged of and <lb/>
            punished by any decision lower than that of the emperor. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, let him know what I venture to prophesy, <lb/>
            that while he is concerning himself about this disaster at <lb/>
            Amida, of which be has received a faithful account; and <lb/>
            while he gives himself up to the influence of the eunuchs, <lb/>
            he will not in the ensuing spring,1 even if he himself <lb/>
            should come with the entire strength of his army, be able <lb/>
            to prevent the dismemberment of Mesopotamia.” This <lb/>
            speech having been related to the emperor with many <lb/>
            additions, and a malignant interpretation, Constantius <lb/>
            became enraged beyond measure; and without allowing <note type="footnote">1 " The minute interval which may be interposed between the hyeme <lb/>
            adultâ and the primo vere of Ammianus, instead of allowing a sufficient <lb/>
            space for a march of three thousand miles, would render the orders of <lb/>
            Constantius as extravagant as they were unjust; the troops of Gaul <lb/>
            could not have reached Syria till the end of autumn. The memory of <lb/>
            Ammianus must have been inaccurate, and his language incorrect.”— <lb/>

            the affair to be discussed, or those things to be explained to <lb/>
            him of which he was ignorant, he believed all the calum- <lb/>
            nies against Ursieinus, and deposing him from his offiee, <lb/>
            ordered him into retirement; promoting Agile, by a vast <lb/>
            leap, to take his place, he having been before only a tribune <lb/>
            of a native troop of Scutarii.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AT the same time one day the sky in the east was <lb/>
            perceived to be covered with a thick darkness, and from <lb/>
            daybreak to noon the stars were visible throughout; and, <lb/>
            as an addition to these terrors, while the light of heaven <lb/>
            was thus withdrawn, and the world almost buried in <lb/>
            clouds, men, from the length of the eclipse, began to <lb/>
            believe that the sun had wholly disappeared. Presently, <lb/>
            however, it was seen again like a new moon, then like a <lb/>
            half-moon, and at last it was restored entire.</p>
          <p>2. A thing which on other occasions did not happen so <lb/>
            visibly except when after several unequal revolutions, the <lb/>
            moon returns to exactly the same point at fixed intervals; <lb/>
            that is to say, when the moon is found in the same sign of <lb/>
            the zodiac, exactly opposite to the rays of the sun, and stops <lb/>
            there a few minutes, which in geometry are called parts of <lb/>
            parts.</p>
          <p>3. And although the changes and motions of both sun <lb/>
            and moon, as the inquiries into intelligible causes have <lb/>
            remarked, perpetually return to the same conjunction at <lb/>
            the end of each lunar month, still the sun is not always <lb/>
            eclipsed on these occasions, but only when the moon, as by <lb/>
            a kind of balance, is in the exact centre between the sun <lb/>
            and our sight.</p>
          <p>4. In short, the sun is eclipsed, and his brilliancy <lb/>
            removed from our sight, when he and the moon, which of <lb/>
            all the constellations of heaven is the lowest, proceeding <lb/>
            with equal pace in their orbits, are placed in conjunction <lb/>
            in spite of the height which separates them (as Ptolemy <lb/>
            learnedly explains it), and afterwards return to the dimen- <lb/>
            sions which are called ascending or descending points of the <lb/>
            ecliptic conjunctions : or, as the Greeks call them, defective <lb/>
            conjunctions. And if these great lights find themselves in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of these points cr knots, the eclipse is small. <pb n="215"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D 360.] </note> 5. But if they are exactly in the knots which form the <lb/>
            points of intersection between the ascending and descending <lb/>
            path of the moon, then the sky will be covered with denser <lb/>
            darkness, and the whole atmosphere becomes so thick that <lb/>
            we cannot see what is close to us.</p>
          <p>6. Again, the sun is conceived to appear double when a <lb/>
            cloud is raised higher than usual, which from its proximity <lb/>
            to the eternal fires, shines in such a manner that it forms <lb/>
            the brightness of a second orb as from a purer mirror.</p>
          <p>7. Now let us come to the moon. The moon sustains a <lb/>
            clear and visible eclipse when, being at the full, and exactly <lb/>
            opposite to the sun, she is distant from his orb one hundred <lb/>
            and eighty degrees, that is, is in the seventh sign ; and <lb/>
            although this happens at every full moon, still there is not <lb/>
            always one eclipse.</p>
          <p>8. But since she is always nearest to the earth as it re- <lb/>
            volves, and the most distant from the rest of the other stars, <lb/>
            and sometimes exposes itself to the light which strikes it, <lb/>
            and sometimes also is partially obscured by the interven- <lb/>
            tion of the shade of night, which comes over it in the <lb/>
            form of a cone ; and then she is involved in thick dark- <lb/>
            ness, when the sun, being surrounded by the centre of the <lb/>
            lowest sphere, cannot illuminate her with his rays, because <lb/>
            the mass of the earth is in the way; for opinions agree <lb/>
            that the moon has no light of her own.</p>
          <p>9. And when she returns to the same sign of the zodiac <lb/>
            which the sun occupies, she is obscured (as has been said), <lb/>
            her brightness being wholly dimmed, and this is called a <lb/>
            conjunction of the moon.</p>
          <p>10. Again the moon is said to be new when she has the <lb/>
            sun above her with a slight variation from the perpendi- <lb/>
            cular, and then she appears very thin to mankind, even <lb/>
            when leaving the sun she reaches the second sign. Then, <lb/>
            when she has advanced further, and shines brilliantly with <lb/>
            a sort of homed figure, she is said to be crescent shaped ; <lb/>
            but when she begins to be a long way distant from the sun, <lb/>
            and reaches the fourth sign, she gets a greater light, the <lb/>
            sun's rays being turned upon her, and then she is of the <lb/>
            shape of a semicircle.</p>
          <p>11. As she goes on still further, and reaches the fifth <lb/>
            sign. she assumes a convex shape, a sort of hump appear- <lb/>
            ing from each side. And when she is exactly opposite the <pb n="216"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK.XX. CH. IV </note> <lb/>
            sun, she shines with a full light, having arrived at the <lb/>
            seventh sign; and even while she is there, having advanced <lb/>
            but a very little further, she begins to diminish, which we <lb/>
            call waning; and as she gets older, she resumes the same <lb/>
            shapes that she had while increasing. But it is established <lb/>
            by unanimous consent that she is never seen to be eclipsed <lb/>
            except in the middle of her course.</p>
          <p>12. But when we said that the sun moves sometimes in <lb/>
            the ether, sometimes in the lower world, it must be under- <lb/>
            stood that the starry bodies, considered in relation to the <lb/>
            universe, neither set nor rise; but only appear to do so to <lb/>
            our sight on earth, which is suspended by the motion of <lb/>
            some interior spirit, and compared with the immensity of <lb/>
            things is but a little point, which causes the stars in their <lb/>
            eternal order to appear sometimes fixed in heaven, and at <lb/>
            others, from the imperfection of human vision, moving from <lb/>
            their places. Let us now return to our original subject.</p>

          <p>§ 1. EVEN while he was hastening to lead succours to the <lb/>
            East, which, as the concurrent testimony of both spies and <lb/>
            deserters assured him, was on the point of being invaded <lb/>
            by the Persians, Constantius was greatly disturbed by the <lb/>
            virtues of Julian, which were now becoming renowned <lb/>
            among all nations, so highly did fame extol his great <lb/>
            labours, achievements, and victories, in having conquered <lb/>
            several kingdoms of the Allemanni, and recovered several <lb/>
            towns in Gaul which had been plundered and destroyed by <lb/>
            the barbarians, and having compelled the barbarians them- <lb/>
            selves to become subjects and tributaries of the empire.</p>
          <p>2. Influenced by these considerations, and fearing lest <lb/>
            Julian's influence should become greater, at the instigation, <lb/>
            as it is said, of the prefect Florentius, he sent Decentius, <lb/>
            the tribune and secretary, to bring away at once the <lb/>
            auxiliary troops of the Heruli and Batavi, and the Celtæ, <lb/>
            and the legion called Petulantes,1 and three hundred <lb/>
            picked men from the other forces; enjoining him to make all <lb/>
            speed on the plea that their presence was required with the <note type="footnote"> 1 According to Erdfurt, this legion was so named from its contu- <lb/>

            army which it was intended to march at the beginning of <lb/>
            spring against the Parthians.</p>
          <p>3. Also, Lupicinus was directed to come as commander <lb/>
            of these auxiliary troops with the three hundred picked <lb/>
            men, and to lose no time, as it was not known that he had <lb/>
            crossed over to Britain ; and Sintula, at that time the <lb/>
            superintendent of Julian's stables, was ordered to select the <lb/>
            best men of the Scutarii and Gentiles,. and to bring them <lb/>
            also to join the emperor.</p>
          <p>4. Julian made no remonstrance, but obeyed these <lb/>
            orders, yielding in all respects to the will of the emperor. <lb/>
            But on one point he could not conceal his feelings nor keep <lb/>
            silence: but entreated that those men might be spared from <lb/>
            this hardship who had left their homes on the other side of <lb/>
            the Rhine, and had joined his army on condition of never <lb/>
            being moved into any country beyond the Alps, urging that <lb/>
            if this were known, it might be feared that other volunteers <lb/>
            of the barbarian nations, who had often enlisted in our ser- <lb/>
            vice on similar conditions, would be prevented from doing <lb/>
            so in future. But he argued in vain.</p>
          <p>5. For the tribune. disregaiding his complaints, carried <lb/>
            out the commands of the emperor, and having chosen out a <lb/>
            band suited for forced marches, of pre-eminent vigour and <lb/>
            activity, set. out with them full of hope of promotion.</p>
          <p>6. And as Julian, being in doubt what to do about the <lb/>
            rest of the troops whom he was ordered to send, and revolv- <lb/>
            ing all kinds of plans in his mind, considered that the <lb/>
            matter ought to be managed with great care, as there was <lb/>
            on one side the fierceness of the barbarians, and on the <lb/>
            other the authority of the orders he had received (his per- <lb/>
            plexity being further increased by the absence of the com- <lb/>
            mander of the cavalry), he <unclear>urged</unclear> the prefect, who had gone <lb/>
            some time before to Vienne under the pretence of procuring <lb/>
            corn, but in reality to escape from military troubles, to <lb/>
            return to him.</p>
          <p>7. For the prefect bore in mind the substance of a report <lb/>
            which he was suspected to have sent some time before, and <lb/>
            which recommended the withdrawing from the defence of <lb/>
            Gaul those troops so renowned for their valour, and already <lb/>
            objects of dread to the barbarians. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Gentiles were body-guards of the emperor, or of the Cæsar, of <lb/>

            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XX. CH. IV. </note> 8. The prefect, as soon as he had received Julian's <lb/>
            letters, informing him of what had happened, and entreat- <lb/>
            ing him to come speedily to him to aid the republic with <lb/>
            his counsels, positively refused, being alarmed because <lb/>
            the letters expressly declared that in any crisis of danger <lb/>
            the prefect ought never to be absent from the general. <lb/>
            And it was added that if he declined to give his aid, <lb/>
            Julian himself would, of his own accord, renounce the <lb/>
            emblems of authority, thinking it better to die, if so it was <lb/>
            fated, than to have the ruin of the provinces attributed to <lb/>
            him. But the obstinacy of the prefect prevailed, and he <lb/>
            resolutely refused to comply with the wishes thus reason- <lb/>
            ably expressed and enforced.</p>
          <p>9. But during the delay which arose from the absence of <lb/>
            Lupicinus and of any military movement on the part of the <lb/>
            alarmed prefect, Julian, deprived of all assistance in the <lb/>
            way of advice, and being greatly perplexed, thought it best <lb/>
            to hasten the departure of all his troops from the stations <lb/>
            in which they were passing the winter, and to let them <lb/>
            begin their march.</p>
          <p>10. When this was known, some one privily threw down <lb/>
            a bitter libel near the standard of the Petulantes legion, <lb/>
            which, among other things, contained these words,-,, We <lb/>
            are being driven to the farthest parts of the earth like con- <lb/>
            demned criminals, and our relations will become slaves to <lb/>
            the Allemanni after we have delivered them from that first <lb/>
            captivity by desperate battles."</p>
          <p>11. When this writing was taken to head-quarters and <lb/>
            read, Julian, considering the reasonableness of the com- <lb/>
            plaint. ordered that their families should go to the East <lb/>
            with them. and allowed them the use of the public wagons <lb/>
            for the purpose of moving them. And as it was for some <lb/>
            time doubted which road they should take, he decided, <lb/>
            at the suggestion of the secretary Decentius, that they <lb/>
            should go by Paris, where he himself still was, not having <lb/>
            moved.</p>
          <p>12. And so it was done. And when they arrived in the <lb/>
            suburbs, the prince, according to his custom, met them, <lb/>
            praising those whom he recognized, and reminding indi- <lb/>
            viduals of their gallant deeds, he congratulated them with <lb/>
            courteous words, encouraging them to go cheerfully to join <lb/>
            the emperor, as they would reap the most worthy rewards <pb n="219"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> <lb/>
            of their exertions where power was the greatest and most <lb/>
            extensive.</p>
          <p>13. And to do them the more honour, as they were <lb/>
            going to a great distance, he invited their chiefs to a <lb/>
            supper, when he bade them ask whatever they desired. <lb/>
            And they, having been treated with such liberality, de- <lb/>
            parted, anxious and sorrowful on two accounts, because <lb/>
            cruel fortune was separating them at once from so kind a <lb/>
            ruler and from their native land. And with this sorrowful <lb/>
            feeling they retired to their camp.</p>
          <p>14. But when night came on they broke out into open <lb/>
            discontent, and their minds being excited, as his own griefs <lb/>
            pressed upon each individual, they had recourse to force, <lb/>
            and took up arms, and with a great outcry thronged to the <lb/>
            palace, and surrounding it so as to prevent any one from <lb/>
            escaping, they saluted Julian as emperor with loud vocife- <lb/>
            rations, insisting vehemently on his coming forth to them; <lb/>
            and though they were compelled to wait till daylight, still, <lb/>
            as they would not depart, at last he did come forth. And <lb/>
            when he appeared, they saluted him emperor with re- <lb/>
            doubled and unanimous cheers.</p>
          <p>15. But he steadily resisted them individually and col- <lb/>
            lectively, at one time showing himself indignant, at another <lb/>
            holding out his hands and entreating and beseeching them <lb/>
            not to sully their numerous victories with anything un- <lb/>
            becoming, and not to let unseasonable rashness and pre- <lb/>
            cipitation awaken materials for discord. At last he appeased <lb/>
            them, and having addressed them mildly, he added-</p>
          <p>16. "I beseech you let your anger depart.for a while: <lb/>
            without any dissension or attempt at revolution what yon <lb/>
            wish will easily be obtained. Since yon are so strongly <lb/>
            bound by love of your country, and fear strange lands to <lb/>
            which you are unaccustomed, return now to your homes, <lb/>
            certain that you shall not cross the Alps, since yon dislike <lb/>
            it. And I will explain the matter to the full satisfaction <lb/>
            of the emperor, who is a man of great wisdom, and will <lb/>
            listen to reason."</p>
          <p>IT. Nevertheless, after his speech was ended, the cries <lb/>
            were repeated with as much vigour and unanimity as ever; <lb/>
            and so vehement was the uproar and zeal, which did not <lb/>
            even spare reproaches and threats, that Julian was com- <lb/>
            pelled to consent. And being lifted up on the shield of an <pb n="220"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XX. CH. IV. </note> <lb/>
            infantry soldier, and raised up in sight of all, he was <lb/>
            saluted as Augustus with one universal acclamation, and <lb/>
            was ordered to produce a diadem. And when he said that <lb/>
            he had never had one, his wife's coronet or necklace was <lb/>
            demanded.</p>
          <p>18. And when he protested that it was not fitting for <lb/>
            him at his first accession to be adorned with female orna- <lb/>
            ments, the frontlet of a horse was sought for, so that being <lb/>
            crowned therewith, he might have some badge, however ob- <lb/>
            scure, of supreme power. But when he insisted that that <lb/>
            also would be unbecoming, a man named Maurus, after- <lb/>
            wards a count, the same who was defeated in the defile <lb/>
            01 the Sued, but who was then only one of the front- <lb/>
            rank men of the Petulantes. tore a chain off his own neck, <lb/>
            which he wore in his quality of standard-bearer, and placed <lb/>
            it boldly on Julian's head, who, being thus brought under <lb/>
            extreme compulsion, and seeing that he could not escape <lb/>
            the most imminent danger to his life if he persisted in <lb/>
            his resistance, consented to their wishes, and promised a <lb/>
            largesse of five pieces of gold and a pound of silver to <lb/>
            every man.</p>
          <p>- 19. After this Julian felt more anxiety than ever; and <lb/>
            keenly alive to the future consequences, neither wore his <lb/>
            diadem or appeared in public, nor would he even transact <lb/>
            the serious business which pressed upon his attention, <lb/>
            but sought retirement, being full of consternation at the <lb/>
            strangeness of the recent events. This continued till one <lb/>
            of the decurions of the palace (which is an office of dig- <lb/>
            nity) came in great haste to the standards of the Petulant es <lb/>
            and of the Celtic legion, and in a violent manner exclaimed <lb/>
            that it was a monstrous thing that he who had the day <lb/>
            before been by their will declared emperor should have <lb/>
            been privily assassinated.</p>
          <p>20. When this was heard, the soldiers, as readily excited <lb/>
            by what they did not know as by what they did, began <lb/>
            to brandish their javelins, and draw their swords, and <lb/>
            (as is usual at times of sudden tumult) to flock from every <lb/>
            quarter in haste and disorder to the palace. The sentinels <lb/>
            were alarmed at the uproar, as were the tribunes and the <lb/>
            captain of the guard, and suspecting some treachery from <lb/>
            the fickle soldiery, they fled, fearing sudden death to them- <lb/>
            selves. <pb n="221"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> 21. When all before them seemed tranquil, the soldiers <lb/>
            stood quietly awhile; and on being asked what was the <lb/>
            cause of their sudden and precipitate movement, they at <lb/>
            first hesitated, and then avowing their alarm for the safety <lb/>
            of the emperor, declared they would not retire till they <lb/>
            had been admitted into the council:chamber, and had seen <lb/>
            him safe in his imperial robes.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHEN the news of these events reached the troops, <lb/>
            whom we have spoken, of as having already marched under <lb/>
            the command of Sintula, they returred with him quietly to <lb/>
            Paris. And an order having been issued that the next <lb/>
            morning they should all assemble in the open space in <lb/>
            front of the camp, Julian advanced among them, and <lb/>
            ascended a tribunal more splendid than usual, surrounded <lb/>
            with the eagles, standards, and banners, and. guarded by a <lb/>
            strong band of armed soldiers.</p>
          <p>2. And after a moment's quiet, while he looked down <lb/>
            from his height on the countenances of those before him, <lb/>
            and saw them all full of joy and alacrity, he kindled their <lb/>
            loyalty with a few simple words, as with a trumpet.</p>
          <p>3. "The difficulty of my situation, 0 brave and faithful <lb/>
            champions of myself and of the republic, who have often <lb/>
            with me exposed your lives for the welfare of the pro- <lb/>
            vinces, requires that, since you have now by your resolute <lb/>
            decision raised me, your Cæsar, to the highest of all dignities, <lb/>
            I should briefly set before yon the state of affairs, in order <lb/>
            that safe and prudent remedies for their new condition may <lb/>
            be devised.</p>
          <p>4. “While little more than a youth as yon well know, I <lb/>
            was for form's sake invested with the purple, and by the <lb/>
            decision of the emperor was intrusted to your protection. <lb/>
            Since that time I have never forgotten my resolution of a <lb/>
            virtuous life : I have been seen with you as the partner of <lb/>
            all your labours, when, in consequence of the diminution of <lb/>
            the confidence felt in us by the barbarians, terrible disas- <lb/>
            ters fell upon the empire, our cities being stormed, and <lb/>
            countless thousands of men being slain, and even the little <lb/>
            that was left to us being in a very tottering condition. I <lb/>
            think it superfluous to recapitulate how often, in the depth <pb n="222"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XX. CH. V </note> <lb/>
            of winter, beneath a frozen sky, at a season when there is <lb/>
            usually a cessation from war both by land and sea, we <lb/>
            have defeated with heavy loss the Allemanni, previously <lb/>
            unconquered.</p>
          <p>5. “One circumstance may neither be passed over nor <lb/>
            suppressed. On that glorious day which we saw at Stras- <lb/>
            burg, which brought perpetual liberty to Gaul, we together, <lb/>
            I throwing myself among the thickly falling darts, and you <lb/>
            Deing invincible by your vigour and experience, repelled <lb/>
            the enemy who poured upon us like a torrent; slaying <lb/>
            them as we did with the sword, or driving them to be <lb/>
            drowned in the river, with very little loss of our own men, <lb/>
            whose funerals we celebrated with glorious panegyrics <lb/>
            rather than with mourning.</p>
          <p>6. " It is my belief that after such mighty achievements <lb/>
            posterity will not be silent respecting your services to the <lb/>
            republic, in every country, if you now, in case of any <lb/>
            danger or misfortune, vigorously support with your valour <lb/>
            and resolution me whom you have raised to the lofty dig- <lb/>
            nity of emperor.</p>
          <p>7. “But to maintain things in their due order, so as to <lb/>
            preserve to brave men their well-merited rewards and <lb/>
            prevent underhand ambition from forestalling your honours, <lb/>
            I make this rule in the honourable presence of your counsel, <lb/>
            That no civil or military officer shall be promoted from any <lb/>
            other consideration than that of his own merits; and he <lb/>
            shall be disgraced who solicits promotion for any one on <lb/>
            any other ground."</p>
          <p>8. The lower class of soldiers, who had long been de- <lb/>
            prived of rank or reward, were encouraged by this speech <lb/>
            to entertain better hopes, and now rising up with a great <lb/>
            noise, and beating their shields with their spears, they <lb/>
            with unanimous shouts showed their approbation of his <lb/>
            language and purpose.</p>
          <p>9. And that no opportunity, however brief, might be <lb/>
            afforded to disturb so wise an arrangement, the Petu-- <lb/>
            lantes and Celtic legion immediately besought him, on <lb/>
            behalf of their commissaries, to give them the govern- <lb/>
            ment of any provinces he pleased, and when he refused <lb/>
            them, they retired without being either offended or out of <lb/>
            humour.</p>
          <p>10. But the very night before the day on which he was <pb n="223"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> <lb/>
            thus proclaimed emperor, Julian had mentioned to his <lb/>
            most intimate friends that during his slumbers some one <lb/>
            had appeared to him in a dream, in the form and habit of <lb/>
            the genius of the empire, who uttered these words in a <lb/>
            tone of reproach: "For some time, Julian, have I been <lb/>
            secretly watching the door of thy palace, wishing to in- <lb/>
            crease thy dignity, and I have often retired as one rejected; <lb/>
            but if I am not now admitted, when the opinion of the <lb/>
            many is unanimous, I shall retire discouraged and sorrow- <lb/>
            ful. But lay this up in the depth of thy heait, that I will <lb/>
            dwell with thee no longer."</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHILE these transactions were proceeding in Gaul, <lb/>
            to the great anxiety of many, the fierce king of Persia (the <lb/>
            advice of Antoninus being now seconded by the arrival <lb/>
            of Craugasius), burning with eagerness to obtain Meso- <lb/>
            potamia, while Constantius with his army was at a dis- <lb/>
            tance, crossed the Tigris in due form with a vast army, <lb/>
            and laid siege to Singara with a thoroughly equipped force, <lb/>
            sufficient for the siege of a town which, in the opinion of <lb/>
            the chief commanders of those regions, was abundantly <lb/>
            fortified and supplied.</p>
          <p>2. The garrison, as soon as they saw the enemy, while <lb/>
            still at a distance, at once closed their gates, and with <lb/>
            great spirit thronged to the towers and battlements, collect- <lb/>
            in- on them stones and warlike engines. And then, having <lb/>
            made all their preparations, they stood prepared to repel <lb/>
            the advancing host if they should venture to approach the <lb/>
            walls.</p>
          <p>3. Therefore the king, when he arrived and found that, <lb/>
            though they would admit some of his nobles near enough <lb/>
            to confer with them, he could not. by any conciliatory lan- <lb/>
            guage, bend the garrison to his wishes, he gave one entire <lb/>
            day to rest, and then, at daybreak, on a signal made by the <lb/>
            laising of a scarlet flag, the whole city was surrounded by <lb/>
            men carrying ladders, while others began to raise engines; <lb/>
            all being protected by fences and penthouses while seeking <lb/>
            a way to assail the foundation of the walls.</p>
          <p>4. Against these attempts the citizens, standing on the <lb/>
            lofty battlements, drove back with stones and every kind <pb n="224"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XX. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            of missile the assailants who were seeking with great <lb/>
            ferocity to find an entrance.</p>
          <p>5. For many days the struggle continued without any <lb/>
            decided result, many being wounded and killed on both <lb/>
            sides. At last, the struggle growing fiercer, one day on <lb/>
            the approach of evening a very heavy battering-ram was <lb/>
            brought forward among other engines, which battered a <lb/>
            round tower with repeated blows, at a point where we <lb/>
            mentioned that the city had been laid open in a former <lb/>
            siege.</p>
          <p>6. The citizens at once repaired to this point, and a <lb/>
            violent conflict arose in this small space; torches and fire- <lb/>
            brands were brought from all quarters to consume this <lb/>
            formidable engine, while arrows and bullets were showered <lb/>
            down without cessation on the assailants. But the keen- <lb/>
            ness of the ram prevailed over every means of defence, <lb/>
            digging through the mortar of the recently cemented stones, <lb/>
            which was still moist and unsettled.</p>
          <p>7. And while the contest was thus proceeding with fire <lb/>
            and sword, the tower fell, and a path was opened into the <lb/>
            city, the place being stripped of its defenders, whom the <lb/>
            magnitude of the danger had scattered. The Persian bands <lb/>
            raised a wild shout, and without hindrance filled every <lb/>
            quarter of the city. A very few of the inhabitants were <lb/>
            slain, and all the rest, by command of Sapor, were taken <lb/>
            alive and transported to the most distant regions of Persia.</p>
          <p>8. There had been assigned for the protection of this city <lb/>
            two legions, the first Flavian and the first Parthian, and a <lb/>
            great body of native troops, as well as a division of auxi- <lb/>
            liary cavalry which had been shut up in it through the <lb/>
            suddenness of the attack made upon it. All of these, as I <lb/>
            have said, were taken prisoners, without receiving any <lb/>
            assistance from our armies.</p>
          <p>9. For the greater part of our army was in tents taking <lb/>
            care of Nisibis, which was at a considerable distance. But <lb/>
            even if it had not been so, no one even in ancient times <lb/>
            could easily bring aid to Singara when in danger, since the <lb/>
            whole country around laboured under a scarcity of water. <lb/>
            And although a former generation had placed this fort very <lb/>
            advisedly, to check sudden movements of hostility, yet it <lb/>
            was a great burden to the state, having been several times <lb/>
            taken, and always involving the loss of its garrison <pb n="225"/>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER Singara had fallen, Sapor prudently avoided <lb/>
            Nisibis, recollecting the losses which he had several times <lb/>
            sustained before it, and turned to the right by a circuitous <lb/>
            path, hoping either to subdue by force or to win by bribes <lb/>
            the garrison of Bezabde, which its founders also called <lb/>
            Phoenice, and to make himself master of that town, which <lb/>
            is an exceedingly strong fortress, placed on a hill of <lb/>
            moderate height, and close to the banks of the Tigris, <lb/>
            having a double wall, as many places have which from their <lb/>
            situation are thought to be especially exposed. For its de- <lb/>
            fence three legions had been assigned; the second Flavian, <lb/>
            the second Armenian, and the second Parthian, with a <lb/>
            large body of archers of the Zabdiceni, a tribe subject to <lb/>
            us, in whose territory this town was situated.</p>
          <p>2. At the beginning of the siege, the king, with an <lb/>
            escort of glittering cuirassiers, himself taller than any of <lb/>
            them, rode entirely round the camp, coming up boldly to <lb/>
            the very edge of the fosse, where he was at once a mark for <lb/>
            the unerring bullets of the balistæ, and arrows ; but he was <lb/>
            so completely covered with thick scale armour that he <lb/>
            retired unhurt.</p>
          <p>3. Then laying aside his anger, he sent some heralds <lb/>
            with all due solemnity, courteously inviting the besieged <lb/>
            to consult the safety of their lives, and seeing the despe- <lb/>
            rateness of their situation, to put an end to the siege by a <lb/>
            timely surrender; to open their gates and come forth, pre- <lb/>
            senting themselves as suppliants before the conqueror of <lb/>
            nations.</p>
          <p>4. When these messengers approached the walls, the garri- <lb/>
            son spared them because they had with them some men of <lb/>
            noble birth, who had been made prisoners at Singara, and <lb/>
            were well known to the citizens; and out of pity to them no <lb/>
            one shot an arrow, though they would give no reply to the <lb/>
            proposal of peace.</p>
          <p>5. Then a truce being made for a day and night, before <lb/>
            dawn on the second day the entire force of the Persians <lb/>
            attacked the palisade with ferocious threats and cries, <lb/>
            coming up boldly to the walls, where a fierce contest <lb/>
            ensued, the citizens resisting with great vigour. <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XX. CH. VII. </note> 6. So that many of the Parthians1 were wounded, <lb/>
            because some of them carrying ladders, and others wicker <lb/>
            screens, advanced as it were blindfold, and were not spared <lb/>
            by our men. For the clouds of arrows flew thickly, <lb/>
            piercing the enemy packed in close order. At last, after <lb/>
            sunset the two sides separated, having suffered about equal <lb/>
            loss : and the next day before dawn the combat was re- <lb/>
            newed with greater vehemence than before, the trumpets <lb/>
            cheering the men on both sides, and aga:n a terrible <lb/>
            slaughter of each took place, both armies struggling with <lb/>
            the most determined obstinacy.</p>
          <p>7. But on the following day both armies by common <lb/>
            consent rested from their terrible exertions, the defenders <lb/>
            of the walls and the Persians being equally dismayed. <lb/>
            When a Christian priest made sign by gestures that he <lb/>
            desired to go forth, and having received a promise that he <lb/>
            should be allowed to return in safety, he advanced to the <lb/>
            king's tent.</p>
          <p>8. When he was permitted to speak, he, with gentle <lb/>
            language, urged the Persians to depart to their own country, <lb/>
            affirming that after the losses each side had sustained they <lb/>
            had reason perhaps to fear even greater disasters in future. <lb/>
            But these and other similar arguments were uttered to no <lb/>
            purpose. The fierce madness of the king robbing them of <lb/>
            their effect, as Sapor swore positively that he would never <lb/>
            retire till he had destroyed our camp.</p>
          <p>9. Nevertheless a groundless suspicion was whispered <lb/>
            against the bishop, wholly false in my opinion, though <lb/>
            supported by the assertions of many, that he had secretly <lb/>
            informed Sapor what part of the wall to attack, as being <lb/>
            internally slight and weak. Though the suspicion derived <lb/>
            some corroboration from the fact that afterwards the <lb/>
            engines of the enemy were carefully and with great ex- <lb/>
            ultation directed against the places which were weakest, <lb/>
            or most decayed, as if those who worked them were ac-. <lb/>
            quainted with what parts were most easily penetrable.</p>
          <p>10. And although the narrowness of the causeway made <lb/>
            the approach to the walls hard, and though the battering- <lb/>
            rams when equipped were brought forward with great <lb/>
            difficulty, from fear of the stones and arrows hurled upon <note type="footnote"> I It maybe remarked that Ammianus continually uses the words Per- <lb/>
            sian and Parthian as synonymous. </note> <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> <lb/>
            the assailants by the besieged, still neither the balistæ ncr <lb/>
            the scorpions rested a moment, the first shooting javelins, <lb/>
            and the latter hurling showers of stones, and baskets on <lb/>
            fire, smeared with pitch and tar; and as these were per- <lb/>
            petually rolled down, the engines halted as if rooted to <lb/>
            the ground, and fiery darts and firebrands well-aimed set <lb/>
            them on fire.</p>
          <p>11. Still while this was going on, and numbers were <lb/>
            falling on both sides, the besiegers were the more eager to <lb/>
            destroy a town, strong both by its natural situation and its <lb/>
            powerful defences, before the arrival of winter, thinking it <lb/>
            impossible to appease the fury of their king if they should <lb/>
            fail. Therefore neither abundant bloodshed nor the sight <lb/>
            of numbers of their comrades pierced with deadly wounds <lb/>
            could deter the rest from similar audacity.</p>
          <p>12. But for a long time, fighting with absolute desperation, <lb/>
            they exposed themselves to imminent danger; while those <lb/>
            who worked the battering-rams were prevented from ad- <lb/>
            vancing by the vast weight of millstones, and all kinds of <lb/>
            fiery missiles hurled against them.</p>
          <p>13. One battering-ram was higher than the rest, and was <lb/>
            covered with bull's hides wetted, and being therefore safer <lb/>
            from any accident of fire, or from lighted javelins, it <lb/>
            led the way in the attacks on the wall with mighty blows, <lb/>
            and with its terrible point it dug into the joints of the <lb/>
            stones till it overthrew the tower. The tower fell with a <lb/>
            mighty crash, and those in it were thrown down with a <lb/>
            sudden jerk, and breaking their limbs, or being buried <lb/>
            beneath the ruins, perished by various and unexpected <lb/>
            kinds of death; then, a safer entrance having been thus <lb/>
            found, the multitude of the enemy poured in with their <lb/>
            arms.</p>
          <p>14. While the war-cry of the Persians sounded in the <lb/>
            trembling ears of the defeated garrison, a fierce battle <lb/>
            within the narrower bounds raged within the walls, while <lb/>
            bands of our men and of the enemy fought hand to hand, <lb/>
            being jammed together, with swords drawn on both sides, <lb/>
            and no quarter given.</p>
          <p>15. At last the besieged, after making head with mighty <lb/>
            exertion against the destruction which long seemed <lb/>
            doubtful, were overwhelmed with the weight of the <lb/>
            countless host which pressed upon them. And the swords <pb n="228"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XX. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            of the furious foe cut down all they could find ; children <lb/>
            were torn from their mother's bosom, and the mothers <lb/>
            were slain, no one regarding what he did. Among these <lb/>
            mournful scenes the Persians, devoted to plunder, loaded <lb/>
            with every kind of booty, and driving before them a <lb/>
            vast multitude of prisoners, returned in triumph to their <lb/>
            tents.</p>
          <p>16. But the king, elated with insolence and triumph, <lb/>
            having long been desirous to obtain possession of Phoenice, <lb/>
            as a most important fortress, did not retire till he had re- <lb/>
            paired in the strongest manner that portion of the walls <lb/>
            which had been shaken, and till he had stocked it with <lb/>
            ample magazines of provisions, and placed in it a garrison <lb/>
            of men noble by birth and eminent for their skill in war. <lb/>
            For he feared (what indeed happened) that the Romans, <lb/>
            being indignant at the loss of this their grand camp, would <lb/>
            exert themselves with all their might to recover it.</p>
          <p>17. Then, being full of exultation, and cherishing <lb/>
            greater hopes than ever of gaining whatever he desired, <lb/>
            after taking a few forts of small importance, he prepared to <lb/>
            attack Vieta, a very ancient fortress, believed to have been <lb/>
            founded by Alexander, the Macedonian, situated on the <lb/>
            most distant border of Mesopotamia, and surrounded with <lb/>
            winding walls full of projecting angles, and so well fur- <lb/>
            nished at all points as to be almost unassailable.</p>
          <p>18. And when he had tried every expedient against it, <lb/>
            at one time trying to bribe the garrison with promises, at <lb/>
            another to terrify them with threats of torture, and em- <lb/>
            ploying all kinds of engines such as are used in sieges, <lb/>
            after sustaining more injury than he inflicted, he at last <lb/>
            retired from his unsuccessful enterprise.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THESE were the events of this year between the Tigris <lb/>
            and the Euphrates. And when frequent intelligence of <lb/>
            them had reached Constantius, who was in continual dread <lb/>
            of Parthian expeditions, and was passing the winter at <lb/>
            Constantinople, he devoted greater care than ever to <lb/>
            strengthening his frontiers with every kind of warlike <lb/>
            equipment. He collected veterans, and enlisted recruits, <lb/>
            and increased the legions with reinforcements of vigorous <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> <lb/>
            youths, who had already repeatedly signalized their valour <lb/>
            in the battles of the eastern campaigns: and beside these <lb/>
            he collected auxiliary forces from among the Scythians by <lb/>
            urgent requests and promises of pay, in order to set out <lb/>
            from Thrace in the spring, and at once march to the dis- <lb/>
            turbed provinces.</p>
          <p>2. During the same time Julian, who was wintering at <lb/>
            Paris, alarmed at the prospect of the ultimate issue of the <lb/>
            events in that district, became full of anxiety, feeling sure, <lb/>
            after deep consideration, that Constantius would never <lb/>
            give his consent to what had been done in his case, since <lb/>
            he had always disdained him as a person of no importance.</p>
          <p>3. Therefore, after much reflection on the somewhat <lb/>
            disturbed beginning which the present novel state of <lb/>
            affairs showed, he determined to send envoys to him to <lb/>
            relate all that had taken place; and he gave them letters <lb/>
            setting forth fully what had been done, and what ought to <lb/>
            be done next, supporting his recommendations by proofs.</p>
          <p>4. Although in reality he believed that the emperor <lb/>
            was already informed of all, from the report of Decentius, <lb/>
            who had returned to him some time before; and of the <lb/>
            chamberlains who had recently gone back from Gaul, <lb/>
            after having brought him some formal orders. And <lb/>
            although he was not in reality vexed at his promotion, <lb/>
            still he avoided all arrogant language in his letters, that he <lb/>
            might not appear to have suddenly shaken off his authority. <lb/>
            Now the following was the purport of his letters.</p>
          <p>5. “I have at all times been of the same mind, and <lb/>
            have adhered to my original intentions, not less by my <lb/>
            conduct than by my promises, as far as lay in my power, <lb/>
            as has been abundantly plain from repeated actions of <lb/>
            mine.</p>
          <p>6. “And up to this time, since you created me Cæsar, <lb/>
            and exposed me to the din of war, contented with the <lb/>
            power you conferred on me, as a faithful officer I have <lb/>
            sent you continued intelligence of all your affairs proceed- <lb/>
            ing according to your wishes ; never speaking of my own <lb/>
            dangers; though it can easily be proved, that, while the <lb/>
            Germans have been routed in every direction, I have <lb/>
            always been the first in all toils and the last to allow <lb/>
            myself any rest.</p>
          <p>7. " But allow me to say, that if any violent change has <pb n="230"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XX. CH. VIII.</note> <lb/>
            taken place, as you think, the soldier who has been passing <lb/>
            his life in many terrible wars without reward, has only <lb/>
            completed what he has long had under consideration, <lb/>
            being indignant and impatient at being only under a chief <lb/>
            of the second class, as knowing that from a Cæsar no <lb/>
            adequate reward for his continued exertions and frequent <lb/>
            victories could possibly be procured.</p>
          <p>8. " And while angry at the feeling that he could <lb/>
            neither expect promotion nor annual pay, he had this <lb/>
            sudden aggravation to his discontent, that he, a man used <lb/>
            to cold climates, was ordered to march to the most remote <lb/>
            districts of the East, to be separated from his wife and <lb/>
            children, and to be dragged away in want and nakedness. <lb/>
            This made him fiercer than usual; and so the troops one <lb/>
            night collected and laid siege to the palace, saluting <lb/>
            with loud and incessant outcries Julian as emperor.</p>
          <p>9. “I shuddered at their boldness, I confess, and <lb/>
            withdrew myself. And retiring while I could, I sought <lb/>
            safety in concealment and disguise-and as they would not <lb/>
            desist, armed, so to say, with the shield of my own free <lb/>
            heart, I came out before them all, thinking that the tumult <lb/>
            might be appeased by authority, or by conciliatory language.</p>
          <p>10. They became wonderfully excited, and proceeded <lb/>
            to such lengths that, when I endeavoured to overcome <lb/>
            their pertinacity with my entreaties, they came close up <lb/>
            to me, threatening me with instant death. At last I was <lb/>
            overcome, and arguing with myself that if I were mur- <lb/>
            dered by them some one else would willingly accept the <lb/>
            dignity of emperor, I consented, hoping thus to pacify <lb/>
            their armed violence.</p>
          <p>11. " This is the plain account of what has been done; <lb/>
            and I entreat you to listen to it with mildness. Do not <lb/>
            believe that anything else is the truth ; and do not listen to <lb/>
            malignant men who deal in mischievous whispers, always <lb/>
            eager to seek their own gain by causing ill will between <lb/>
            princes. Banish flattery, which is the nurse of vice, and <lb/>
            listen to the voice of that most excellent of all virtues, <lb/>
            justice. And receive with good faith the equitable con- <lb/>

            such things are for the interest of the Roman state, and of <lb/>
            us also who are united by affection of blood, and by an <lb/>
            equality of superior fortune. <pb n="231"/>

            I am not so anxious to see carried out, as to see them <lb/>
            approved by you as expedient and proper; and I shall <lb/>
            with eagerness follow all your instructions.</p>
          <p>13. " What requires to be done I will briefly explain. <lb/>
            I will provide you some Spanish draught horses, and some <lb/>
            youths to mingle with the Gentiles and Scutarii of the <lb/>
            Letian tribe, a race of barbarians on the side of the Rhine; <lb/>
            or else of those people which have come over to our <lb/>
            side. And I promise till the end of my life to do all <lb/>
            I can to assist you, not only with gratitude, but with <lb/>
            eagerness.</p>
          <p>14. “Your clemency will appoint us prefects for our <lb/>
            prætorium of known equity and virtue: the appointment <lb/>
            of the ordinary judges, and the promotion of the military <lb/>
            officers it is fair should be left to me ; as also the selection <lb/>
            of my guard. For it would be unreasonable, when it is <lb/>
            possible to be guarded against, that those persons should <lb/>
            be placed about an emperor of whose manners and in- <lb/>
            clinations he is ignorant.</p>
          <p>15. " These things I can further assure you of positively. <lb/>
            The Gauls will neither of their own accord, nor by any <lb/>
            amount of compulsion, be brought to send recruits to <lb/>
            foreign and distant countries, since they have been long <lb/>
            harassed by protracted annoyances and heavy disasters, <lb/>
            lest the youth of the nation should be destroyed, and the <lb/>
            whole people, while recollecting their past sufferings, <lb/>
            hould abandon themselves to despair for the future.</p>
          <p>16. " Nor is it fit to seek from hence assistance against <lb/>
            the Parthians, when even now the attempts of the bar- <lb/>
            barians against this land are not brought to an end, and <lb/>
            while, if you will suffer me to tell the truth, these pro- <lb/>
            vinces are still exposed to continual dangers on being de- <lb/>
            prived of all foreign or adequate assistance.</p>
          <p>17. " In speaking thus, I do think I have written to you <lb/>
            in a manner suited to the interests of the state, both in my <lb/>
            demands and my entreaties. For I well know, not to <lb/>
            speak in a lofty tone, though such might not misbecome an <lb/>
            emperor, what wretched states of affairs, even when utterly <lb/>
            desperate and given up, have been before now retrieved <lb/>
            and re-established by the agreement of princes, each <lb/>
            yielding reciprocally to one another. While it is also <pb n="232"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XX. CH. VIII. </note> <lb/>
            plain from the example of our ancestors, that rulers who <lb/>
            acknowledge and act upon such principles do somehow <lb/>
            ever find the means of living prosperously and happily, and <lb/>
            leave behind them to the latest posterity an enviable <lb/>
            fame."</p>
          <p>18. To these letters he added others of a more secret <lb/>
            purport, to be given privily to Constantius, in which he <lb/>
            blamed and reproached him ; though their exact tenor was <lb/>
            not fit to be known, nor if known, fit to be divulged to the <lb/>
            public.</p>
          <p>19. For the office of delivering these letters, men of <lb/>
            great dignity were chosen; namely, Pentadius, the master <lb/>
            of the ceremonies, and Eutherius, at that time the principal <lb/>
            chamberlain ; who were charged, after they had delivered <lb/>
            the letters, to relate what they had seen, without suppress- <lb/>
            ing anything; and to take their own measures boldly on <lb/>
            all future emergencies which might arise.</p>
          <p>20. In the mean time the flight of Florentius, the pre- <lb/>
            fect, aggravated the envy with which these circumstances <lb/>
            were regarded. For he, as if he foresaw the commotion <lb/>
            likely to arise, as might be gathered from general conver- <lb/>
            sation, from the act of sending for the troops, had departed <lb/>
            for Vienne (being also desirous to get out of the way of <lb/>
            Julian, whom he had often slandered), pretending to be <lb/>
            compelled to this journey for the sake of providing supplies <lb/>
            for the army.</p>
          <p>21. Afterwards, when he had heard of Julian's being <lb/>
            raised to the dignity of emperor, being greatly alarmed, <lb/>
            and giving up almost all hope of saving his life, he availed <lb/>
            himself of his distance from Julian to escape from the <lb/>
            evils which he suspected; and leaving behind him all his <lb/>
            family, he proceeded by slow journeys to Constantius; and <lb/>
            to prove his own innocence he brought forward many <lb/>
            charges of rebellion against Julian.</p>
          <p>22. And after his departure, Julian, adopting wise mea- <lb/>
            sures, and wishing it to be known that, even if he had <lb/>
            him in his power, he would have spared him, allowed his <lb/>
            relations to take with them all their property, and even <lb/>
            granted them the use of the public conveyances to retire <lb/>
            with safety to the East. <pb n="233"/>

          <p>§ 1. THE envoys whom I have mentioned took equal care <lb/>
            to discharge their orders ; but while eager to pursue their <lb/>
            journey they were unjustly detained by some of the <lb/>
            superior magistrates on their road; and having been long <lb/>
            and vexatiously delayed in Italy and lllyricum, they at <lb/>
            last passed the Bosphorus, and advancing by slow journeys, <lb/>
            they found Constantius still staying at Cæsarea in Cappa- <lb/>
            docia, a town formerly known as Mazaca, admirably situ- <lb/>
            ated at the foot of Mount Argæus, and of high reputation.</p>
          <p>2. Being admitted to the presence, they received permis- <lb/>
            sion to present their letters; but when they were read the <lb/>
            emperor became immoderately angry, and looking askance <lb/>
            at them so as to make them fear for their lives, he ordered <lb/>
            them to be gone without asking them any questions or <lb/>
            permitting them to speak.</p>
          <p>3. But in spite of his anger he was greatly perplexed <lb/>
            to decide whether to move those troops whom he could <lb/>
            trust against the Persians, or against Julian; and while <lb/>
            he was hesitating, and long balancing between the two <lb/>
            plans, he yielded to the useful advice of some of his <lb/>
            counsellors, and ordered the army to march to the East.</p>
          <p>4. Immediately also he dismissed the envoys, and ordered <lb/>
            his quæstor Leonas to go with all speed with letters from <lb/>
            him to Julian ; in which he asserted that he himself would <lb/>
            permit no innovators, and recommended Julian, if he had <lb/>
            any regard for his own safety or that of his relations, to <lb/>
            lay aside his arrogance, and resume the rank of Cæsar.</p>
          <p>5. And, in order to alarm him by the magnitude of his <lb/>
            preparations, as if he really was possessed of great power, <lb/>
            he appointed Nebridius, who was at that time Julian's <lb/>
            quæstor, to succeed Florentius as prefect of the prætorium, <lb/>
            and made Felix the secretary, master of the ceremonies, <lb/>
            with several other appointments. Gumoharius, the com- <lb/>
            mander of the heavy infantry, he had already appointed <lb/>
            to succeed Lupicinus, before any of these events were <lb/>
            known.</p>
          <p>6. Accordingly Leonas reached Paris, and was there <lb/>
            received as an honourable and discreet mail; and the next <lb/>
            day, when Julian had proceeded into the plain in front of <pb n="234"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XX. CH. X. </note> <lb/>
            the camp with a great multitude of soldiers and common <lb/>
            people, which he had ordered to assemble on purpose, he <lb/>
            mounted a tribune, in order from that high position to be <lb/>
            more conspicuous, and desired Leonas to present his <lb/>
            letters; and when he had opened the edict which had <lb/>
            been sent, and began to read it, as soon as he arrived at <lb/>
            the passage that Constantius disapproved of all that had <lb/>
            been done, and desired Julian to be content with the <lb/>
            power of a Cæsar, a terrible shout was raised on all sides,</p>
          <p>7. “Julian emperor, as has been decreed by the autho- <lb/>
            rity of the province, of the army, and of the republic, <lb/>
            which is indeed re-established, but which still dreads the <lb/>
            renewed attacks of the barbarians."</p>
          <p>8. Leonas heard this, and, after receiving letters from <lb/>
            Julian, stating what had occurred, was dismissed in <lb/>
            safety: the only one of the emperor's appointments which <lb/>
            was allowed to take effect was that of Nebridius, which <lb/>
            Julian in his letters had plainly said would be in accord- <lb/>
            ance with his wishes. For he himself had some time <lb/>
            before appointed Anatolius to be master of the ceremonies, <lb/>
            having been formerly his private secretary; and he had <lb/>
            also made such other appointments as seemed useful and <lb/>
            safe.</p>
          <p>9. And since, while matters were going on in this <lb/>
            matter, Lupicinus, as being a proud and arrogant man, <lb/>
            was an object of fear, though absent and still in Britain; <lb/>
            and since there was a suspicion that if he heard of these <lb/>
            occurrences while on the other side of the channel, he <lb/>
            might cause disorders in the island, a secretary was sent <lb/>
            to Boulogne to take care that no one should be allowed to <lb/>
            cross ; and as that was contrived, Lupicinus returned with- <lb/>
            out hearing of any of these matters, and so had no oppor- <lb/>
            tunity of giving trouble.</p>

          <p>§ 1. BUT Julian, being gratified at his increase of rank, <lb/>
            and at the confidence of the soldiers in him, not to let <lb/>
            his good fortune cool, or to give any colour for charging <lb/>
            him with inactivity or indolence, after he had sent his <lb/>
            envoys to Constantius, marched to the frontier of the pro- <lb/>
            vince of lower Germany; and having with him all the force <pb n="235"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] <lb/>
            </note>which the business in hand demanded, he approached the <lb/>
            town of Santon.1</p>
          <p>2. Then crossing the Rhine, he suddenly entered the <lb/>
            district belonging to a Frank tribe, called the Attuarii, <lb/>
            men of a turbulent character, who at that very moment <lb/>
            were licentiously plundering the districts of Gaul. He <lb/>
            attacked them unexpectedly while they were apprehensive <lb/>
            of no hostile measures, but were reposing in fancied se- <lb/>
            curity, relying on the ruggedness and difficulty of the <lb/>
            roads which led into their country, and which no prince <lb/>
            within their recollection had ever penetrated. He, how- <lb/>
            ever, easily surmounted all difficulties, and having put <lb/>
            many to the sword and taken many prisoners, he granted <lb/>
            the survivors, peace at their request, thinking such a course <lb/>
            best for their neighbours.</p>
          <p>3. Then with equal celerity he repassed the river, and <lb/>
            examining carefully the state of the garrisons on the fron- <lb/>
            tier, and putting them in a proper state, he marched <lb/>
            towards Basle ; and having recovered the places which the <lb/>
            barbarians had taken and still retained in their hands, and <lb/>
            having carefully strengthened them, he went to Vienne, <lb/>
            passing through Besançon, and there took up his winter <lb/>
            quarters.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THESE were the events which took place in Gaul, and <lb/>
            while they were thus conducted with prudence and good <lb/>
            fortune, Constantius, having summoned Arsaces, king of <lb/>
            Armenia, and having received him with great courtesy, <lb/>
            advised and exhorted him to continue friendly and faithful <lb/>
            to us.</p>
          <p>2. For he had heard that the king of Persia had often <lb/>
            tried by deceits and threats, and all kinds of stratagems, <lb/>
            to induce him to forsake the Roman alliance and join his <lb/>
            party.</p>
          <p>3. But he, vowing with many oaths that he would rather <lb/>
            lose his life than change his opinion, received ample rewards, <lb/>
            and returned to his kingdom with the retinue which he <lb/>
            brought with him; and never ventured at any subsequent <lb/>
            time to break any of his promises, being bound by many <note type="footnote">1 Santon is near Cleves. </note> <pb n="236"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XX. CH. <unclear>I</unclear>. </note> <lb/>
            ties of gratitude to Constantius. The strongest tie of all <lb/>
            being that the emperor had given him for a wife, Olympias, <lb/>
            the daughter of Abladius, formerly prefect of the præ- <lb/>
            torium, who had once been betrothed to his own brother <lb/>
            Constans.</p>
          <p>4. And when Arsaces had been dismissed, Constantius <lb/>
            left Cappadocia, and going by Melitina, a town of the <lb/>
            lesser Armenia, and Lacotene, and Samosata, he crossed <lb/>
            the Euphrates and arrived at Edessa. Stopping some time <lb/>
            in each town, while waiting for divisions of soldiers who <lb/>
            were flocking in from all quarters, and for sufficient sup- <lb/>
            plies of provisions. And after the autumnal equinox, he <lb/>
            proceeded onwards on his way to Amida.</p>
          <p>5. When he approached the walls of that town, and saw <lb/>
            everything buried in ashes, he groaned and wept, recollect- <lb/>
            ing what sufferings the wretched city had suffered. And <lb/>
            Ursulus, the treasurer, who happened to be present, was <lb/>
            moved with indignation, and exclaimed, “Behold the <lb/>
            courage with which cities are defended by our soldiers; <lb/>
            men for whose pay the whole wealth of the empire is <lb/>
            exhausted." This bitter speech the crowd of soldiers after- <lb/>
            wards recollected at Chalcedon, when they rose up and <lb/>
            destroyed him.</p>
          <p>6. Then proceeding onward in close column, he reached <lb/>
            Bezabde, and having fixed his camp there, and fortified it <lb/>
            with a rampart and a deep fosse, as he took a long ride <lb/>
            round the camp, he satisfied himself, by the account which <lb/>
            he received from several persons, that those places in the <lb/>
            walls which the carelessness of ancient times had allowed <lb/>
            to become decayed, had been repaired so as to be stronger <lb/>
            than ever.</p>
          <p>7. And, not to omit anything which was necessary to <lb/>
            do before the heat of the contest was renewed, he sent <lb/>
            prudent men to the garrison to offer them two conditions; <lb/>
            either to withdraw to their own country, giving up what <lb/>
            did not belong to them, without causing bloodshed by <lb/>
            resistance, or else to become subjects of the Romans, in <lb/>
            which case they should receive rank and rewards. But <lb/>
            when they, with native obstinacy, resisted the demands as <lb/>
            became men of noble birth, who had been hardened by <lb/>
            dangers and labours, everything was prepared for the <lb/>
            siege. <pb n="237"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> 8. Therefore the soldiers with alacrity, in dense order, <lb/>
            and cheered by the sound of trumpets, attacked every side <lb/>
            of the town; and the legions, being protected by various <lb/>
            kinds of defences, advanced in safety, endeavouring by slow <lb/>
            degrees to overthrow the walls; and because all kinds of <lb/>
            missiles were poured down upon them, which disjoined the <lb/>
            union of their shields, they fell back, the signal for a <lb/>
            retreat being given.</p>
          <p>9. Then a truce was agreed upon for one day; but the <lb/>
            day after, having protected themselves more skilfully, they <lb/>
            again raised their war-cry, and tried on every side to scale the <lb/>
            walls. And although the garrison, having stretched cloths <lb/>
            before them not to be distinguished, lay concealed within <lb/>
            the walls ; still, as often as necessity required, they boldly <lb/>
            put out their arms and hurled down stones and javelins on <lb/>
            their assailants below.</p>
          <p>10. And while the wicker penthouses were advanced <lb/>
            boldly and brought close to the walls, the besieged dropped <lb/>
            upon them heavy casks and millstones, and fragments of <lb/>
            pillars, by the overpowering weight of which the assailants <lb/>
            were crushed, their defences torn to pieces, and wide open- <lb/>
            ings made in them, so that they incurred terrible dangers, <lb/>
            and were again forced to retreat.</p>
          <p>11. Therefore, on the tenth day from the beginning of <lb/>
            the siege, when the confidence of our men began to fill the <lb/>
            town with alarm, we determined on bringing up a vast <lb/>
            battering-ram, which, after having destroyed Antioch with <lb/>
            it sometime before, the Persians had left at Carrhæ; and <lb/>
            as soon as that appeared, and was begun to be skilfully <lb/>
            set up, it cowed the spirits of the besieged, so that they <lb/>
            were almost on the point of surrendering, when they again <lb/>
            plucked up courage and prepared means for resisting this <lb/>
            engine.</p>
          <p>12. From this time neither their courage nor their inge- <lb/>
            nuity failed ; for as the ram was old, and it had been taken <lb/>
            to pieces for the facility of transporting it, so while it was <lb/>
            being put together again, it was attacked with great exer- <lb/>
            tions and vigour by the garrison, and defended with equal <lb/>
            valour and firmness by the besiegers; and engines hurling <lb/>
            showers of stones, and slings, and missiles of all sorts, slew <lb/>
            numbers on each side. Meantime, high mounds rose up <lb/>
            with speedy growth; and the siege grew fiercer and sterner <pb n="238"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XX. CH. XI </note> <lb/>
            daily; many of our men being slain because, fighting as <lb/>
            they were under the eye of the emperor, and eager for <lb/>
            reward, they took off their helmets in order to be the <lb/>
            more easily recognized, and so with bare heads, were an <lb/>
            easy mark for the skilful archers of the enemy.</p>
          <p>13. The days and nights being alike spent in watching, <lb/>
            made each side the more careful; and the Persians, being <lb/>
            alarmed at the vast height to which the mounds were now <lb/>
            carried, and at the enormous ram, which was accompanied <lb/>
            by others of smaller size, made great exertions to burn <lb/>
            them, and kept continually shooting firebrands and incen- <lb/>
            diary missiles at them; but their labour was vain, because <lb/>
            the chief part of them was covered with wet skins and <lb/>
            cloths, and some parts also had been steeped in alum, so <lb/>
            that the fire might fall harmless upon them.</p>
          <p>14. But the Romans, driving these rams on with great <lb/>
            courage, although they had difficulty in defending them- <lb/>
            selves, disregarded danger, however imminent, in the hope <lb/>
            of making themselves masters of the town.</p>
          <p>15. And on the other hand, when the enormous ram was <lb/>
            brought against the tower to which it was applied, as if it <lb/>
            could at once throw it down, the garrison, by a clever <lb/>
            contrivance, entangled its projecting iron head, which in <lb/>
            shape was like that of a ram, with long cords on both <lb/>
            sides, to prevent its being drawn back and then driven for- <lb/>
            ward with great force, and to hinder it from making any <lb/>
            serious impression on the walls by repeated blows; and <lb/>
            meanwhile they poured on it burning pitch, and for a long <lb/>
            time these engines were fixed at the point to which they <lb/>
            had been advanced, and exposed to all the stones and <lb/>
            javelins which were hurled from the walls.</p>
          <p>16. By this time the mounds were raised to a consider- <lb/>
            able height, and the garrison, thinking that unless they <lb/>
            used extraordinary vigilance their destruction must be at <lb/>
            hand, resorted to extreme audacity; and making an un- <lb/>
            expected sally from the gates, they attacked our front rank, <lb/>
            and with all their might hurled firebrands and iron braziers <lb/>
            loaded with fire against the rams.</p>
          <p>17. But after a fierce but undecided conflict, the bulk of <lb/>
            them were driven within the walls, without having suc- <lb/>
            ceeded in their attempt; and presently the battlements <lb/>
            were attacked from the mounds which the Romans had <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> <lb/>
            raised, with arrows and slings and lighted javelins, which <lb/>
            flew over the roofs of the towers, but did no harm, means <lb/>
            having been prepared to extinguish any flames.</p>
          <p>-18. And as the ranks on both sides became thinner, and <lb/>
            the Persians were now reduced to extremities unless <lb/>
            some aid could be found, they prepared with redoubled <lb/>
            energy a fresh sally from the camp : accordingly, they <lb/>
            made a sudden sally, supported by increased numbers, and <lb/>
            among the armed men were many bearing torches, and <lb/>
            iron baskets full of fire, and faggots; and all kinds of things <lb/>
            best adapted for setting fire to the works of the besiegers <lb/>
            were hurled against them.</p>
          <p>19. And because the dense clouds of smoke obscured the <lb/>
            ight, when the trumpet gave the signal for battle, the <lb/>
            legions came up with quick step; and as the eagerness of <lb/>
            the conflict grew hotter, after they had engaged, suddenly <lb/>
            all the engines, except the great ram, caught fire from the <lb/>
            flames which were hurled at them; but the ropes which <lb/>
            held the chief ram were broken asunder, and that the <lb/>
            vigorous efforts of some gallant men saved when it was <lb/>
            half burnt.</p>
          <p>20. When the darkness of night terminated the combat, <lb/>
            only a short time was allowed to the soldiers for rest; but <lb/>
            when they had been refreshed by a little food and sleep, <lb/>
            they were awakened by their captains, and ordered to re- <lb/>
            move their works away from the walls of the town, and <lb/>
            prepare to fight at closer quarters from the lofty mounds <lb/>
            which were untouched by the flames, and now commanded <lb/>
            the walls. And to drive the defenders from the walls, on <lb/>
            the summit of the mounds they stationed two balistæ, in <lb/>
            fear of which they thought that none of the enemy would <lb/>
            venture even to look out.</p>
          <p>21. After having taken these efficacious measures, a <lb/>
            triple line of our men, having a more threatening aspect <lb/>
            than usual from the nodding cones of their helmets (many <lb/>
            of them also bearing ladders), attempted about twilight to <lb/>
            scale the walls. Arms clashed and trumpets sounded, and <lb/>
            both sides fought with equal boldness and ardour. The <lb/>
            Romans, extending their lines more widely, when they saw <lb/>
            the Persians hiding from fear of the engines which had been <lb/>
            stationed on the mounds, battered the wall with their ram, <lb/>
            and with spades, and axes, and levers, and ladders, pressed <pb n="240"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XX. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            fiercely on, while missiles from each side flew without <lb/>
            ceasing.</p>
          <p>22. But the Persians were especially pressed by the <lb/>
            various missiles shot from the balistæ, which, from the <lb/>
            artificial mounds, came down upon them in torrents; and <lb/>
            having become desperate, they rushed on, fearless of <lb/>
            death, and distributing their force as if at the last ex- <lb/>
            tremity, they left some to guard the walls, while the <lb/>
            rest, secretly opening a postern gate, rushed forth va- <lb/>
            liantly with drawn swords, followed by others who carried <lb/>
            concealed fire.</p>
          <p>23. And while the Romans at one moment were pressing <lb/>
            on those who retreated, at another receiving the assault of <lb/>
            those who attacked them, those who carried the fire crept <lb/>
            round by a circuitous path, and pushed the burning coals <lb/>
            in among the interstices of one of the mounds, which was <lb/>
            made up of branches of trees, and rushes, and bundles of <lb/>
            reeds. This soon caught fire and was utterly destroyed, <lb/>
            the soldiers themselves having great difficulty in escaping <lb/>
            and saving their engines.</p>
          <p>24. But when the approach of evening broke off the <lb/>
            conflict, and the two sides separated to snatch a brief <lb/>
            repose, the emperor, after due reflection, resolved to change <lb/>
            his plans. Although many reasons of great urgency pressed <lb/>
            him to force on the destruction of Phœnice, as of a fortress <lb/>
            which would prove an impregnable barrier to the inroads <lb/>
            of the enemy, yet the lateness of the season was an objec- <lb/>
            tion to persevering any longer. He determined, therefore, <lb/>
            while he preserved his position, to carry on the siege for <lb/>
            the future by slight skirmishes, thinking that the Persians <lb/>
            would be forced to surrender from want of provisions, <lb/>
            which, however, turned out very different.</p>
          <p>25. For while the conflict was proceeding sharply, <lb/>
            the heavens became moist, and watery clouds appeared <lb/>
            with threatening darkness; and presently the ground got <lb/>
            so wet from continual rain, that the whole country was <lb/>
            changed into an adhesive mud (for the soil is naturally <lb/>
            rich), and every plan was thrown into confusion; mean- <lb/>
            time, thunder with incessant crashes and ceaseless light- <lb/>
            ning filled men's minds with fear.</p>
          <p>26. To these portents were added continual rainbows. <lb/>
            A short explanation will serve to show how these appear- <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> <lb/>
            ances are formed. The vapours of the earth becoming <lb/>
            warmer, and the watery particles gathering in clouds, and <lb/>
            thence being dispersed in spray, and made brilliant by the <lb/>
            fusion of rays, turn upwards towards the fiery orb of the <lb/>
            sun, and form a rainbow, which sweeps round with a large <lb/>
            curve because it is spread over our world, which physical <lb/>
            investigations place on the moiety of a sphere.</p>
          <p>27. Its appearance, as far as mortal sight can discern, is, <lb/>
            in the first line yellow, in the second tawny, in the third <lb/>
            scarlet, in the fourth purple, and in the last a mixture of <lb/>
            blue and green.</p>
          <p>28. And it is so tempered with this mixed beauty, as <lb/>
            mankind believe, because its first portion is discerned in <lb/>
            a thin diluted state, of the same colour as the air which <lb/>
            surrounds it; the next line is tawny, that is a somewhat <lb/>
            richer colour than yellow; the third is scarlet, because it <lb/>
            is opposite to the bright rays of the sun, and so pumps up <lb/>
            and appropriates, if one may so say, the most subtle portion <lb/>
            of its beams; the fourth is purple, because the density of <lb/>
            the spray by which the splendour of the sun's rays is <lb/>
            quenched shines between, and so it assumes a colour near <lb/>
            that of flame ; and as that colour is the more diffused, it <lb/>
            shades off into blue and green.</p>
          <p>29. Others think that the rainbow is caused by the rays <lb/>
            of the sun becoming infused into some dense cloud, and <lb/>
            pouring into it a liquid light, which, as it can find no <lb/>
            exit, falls back upon itself, and shines the more brilliantly <lb/>
            because of a kind of attrition; and receives those hues <lb/>
            which are most akin to white from the sun above; its <lb/>
            green hues from the cloud under which it lies, as often <lb/>
            happens in the sea, where the waters which beat upon the <lb/>
            shore are white, and those farther from the land, which, <lb/>
            as being so, are more free from any admixture, are blue.</p>
          <p>30. And since it is an indication of a change in the <lb/>
            atmosphere (as we have already said), when in a clear sky <lb/>
            sudden masses of clouds appear, or on the other hand, when <lb/>
            the sky changed from a gloomy look to a joyful serenity, <lb/>
            therefore we often read in the poets that Iris is sent from <lb/>
            heaven when a change is required in the condition of any <lb/>
            present affairs. There are various other opinions which it <lb/>
            would be superfluous now to enumerate, since my narration <lb/>
            must hasten back to the point from which it digressed. <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. </note> 31. By these and similar events the emperor was kept <lb/>
            wavering between hope and fear, as the severity of <lb/>
            winter was increasing, and he suspected ambuscades in the <lb/>
            country, which was destitute of roads; fearing also, among <lb/>
            other things, the discontent of the exasperated soldiers. <lb/>
            And it further goaded his unquiet spirit to return balked <lb/>

            For, as if some unfriendly constellation so governed <lb/>
            events, Constantius himself, while warring with the Per- <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE Constantius was detained by this perplexing <lb/>
            war beyond the Euphrates, Julian at Vienne devoted his <lb/>
            days and nights to forming plans for the future, as far as <lb/>
            his limited resources would allow; being in great suspense, <lb/>
            and continually doubting whether to try every expedient <lb/>
            to win Constantius over to friendship, or to anticipate his <lb/>
            attack, with the view of alarming him.</p>
          <p>2. And while anxiously considering these points he <lb/>
            feared him, as likely to be in the one case a cruel friend, <lb/>
            while in the other case he recollected that he had always <lb/>
            been successful in civil disturbances. Above all things <lb/>
            his anxiety was increased by the example of his brother <lb/>
            Gallus, who had been betrayed by his own want of caution <lb/>
            and the perjured deceit of certain individuals.</p>
          <p>3. Nevertheless he often raised himself to ideas of <lb/>
            energetic action, thinking it safest to show himself as an <lb/>
            avowed enemy to him whose movements he could, as a pru- <lb/>
            dent man, judge of only from his past actions, in order not <lb/>
            to be entrapped by secret snares founded on pretended <lb/>
            friendship.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, paying little attention to the letters which <lb/>
            Constantius had sent by Leonas, and admitting none of his <lb/>
            appointments with the exception of that of Nebridius, he <pb n="244"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXI. CH. <unclear>I</unclear> </note> <lb/>
            now celebrated the Quinqucunalia1 as emperor, and wore a <lb/>
            splendid diadem inlaid with precious stones, though when <lb/>
            first entering on that power he had worn but a paltry- <lb/>
            looking crown like that of a president of the public <lb/>
            games.</p>
          <p>5. At this time also he sent the body of his wife Helen, <lb/>
            recently deceased, to Rome, to be buried in the suburb on <lb/>
            the road to Nomentum, where also Constantina, his sister- <lb/>
            in-law, the wife of Gallus, had been buried.</p>
          <p>6. His desire to march against Constantius, now that <lb/>
            Gaul was tranquillized, was inflamed by the belief which <lb/>
            he had adopted from many omens (in the interpretation of <lb/>
            which he had great skill), and from dreams that the <lb/>
            emperor would soon die.</p>
          <p>7. And since malignant people have attributed to this <lb/>
            prince, so erudite and so eager to acquire all knowledge, <lb/>
            wicked practices for the purpose of learning future events, <lb/>
            we may here briefly point out how this important branch <lb/>
            of learning may be acquired by a wise man.</p>
          <p>8. The spirit which directs all the elements, and which <lb/>
            at all times and throughout all places exercises its activity <lb/>
            by the movement of these eternal bodies, can communicate <lb/>
            to us the capacity of foresceing the future by the sciences <lb/>
            which we attain through various kinds of discipline. And <lb/>
            the ruling powers, when properly propitiated, as from <lb/>
            everlasting springs, supply mankind with words of pro- <lb/>
            phecy, over which the deity of Themis is said to preside, <lb/>
            and which, because she teaches men to know what has been <lb/>
            settled for the future by the law of Fate, has received that <lb/>
            name from the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεθειμένα</foreign> (" fixed "), and has <lb/>
            been placed by ancient theologians in the bed and on the <lb/>
            throne of Jupiter, who gives life to all the world.</p>
          <p>9. Auguries and auspices are not collected from the will <lb/>
            of birds who are themselves ignorant of the future (for <lb/>
            there is no one so silly as to say they understand it) ; but <lb/>
            God directs the flight of birds, so that the sound of their <lb/>
            beaks, or the motion of their feathers, whether quiet or <lb/>
            disturbed, indicates the character of the future. For the <note type="footnote">1 The Quinquennalia (games under which title had been previously <lb/>
            instituted in honour of Julius Cæsar and Augustus) were revived by <lb/>
            Nero, A.D. GO, again fell into disuse, and were again revived by Do,- <lb/>
            mitian.—Cf. Tacit. An. xiv. 20. </note> <pb n="245"/>

            kindness of the deity, whether it be that men deserve it, <lb/>
            or that he is touched by affection for them, likes by these <lb/>
            acts to give information of what is impending.</p>
          <p>10. Again, those who attend to the prophetic entrails of <lb/>
            cattle, which often take all kinds of shapes, learn from <lb/>
            them what happens. Of this practice a man called Tages <lb/>
            was the inventor, who, as is reported, was certainly seen <lb/>
            to rise up out of the earth in the district of Etruria.</p>
          <p>11. Men too, when their hearts are in a state of excite- <lb/>
            ment, foretell the future, but then they are speaking under <lb/>
            divine inspiration. For the sun, which is, as natural <lb/>
            philosophers say, the mind of the world, and which scatters <lb/>
            our minds among us as sparks proceeding from itself, when <lb/>
            it has inflamed them with more than usual vehemence, <lb/>
            renders them conscious of the future. From which the <lb/>
            Sibyls often say they are burning and fired by a vast <lb/>
            power of flames; and with reference to these cases the sound <lb/>
            of voices, various signs, thunder, lightning, thunderbolts, <lb/>
            and falling-stars, have a great significance.</p>
          <p>12. But the belief in dreams would be strong and un- <lb/>
            doubted if the interpreters of them were never deceived; <lb/>
            and sometimes, as Aristotle asserts, they are fixed and <lb/>
            stable when the eye of the person, being soundly asleep, <lb/>
            turns neither way, but looks straight forward.</p>
          <p>13. And because the ignorance of the vulgar often talks <lb/>
            loudly, though ignorantly, against these ideas, asking why, <lb/>
            if there were any faculty of foreseeing the future, one man <lb/>
            should be ignorant that he would be killed in battle, or <lb/>
            another that he would meet with some misfortune, and so <lb/>
            on; it will be enough to reply that sometimes a gram- <lb/>
            marian has spoken incorrectly, or a musician has sung out <lb/>
            of tune, or a physician been ignorant of the proper remedy <lb/>
            for a disease; but these facts do not disprove the existence <lb/>
            of the sciences of grammar, music, or medicine.</p>
          <p>14. So that Tully is right in this as well as other sayings <lb/>
            of his, when he says, " Signs of future events are shown <lb/>
            by the gods; if any one mistakes them he errs, not <lb/>
            because of the nature of the gods, but because of the con- <lb/>
            jectures of men." But lest this discussion, running on this <lb/>
            point beyond the goal, as the proverb is, should disgust <lb/>
            the reader, we will now return to relate what follows. <pb n="246"/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE Julian, still with the rank of Cæsar only, was <lb/>
            at Paris one day, exercising himself in the camp-field, and <lb/>
            moving his shield in various directions, the joints by which <lb/>
            it was fastened gave way, and the handle alone remained <lb/>
            in his hand, which he still held firmly, and when those <lb/>
            present were alarmed, thinking it a bad omen, he said, <lb/>
            " Let no one be alarmed, I still hold firmly what I had <lb/>
            before."</p>
          <p>2. And again, when one day after a slight dinner, he <lb/>
            was sleeping at Vienne, in the middle of the darkness of <lb/>
            the night a figure of unusual splendour appeared to him, <lb/>
            and when he was all but awake, repeated to him the follow- <lb/>
            ing heroic verses, reciting them over and over again ; <lb/>
            which he believed, so that he felt sure that no ill fortune <lb/>
            remained for him :— <lb/>
            "When Jove has passed the water-carrier's sign, <lb/>
            And Saturn's light, for five-and-twenty days <lb/>
            Has lightened up the maid; the king divine <lb/>
            Of Asia's land shall enter on the ways <lb/>
            That painful lead to death and Styx'a gloomy maze."</p>
          <p>3. Therefore in the mean time he made no change in the <lb/>
            existing condition of affairs, but arranged everything that <lb/>
            occurred with a quiet and easy mind, gradually strengthen- <lb/>
            ing himself, in order to make the increase of his power <lb/>
            correspond with the increase of his dignity.</p>
          <p>4. And in order, without any hindrance, to conciliate the <lb/>
            goodwill of all men, he pretended to adhere to the Christian <lb/>
            religion, which in fact he had long since secretly aban- <lb/>
            doned, though very few were aware of his private opinions, <lb/>
            giving up his whole attention to soothsaying and divina- <lb/>
            tion, and the other arts which have always been practised <lb/>
            by the worshippers of the gods.</p>
          <p>5. But to conceal this for a while, on the day of the <lb/>
            festival at the beginning of January, which the Christians <lb/>
            call Epiphany, he went into their church, and offered <lb/>
            solemn public prayer to their God.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE these events were proceeding, and spring was <lb/>
            coming on, Julian was suddenly smitten with grief and <lb/>
            sorrow by unexpected intelligence. For he learnt that <pb n="247"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> <lb/>
            the Allemanni had poured forth from the district of Vado- <lb/>
            marius, in which quarter, after the treaty which had been <lb/>
            made with him, no troubles had been anticipated, and were <lb/>
            laying waste the borders of the Tyrol, pouring their pre- <lb/>
            datory bands over the whole frontier, and leaving nothing <lb/>
            unravaged.</p>
          <p>2. He feared that if this were passed over it might <lb/>
            rekindle the flames of war; and so at once sent a count <lb/>
            named Libino, with the Celtic and Petulantes legions, <lb/>
            who were in winter quarters with him, to put a decided and <lb/>
            immediate end to this affair.</p>
          <p>3. Libino marched with speed, and arrived at Seckingen; <lb/>
            but was seen while at a distance by the barbarians, who <lb/>
            had already hidden themselves in the valleys with the <lb/>
            intention of giving him battle. His soldiers were inferior <lb/>
            in number, but very eager for battle; and he, after <lb/>
            haranguing them, rashly attacked the Germans, and at the <lb/>
            very beginning of the fight was slain among the first. At <lb/>
            his death the confidence of the barbarians increased, while <lb/>
            the Romans were excited to avenge their general; and so <lb/>
            the conflict proceeded with great obstinacy, but our men <lb/>
            were overpowered by numbers, though their loss in killed <lb/>
            and wounded was but small.</p>
          <p>4. Constantius, as has been related, had made peace <lb/>
            with this Vadomarius, and his brother Gundomadus, who <lb/>
            was also a king. And when afterwards Gundomadus died, <lb/>
            thinking that Vadomarius would be faithful to him, and a <lb/>
            silent and vigorous executor of his secret orders (if one <lb/>
            may believe what is only report), he gave-him directions <lb/>
            by letter to harass the countries on his borders, as if he <lb/>
            had broken off the treaty of peace, in order to keep Julian, <lb/>
            through his fears of him, from ever abandoning the protec- <lb/>
            tion of Gaul.</p>
          <p>5. In obedience to these directions, it is fair to believe <lb/>
            'that Vadomarius committed this and other similar actions ; <lb/>
            being a man from his earliest youth marvellously skilled <lb/>
            in artifice and deceit, as he afterwards showed when he <lb/>
            enjoyed the dukedom of Phœnice.1</p>
          <p>6. But now, being discovered, he desisted from his hos- <lb/>
            tilities. For one of his secretaries, whom he had sent to <lb/>
            Constantius, was taken prisoner by Julian's outposts, and <note type="footnote">1 V. intra, Leo xxvi. c. 8. </note> <pb n="248"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. CH. IV. </note> <lb/>
            when he was searched to see if he was the bearer of any- <lb/>
            thing, a letter was found on him, which contained these <lb/>
            words among others, "Your Cæsar is not submissive." <lb/>
            But when he wrote to Julian he always addressed him as <lb/>
            lord, and emperor, and god.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THESE affairs were full of danger and doubt; and Julian <lb/>
            considering them likely to lead to absolute destruction, <lb/>
            bent all his mind to the one object of seizing Vadomarius <lb/>
            unawares, through the rapidity of his movements, in order <lb/>
            to secure his own safety and that of the provinces. And <lb/>
            the plan which he decided on was this.</p>
          <p>2. He sent to those districts Philagrius, one of his <lb/>
            secretaries, afterwards count of the East, in whose proved <lb/>
            prudence and fidelity he could thoroughly rely; and <lb/>
            besides a general authority to act as he could upon emer- <lb/>
            gencies, he gave him also a paper signed by himself, which <lb/>
            he bade him not to open nor read unless Vadomarius <lb/>
            appeared on the western side of the Rhine.</p>
          <p>3. Philagrius went as he was ordered, and while he was <lb/>
            in that distriet busying himself with various arrangements, <lb/>
            Vadomarius crossed the river, as if he had nothing to fear, <lb/>
            in a time of profound peace, and pretending to know of <lb/>
            nothing having been done contrary to treaty, when he saw <lb/>
            the commander of the troops who were stationed there, <lb/>
            made him a short customary speeeh, and to remove all <lb/>
            suspicion, of his own accord promised to come to a ban- <lb/>
            quet to which Philagrius also had been invited.</p>
          <p>4. As soon as Philagrius arrived, when he saw the king, <lb/>
            he recollected Julian's words, and pretending some serious <lb/>
            and urgent business, returned to his lodging, where having <lb/>
            read the paper intrusted to him, and learnt what he was to <lb/>
            do, he immediately returned and took his seat among the <lb/>
            rest.</p>
          <p>5. But when the banquet was over he boldly arrested <lb/>
            Vadomarius, and gave him to the commander of the forces, <lb/>
            to be kept in strict custody in the camp, reading to him <lb/>
            the commands he had received; but as nothing was men- <lb/>
            tioned about Vadomarius's retinue, he ordered them to <lb/>
            return to their own country. <pb n="249"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> 6. But the king was afterwards conducted to Julian's <lb/>
            camp, and despaired of pardon when he heard that his <lb/>
            secretary had been taken, and the letters which he had <lb/>
            written to Constantius read; he was however not even <lb/>
            reproached by Julian, but merely sent off to Spain, as it <lb/>
            was an object of great importance that, while Julian was <lb/>
            absent from Gaul, this ferocious man should not be able to <lb/>
            throw into confusion the provinces which had been tran- <lb/>
            quillized with such great difficulty.</p>
          <p>7. Julian, being much elated at this occurrence, since the <lb/>
            king, whom he feared to leave behind him while at a dis- <lb/>
            tance, had been caught more quickly than he expected, <lb/>
            without delay prepared to attack the barbarians who, as <lb/>
            we have just related, had slain Count Libino and some of <lb/>
            his soldiers in battle.</p>
          <p>8. And to prevent any rumour of his approach giving <lb/>
            them warning to retire to remoter districts, he passed the <lb/>
            Rhine by night with great silence, with some of the most <lb/>
            rapid of his auxiliary bands ; and so came upon them while <lb/>
            fearing nothing of the sort. And he at once attacked them <lb/>
            the moment they were first roused by the sound of enemies, <lb/>
            and while still examining their swords and javelins; some <lb/>
            he slew, some he took prisoners, who sued for mercy and <lb/>
            offered to surrender their booty; to the rest who remained <lb/>
            and implored peace, and promised to be quiet for the <lb/>
            future, he granted peace.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHILE these transactions were carried on in this <lb/>
            spirited manner, Julian, considering to what great internal <lb/>
            divisions his conduct had given rise, and that nothing is so <lb/>
            advantageous for the success of sudden enterprise as <lb/>
            celerity of action, saw with his usual sagacity that if he <lb/>
            openly avowed his revolt from the emperor, he should be <lb/>
            safer; and feeling uncertain of the fidelity of the soldiers, <lb/>
            having offered secret propitiatory sacrifices to Bellona, he <lb/>
            summoned the army by sound of trumpet to an assembly, <lb/>
            and standing on a tribune built of stone, with every <lb/>
            appearance of confidence in his manner, he spoke thus <lb/>
            with a voice unusually loud:-</p>
          <p>2. " I imagine that you, my gallant comrades, exalted <lb/>
            by the greatness of your own achievements, have long been <pb n="250"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. CH. V. </note> <lb/>
            silently expecting this meeting, in order to form a previous <lb/>
            judgment of, and to take wise measures against the events <lb/>
            which may be expected. For soldiers united by glorious <lb/>
            actions ought to hear rather than speak; nor ought a com- <lb/>
            ' mander of proved justice to think anything but what is <lb/>
            worthy of praise and approbation. That therefore I may <lb/>
            explain to you what 1 propose, I entreat you to listen <lb/>
            favourably to what I will briefly set before you.</p>
          <p>3. " From my earliest year, by the will of God, I have <lb/>
            been placed among you, with whom I have crushed the <lb/>
            incessant inroads of the Franks and Allemanni, and checked <lb/>
            the endless licentiousness of their ravages ; by our united <lb/>
            vigour we have opened the Rhine to the Roman armies, when- <lb/>
            ever they choose to cross it; standing immovable against <lb/>
            reports, as well as against the violent attacks of powerful <lb/>
            nations, because I trusted to the invincibility of your valour.</p>
          <p>4. " Gaul, which has beheld our labours, and which, after <lb/>
            much slaughter and many periods of protracted and severe <lb/>
            disasters, is at last replaced in a healthy state, will for ever <lb/>
            bear witness to posterity of our achievements.</p>
          <p>5. " But now since, constrained both by the authority of <lb/>
            your judgment, and also by the necessity of the case, I <lb/>
            have been raised to the rank of emperor, under the favour <lb/>
            of God and of you, I aim at still greater things, if fortune <lb/>
            should smile on my undertakings. Boasting at least that I <lb/>
            have secured to the army, whose equity and mighty ex- <lb/>
            ploits are so renowned, a moderate and merciful chief in <lb/>
            time of peace, and in war a prudent and wary leader <lb/>
            against the combined forces of the barbarians..</p>
          <p>6. " In order therefore that by the cordial unanimity of <lb/>
            our opinions we may prevent ill fortune by anticipating it, <lb/>
            I be- you to follow my counsel, salutary, as I think it, <lb/>
            since the state of our affairs corresponds to the purity of my <lb/>
            intentions and wishes. And while the legions of Illyricum <lb/>
            are occupied by no greater force than usual, let us occupy <lb/>
            the further frontier of Dacia: and then take counsel from <lb/>
            our success what is to be done next.</p>
          <p>7. " But as brave generals. I entreat you to promise <lb/>
            with an oath that you will adhere to me with unanimity <lb/>
            and fidelity; while I will give my customary careful <lb/>
            attention to prevent anything from being done rashly or <lb/>
            carelessly; and if any one requires it, will pledge my <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 360.] </note> <lb/>
            own unsullied honour that I will never attempt ncr think <lb/>
            of anything but what is for the common good.</p>
          <p>8. " This especially I request and beseech you to observe, <lb/>
            that none of you let any impulse of sudden ardour lead <lb/>
            you to inflict injury on any private individual; recollecting <lb/>
            that our greatest renown is not derived so much from the <lb/>
            numberless defeats of the enemy as from the safety of the <lb/>
            provinces, and their freedom from injury, which is cele- <lb/>
            brated as an eminent example of our virtue."</p>
          <p>9. The emperor's speech was approved as though it had <lb/>
            been the voice of an oracle, and the whole assembly was <lb/>
            greatly excited, and being eager for a change, they all with <lb/>
            one consent raised a tremendous shout, and beat their <lb/>
            shields with a violent crash, calling him a great and noble <lb/>
            general, and, as had been proved, a fortunate conqueror <lb/>
            and king.</p>
          <p>10. And being all ordered solemnly to swear fidelity to <lb/>
            him, they put their swords to their throats with terrible <lb/>
            curses, and took the oath in the prescribed form, that for <lb/>
            him they would undergo every kind of suffering, and even <lb/>
            death itself, if necessity should require it; and their officers <lb/>
            and all the friends of the prince gave a similar pledge with <lb/>
            the same forms.</p>
          <p>11. Nebridius the prefect alone, boldly and unshakenly <lb/>
            refused, declaring that he could not possibly bind himself <lb/>
            by an oath hostile to Constantius, from whom he had <lb/>
            received many and great obligations.</p>
          <p>12. When these words of his were heard, the soldiers <lb/>
            who were nearest to him were greatly enraged, and wished <lb/>
            to kill him; but he threw himself at the feet of Julian, <lb/>
            who shielded him with his cloak. Presently, when he <lb/>
            returned to the palace, Nebridius appeared before him, <lb/>
            threw himself at his feet as a suppliant, and entreated <lb/>
            him to relieve his fears by giving him his right hand. <lb/>
            Julian replied, "Will there be any conspicuous favour <lb/>
            reserved for my own friends if you are allowed to touch <lb/>
            my hand? However, depart in peace as you will." On <lb/>
            receiving this answer, Nebridius retired in safety to his <lb/>
            own house in Tuscany.</p>
          <p>13. By these preliminary measures, Julian having learnt, <lb/>
            as the importance of the affair required, what great in- <lb/>
            fluence promptness and being beforehand has in a tumultu- <pb n="252"/>

            ous state of affairs, gave the signal to march towards <lb/>
            Pannonia, and advancing his standard and his camp, boldly <lb/>
            committed himself to fickle fortune.</p>

          <p>§ 1. IT is fitting now to retrace our steps and to relate <lb/>
            briefly what (while these events just related were taking <lb/>
            place in Gaul) Constantius, who passed the winter at <lb/>
            Antioch, did, whether in peace or war.</p>
          <p>2. Besides many others of high rank, some of the most <lb/>
            distinguished tribunes generally come to salute an emperor <lb/>
            on his arrival from distant lands. And accordingly, when <lb/>
            Constantius, on his return from Mesopotamia, received <lb/>
            this compliment, a Paphlagonian named Amphilochius, <lb/>
            who had been a tribune, and whom suspicion, not very <lb/>
            far removed from the truth, hinted at as having, while <lb/>
            serving formerly under Constans, sown the seeds of discord <lb/>
            between him and his brother, now ventured, with no little <lb/>
            audacity, to come forward as if he were to be admitted to <lb/>
            pay his duty in this way, but was recognized and refused <lb/>
            admittance. Many also raised an outcry against him, <lb/>
            crying out that he, as a stubborn rebel, ought not to be <lb/>
            permitted to see another day. But Constantius, on this <lb/>
            occasion more merciful than usual, said, " Cease to press <lb/>
            upon a man who, indeed, as I believe, is guilty, but who <lb/>
            has not been convicted. And remember that if he has done <lb/>
            anything of the kind, he, as long as he is in my sight, will <lb/>
            be punished by the judgment of his own conscience, which <lb/>
            he will not be able to escape." And so he departed.</p>
          <p>3. The next day, at the Circensian games, the same <lb/>
            man was present as a spectator, just opposite the usual <lb/>
            feat of the emperor, when a sudden shout was raised at the <lb/>
            moment of the commencement of the expected contest; <lb/>
            the barriers, on which he with many others was leaning, <lb/>
            were broken, and the whole crowd as well as he were <lb/>
            thrown forward into the empty space; and though a few <lb/>
            were slightly hurt, he alone was found to be killed, having <lb/>
            received some internal injury. At which Constantius re- <lb/>
            joiced, prognosticating from this omen protection from his <lb/>
            other enemies. <pb n="253"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> 4. About the same time (his wife Euscbia having died <lb/>
            some time before) he took another wife, named Faustina. <lb/>
            Eusebia's brothers were two men of consular rank, Hypatius <lb/>
            and Eusebius. She had been a woman of prc-eminent <lb/>
            beauty both of person and character, and for one of her <lb/>
            high rank most courteous and humane. And to her favoul <lb/>
            and justice it was owing, as we have already mentioned, <lb/>
            that Julian was saved from danger and declared Cæsar.</p>
          <p>5. About the same time Florentius also was rewarded, <lb/>
            who had quitted Gaul from fear of a revolution. He was <lb/>
            now appointed to succeed Anatolius, the prefect of the <lb/>
            prætorium in Illyricum, who had lately died. And in <lb/>
            conjunction with Taurus, who was appointed to the same <lb/>
            office in Italy, he received the ensigns of this most honour- <lb/>
            able dignity.-</p>
          <p>6. Nevertheless, the preparations for both foreign and <lb/>
            civil wars went on, the number of the squadrons of cavalry <lb/>
            was augmented, and reinforcements for the legions were <lb/>
            enlisted with equal zeal, recruits being collected all over <lb/>
            the provinces. Also every class and profession was ex- <lb/>
            posed to annoyances, being called upon to furnish arms, <lb/>
            clothes, military engines, and even gold and silver <lb/>
            and abundant stores of provisions, and various kinds of <lb/>
            animals.</p>
          <p>7. And because, as the king of Persia had been com- <lb/>
            pelled unwillingly to fall back on account of the difficulties <lb/>
            of the winter, it was feared that as soon as the weather <lb/>
            became open he would return with greater impetuosity <lb/>
            than ever, ambassadors were sent to the kings and satraps <lb/>
            across the Tigris, with splendid presents, to advise and <lb/>
            entreat them all to join us, and abstain from all designs or <lb/>
            plots against us.</p>
          <p>8. But the most important object of all was to win over <lb/>
            Arsaces and Meribanes, the kings of Armenia and Hiberia, <lb/>
            who were conciliated by the gift of magnificent and honour- <lb/>
            able robes and by presents of all kinds, and who could <lb/>
            have done great harm to the Roman interests if at such a <lb/>
            crisis they had gone over to the Persians.</p>
          <p>9. At this important time. Hermogenes died, and was <lb/>
            succeeded in his prefecture by Helpidius, a native of <lb/>
            Paphlagonia. a man of mean appearance and no eloquence, <lb/>
            but of a frank and truthful disposition, humane and merci. <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. CH VII. </note> <lb/>
            ful. So much so that once when Constantius ordered an <lb/>
            innocent man to be put to the torture before him, he calmly <lb/>
            requested to be deprived of his office, and that such com- <lb/>
            missions might be given to others who would discharge <lb/>
            them in a manner more in accordance with the emperor's <lb/>
            sentence.</p>

          <p>§ 1. CONSTANTIUS was perplexed at the danger of the crisis <lb/>
            before him, and doubted what to do, being for some time <lb/>
            in deep anxiety whether to march against Julian, who <lb/>
            was still at a distance, or to drive back the Persians, who <lb/>
            were already threatening to cross the Euphrates. And <lb/>
            while he was hesitating, and often taking counsel with <lb/>
            his generals, he at last decided that he would first finish, <lb/>
            or at all events take the edge off, the war which was <lb/>
            nearest, so as to leave nothing formidable behind him, <lb/>
            and then penetrate through Jllyricum and Italy, thinking <lb/>
            to catch Julian at the very outset of his enterprise, as he <lb/>
            might catch a deer with hounds. For so he. used to boast, <lb/>
            to appease the fears of those about him.</p>
          <p>2. But that his purpose might not appear to cool, and <lb/>
            that he might not seem to have neglected any side of the <lb/>
            war, he spread formidable rumours of his approach in every <lb/>
            direction. And fearing that Africa, which on all occasions <lb/>
            seemed to invite usurpers, might be invaded during his <lb/>
            absence, as if he had already quitted the eastern frontier, <lb/>
            he sent by sea to that country his secretary Gaudentius, <lb/>
            whom we have already mentioned as a spy upon the <lb/>
            actions of Julian in Gaul.</p>
          <p>3. He had two reasons for thinking that this man would <lb/>
            be able with prompt obedience to do all that he desired, <lb/>
            both because he feared the other side, which he had <lb/>
            offended, and also because he was anxious to take this <lb/>
            opportunity to gain the favour of Constantius, whom he <lb/>
            expected beyond a doubt to see victorious. Indeed no one <lb/>
            at that time had any other opinion.</p>
          <p>4. When Gaudentius arrived in Africa, recollecting the <lb/>
            emperor's orders, he sent letters to Count Cretio, and to the <lb/>
            other officers, to instruct them what his object was; and <lb/>
            having collected a formidable force from all quarters, and <lb/>
            having brought over a light division of skirmishers from <pb n="255"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> <lb/>
            the two Mauritanias, he watched the coasts opposite to <lb/>
            Italy and Gaul with great strictness.</p>
          <p>5. Nor was Constantius deceived in the wisdom of this <lb/>
            measure. For as long as Gaudentius lived none of the <lb/>
            adverse party ever reached that country, although a vast <lb/>
            multitude in arms was watching the Sicilian coast between <lb/>
            Cape Boeo and Cape Passaro, and ready to cross in a <lb/>
            moment if they could find an opportunity.</p>
          <p>6. Having made these arrangements as well as the case <lb/>
            admitted, in such a way as he thought most for his advan- <lb/>
            tage, and having settled other things also of smaller im- <lb/>
            portance, Constantius was warned by messengers and <lb/>
            letters from his generals that the Persian army, in one solid <lb/>
            body, and led by its haughty king, was now marching <lb/>
            close to the banks of the Tigris, though it was as yet <lb/>
            uncertain at what point they meant to cross the frontier.</p>
          <p>7. And he, feeling the importance of this intelligence, <lb/>
            in order, by being near them, to anticipate their intended <lb/>
            enterprises, quitted his winter quarters in haste, having <lb/>
            called in the infantry and cavalry on which he could rely <lb/>
            from all quarters, crossed the Euphrates by a bridge of <lb/>
            boats at Capessana, and marched towards Edessa, which <lb/>
            was well provisioned and strongly fortified, intending to <lb/>
            wait there a short time till he could receive from spies or <lb/>
            deserters certain information of the enemy's motions.</p>

          <p>§ 1. IN the mean time, Julian leaving the district of Basle, <lb/>
            and having taken all the steps which we have already <lb/>
            mentioned, sent Sallustius, whom he bad promoted to be a <lb/>
            prefect, into Gaul, and appointed Germanianus to succeed <lb/>
            Nebridius. At the same time he gave Nevitta the com- <lb/>
            mand of the heavy cavalry, being afraid of the old traitor <lb/>
            Gumoarius, who, when he was commander of the Scutarii, <lb/>
            he heard had secretly betrayed his chief officer, Vetranio. <lb/>
            The quæstorship he gave to Jovius, of whom we have <lb/>
            spoken when relating the acts of Magnentius, and the <lb/>
            treasury he allotted to Mamertinus. Dagalaiphus also <lb/>
            was made captain of the household guard, and many others, <lb/>
            with whose merits and fidelity he was acquainted, received <lb/>
            different commands at his discretion. <pb n="256"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. CH. IX. </note> 2. Being now about to march through the Black Forest, <lb/>
            and the country lying on the banks of the Danube, he <lb/>
            on a sudden conceived great doubt and fear whether the <lb/>
            smallness of his force might not breed contempt, and en- <lb/>
            courage the numerous population of the district to resist <lb/>
            his advance.</p>
          <p>3. To prevent this, he took prudent precautions, and <lb/>
            distributing his army into divisions, be sent some under <lb/>
            Jovenius and Jovius to advance with all speed by the well- <lb/>
            trodden roads of Italy; others under the command of <lb/>
            Nevitta, the commander of the cavalry, were to take the <lb/>
            inland road of the Tyrol. So that his army, by being <lb/>
            scattered over various countries, might cause a belief that <lb/>
            its numbers were immense, and might fill all nations with <lb/>
            fear. Alexander the Great, and many other skilful generals, <lb/>
            had done the same thing when their affairs required it.</p>
          <p>4. But he charged them, when they set forth, to march <lb/>
            with all speed, as if likely to meet at any moment with <lb/>
            an enemy, and carefully to post watches and sentries and <lb/>
            outposts at night, so as to be free from the danger of any <lb/>
            sudden attack.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1, THESE things having been arranged according to the <lb/>
            best of his judgment, Julian adhering to the maxim by <lb/>
            which he had often forced his way through the countries <lb/>
            of the barbarians, and trusting in his continued successes, <lb/>
            proceeded in his advance.</p>
          <p>2. And when he had reached the spot at which he had <lb/>
            been informed that the river was navigable, he embarked <lb/>
            on board some boats which good fortune had brought <lb/>
            thither in numbers, and passed as secretly as he could <lb/>
            down the stream, escaping notice the more because his <lb/>
            habits of endurance and fortitude had made him indifferent <lb/>
            to delicate food; so that, being contented with meagre and <lb/>
            poor fare, he did not care to approach their towns or <lb/>
            camps, forming his conduct in this respect according to <lb/>
            the celebrated saying of the ancient Cyrus, who, when he <lb/>
            was introduced to a host who asked him what he wished <lb/>
            to have got ready for supper, answered, " Nothing beyond <lb/>
            bread, for that lie hoped he should sup by the side of a <lb/>
            river." <pb n="257"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> D. 361.] </note> 3. But Fame, which, as they say, having a thousand <lb/>
            tongues, always exaggerates the truth, at this time spread <lb/>
            abroad a report among all the tribes of Illyricum that <lb/>
            Julian, having overthrown a number of kings and nations <lb/>
            in Gaul, was coming on flushed with success and with a <lb/>
            numerous army.</p>
          <p>4. Jovinus, the prefect of the prætorium, being alarmed <lb/>
            at this rumour, fled in haste, as if from a foreign enemy; <lb/>
            and going by the public conveyances with frequent relays, <lb/>
            he crossed the Julian Alps, taking with him also Florentius <lb/>
            the prefect.</p>
          <p>5. But Count Lucillianus, who at that time had the <lb/>
            command of the army in these districts, being at Sirmium, <lb/>
            and having received some slight intelligence of Julian's <lb/>
            movements, collected the soldiers whom the emergency <lb/>
            gave time for being quickly called from their several sta- <lb/>
            tions, and proposed to resist his advance.</p>
          <p>6. Julian, however, like a firebrand or torch once kindled, <lb/>
            hastened quickly to his object; and when, at the waning of <lb/>
            the moon, he had reached Bonmunster, which is about nine- <lb/>
            teen miles from Sirmium,' and when, therefore, the main <lb/>
            part of the night was dark, he unexpectedly quitted his <lb/>
            boats, and at once sent forward Dagalaiphus with his light <lb/>
            troops to summon Lucillianus to his presence, and to drag <lb/>
            him before him if he resisted.</p>
          <p>7. He was asleep, and when he was awakened by the <lb/>
            violence of this uproar, and saw himself surrounded by a <lb/>
            crowd of strangers, perceiving the state of the case, and <lb/>
            being filled with awe at the name of the emperor, he <lb/>
            obeyed his orders, though sadly against his will. And <lb/>
            though commander of the cavalry, a little while before <lb/>
            proud and fierce, he now obeyed the will of another, and <lb/>
            mounting a horse which was brought him on a sudden, he <lb/>
            was led before Julian as an ignoble prisoner, and from <lb/>
            fear was hardly able to collect his senses.</p>
          <p>8. But as soon as he saw the emperor, and was relieved <lb/>
            by receiving permission to offer his salutations to his purple <lb/>
            robe, he recovered his courage, and feeling safe said, "You <lb/>
            have been incautious and rash, 0 emperor, to trust yourself <lb/>
            with but a few troops in the country of another." But <lb/>
            Julian, with a sarcastic smile, replied, " Keep these prudent <note type="footnote">1 Sirmium was very near the existing town of Peterwaradin. </note> <note type="footnote"> s </note> <pb n="258"/>

          <p>§ 1. So after he had got rid of Lucillianus, thinking no <lb/>
            further delay or hesitation admissible, being bold and con- <lb/>
            fident in all emergencies, and on the way, as he presumed, <lb/>
            to a city inclined to surrender, he marched on with great <lb/>
            speed. When he came near the suburbs, which are very <lb/>
            large and much extended, a vast crowd of soldiers and of <lb/>
            every class of the population came forth to meet him <lb/>
            with lights and flowers and auspicious prayers, and after <lb/>
            saluting him. as emperor and lord, conducted him to the <lb/>
            palace.</p>
          <p>2. He, pleased at these favourable omens, and conceiving <lb/>
            therefrom a sanguine hope of future success, concluded <lb/>
            that the example of so populous and illustrious a metro- <lb/>
            polis would be followed as a guiding-star by other cities <lb/>
            also, and therefore on the very next day exhibited a <lb/>
            chariot race, to the great joy of the people. On the third <lb/>
            day, unable to brook any delay, he proceeded by the public <lb/>
            roads, and without any resistance seized upon Succi, and <lb/>
            appointed Nevitta governor of the place, as one whom he <lb/>
            could trust. It is fitting that I should now explain the <lb/>
            situation of this place Succi.</p>
          <p>3. The summits of the mountain chains of Hæmus1 and <lb/>
            Rhodope, the first of which rises up from the very banks of <lb/>
            the Danube, and the other from the southern bank of the <lb/>
            river Axius, ending with swelling ridges at one narrow <lb/>
            point, separate the lllyrians and the ThracianR, being on <lb/>
            the one side near the inland Dacians and Serdica, on the <lb/>
            other looking towards Thrace and the rich and noble city <lb/>
            of Philippopolis. And, as if Nature had provided for bring- <lb/>
            ing the surrounding nations under the dominion of the <lb/>
            Romans, they are of such a form as to lead to this end. <lb/>
            Affording at first only a single exit through narrow defiles, <lb/>
            but at a later period they were opened out with roads of <lb/>
            such size and beauty as to be passable even for waggons. <lb/>
            Though still, when the passes have been blocked up, they <note type="footnote">1 Now the Balkan. </note> <pb n="259"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> <lb/>
            have often repelled the attacks of great generals and <lb/>
            mighty armies.</p>
          <p>4. The part which looks to Illyricum is of a more <lb/>
            gentle ascent, so as to be climbed almost imperceptibly; <lb/>
            but the side opposite to Thrace is very steep and preci- <lb/>
            pitems, in some places absolutely impassable, and in others <lb/>
            hard to climb even where no one seeks to prevent it. <lb/>
            Beneath this lofty chain a spacious level plain extends in <lb/>
            every direction, the upper portion of it reaching even to <lb/>
            the Julian Alps, while the lower portion of it is so open <lb/>
            and level as to present no obstacles all the way to the <lb/>
            straits and sea of Marmora.</p>
          <p>5. Having arranged these matters as well as the occasion <lb/>
            permitted, and having left there the commander of the <lb/>
            cavalry, the emperor returned to Nissa, a considerable town, <lb/>
            in order, without any hindrance, to settle everything in <lb/>
            the way most suited to his interests.</p>
          <p>6. While there he appointed Victor, an historical writer, <lb/>
            whom he had seen at Sirmium, and whom he ordered to <lb/>
            follow him from that city, to be consular governor of the <lb/>
            second Pannonia; and he erected in his honour a brazen <lb/>
            statue, as a man to be imitated for his temperance; and <lb/>
            some time after he was appointed prefect of Rome.</p>
          <p>7. And now, giving the rein to loftier ideas, and believing <lb/>
            it to be impossible to bring Constantius to terms, he wrote <lb/>
            a speech full of bitter invectives to the senate, setting forth <lb/>
            many charges of disgrace and vice against him. And when <lb/>
            this harangue, Tertullus still being prefect of the city, was <lb/>
            read in the senate, the gratitude of the nobles, as well as <lb/>
            their splendid boldness, was very conspicuous; for they all <lb/>
            cried out with one unanimous feeling, " We expect that you <lb/>
            should show reverence to the author of your own great- <lb/>
            ness."</p>
          <p>8. Then he assailed the memory of Constantine also as <lb/>
            an innovator and a disturber of established laws and of <lb/>
            customs received from ancient times, accusing him of <lb/>
            having been the first to promote barbarians to the fasces <lb/>
            and robe of the consul. But in this respect he spoke with <lb/>
            folly and levity, since, in the face of what he so bitterly <lb/>
            reproved, he a very short time afterwards added to Ma- <lb/>
            mertinus, as his colleague in the consulship, Nevitta, a <lb/>
            man neither in rank, experience, or reputation at all equal <pb n="260"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXI. CH. XI. </note> <lb/>
            to those on whom Constantine had conferred that illus- <lb/>
            trous magistracy, but who, on the contrary, was desti- <lb/>
            tute of accomplishments and somewhat rude ; and what <lb/>
            was less easy to be endured, made a cruel use of his high <lb/>
            power.</p>

            <title type="sub">XI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHILE Julian was occupied with these and similar <lb/>
            thoughts, and was anxious about great and important <lb/>
            affairs, a messenger came with terrible and unexpected <lb/>
            news of the monstrous attempts of some persons which <lb/>
            were likely to hinder his fiery progress, unless by prompt <lb/>
            vigilance he could crush them before they came to a head. <lb/>
            I will briefly relate what they were.</p>
          <p>2. Under pretence of urgent necessity, but in reality <lb/>
            because he still suspected their fidelity to him, he had sent <lb/>
            into Gaul two legions belonging to the army of Constantius, <lb/>
            with a troop of archers which he had found at Sirmium. <lb/>
            They, moving slowly, and dreading the length of the <lb/>
            journey and the fierce and continual attacks of the hostile <lb/>
            Germans, planned a mutiny, being prompted and en- <lb/>
            couraged by Nigiinus, a tribune of a squadron of cavalry, <lb/>
            a native of Mesopotamia. And having arranged the matter <lb/>
            in secret conferences, and kept it close in profound silence, <lb/>
            when they arrived at Aquileia, a city important from its <lb/>
            situation and wealth, and fortified with strong walls, they <lb/>
            suddenly closed the gates in a hostile manner, the native <lb/>
            population, by whom the name of Constantius was still <lb/>
            beloved, increasing the confusion and the terror. And <lb/>
            having blockaded all the approaches, and armed the towers <lb/>
            and battlements, they prepared measures to encounter the <lb/>
            impending struggle, being in the mean time free and un- <lb/>
            restrained. By this daring conduct they roused the Italian <lb/>
            natives of the district to espouse the side of Constantius, <lb/>
            who was still alive.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHEN Julian heard of this transaction, being then at <lb/>
            Nissa, as he feared nothing unfriendly in his rear, and <lb/>
            had read and heard that this city, though often besieged, <pb n="261"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> <lb/>
            had never been destroyed or taken, hastened the more <lb/>
            eagerly to gain it, either by stratagem, or by some kind of <lb/>
            flattery or other, before any more formidable event should <lb/>
            arise.</p>
          <p>2. Therefore he ordered Jovinus, the captain of his <lb/>
            cavalry, who was marching over the Alps, and had entered <lb/>
            Noricum, to return with all speed, to remedy by some <lb/>
            means or other, the evil which had burst out. And, that <lb/>
            nothing might be wanting, he bade him retain all the <lb/>
            soldiers who were marching after his court or his standards <lb/>
            and passing through that town, and to avail himself of <lb/>
            their help to the utmost.</p>
          <p>3. When he had made these arrangements, having soon <lb/>
            afterwards heard of the death of Constantius, he crossed <lb/>
            through Thrace, and entered Constantinople: and having <lb/>
            been often assured that the siege would be protracted <lb/>
            rather than formidable, he sent Immo with some other <lb/>
            counts to conduct it; and removed Jovinus to employ him <lb/>
            in other matters of greater importance.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, having surrounded Aquileia with a double <lb/>
            line of heavy infantry, the generals all agreed upon trying <lb/>
            to induce the garrison to surrender, using alternately <lb/>
            threats and caresses ; but after many proposals and replies <lb/>
            had been interchanged, their obstinacy only increased, and <lb/>
            the conferences were abandoned, having proved wholly <lb/>
            ineffectual.</p>
          <p>5. And because there was now no prospect but that of a <lb/>
            battle, both sides refreshed themselves with sleep and <lb/>
            food ; and at daybreak the trumpets sounded, and the two <lb/>
            armies, arrayed for reciprocal slaughter, attacked one <lb/>
            another with loud shouts, but with more ferocity than <lb/>
            skill.</p>
          <p>6. Therefore the besiegers, bearing wooden penthouses <lb/>
            over them, and closely woven wicker defences, marched on <lb/>
            slowly and cautiously, and attempted to undermine the <lb/>
            walls with iron tools: many also bore ladders which had <lb/>
            been made of the height of the walls, and came up close <lb/>
            to them: when some were dashed down by stones hurled <lb/>
            on their heads, others were transfixed by whizzing jave- <lb/>
            lins, and falling back, dragged with them those who were <lb/>
            in their rear: and others, from fear of similar mischances, <lb/>
            shrank from the attack. <pb n="262"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. CH. XII. </note> 7. The besieged being encouraged by the issue of this <lb/>
            first conflict, and hoping for still better success, disregarded <lb/>
            the rest of the attacks made on them; and with resolute <lb/>
            minds they stationed engines in suitable positions, and <lb/>
            with unwearied toil discharged the duties of watching and <lb/>
            of whatever else could tend to their safety.</p>
          <p>8. On the other hand, the besiegers, though fearing an- <lb/>
            other combat, and full of anxiety, still out of shame would <lb/>
            not appear lazy or cowardly, and as they could make no <lb/>
            way by open attacks, they also applied themselves to the <lb/>
            various manoeuvres employed in sieges. And because <lb/>
            there was no ground favourable for working battering-rams <lb/>
            or other engines, nor for making mines, since the river <lb/>
            Natiso passed under the walls of the city, they contrived <lb/>
            a plan worthy to be compared with any effort of ancient <lb/>
            skill.</p>
          <p>9. With great rapidity they built some wooden towers, <lb/>
            higher than the battlements of the enemy, and then fasten- <lb/>
            ing their boats together, they placed these towers on them. <lb/>
            In them they stationed soldiers, who, with undaunted reso- <lb/>
            lution, laboured to drive down the garrison from the walls; <lb/>
            while under them were bodies of light infantry wholly <lb/>
            unencumbered, who going forth from the hollow parts of <lb/>
            the towers below, threw drawbridges across, which they <lb/>
            had put together beforehand, and so tried to cross over to the <lb/>
            bottom of the wall while the attention of the garrison was <lb/>
            diverted from them; so that while those above them were <lb/>
            attacking one another with darts and stones, those who <lb/>
            crossed over on the drawbridges might be able without <lb/>
            interruption to break down a portion of the wall and so <lb/>
            effect an entrance.</p>
          <p>10. But once more a clever design failed in its result. <lb/>
            For when the towers came close to the walls, they were <lb/>
            assailed with brands steeped in pitch, and reeds, and <lb/>
            faggots, and every kind of food for flames, all kindled. <lb/>
            The towers quickly caught fire, and yielding under the <lb/>
            weight of the men who were mounted on them, fell into <lb/>
            the river, while some of the soldiers on their summits, <lb/>
            even before they fell, had been pierced with javelins hurled <lb/>
            from the engines on the walls, and so died.</p>
          <p>11. Meanwhile the soldiers at the foot of the wall, being <lb/>
            cut off by the destruction of their comrades in the boats, <pb n="263"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> <lb/>
            were crushed with huge stones, with the exception of a <lb/>
            few, who, in spite of the difficult ground over which <lb/>
            their flight lay, escaped by their swiftness of foot. At <lb/>
            last, when the contest had been protracted till even- <lb/>
            ing, the usual signal for retreat was given, and the <lb/>
            combatants parted to pass the night with very different <lb/>
            feelings.</p>
          <p>12. The losses of the besiegers, who had suffered greatly, <lb/>
            encouraged the defenders of the town with hopes of vic- <lb/>
            tory, though they also had to mourn the deaths of some <lb/>
            few of their number. Nevertheless, the preparations went <lb/>
            on rapidly. Rest and food refreshed their bodies during <lb/>
            the night; and at dawn of day the conflict was renewed <lb/>
            at the trumpet's signal.</p>
          <p>13. Some, holding their shields over their heads, in <lb/>
            order to fight with more activity; others, in front, bore <lb/>
            ladders on their shoulders, and rushed on with eager vehe- <lb/>
            mence, exposing their breasts to wounds from every kind <lb/>
            of weapon. Some endeavoured to break down the iron <lb/>
            bars of the gates ; but were attacked with fire, or crushed <lb/>
            under stones hurled from the walls. Some boldly strove <lb/>
            to cross the fosses, but fell beneath the sudden sallies of <lb/>
            soldiers rushing out from postern gates, or were driven <lb/>
            back with severe wounds. For those who sallied forth <lb/>
            had an easy retreat within the walls, and the rampart in <lb/>
            front of the walls, strengthened with turf, saved those who <lb/>
            lay in wait behind it from all danger.</p>
          <p>14. Although the garrison excelled in endurance and in <lb/>
            the arts of war, without any other aid than that of their <lb/>
            walls, still our soldiers, being attacked as they were from a <lb/>
            more numerous force, became impatient of the long delay, <lb/>
            and moved round and round the suburbs, seeking diligently <lb/>
            to discover by what force or what engines they could make <lb/>
            their way out of the city.</p>
          <p>15. But as, through the greatness of the difficulties in <lb/>
            their way, they could not accomplish this, they began to <lb/>
            slacken their exertions as to the siege itself, and leaving a <lb/>
            few watches and outposts, ravaged the adjacent country, <lb/>
            and thus obtained all kinds of supplies, dividing their <lb/>
            booty with their comrades. The consequence was, that <lb/>
            excessive eating and drinking proved injurious to their <lb/>
            health. <pb n="264"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. CH. XII. </note> 16. When, however, Immo and his colleagues reported <lb/>
            this to Julian, who was passing the winter at Constan- <lb/>
            tinople, he applied a wise remedy to such a disorder, and <lb/>
            sent thither Agilo, the commander of his infantry, an <lb/>
            officer in great esteem, that when a man of his rank and <lb/>
            reputation appeared there and took the intelligence of the <lb/>
            death of Constantius to the army, the siege might be ter- <lb/>
            minated in that way.</p>
          <p>17. In the mean while, not to abandon the siege of <lb/>
            Aquileia, as all other attempts had proved futile, the <lb/>
            generals endeavoured to compel the citizens to surrender <lb/>
            by want of water. So they cut the aqueducts; but as the <lb/>
            garrison still resisted with undiminished courage, they, <lb/>
            with vast valour, diverted the stream of the river. But <lb/>
            this again was done in vain; for they reduced the allow- <lb/>
            ance of water to each man ; and contented themselves with <lb/>
            the scanty supply they could procure from wells.</p>
          <p>18. While these affairs were proceeding thus, Agilo <lb/>
            arrived, as he had been commanded; and, being protected <lb/>
            by a strong body of heavy infantry, came up boldly close <lb/>
            to the walls; and in a long and veracious speech, told the <lb/>
            citizens of the death of Constantius, and the confirmation <lb/>
            of Julian's power; but was reviled and treated as a liar. <lb/>
            Nor would any one believe his statement of what had <lb/>
            occurred, till on promise of safety he was admitted by <lb/>
            himself to the edge of the defences; where, with a solemn <lb/>
            oath, he repeated what he had before related.</p>
          <p>19. When his story was heard, they all, eager to be <lb/>
            released from their protracted sufferings, threw open the <lb/>
            gates and rushed out, admitting him in the joy as a captain <lb/>
            who brought them peace; and excusing themselves, they <lb/>
            gave up Kigrinus as the author of their mad resistance, <lb/>
            and a few others ; demanding that their punishment should <lb/>
            be taken as an atonement for the treason and sufferings of <lb/>
            the city.</p>
          <p>20. Accordingly, a few days later, the affair was rigor- <lb/>
            ously investigated; Mamertinus, the prefect of the præ- <lb/>
            torium, sitting as judge; and Kigrinus, as the cause of the <lb/>
            war, was burnt alive. After him, Romulus and Sabostius, <lb/>
            men who had held high office, being convicted of having <lb/>
            sown discord in the empire without any regard to the con- <lb/>
            sequences, were beheaded; and all the rest escaped un- <pb n="265"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.B. 361.] </note> <lb/>
            punished, as men who had been driven to hostilities by <lb/>
            necessity, and not by their own inclination; this being <lb/>
            the decision of the merciful and clement emperor, after a <lb/>
            full consideration of justice. These things, however, hap- <lb/>
            pened some time afterwards.</p>
          <p>21. But Julian, who was still at Nissa, was occupied in <lb/>
            the graver cases, being full of fears on both sides. For he <lb/>
            was apprehensive lest the defiles of the Julian Alps might <lb/>
            be seized and barred against hint by some sudden onset of <lb/>
            the troops who had been shut up in Aquileia; by which <lb/>
            he might lose the provinces beyond, and the supplies <lb/>
            which he was daily expecting from that quarter.</p>
          <p>22. And he also greatly feared the power of the East; <lb/>
            hearing that the soldiers who were scattered over Thrace <lb/>
            had been suddenly collected together to act against him, <lb/>
            and were advancing towards the frontiers of the Sued, under <lb/>
            command of Count Marcianus. But, devising measures suit- <lb/>
            able to this mass of pressing anxieties, he quickly assembled <lb/>
            his Illyrian army, long inured to war, and eager to renew <lb/>
            its martial labours under a warlike chief.</p>
          <p>23. Nor even at this critical moment did he forget the <lb/>
            interests of individuals ; but devoted some time to hearing <lb/>
            contested causes, especially those concerning municipal <lb/>
            bodies, in whose favour he was too partial, so that he raised <lb/>
            several persons who did not deserve such honour to <lb/>
            public offices.</p>
          <p>24. It was here that he found Symmachus and Maximus, <lb/>
            two eminent senators, who had been sent by the nobles as <lb/>
            envoys to Constantius, and had returned again. He pro- <lb/>
            moted them with great honour; so that, preferring them <lb/>
            to others more deserving, he made Maximus prefect of <lb/>
            the eternal city, In order to gratify Rnfinus Vulcatius, <lb/>
            whose nephew he was. Under his administration the city <lb/>
            enjoyed great plenty, and there was an end to the com- <lb/>
            plaints of the common people, which had been so frequent.</p>
          <p>25. Afterwards, in order to add security to those of his <lb/>
            affairs which were still unsettled, and encourage the con- <lb/>
            fidence of the loyal, he raised Mamertinus, the prefect <lb/>
            of the prætorium in Illyricum, and Nevitta to the consul- <lb/>
            ship ; though he had so lately assailed the memory of <lb/>
            Constantine as the person who had set the example of thus <lb/>
            promoting low-born barbarians. <pb n="266"/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE Julian was thus carrying out new projects, and <lb/>
            alternating between hope and fear, Constantius at Edcssa, <lb/>
            being made anxious by the various accounts brought him <lb/>
            by his spies, was full of perplexity. At one time collecting <lb/>
            his army for battle; at another, wishing to lay siege to <lb/>
            Bezabde on two sides, if he could find an opportunity; <lb/>
            taking at the same time prudent precautions not to leave <lb/>
            Mesopotamia unprotected, while about to march into the <lb/>
            districts of Armenia.</p>
          <p>2. But while still undecided, he was detained by various <lb/>
            causes. Sapor also remained on the other side of the <lb/>
            Tigris till the sacrifices should become propitious to his <lb/>
            moving. For if after crossing the river he found no re- <lb/>
            sistance, he might without difficulty penetrate to the <lb/>
            Euphrates. On the other hand, if he wished to keep his <lb/>
            soldiers for the civil war, he feared to expose them to the <lb/>
            dangers of a siege; having already experienced the strength <lb/>
            of the walls and the vigour of the garrison.</p>
          <p>3. However, not to lose time, and to avoid inactivity, lie <lb/>
            sent Arbetio and Agile, the captains of his infantry and <lb/>
            cavalry, with very large forces, to march with all speed ; <lb/>
            not to provoke the Persians to battle, but to establish <lb/>
            forts on the nearest bank of the Tigris, which might be <lb/>
            able to reconnoitre, and see in what direction the furious <lb/>
            monarch broke forth ; and with many counsels given both <lb/>
            verbally and in writing, he charged them to retreat with <lb/>
            celerity the moment the enemy's army began to cross the <lb/>
            river.</p>
          <p>4. While these generals were watching the frontier as <lb/>
            they were ordered, and spying out the secret designs of <lb/>
            their most crafty enemy, he himself, with the main body <lb/>
            of his army, made head against his most pressing foes, as if <lb/>
            prepared for battle; and defended the adjacent towns by <lb/>
            rapid movements. Meantime spies and deserters con- <lb/>
            tinually coming in, related to him opposite stories; being <lb/>
            in fact ignorant of what was intended, because among the <lb/>
            Persians no one knows what is decided on except a few <lb/>
            taciturn and trusty nobles, by whom the god Silence is <lb/>
            worshipped.</p>
          <p>5. But the emperor was continually sent for by the <pb n="267"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> <lb/>
            generals whom I have mentioned, who implored him to <lb/>
            send them aid. For they protested that unless the whole <lb/>
            strength of the army was collected together, it would be <lb/>
            impossible to withstand the onset of the furious Sapor.</p>
          <p>6. And while things in this quarter were thus full of <lb/>
            anxiety, other messengers arrived in numbers, by whose <lb/>
            accurate statements he learnt that Julian had traversed <lb/>
            Italy and Illyricum with great rapidity, had occupied the <lb/>
            defiles of the Succi, and called in auxiliaries from all <lb/>
            quarters, and was now marching through Thrace with a <lb/>
            very large force.</p>
          <p>7. Constantius, learning this, was overwhelmed with <lb/>
            grief, but supported by one comfort, that he had always <lb/>
            triumphed over internal commotions. Nevertheless, though <lb/>
            the affair made it very difficult for him to decide on a line <lb/>
            of action, he chose the best; and sent a body of troops on <lb/>
            by public conveyances,, in order as quickly as possible to <lb/>
            make head against the impending danger.</p>
          <p>8. And as that plan was universally approved, the troops <lb/>
            went as they were commanded, in the lightest marching <lb/>
            order. But the next day, while he was finally arranging <lb/>
            these matters, he received intelligence that Sapor, with his <lb/>
            whole army, had returned to his own country, because the <lb/>
            auspices were unfavourable. So, his fears being removed, <lb/>
            he called in all the troops except those who as usual <lb/>
            were assigned for the protection of Mesopotamia, and <lb/>
            returned to Hierapolis.</p>
          <p>9. And still doubting what would be the final result of <lb/>
            all his difficulties, when he had collected his army together <lb/>
            he convened all the centuries and companies and squadrons <lb/>
            by sound of trumpet; and the whole plain being filled with <lb/>
            the host, he, standing on a lofty tribune, in order to <lb/>
            encourage them the more readily to execute what he <lb/>
            should direct, and being surrounded by a numerous retinue, <lb/>
            spoke thus with great appearance of calmness and a <lb/>
            studied look of confidence.</p>
          <p>10. " Being always anxious never to do or say anything <lb/>
            inconsistent with incorruptible honour, like a cautious <lb/>
            pilot, who turns his helm this way or that way according <lb/>
            to the movement of the waves, I am now constrained, my <lb/>
            most affectionate subjects, to confess my errors to you, <lb/>
            or rather, if I were to say the plain truth, my humanity, <pb n="268"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXI. CH. XIII. </note> <lb/>
            which I did think would be beneficial to our common in- <lb/>
            terests. So now that you may the better understand <lb/>
            what is the object of convoking this assembly, listen, I <lb/>
            pray you, with impartiality and kindness.</p>
          <p>11. " At the time when Magnentius, whom your bravery <lb/>
            overcome, was obstinately labouring to throw all things <lb/>
            into confusion, I sent Gallus my cousin, who had been <lb/>
            lately raised to the rank of Cæsar, to guard the East. <lb/>
            But he, having by many wicked and shameful arts departed <lb/>
            from justice, was punished by a legal sentence.</p>
          <p>12. " Would that Envy had then been contented, that <lb/>
            most bitter exciter of troubles! And that we had nothing <lb/>
            to grieve us but the single recollection of past sorrows, <lb/>
            unaccompanied by any idea of present danger! But now <lb/>
            a new circumstance, more grievous than any former one I <lb/>
            will venture to say, has taken place, which the gods who <lb/>
            aid us will put an end to by means of your innate valour.</p>
          <p>13. " Julian, whom, while you were combating the <lb/>
            nations which threaten Illyricum on all sides, I appointed <lb/>
            to protect Gaul, presuming on the issue of some trifling <lb/>
            battles which he has fought against the half-armed <lb/>
            Germans, and full of silly elation, has taken a few <lb/>
            auxiliary battalions into his noble alliance, men from their <lb/>
            natural ferocity and the desperateness of their situation <lb/>
            ready for acts of the most mischievous audacity, and has <lb/>
            conspired against the public safety, trampling down <lb/>
            justice, the parent and nurse of the Roman world. That <lb/>
            power I believe, both because I myself have experienced <lb/>
            it, and because all antiquity assures me of its might, will, <lb/>
            as an avenger of wickedness, soon trample down their pride <lb/>
            like so many ashes.</p>
          <p>14. " What then remains, except to hasten to encounter <lb/>
            the whirlwind thus raised against us ? so as by prompti- <lb/>
            tude to crush the fury of this rising war before it comes <lb/>
            to maturity and strength ? Nor can it be questioned <lb/>
            that, with the favour of the supreme deity, by whose <lb/>
            everlasting sentence ungrateful men are condemned, the <lb/>
            sword which they have wickedly drawn will be turned <lb/>
            to their own destruction. Since never having received <lb/>
            any provocation, but rather after having been loaded with <lb/>
            benefits, they have risen up to threaten innocent men with <lb/>
            danger. <pb n="269"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> AD. 361.] </note> 15. " For as my mind augurs, and as justice, which will <lb/>
            aid upright counsels, promises, I feel sure that when once <lb/>
            we come to close quarters, they will be so benumbed with <lb/>
            fear as neither to be able to stand the fire of your glanc- <lb/>
            ing eyes nor the sound of your battle cry." This <lb/>
            speech harmonized well with the feelings of the soldiers. <lb/>
            In their rage they brandished their shields, and after <lb/>
            answering him in terms of eager goodwill, demanded <lb/>
            to be led at once against the rebels. Their cordiality <lb/>
            changed the emperor's fear into joy; and having dismissed <lb/>
            the assembly, as he knew by past experience that Arbetio <lb/>
            was most eminently successful in putting an end to intestine <lb/>
            wars, he ordered him to advance first by the road which <lb/>
            he himself designed to take, with the spearmen and the <lb/>
            legion of Mattium,1 and several battalions of light troops; <lb/>
            he also ordered Gomoarius to take with him the Lett, to <lb/>
            check the enemy on their arrival among the defiles of the <lb/>
            Succi; he was selected for this service because he was <lb/>
            unfriendly to Julian on account of some slight he had <lb/>
            received from him in Gaul.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the fortune of Constantius was now wavering <lb/>
            and tottering in this tumult of adverse circumstances, it <lb/>
            showed plainly by signs which almost spoke that a very <lb/>
            critical moment of his life was at hand. For he was <lb/>
            terrified by nocturnal visions, and before he was thoroughly <lb/>
            asleep he had seen the shade of his father bringing him a <lb/>
            beautiful child; and when he received it and placed it in <lb/>
            his bosom, it struck a globe which he had in his right hand <lb/>
            to a distance. Now this indicated a change of circum- <lb/>
            stances, although those who interpreted it gave favourable <lb/>
            answers when consulted.</p>
          <p>2. After this he confessed to his most intimate friends <lb/>
            that, as if he were wholly forsaken, he had ceased to see a <lb/>
            secret vision which sometimes he had fancied appeared to <lb/>
            him in mournful guise; and he believed that the genius <lb/>
            who had been appointed to watch over his safety had <lb/>
            abandoned him, as one who was soon to leave the world. <note type="footnote"> 1 It is believed that Mattium is the same as Marburg; it is not <lb/>
            quite certain. </note> <pb n="270"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. CH. XV. </note> 3. For the opinion of theologians is, that all men when <lb/>
            they are born (without prejudice to the power of destiny) <lb/>
            are connected with a superior power of this kind, who, as <lb/>
            it were, guides their actions; but who is seen by very <lb/>
            few, and only by those who are endued with great and <lb/>
            various virtues.</p>
          <p>4. This may be collected both from oracles and from <lb/>
            eminent writers. Among whom is the comic poet Menan- <lb/>
            der, in whose works these two verses are found ;- <lb/>
            " A spirit is assigned to every man <lb/>
            When born to guide him in the path of life."</p>
          <p>5. It may also be gathered from the immortal poetry of <lb/>
            Homer, that they were not really the gods of heaven who <lb/>
            conversed with his heroes, or stood by them and aided <lb/>
            them in their combats; but the familiar genii who be- <lb/>
            longed to them; to whom also, as their principal support, <lb/>
            Pythagoras owes his eminence, and Socrates and Numa <lb/>
            Pompilius and the elder Scipio. And, as some fancy, <lb/>
            Marius, and Octavianus the first, who took the name of <lb/>
            Augustus. And Hermes Trismegistus, and Apollonius of <lb/>
            Tyana, and Plotinus, who ventured upon some very <lb/>
            mystical discussions of this point; and endeavoured to <lb/>
            show by profound reasoning what is the original cause <lb/>
            why these genii, being thus connected with the souls of <lb/>
            mortals, protect them as if they had been nursed in their <lb/>
            own bosoms, as far as they are permitted; and, if they <lb/>
            find them pure, preserving the body untainted by any <lb/>
            connection with vice, and free from all taint of sin, instruct <lb/>
            them in loftier mysteries.</p>

          <p>§ 1. Constantius therefore, having hastened to Antioch, <lb/>
            according to his wont, at the first movement of a civil war <lb/>
            which he was eager to encounter, as soon as he had made <lb/>
            all his preparations, was in amazing haste to march, though <lb/>
            many of his court were so unwilling as even to proceed to <lb/>
            murmurs. For no one dare openly to remonstrate or <lb/>
            object to his plan.</p>
          <p>2. He set forth towards the end of autumn ; and when <lb/>
            he reached the suburb called Hippocephalus, which is <lb/>
            about three miles from the town, as soon as it was daylight <pb n="271"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> <lb/>
            he saw on his right the corpse of a man who had been <lb/>
            murdered, lying with his head torn off from the body, <lb/>
            stretched out towards the west-and though alarmed at the <lb/>
            omen, which seemed as if the Fates were preparing his end, <lb/>
            he went on more resolutely, and came to Tarsus, where he <lb/>
            caught a slight fever ; and thinking that the motion of his <lb/>
            journey would remove the distemper, lie went on by bad <lb/>
            roads; directing his course by Mopsucrenæ, the farthest <lb/>
            station in Cilicia for those who travel from hence, at the <lb/>
            foot of Mount Taurus.</p>
          <p>3. But when he attempted to proceed the next day he <lb/>
            was prevented by the increasing violence of his disorder, <lb/>
            and the fever began gradually to inflame his veins, so that <lb/>
            his body felt like a little fire, and could scarcely be touched; <lb/>
            and as all remedies failed, he began in the last extremity <lb/>
            to bewail his death; and while his mental faculties were <lb/>
            still entire, he is said to have indicated Julian as the suc- <lb/>
            cessor to his power. Presently the last struggle of death <lb/>
            came on, and he lost the power of speech. And after long <lb/>
            and painful agony he died on the fifth of October, having <lb/>
            lived and reigned forty years and a few months.</p>
          <p>4. After bewailing his death with groans, lament- <lb/>
            ations, and mourning, those of the highest rank in the <lb/>
            royal palace deliberated what to do or to attempt; and <lb/>
            having secretly consulted a few persons about the election <lb/>
            of an emperor, at the instigation, as it is said, of Eusebius, <lb/>
            who was stimulated by his consciousness of guilt (since <lb/>
            Julian was approaching who was prepared to oppose his <lb/>
            attempts at innovation), they sent Theolaiphus and Aligil- <lb/>
            dus, who at that time were counts, to him, to announce <lb/>
            the death of his kinsman ; and to entreat him to lay aside <lb/>
            all delay and hasten to take possession of the East, which <lb/>
            was prepared to obey him.</p>
          <p>5. But fame and an uncertain report whispered that <lb/>
            Constantius had left a will, in which, as we have already <lb/>
            mentioned, he had named Julian as his heir; and had <lb/>
            given commissions and legacies to his friends. But he left <lb/>
            his wife in the family way, who subsequently had a <lb/>
            daughter, who received the same name, and was afterwards <lb/>
            married to Gratianus. <pb n="272"/>

          <p>§ 1. In accurately distinguishing the virtues and vices of <lb/>
            Constantius, it will be well to take the virtues first. <lb/>
            Always preserving the dignity of the imperial authority, <lb/>
            he proudly and magnanimously disdained popularity. In <lb/>
            conferring the higher dignities he was very sparing, and <lb/>
            allowed very few changes to be made in the administration <lb/>
            of the finances. Nor did he ever encourage the arrogance <lb/>
            of the soldiers.</p>
          <p>2. Nor under him was any general promoted to the <lb/>
            title of most illustrious.' For there was also, as we have <lb/>
            already mentioned, the title of most perfect.' Nor had the <lb/>
            governor of a province occasion to court a commander of <lb/>
            cavalry; as Constantius never allowed those officers to <lb/>
            meddle with civil affairs. But all officers, both military <lb/>
            and civil, were according to the respectful usages of old, <lb/>
            inferior to that of the prefect of the prætorium, which was <lb/>
            the most honourable of all.</p>
          <p>3. In taking care of the soldiers he was very cautious: <lb/>
            an examiner into their merits, sometimes over-scrupulous, <lb/>
            giving dignities about the palace as if with scales. Under <lb/>
            him no one who was not well known to him, or who was <lb/>
            favoured merely by some sudden impulse, ever received <lb/>
            any high appointment in the palace. But only such as <lb/>
            had served ten years in some capacity or other could look <lb/>
            for such appointments as master of the ceremonies or trea- <lb/>
            surer. The successful candidates could always be known <lb/>
            beforehand; and it very seldom happened that any military <lb/>
            officer was transferred to a civil office; while on the other <lb/>
            hand none but veteran soldiers were appointed to com- <lb/>
            mand troops. <note type="footnote"> 1 These and other titles, such as " respectable " (spectabiles), " illus- <lb/>
            trious " (egregrie, illustres), were invented by the emperors of this <lb/>
            century. They none of them appear to have conferred any substantive <lb/>
            power. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This office had been first established by Augustus, who created <lb/>
            two prefects of the prætorian cohorts, under whose command also all <lb/>
            the soldiers in Italy were placed. Commodus raised the number to <lb/>
            three, and Constantine to four, whom (when he abolished the prætorian <lb/>
            cohort), he made, in fact, governors of provinces. There was one <lb/>
            præfectus prætorio for Gaul, one for Italy, one for Illyricum, and one <lb/>
            for the East. </note> <pb n="273"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> 4. He was a diligent cultivator of learning, but, as his <lb/>
            blunted talent was not suited to rhetoric, he devoted <lb/>
            himself to versification ; in which, however, he did nothing <lb/>
            worth speaking of.</p>
          <p>5. In his way of life he was economical and temperate, <lb/>
            and by moderation in eating and drinking he preserved <lb/>
            such robust health that he was rarely ill, though when ill <lb/>
            dangerously so. For repeated experience and proof has <lb/>
            shown that this is the case with persons who avoid licen- <lb/>
            tiousness and luxury.</p>
          <p>6. He was contented with very little sleep, which he <lb/>
            took when time and season allowed; and throughout his <lb/>
            long life he was so extremely chaste that no suspicion was <lb/>
            ever cast on him in this respect, though it is a charge <lb/>
            which, even when it can find no ground, malignity is apt <lb/>
            to fasten on princes.</p>
          <p>7. In riding and throwing the javelin, in shooting with <lb/>
            the bow, and in all the accomplishments of military exer- <lb/>
            cises, he was admirably skilful. That he never blew his <lb/>
            nose in public, never spat, never was seen to change coun- <lb/>
            tenance, and that he never in all his life ate any fruit I <lb/>
            pass over, as what has been often related before.</p>
          <p>8. Having now briefly enumerated his good qualities <lb/>
            with which we have been able to become acquainted, let <lb/>
            us now proceed to speak of his vices. In other respects <lb/>
            he was equal to average princes, but if he had the slightest <lb/>
            reason (even if founded on wholly false information) for <lb/>
            suspecting any one of aiming at supreme power, he would <lb/>
            at once institute the most rigorous inquiry—trampling <lb/>
            down right and wrong alike, and outdo the cruelty of <lb/>
            Caligula, Domitian, or Commodus, whose barbarity he <lb/>
            rivalled at the very beginning of his reign, when he <lb/>
            shamefully put to death his own connections and relations.</p>
          <p>9. And his cruelty and morose suspicions, which were <lb/>
            directed against everything of the kind, were a cruel addi- <lb/>
            tion to the sufferings of the unhappy persons who were <lb/>
            accused of sedition or treason.</p>
          <p>10. And if anything of the kind got wind, he instituted <lb/>
            investigations of a more terrible nature than the law sanc- <lb/>
            tioned, appointing men of known cruelty as judges in such <lb/>
            cases; and in punishing offenders he endeavoured to pro- <lb/>
            tract their deaths as long as nature would allow, being in <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXI. CH. XVI. </note> <lb/>
            such cases more savage than even Gallienus. For lie, <lb/>
            though assailed by incessant and real plots of rebels, such <lb/>
            as Aureolus, Posthumus, Ingenuus, and Valens who was <lb/>
            surnamed the Thessalonian, and many others, often miti- <lb/>
            gated the penalty of crimes liable to sentence of death; <lb/>
            while Constantius caused facts which were really unques- <lb/>
            tionable to be looked upon as doubtful by the excessive <lb/>
            inhumanity of his tortures.</p>
          <p>1 ]. In such cases he had a mortal hatred of justice, even <lb/>
            though his great object was to be accounted just and mer- <lb/>
            ciful : and as sparks flying from a dry wood, by a mere <lb/>
            breath of wind are sometimes carried on with unrestrained <lb/>
            course to the danger of the country villages around, so he <lb/>
            also from the most trivial causes kindled heaps of evils , <lb/>
            being very unlike that wise emperor Marcus Aurelius, <lb/>
            who, when Cassius in Syria aspired to the supreme power, <lb/>
            and when a bundle of letters which he had written to his <lb/>
            accomplices, was taken with their bearer, and brought to <lb/>
            him. ordered them at once to be burned, while he was still <lb/>
            in Illyricum, in order that he might not know who had <lb/>
            plotted against him, and so against his will be obliged to <lb/>
            consider some persons as his enemies.</p>
          <p>12. And, as some right-thinking people are of opinion, <lb/>
            it was rather an indication of great virtue in Constantius <lb/>
            to have quelled the empire without shedding more blood, <lb/>
            than to have revenged himself with such cruelty.</p>
          <p>13. As Cicero also teaches us, when in one of his letters <lb/>
            to Nepos he accuses Cæsar of cruelty, " For," says he, <lb/>
            " felicity is nothing else but success in what is honour- <lb/>
            able or to define it in another way, " Felicity is fortune <lb/>
            assisting good counsels, and he who is not guided by such <lb/>
            cannot be happy. Therefore in wicked and impious de- <lb/>
            signs such as those of Cæsar there could be no felicity; <lb/>
            and in my judgment Camillus when in exile was happier <lb/>
            than Manlius at the same time, even if Manlius had been <lb/>
            able to make himself king, as he wished.'</p>
          <p>14. The same is the language of Heraclitus of Ephesus, <lb/>
            when he remarks that men of eminent capacity and virtue, <lb/>
            through the caprice of fortune, have often been overcome <lb/>
            by men destitute of either talent or energy. But that that <lb/>
            glory is the best when power, existing with high rank, <lb/>
            forces, as it were, its inclinations to be angry and cruel, <pb n="275"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> <lb/>
            and oppressive under the yoke, and so erects a glorious <lb/>
            trophy in the citadel of its victorious mind.</p>
          <p>15. But as in his foreign wars this emperor was unsuc- <lb/>
            cessful and unfortunate, on the other hand in his civil <lb/>
            contests he was successful; and in all those domestic cala- <lb/>
            mities he covered himself with the horrid blood of the <lb/>
            enemies of the republic and of himself; and yielding to <lb/>
            his elation at these triumphs in a way neither right nor <lb/>
            usual, he erected at a vast expense triumphal arches in <lb/>
            Gaul and the two Pannonias, to record his triumphs over <lb/>
            his own provinces; engraving on them the titles of his <lb/>
            exploits ... as long as they should last, to those who <lb/>
            read the inscriptions.</p>
          <p>16. He was preposterously addicted to listening to his <lb/>
            wives, and to the thin voices of his eunuchs, and some of <lb/>
            his courtiers, who applauded all his words, and watched <lb/>
            everything he said, whether in approval or disapproval, in <lb/>
            order to agree with it.</p>
          <p>17. The misery of these times was further increased by <lb/>
            the insatiable covetousness of his tax-collectors, who <lb/>
            brought him more odium than money : and to many <lb/>
            persons this seemed the more intolerable, because he <lb/>
            never listened to any excuse, never took any measures for <lb/>
            relief of the provinces when oppressed by the multiplicity of <lb/>
            taxes and imposts; and in addition to all this he was very <lb/>
            apt to take back any exemptions which he had granted.</p>
          <p>18. He confused the Christian religion, which is plain <lb/>
            and simple, with old women's superstitions; in investi- <lb/>
            gating which he preferred perplexing himself-to settling <lb/>
            its questions with dignity, so that he excited much dissen- <lb/>
            sion ; which he further encouraged by diffuse wordy <lb/>
            explanations: he ruined the establishment of public con- <lb/>
            veyances by devoting them to the service of crowds of <lb/>
            priests, who went to and fro to different synods, as they <lb/>
            call the meetings at which they endeavour to settle every- <lb/>
            thing according to their own fancy.</p>
          <p>19. As to his personal appearance and stature, he was <lb/>
            of a dark complexion with prominent eyes; of keen sight, <lb/>
            soft hair, with his cheeks carefully shaved, and bright <lb/>
            looking. From his waist to his neck he was rather long, <lb/>
            his legs were very short and crooked, which made him a <lb/>
            good leaper and runner. <pb n="276"/>

            seemed to portend to Jovianus, as the superintendent of his <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the variable events of fortune were bringing to <lb/>
            pass these events in different parts of the world, Julian, <lb/>
            amid the many plans which he was revolving while in <lb/>
            Illyricum, was continually consulting the entrails of vic- <lb/>
            tims and watching the flight of birds in his eagerness to <lb/>
            know the result of what was about to happen.</p>
          <p>2. Aprunculus Gallus, an orator and a man of skill as a <lb/>
            soothsayer, who was afterwards promoted to be governor <lb/>
            of Narbonne, announced these results to him, being taught <lb/>
            beforehand by the inspection of a liver, as he affirmed, <lb/>
            which he had seen covered with a double skin. And <lb/>
            while Julian was fearing that he was inventing stories to <lb/>
            correspond with his desires, and was on that account out <lb/>
            of humour, he himself beheld a far more favourable omen, <lb/>
            which clearly predicted the death of Constantius. For at <lb/>
            the same moment that that prince died in Cilicia, the <lb/>
            soldier who, as he was going to mount his horse, had <lb/>
            supported him with his right hand, fell down, on which <lb/>
            Julian at once exclaimed, in the bearing of many persons, <lb/>
            that he who had raised him to the summit had fallen.</p>
          <p>3. But he did not change his plans, but remained within <lb/>
            the border of Dacia, still being harassed with many <lb/>
            fears. Nor did he think it prudent to trust to conjectures, <lb/>
            which might perhaps turn out contrary to his expect- <lb/>
            ations.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. BUT while he was thus in suspense, the ambassadors, <lb/>
            Theolaiphus and Aligildus, who had been despatched to <pb n="278"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXII. CH. II. </note> <lb/>
            him to announce the death of Constantius, suddenly ar <lb/>
            rived, adding that that prince with his last words had <lb/>
            named him as his successor in his dignity.</p>
          <p>2. As soon as he learnt this, being delighted at his deli- <lb/>
            verance from the turmoils of war and its consequent dis- <lb/>
            orders, and fully relying on the prophecies he had received, <lb/>
            having besides often experienced the advantages of celerity <lb/>
            of action, he issued orders to march to Thrace. Therefore <lb/>
            speedily advancing his standards, he passed over the high <lb/>
            ground occupied by the Succi, and marched towards the <lb/>
            ancient city of Eumolpias, now called Philippopolis, all <lb/>
            his army following him with alacrity.</p>
          <p>3. For they now saw that the imperial power which <lb/>
            they were on their way to seize, in the face of imminent <lb/>
            danger, was in a measure beyond their hopes put into their <lb/>
            hands by the course of nature. And as report is wont <lb/>
            marvellously to exaggerate events, a rumour got abroad <lb/>
            that Julian, formidable both by sea and land, had entered <lb/>
            Heraclea, called also Perinthus, borne over its unresisting <lb/>
            walls on the chariot of Triptolemus, which from its rapid <lb/>
            movements the ancients, who loved fables, had stated to <lb/>
            be drawn by flying serpents and dragons.</p>
          <p>4. When he arrived at Constantinople, people of every <lb/>
            age and sex poured forth to meet him, as though he were <lb/>
            some one dropped from heaven. On the eleventh of De- <lb/>
            cember he was received with respectful duty by the senate, <lb/>
            and by the unanimous applause of the citizens, and was <lb/>
            escorted into the city by vast troops of soldiers and civi- <lb/>
            lians, marshalled like an army, while all eyes were turned <lb/>
            on him, not only with the gaze of curiosity, but with great <lb/>
            admiration.</p>
          <p>5. For it seemed to them like a dream, that a youth in <lb/>
            the flower of his age, of slight body, but renowned for <lb/>
            great exploits, after many victories over barbarian kings <lb/>
            and nations, having passed from city to city with un- <lb/>
            paralleled speed, should now, by an accession of wealth <lb/>
            and power as rapid as the spread of fire, have become the <lb/>
            unresisted master of the world; and the will of God itself <lb/>
            having given him the empire, should thus have obtained <lb/>
            it without any injury to the state. <pb n="279"/>

          <p>§ 1. His first step was to give to Secundus Sallustius, <lb/>
            whom he promoted to be prefect of the prætorium, being <lb/>
            well assured of his loyalty, a commission to conduct some <lb/>
            important investigations, joining with him as colleagues <lb/>
            Mamertinus, Arbetio, Agile, and Nevitta, and also Jovinus, <lb/>
            whom he had recently promoted to the command of the <lb/>
            cavalry in Illyricum.</p>
          <p>2. They all went to Chalcedon, and in the presence of <lb/>
            the chiefs and tribunes, the Jovian and Herculian legions, <lb/>
            they tried several causes with too much rigour, though <lb/>
            there were some in which it was undeniable that the <lb/>
            accused were really guilty.</p>
          <p>3. They banished Palladius, the master of the ceremonies, <lb/>
            to Britain, though there was but a suspicion that he had <lb/>
            prejudiced Constantius against Gallus, while he was master <lb/>
            of the ceremonies under that prince as Cæsar.</p>
          <p>4. They banished Taurus, who had been prefect of the <lb/>
            prætorium, to Vercelli, who, to all persons capable of dis- <lb/>
            tinguishing between right and wrong, will appear very <lb/>
            excusable in respect to the act for which he was con- <lb/>
            demned. For his offence was only that, fearing a violent <lb/>
            disturbance which had arisen, he fled to the protection of <lb/>
            his prince. And the treatment inflicted on him could not <lb/>
            be read without great horror, when the preamble of the <lb/>
            public accusation began thus:—" In the consulship of <lb/>
            Taurus and Florentius, Taurus being brought before the <lb/>
            criers-It</p>
          <p>5. Pentadius also was destined for a similar sentence; <lb/>
            the charge against him being that, having been sent on <lb/>
            a mission by Constantius, he had made notes of the replies <lb/>
            given by Gallus when he was examined on several sub- <lb/>
            jects before he was put to death. But as he defended <lb/>
            himself with justice, he was at last discharged.</p>
          <p>6. With similar iniquity, Florentius, at that time master <lb/>
            of the ceremonies, the son of Nigrinianus, was banished to <lb/>
            Boæ, an island on the coast of Dalmatia. The other <lb/>
            Florentius, who had been prefect of the prætorium, and <lb/>
            was then consul, being alarmed at the sudden change in <lb/>
            the aspect of affairs, in order to save himself from danger, <pb n="280"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXII. CH. III. </note> <lb/>
            hid himself and his wife for some time, and never returned <lb/>
            during Julian's life; still he was, though absent, con- <lb/>
            demned to death.</p>
          <p>7. In the same way, Evagrius, the comptroller of the <lb/>
            private demesnes of the emperor, and Saturninus, late <lb/>
            superintendent of the palace, and Cyrinus, late secretary, <lb/>
            were all banished. But Justice herself seems to have <lb/>
            mourned over the death of Ursulus, the treasurer, and <lb/>
            to accuse Julian of ingratitude to him. For when, as <lb/>
            Cæsar, he was sent to the west, with the intent that he <lb/>
            was to be kept in great poverty, and without any power of <lb/>
            making presents to any of his soldiers, in order to make <lb/>
            them less inclined to favour any enterprise which he <lb/>
            might conceive, this same Ursulus gave him letters to <lb/>
            the superintendent of the Gallic treasury, desiring him <lb/>
            to give the Cæsar whatever he might require.</p>
          <p>8. After his death, Julian, feeling that he was exposed <lb/>
            to general reproach and execration, thinking that an un- <lb/>
            pardonable crime could be excused, affirmed that the man <lb/>
            had been put to death without his being aware of it, <lb/>
            pretending that he had been massacred by the fury of the <lb/>
            soldiers, who recollected what he had said (as we men- <lb/>
            tioned before) when he saw the destruction of Amida.</p>
          <p>9. And therefore it seemed to be through fear, or else <lb/>
            from a want of understanding what was proper, that he <lb/>
            appointed Arbetio, a man always vacillating and arrogant, <lb/>
            to preside over these investigations, with others of the <lb/>
            chief officers of the legions present for the look of the <lb/>
            thing, when he knew that he had been one of the chief <lb/>
            enemies to his safety, as was natural in one who had borne <lb/>
            a distinguished share in the successes of the civil war.</p>
          <p>10. And though these transactions which I have men- <lb/>
            tioned vexed those who wished him well, those which <lb/>
            came afterwards were carried out with a proper vigour <lb/>
            and severity.</p>
          <p>11. It was only a deserved destiny which befel Apode- <lb/>
            mius, who had been the chief steward, and whose cruel <lb/>
            machinations with respect to the deaths of Silvanus and <lb/>
            Gallus we have already mentioned, and Paulus, the secre- <lb/>
            tary, surnamed " The Chain," men who are never spoken <lb/>
            of without general horror, and who were now sentenced to <lb/>
            be burnt alive. <pb n="281"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">A.D. 361.] </note> 12. They also sentenced to death Eusebius, the chief <lb/>
            chamberlain of Constantius, a man equally full of am- <lb/>
            bition and cruelty, who from the lowest rank had been <lb/>
            raised so high as even almost to lord it over the emperor, <lb/>
            and who had thus become wholly intolerable; and whom <lb/>
            Nemesis, who beholds all human affairs, having often, as <lb/>
            the saying is, plucked him by the ear, and warned to con- <lb/>
            duct himself with more moderation, now, in spite of his <lb/>
            struggles, hurled headlong from his high position.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER this Julian directed his whole favour and affec- <lb/>
            tion to people of every description about the palace; not <lb/>
            acting in this like a philosopher anxious for the discovery <lb/>
            of truth.</p>
          <p>2. For he might have been praised if he had re- <lb/>
            tained a few who were moderate in their disposition, and <lb/>
            of proved honesty and respectability. We must, indeed, <lb/>
            confess that the greater part of them had nourished as it <lb/>
            were such a seed-bed of all vices, which they spread abroad <lb/>
            so as to infect the whole republic with evil desires, and <lb/>
            did even more injury by their example than by the im- <lb/>
            punity which they granted to crimes.</p>
          <p>3. Some of them had been fed on the spoils of temples, <lb/>
            had smelt out gain on every occasion, and having raised <lb/>
            themselves from the lowest poverty to vast riches, had set <lb/>
            no bounds to their bribery, their plunder, or their ex- <lb/>
            travagance, being at all times accustomed to-seize what <lb/>
            belonged to others.</p>
          <p>4. From which habit the beginnings of licentious life <lb/>
            sprang up, with perjuries, contempt of public opinion, and <lb/>
            an insane arrogance, sacrificing good faith to infamous <lb/>
            gains.</p>
          <p>5. Among which vices, debauchery and unrestrained <lb/>
            gluttony grew to a head, and costly banquets superseded <lb/>
            triumphs for victories. The common use of silken robes <lb/>
            prevailed, the textile arts were encouraged, and above <lb/>
            all was the anxious care about the kitchen. Vast spaces <lb/>
            were sought out for ostentatious houses, so vast that if the <lb/>
            consul Cincinnatus had possessed as much land, he would <lb/>
            have lost the glory of poverty after his dictatorship. <pb n="282"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XXII. CH. V. </note> 6. To these shameful vices was added the loss of mili- <lb/>
            tary discipline ; the soldier practised songs instead of his <lb/>
            battle-cry, and a stone would no longer serve him for a <lb/>
            bed, as formerly, but he wanted feathers and yielding <lb/>
            mattresses, and goblets heavier than his sword, for he was <lb/>
            now ashamed to drink out of earthenware; and lie <lb/>
            required marble houses, though it is recorded in ancient <lb/>
            histories that a Spartan soldier was severely punished for <lb/>
            venturing to appear under a roof at all during a campaign.</p>
          <p>7. But now the soldier was fierce and rapacious towards <lb/>
            his own countrymen, but towards the enemy be was <lb/>
            inactive and timid, by courting different parties, and in <lb/>
            times of peace he had acquired riches, and was now a <lb/>
            judge of gold and precious stones, in a manner wholly <lb/>
            contrary to the recollection of very recent times.</p>
          <p>8. For it is well known that when, in the time of the <lb/>
            Cæsar Maximian, the camp of the king of Persia was plun- <lb/>
            dered ; a common soldier, after finding a Persian bag full <lb/>
            of pearls, threw the gems away in ignorance of their value, <lb/>
            and went away contented with the mere beauty of his <lb/>
            bit of dressed leather.</p>
          <p>9. In those days it also happened that a barber who had <lb/>
            been sent for to cut the emperor's hair, came handsomely <lb/>
            dressed; and when Julian saw him, he was amazed, and <lb/>
            said, " I did not send for a superintendent, but for a <lb/>
            barber." And when he was asked what he made by his <lb/>
            business, he answered that he every day made enough to <lb/>
            keep twenty persons, and as many horses, and also a largo <lb/>
            annual income, besides many sources of accidental gain.</p>
          <p>10. And Julian, angry at this, expelled all the men of <lb/>
            this trade, and the cooks, and all who made similar profits, <lb/>
            as of no use to him, telling them, however, to go where <lb/>
            they pleased.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">V.</title>

          <p>§ 1. AXD although from his earliest childhood he was in- <lb/>
            clined to the worship of the gods,' and gradually, as he <lb/>
            grew up, became more attached to it, yet he was influenced <lb/>
            by many apprehensions which made him act in things <lb/>
            relating to that subject as secretly as he could. <note type="footnote"> I Ammianus uses the phrase "worship of the gods," in opposition <lb/>
            tc Christianity. </note> <pb n="283"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 361.] </note> 2. But when his fears were terminated, and he found <lb/>
            himself at liberty to do what he pleased, he then showed <lb/>
            his secret inclinations, and by plain and positive decrees <lb/>
            ordered the temples to be opened, and victims to be <lb/>
            brought to the altars for the worship of the gods.</p>
          <p>3. And in order to give more effect to his intentions, be <lb/>
            ordered the priests of the different Christian sects, with <lb/>
            the adherents of each sect, to be admitted into the palace, <lb/>
            and in a constitutional spirit expressed his wish that their <lb/>
            dissensions being appeased, each without any hindrance <lb/>
            might fearlessly follow the religion he preferred.</p>
          <p>4. He did this the more resolutely because, as long <lb/>
            licence increased their dissensions, he thought he should <lb/>
            never have to fear the unanimity of the common people, <lb/>
            having found by experience that no wild beasts are so <lb/>
            hostile to men as Christian sects in general are to one <lb/>
            another. And he often used to say, " Listen to me, to <lb/>
            whom the Allemanni and Franks have listened imitating <lb/>
            in this an expression of the ancient emperor Marcus <lb/>
            Aurelius. But he omitted to notice that there was a great <lb/>
            difference between himself and his predecessor.</p>
          <p>5. For when Marcus was passing through Palestine, on <lb/>
            his road to Egypt, he is said, when wearied by the dirt <lb/>
            and rebellious spirit of the Jews, to have often exclaimed <lb/>
            with sorrow, " 0 Marcomanni, 0 Quadi, 0 Sarmatians, I <lb/>
            have at last found others worse than you I"</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. ABOUT the same time many Egyptians, excited by <lb/>
            various rumours, arrived at Constantinople; a race given <lb/>
            to controversy, and extremely addicted to habits of litiga- <lb/>
            tion, covetous, and apt to ask payment of debts due to <lb/>
            them over and over again ; and also, by way of escaping <lb/>
            from making the payments due to them, to accuse the rich <lb/>
            of embezzlement, and the tax-gatherers of extortion.</p>
          <p>2. These men, collecting into one body, came screeching <lb/>
            like so many jackdaws, claiming in a rude manner the atten- <lb/>
            tion of the emperor himself, and of the prefects of the prae- <lb/>
            torium, and demanding the restoration of the contributions <lb/>
            which they had been compelled to furnish, justly or un- <lb/>
            justly, for the last seventy years. <pb n="284"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XXII. CH. VII. </note> 3. And as they hindered the transaction of any other <lb/>
            business, Julian issued an edict in which he ordered them <lb/>
            all to go to Chalcedon, promising that he himself also <lb/>
            would soon come there, and settle all their business.</p>
          <p>4. And when they had gone, an order was given to all <lb/>
            the captains of ships which go to and fro, that none of <lb/>
            them should venture to take an Egyptian foi a passenger. <lb/>
            And as this command was carefully observed, their ob- <lb/>
            stinacy in bringing false accusations came to an end, and <lb/>
            they all, being disappointed in their object, returned <lb/>
            home.</p>
          <p>5. After which, as if at the dictation of justice herself, <lb/>
            a law was published forbidding any one to exact from any <lb/>
            officer the restitution of things which that officer had <lb/>
            legally received.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. AT the beginning of the new year, when the consular <lb/>
            records had received the names of Mamertinus and Nevitta, <lb/>
            the prince humbled himself by walking in their train with <lb/>
            other men of high rank; an act which some praised, <lb/>
            while others blame it as full of affectation, and mean.</p>
          <p>2. Afterwards, when Mamertinus was celebrating the <lb/>
            Circensian games, Julian, following an ancient fashion, <lb/>
            manumitted some slaves, who were introduced by the <lb/>
            consul's officer; but afterwards, being informed that on <lb/>
            that day the supreme jurisdiction belonged to another, he <lb/>
            fined himself ten pounds of gold as an offender.</p>
          <p>3. At the same time he was a continual attendant in <lb/>
            the court of justice, settling many actions which were <lb/>
            brought in all kinds of cases. One day while he was <lb/>
            sitting as judge, the arrival of a certain philosopher from <lb/>
            Asia named Maximus, was announced, on which he leapt <lb/>
            down from the judgment seat in an unseemly manner, and <lb/>
            forgetting himself so far as to run at full speed from the <lb/>
            hall, he kissed him, and received him with great reverence, <lb/>
            and led him into the palace, appearing by this unseasonable <lb/>
            ostentation a seeker of empty glory, and forgetful of those <lb/>
            admirable words of Cicero, which describe people like him.</p>
          <p>4. " Those very philosophers inscribe their names on the <lb/>
            identical books which they wiite about the contempt of <pb n="285"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> <lb/>
            glory, in order that they may be named and extolled in <lb/>
            that very thing in which they proclaim their contempt for <lb/>
            mention and for praise." 1</p>
          <p>5. Not long afterwards, two of the secretaries who had <lb/>
            been banished came to him, boldly promising to point <lb/>
            out the hiding-place of Florentius if he would restore <lb/>
            them to their rank in the army; but he abused them, and <lb/>
            called them informers; adding that it did not become an <lb/>
            emperor to be led by underhand information to bring back <lb/>
            a man who had concealed himself out of fear of death, and <lb/>
            who perhaps would not long be left in his retreat un- <lb/>
            pardoned.</p>
          <p>6. On all these occasions Prætextatus was present, a <lb/>
            senator of a noble disposition and of old-fashioned dignity; <lb/>
            who at that time had come to Constantinople on his own <lb/>
            private affairs, and whom Julian by his own choice selected <lb/>
            as governor of Achaia with the rank of proconsul.</p>
          <p>7. Still, while thus diligent in correcting civil evils, <lb/>
            Julian did not omit the affairs of the army: continually <lb/>
            appointing over the soldiers officers of long-tried worth ; <lb/>
            repairing the exterior defences of all the cities throughout <lb/>
            Thrace, and taking great care that the soldiers on the <lb/>
            banks of the Danube, who were exposed to the attacks of <lb/>
            the barbarians, and who, as he heard were doing their <lb/>
            duty with vigilance and courage, should never be in want <lb/>
            of arms, clothes, pay, or provisions.</p>
          <p>8. And while superintending these matters he allowed <lb/>
            nothing to be done carelessly : and when those about him <lb/>
            advised him to attack the Gauls as neighbours who were <lb/>
            always deceitful and perfidious, he said he wished for more <lb/>
            formidable foes; for that the Gallic merchants were enough <lb/>
            for them, who sold them at all times without any distinc- <lb/>
            tion of rank.</p>
          <p>9. While he gave his attention to these and similai <lb/>
            matters, his fame was spreading among foreign nations for <lb/>
            courage, temperance, skill in war, and eminent endow- <lb/>
            ments of every kind of virtue, so that he gradually became <lb/>
            renowned throughout the whole world.</p>
          <p>10. And as the fear of his approach pervaded both <lb/>
            neighbouring and distant countries, embassies hastened to <lb/>
            him with unusual speed from all quarters at one time; the <note type="footnote">1 Pro Archias Poeta, cap. xxii. </note> <pb n="286"/>

            people beyond the Tigris and the Armenians sued for <lb/>
            peace. At another the Indian tribes vied with each other, <lb/>
            sending nobles loaded with gifts even from the Maldive <lb/>
            Islands and Ceylon; from the south the Moors offered <lb/>
            themselves as subjects of the Roman empire; from the <lb/>
            north, and also from those hot climates through which the <lb/>
            Phasis passes on its way to the sea, and from the people of <lb/>
            the Bosphorus, and from other unknown tribes came <lb/>
            ambassadors entreating that on the payment of annual <lb/>
            duties they might be allowed to live in peace within their <lb/>
            native countries.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THE time is now appropriate, in my opinion, since in <lb/>
            treating of this mighty prince we are come to speak of <lb/>
            these districts, to explain perspicuously what we have <lb/>
            learnt by our own eyesight or by reading, about the <lb/>
            frontiers of Thrace and the situation of the Black Sea.</p>
          <p>2. The lofty mountains of Athos in Macedonia, once <lb/>
            made passable for ships by the Persians, and the Eubœan <lb/>
            rocky promontory of Caphareus, where Nauplius the <lb/>
            father of Palamedes wrecked the Grecian fleet, though <lb/>
            far distant from one another, separate the Ægean from the <lb/>
            Thessalian Sea, which, extending as it proceeds, on the <lb/>
            right, where it is widest, is full of the Sporades and <lb/>
            Cyclades islands, which latter are so called because they <lb/>
            lie round Delos, an island celebrated as the birthplace of <lb/>
            the gods; on the left it washes Imbros, Tenedos, Lemnos, <lb/>
            and Thasos; and when agitated by any gale it beats <lb/>
            violently on Lesbos.</p>
          <p>3. From thence, with a receding current, it flows past <lb/>
            the temple of Apollo Sminthius, and Troas, and Troy, <lb/>
            renowned for the adventures of heroes; and on the west it <lb/>
            forms the Gulf of Melas, near the head of which is seen <lb/>
            Abdera, the abode of Protagoras and Democritus; and the <lb/>
            blood-stained seat of the Thracian Diomede; and the <lb/>
            valleys through which the Maritza flows on its way to its <lb/>
            waves; and Maronea, and Ænns, founded under sad <lb/>
            auspices and soon deserted by AEneas, when under the <lb/>
            guidance of the gods he hastened onwards to ancient Italy.</p>
          <p>4. After this it narrows gradually, and, as if by a kind <lb/>
            of natural wish to mingle with its waters, it rushes <pb n="287"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> <lb/>
            towards the Black Sea; and taking a portion of it fortis a <lb/>
            figure like the Greek &lt;&amp;. Then separating the Hellespont <lb/>
            from Mount Rhodope, it passes by Cynossema,' where <lb/>
            Hecuba is supposed to be buried, and Cæla, and Sestos, <lb/>
            and Callipolis, and passing by the tombs of Ajax and <lb/>
            Achilles, it touches Dardanus and Abydos (where Xerxes, <lb/>
            throwing a bridge across, passed over the waters on foot), <lb/>
            and Lampsacus, given to Themistocles by the king of <lb/>
            Persia; and Parion, founded by Parius the son of Jason.</p>
          <p>5. Then curving round in a semicircle and separating <lb/>
            the opposite lands more widely in the round gulf of the <lb/>
            sea of Marmora, it washes on the east Cyzicus, and <lb/>
            Dindyma, the holy seat of the mighty mother Cybele, and <lb/>
            Apamia, and Cius, and Astacus afterwards called Nicomedia <lb/>
            from the King Nicomedes.</p>
          <p>6. On the west it beats against the Chersonese, Ægospo- <lb/>
            tami where Anaxagoras predicted that stones would fall <lb/>
            from heaven, and Lysimachia, and the city which Hercules <lb/>
            founded and consecrated to the memory of his comrade <lb/>
            Perinthus. And in order to preserve the full and complete <lb/>
            figure of the letter <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φ</foreign>, in the very centre of the circular gulf <lb/>
            lies the oblong island of Proconnesus, and also Besbicus.</p>
          <p>7. Beyond the upper end of this island the sea again <lb/>
            becomes very narrow where it separates Bithynia from <lb/>
            Europe, passing by Chalcedon and Chrysopolis, and some <lb/>
            other places of no importance.</p>
          <p>8. Its left shore is looked down upon by Port Athyras <lb/>
            and Selymbria, and Constantinople, formerly called Byzan- <lb/>
            tium, a colony of the Athenians, and Cape Ceras, having <lb/>
            at its extremity a lofty tower to serve as a lighthouse <lb/>
            to ships-from which cape also a very cold wind which <lb/>
            often arises from that point is called Ceratas.</p>
          <p>9. The sea thus broken, and terminated by mingling <lb/>
            with the seas at each end, and now becoming very calm, <lb/>
            spreads out into wider waters, as far as the eye can reach <lb/>
            both in length and breadth. Its entire circuit, if one <lb/>
            should measure it as one would measure an island, sailing <lb/>
            along its shores, is 23,000 furlongs according to Eratos- <lb/>
            thenes, Hecatæus, and Ptolemy, and other accurate inves- <lb/>
            tigators of subjects of this kind, resembling, by the consent <note type="footnote">1 The fable was that Hecuba was turned into a bitch, from which <lb/>
            thisplace was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κονος ση̑μα</foreign>, a dog's tomb. </note> <pb n="288"/>

            of all geographers, a Scythian bow, held at both ends by <lb/>
            its string.</p>
          <p>tO. When the sun rises from the eastern ocean, it is <lb/>
            shut in by the marshes of the Sea of Azov. On the west <lb/>
            it is bounded by the Roman provinces. On the north lie <lb/>
            many tribes differing in language and manners; its southern <lb/>
            side describes a gentle curve.</p>
          <p>11. Over this extended space are dispersed many Greek <lb/>
            cities, which have for the most part been founded by the <lb/>
            people of Miletus, an Athenian colony, long since esta- <lb/>
            blished in Asia among the other Ionians by Nileus, the son <lb/>
            of the famous Codrus, who is said to have devoted himself <lb/>
            to his country in the Doric war.</p>
          <p>12. The thin extremities of the bow at each end are <lb/>
            commanded by the two Bospori, the Thracian and <lb/>
            Cimmerian, placed opposite to one another; and they are <lb/>
            called Bospori because through them the daughter of <lb/>
            Inachus,1 who was changed (as the poets relate) into a <lb/>
            cow, passed into the Ionian sea.</p>
          <p>13. The right curve of the Thracian Bosphorus is covered <lb/>
            by a side of Bithynia, formerly called Mygdonia, of which <lb/>
            province Thynia and Mariandena are districts; as also is <lb/>
            Bebrycia, the inhabitants of which were delivered from the <lb/>
            cruelty of Amycus by the valour of Pollux; and also the <lb/>
            remote spot in which the soothsayer Phineus was terrified <lb/>
            by the threatening flight of the Harpies.</p>
          <p>14. The shores are curved into several long bays, into <lb/>
            which fall the rivers Sangarius, and Phyllis, and Bizes, <lb/>
            and Rebas; and opposite to them at the lower end are the <lb/>
            Symplegades, two rocks which rise into abrupt peaks, and <lb/>
            which in former times were accustomed to dash against one <lb/>
            another with a fearful crash, and then rebounding with a <lb/>
            sharp spring, to recoil once more against the object already <lb/>
            struck. Even a bird could by no speed of its wings pass <lb/>
            between these rocks as they pass and meet again without <lb/>
            being crushed to death.</p>
          <p>15. These rocks, when the Argo, the first of all <lb/>
            ships, hastening to Colchis to carry off the golden fleece, <lb/>
            had passed unhurt by them, stood immovable for the <lb/>
            future, the power of the whirlwind which used to agitate <note type="footnote">1 To-the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βόσπορος</foreign> is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοὸς πόρος</foreign>, the passage of <lb/>

            them being broken ; and are now so firmly united that no one <lb/>
            who saw them now would believe that they had ever been <lb/>
            separated; if all the poems of the ancients did not agree on <lb/>
            the point.</p>
          <p>16. After this portion of Bithynia, the next provinces arc <lb/>
            Pontus and Paphlagonia, in which are the noble cities <lb/>
            of HeracJea, and Sinope, and Polemonium, and Amisus, and <lb/>
            Ties, and Amastris, all originally founded by the energy of <lb/>
            the Greeks ; and Cerasus, from which Lucullus brought the <lb/>
            cherry, and two lofty islands which contain the famous <lb/>
            cities of Trapezus and Pityus.</p>
          <p>17. Beyond these places is the Acherusian cave, which <lb/>
            the natives call <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μυχοπόντιον</foreign>; and the harbour of Acone, and <lb/>
            several rivers, the Acheron, the Arcadius, the Iris, the <lb/>
            Tibris, and near to that the Parthenius, all of which pro- <lb/>
            ceed with a rapid stream into the sea. Close to them is <lb/>
            the Thermodon, which rises in Mount Armonius, and flows <lb/>
            through the forest of Themiscyra, to which necessity for- <lb/>
            merly compelled the Amazons to migrate.</p>
          <p>18. The Amazons, as maybe here explained, after having <lb/>
            ravaged their neighbours by bloody inroads, and over- <lb/>
            powered them by repeated defeats, began to entertain <lb/>
            greater projects; and perceiving their own strength to be <lb/>
            superior to their neighbours', and being continually cove- <lb/>
            tous of their possessions, they forced their way through <lb/>
            many nations, and attacked the Athenians. But they were <lb/>
            routed in a fierce battle, and their flanks being uncovered <lb/>
            by cavalry, they all perished.</p>
          <p>19. When their destruction became known, the rest, who <lb/>
            had been left at home as unwarlike, were reduced to the <lb/>
            last extremities; and fearing the attacks of their neigh- <lb/>
            bours, who would now retaliate on them, they removed <lb/>
            to the more quiet district of the Thermodon. And after a <lb/>
            long time, their posterity again becoming numerous, re- <lb/>
            turned in great force to their native regions, and became <lb/>
            in later ages formidable to the people of many nations.</p>
          <p>20. Not far from hence is the gentle hill Carambis, on <lb/>
            the north, opposite to which, at a distance of 2,500 furlongs, <lb/>
            is the Criu-Metopon, a promontory of Taurica. From <lb/>
            this spot the whole of the sea-coast, beginning at the <lb/>
            river Halys, is like the chord of an arc fastened at both <lb/>
            ends. <note type="footnote"> U </note> <pb n="290"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [BK.XXII. CH.VIII. </note> 21. On the frontiers of this district are the Dahæ,1 the <lb/>
            fiercest of all warriors; and the Chalybes, the first people <lb/>
            who dug up iron, and wrought it to the use of man. <lb/>
            N ext to them lies a large plain occupied by the Dyzares, <lb/>
            the Saqires, the Tibareni, the Mosynæei, the Macrones <lb/>
            and the Philyres, tribes with whieh we have no inter- <lb/>
            course.</p>
          <p>22. And at a small distance from them are some monu- <lb/>
            ments of heroes, where Sthenelus, Idmon, and Tiphys are <lb/>
            buried, the first being that one of Hercules's comrades who <lb/>
            was mortally wounded in the war with the Amazons; the <lb/>
            second the soothsayer of the Argonauts; the third the <lb/>
            skilful pilot of the crew.</p>
          <p>23. After passing by the aforesaid districts, we come to <lb/>
            the cave Aulon, and the river of Calliehorus, which <lb/>
            derives its name from the fact that when Bacehus, having <lb/>
            subdued the nations of India in a three years' war, came <lb/>
            into those countries, he chose the green and shady banks <lb/>
            of this river for the re-establishment of his aneient orgies <lb/>
            and dances; and some think that such festivals as these <lb/>
            were those called Trieterica.2</p>
          <p>24. Next to these frontiers eome the famous eantons of <lb/>
            the Camaritæ, and the Phasis, which with its roaring <lb/>
            streams reaches the Colchi, a race desecnded from the <lb/>
            Egyptians; among whom, besides other cities, is one called <lb/>
            Phasis from the name of the river; and Dioscurias,8 still <lb/>
            famous, which is said to have been founded by the Spartans <lb/>
            Amphitus and 'Cercius, the charioteers of Castor and Pollux; <lb/>
            from whom the nation of Henioehi4 derives its origin.</p>
          <p>25. At a little distance from these are the Achæi, who <lb/>
            after some earlier Trojan war, and not that which began <lb/>
            about Helen, as some authors have affirmed, were driven <lb/>
            into Pontus by foul winds, and, as all around was hostile, <lb/>
            so that they eould nowhere find a settled abode, they <lb/>
            always stationed themselves on the tops of snowy moun- <lb/>
            L'tins : and, under the pressure of an unfavourable elimate <lb/>
            they contracted a habit of living on plunder in contempt <note type="footnote">1 So Virgil calls them Indomitique Dahæ. In the Georgics. also, lie <lb/>

            of all danger; and thus became the most ferocious of all <lb/>
            nations. Of the Cercetæ, who lie next to them, nothing is <lb/>
            known worth speaking of.</p>
          <p>26. Behind them lie the inhabitants of the Cimmerian <lb/>
            Bosphorus, living in cities founded by the Milesiani, the <lb/>
            chief of which is Panticapæum, which is on the Bog a <lb/>
            river of great size, both from its natural waters and the <lb/>
            streams which fall into it.</p>
          <p>27. Then for a great distance the Amazons stretch as <lb/>
            far as the Caspian sea ; occupying the banks of the Don, <lb/>
            which rises in Mount Caucasus, and proceeds in a winding <lb/>
            course, separating Asia from Europe, and falls into the <lb/>
            swampy sea of Azov.</p>
          <p>28. Near to this is the Rha, on the banks of which <lb/>
            grows a vegetable of the same name, which is useful as a <lb/>
            remedy for many diseases.</p>
          <p>29. Beyond the Don, taking the plain in its width, lie the <lb/>
            Sauromatæ, whose land is watered by the never-failing <lb/>
            rivers Maræcus, Rhombites, Theophanes, and Totordanes. <lb/>
            And there is at a vast distance another nation also known <lb/>
            as Sauromatæ, touching the shore at the point where the <lb/>
            river Corax falls into the sea.</p>
          <p>30. Near to this is the sea of Azov, of great extent, <lb/>
            from the abundant sources of which a great body of <lb/>
            water pours through the straits of Patares, near the Black <lb/>
            Sea; on the right are the islands Phanagorus and Her- <lb/>
            monassa, which have been settled by the industry of the* <lb/>
            Greeks.</p>
          <p>31. Round the furthest extremity of this gulf dwell <lb/>
            many tribes differing from one another in language and <lb/>
            habits; the Jaxamatæ, the Mæotæ, the Jazyges, the Rox- <lb/>
            olani, the Alani, the Melanchlænæ, the Geloni, and the <lb/>
            Agathyrsi, whose land abounds in adamant.</p>
          <p>32. And there are others beyond, who are the most re- <lb/>
            mote people of the whole world. On the left side of this <lb/>
            gulf lies the Crimea, full of Greek colonies; the people of <lb/>
            which are quiet and steady : they practise agriculture, and <lb/>
            live on the produce of the land.</p>
          <p>33. From them the Tauri, though at no great distance, <lb/>
            are separated by several kingdoms, among which are the <lb/>
            Arinchi, a most savage tribe, the Sinchi, and the Napæi, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐθρόνη</foreign>, and the furies, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐμενίδες</foreign>.</p>
          <p>34. For they propitiated the gods with human victims, <lb/>
            sacrificing strangers to Diana, whom they call Oreiloche, <lb/>
            and fix the heads of the slain on the walls of their temples, <lb/>
            as perpetual monuments of their deeds.</p>
          <p>35. In this kingdom of the Tauri lies the uninhabited <lb/>
            island of Leuce, which is consecrated to Achilles; and if <lb/>
            any ever visit it, as soon as they have examined the traces <lb/>
            of antiquity, and the temple and offerings dedicated to <lb/>
            the hero, they return the same evening to their ships, as <lb/>
            it is said that no one can pass the night there without <lb/>
            danger to his life.</p>
          <p>36. There is water there, and white birds like king- <lb/>
            fishers, the origin of which, and the battles of the Helle- <lb/>
            spont, we will discuss at a proper time. And there are <lb/>
            some cities in this region of which the most eminent are <lb/>
            Eupatoria, Dandaca, and Theodosia, and several others <lb/>
            which are free from the wickedness of human sacrifices.</p>
          <p>37. Up to this we reckon that one of the extremities of <lb/>
            the arc extends. We will now follow, as order suggests, <lb/>
            the rest of the curve which extends towards the north, <lb/>
            along the left side of the Thracian Bosphorus, just remind- <lb/>
            ing the reader that while the bows of all other nations <lb/>
            bend along the whole of their material, those of the <lb/>
            Scythians and Parthians have a straight rounded line in the <lb/>
            centre, from which they curve their spreading horns so as <lb/>
            to present the figure of the waning moon.</p>
          <p>38. At the very beginning then of this district, where <lb/>
            the Rhipæan mountains end, lie the Arimphæi, a just <lb/>
            people known for their quiet character, whose land is <lb/>
            watered by the rivers Chronius and Bisula; and next to <lb/>
            them are the Massagetæ, the Alani, and the Sargetæ, and <lb/>
            several other tribes of little note, of whom we know <lb/>
            neither the names nor the customs.</p>
          <p>39. Then, a long way off, is the bay Carcinites, and a <note type="footnote">1 The old name was <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Αξεινος</foreign>, inhospitable; turned into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>, <lb/>

            river of the same name, and a grove of Diana, frequented <lb/>
            by many votaries in those countries.</p>
          <p>40. After that we come to the Dnieper (Borysthenes), <lb/>
            which rises in the mountains of the Neuri; a river very <lb/>
            large at its first beginning, and which increases by the <lb/>
            influx of many other streams, till it falls into the sea with <lb/>
            great violence ; on its woody banks is the town of Borys- <lb/>
            thenes, and Cephalonesus, and some altars consecrated to <lb/>
            Alexander the Great and Augustus Cæsar.</p>
          <p>41. Next, at a great distance, is an island inhabited by <lb/>
            the Sindi, a tribe of low-born persons, who upon the over- <lb/>
            throw of their lords and masters in Asia, took possession of <lb/>
            their wives and properties. Below them is a narrow strip of <lb/>
            coast called by the natives the Course of Achilles, having <lb/>
            been made memorable in olden time by the exercises of the <lb/>
            Thessalian chief, and next to that is the city of Tyros, a <lb/>
            colony of the Phœnicians, watered by the river Dniester.</p>
          <p>42. But in the middle of the arc which we have de- <lb/>
            scribed as being of an extended roundness, and which <lb/>
            takes an active traveller fifteen days to traverse, are the <lb/>
            Europæan Alani, the Costoboci, and the countless tribes <lb/>
            of the Scythians, who extend over territories which have <lb/>
            no ascertained limit; a small part of whom live on grain. <lb/>
            But the rest wander over vast deserts, knowing neither <lb/>
            ploughtime nor seedtime ; but living in cold and frost, and <lb/>
            feeding like great beasts. They place their relations, <lb/>
            their homes, and their wretched furniture on waggons <lb/>
            covered with bark, and, whenever they choose, they <lb/>
            migrate without hindrance, driving off these waggons <lb/>
            wherever they like.</p>
          <p>43. When one arrives at another point of the circuit <lb/>
            where there is a harbour, which bounds the figure of the <lb/>
            arc at that extremity, the island Peuce is conspicuous, <lb/>
            inhabited by the Troglodyte, and Peuci, and other inferior <lb/>
            tribes, and we come also to Bistros, formerly a city of <lb/>
            great power, and to Tomi, Apollonia, Anchialos, Odissos, <lb/>
            and many others on the Thracian coast.</p>
          <p>44. But the Danube, rising near Basle on the borders of <lb/>
            the Tyrol, extending over a wider space, and receiving <lb/>
            on his way nearly sixty navigable rivers, pours through <lb/>
            the Scythian territory by seven mouths into the Black <lb/>
            Sea. <pb n="294"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> BK. XXII. CH. VIII. </note> 45. The first mouth (according to the Greek interpreta. <lb/>
            tion of the names) is at the island of Peuce, which we have <lb/>
            mentioned; the second is at Naracustoma, the third at <lb/>
            Calonstoma, the fourth at Pseudostoma. The Boreonstoma <lb/>
            and the Sthenostoma, arc much smaller, and the seventh is <lb/>
            large and black-looking like a bog.</p>
          <p>46. But the whole sea, all around, is full of mists and <lb/>
            shoals, and is sweeter than seas in general, because by the <lb/>
            evaporation of moisture the air is often thick and dense, <lb/>
            and its waters are tempered by the immensity of the rivers <lb/>
            which fall into it; and it is full of shifting shallows, <lb/>
            because the number of the streams which surround it pour <lb/>
            in mud and'lumps of soil.</p>
          <p>47. And it is well known that fish flock in large shoals <lb/>
            to its most remote extremities that. they may spawn and <lb/>
            rear their young more healthfully, in consequence of the <lb/>
            salubrity of the water; while the hollow caverns, which <lb/>
            are very numerous there, protect them from voracious mon- <lb/>
            sters. For nothing of the kind is ever seen in this sea, <lb/>
            except some small dolphins, and they do no harm.</p>
          <p>48. Now the portions of the Black Sea which are <lb/>
            exposed to the north wind are so thoroughly frozen that, <lb/>
            while the rivers, as it is believed, cannot continue their <lb/>
            course beneath the ice, yet neither can the foot of beast or <lb/>
            man proceed firmly over the treacherous and shifting <lb/>
            ground; a fault which is never found in a pure sea, but <lb/>
            only in one of which the waters are mingled with those of <lb/>
            rivers. We have digressed more than we had intended, <lb/>
            so now let us turn back to what remains to be told.</p>
          <p>49. Another circumstance came to raise Julian's present <lb/>
            joy, one which indeed had been long expected, but which <lb/>
            had been deferred by all manner of delays. For intel- <lb/>
            ligence was brought by Agile and Jovius, who was after- <lb/>
            wards quæstor, that the garrison of Aquileia, weary of the <lb/>
            length of the siege, and having heard of the death of Con- <lb/>
            stantius, had opened their gates and come forth, delivering <lb/>
            up the authors of the revolt; and that, after they had been <lb/>
            burnt alive, as has been related, the rest had obtained <lb/>
            pardon for their offences. <pb n="295"/>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. BUT Julian, elated at his prosperity, began to aspire to <lb/>
            greatness beyond what is granted to man: amid continual <lb/>
            dangers he had learnt by experience that propitious <lb/>
            fortune held out to him, thus peacefully governing the <lb/>
            Roman world, a cornucopia as it were of human blessings <lb/>
            and all kinds of glory and success : adding this also to his <lb/>
            former titles of victory, that while he alone held the reins <lb/>
            of empire he was neither disturbed by intestine commo- <lb/>
            tions, nor did any barbarians venture to cross his frontiers, <lb/>
            but all nations, eager at all times to find fault with what is <lb/>
            past, as mischievous and unjust, were with marvellous <lb/>
            unanimity agreed in his praises.</p>
          <p>2. Having therefore arranged with profound delibera- <lb/>
            tion all the matters which were required either by the cir- <lb/>
            cumstances of the state or by the time, and having <lb/>
            encouraged the soldiers by repeated harangues and by <lb/>
            adequate pay to be active in accomplishing all that was to <lb/>
            be done, Julian, being in great favour with all men, set <lb/>
            out for Antioch, leaving Constantinople, which he had <lb/>
            greatly strengthened and enriched; for he had been born <lb/>
            there, and loved and protected it as his native city.</p>
          <p>3. Then crossing the straits, and passing by Chalcedon <lb/>
            and Libyssa, where Hannibal the Carthaginian is buried, <lb/>
            he came to Nicomedia; a city of ancient renown, and so <lb/>
            adorned at the great expense of former emperors, that <lb/>
            from the multitude of its public and private buildings <lb/>
            good judges look on it as a quarter, as it were, of the <lb/>
            eternal city.</p>
          <p>4. When Julian beheld its walls buried in miserable <lb/>
            ashes, he showed the anguish of his mind. by silent tears, <lb/>
            and went slowly on towards the palace; especially lament- <lb/>
            in,; its misfortunes, because the senators who came out to <lb/>
            meet him were in poor-looking condition, as well as the <lb/>
            people who had formerly been most prosperous; some of <lb/>
            them he recognized having been brought up there by the <lb/>
            bishop Eusebius, of whom he was a distant relation.</p>
          <p>5. Having here made many arrangements for repairing <lb/>
            the damage done by an earthquake, he passed through <lb/>
            Nisæa to the frontier of Gallogræcia, and then turning to <pb n="296"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXII. CH. IX. </note> <lb/>
            the right, he went to Pessinus, to see the ancient temple of <lb/>
            Cybele; from which town in the second Punic war, in ac- <lb/>
            cordance with the warning of the Sibylline verses, the image <lb/>
            of the goddess was removed to Rome by Scipio Nasica.</p>
          <p>6. Of its arrival in Italy, with many other matters con- <lb/>
            nected with it, we made mention in recording the acts of <lb/>
            the emperor Commodus; but as to what the reason was <lb/>
            for the town receiving this name writers differ.</p>
          <p>7. For some have declared that the city was so called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεσει̃ν</foreign>, from falling; inventing a tale that the statue <lb/>
            fell from heaven; others affirm that Ilus, the son of Tros, <lb/>
            king of Dardania, gave the place this name, which Theo- <lb/>
            pompus says it received not from this, but from Midas, <lb/>
            formerly a most powerful king of Phrygia.</p>
          <p>8. Accordingly, having paid his worship to the goddess, <lb/>
            and propitiated her with sacrifices and prayers, he returned <lb/>
            to Ancyra; and as he was proceeding on this way from <lb/>
            thence he was disturbed by a multitude; some violently <lb/>
            demanding the restoration of what had been taken from <lb/>
            them, others complaining that they had been unjustly <lb/>
            attached to different courts; some, regardless of the risk <lb/>
            they ran, tried to enrage him against their adversaries, by <lb/>
            charging them with treason.</p>
          <p>9. But he, a sterner judge than Cassius or Lycurgus, <lb/>
            weighed the charges with justice, and gave each his due ; <lb/>
            never being swayed from the truth, but very severe <lb/>
            to calumniators, whom he hated, because he himself, while <lb/>
            still a private individual and of low estate, had often <lb/>
            experienced the petulant frenzy of many in a way which <lb/>
            placed him in great danger.</p>
          <p>10. And though there are many other examples of his <lb/>
            patience in such matters, it will suffice to relate one here. <lb/>
            A certain man laid an information against his enemy, with <lb/>
            whom he had a most bitter quarrel, affirming that he had <lb/>
            been guilty of outrage and sedition; and when the emperor <lb/>
            concealed his own opinion, he renewed the charge for <lb/>
            several days, and when at last he was asked who the man <lb/>
            was whom he was accusing, he replied, a rich citizen. <lb/>
            When the emperor heard this he smiled and said, “ What <lb/>
            proof led you to the discovery of this conduct of his ?” He <lb/>
            replied, " The man has had made for himself a purple silk <lb/>
            robe." <pb n="297"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> </p>
          <p>11. And on this, being ordered to depart in silence, and <lb/>
            though unpunished as a low fellow who was accusing one <lb/>
            of his own class of too difficult an enterprise to be believed,. <lb/>
            he nevertheless insisted on the truth of the accusation, till <lb/>
            Julian, being wearied by his pertinacity, said to the <lb/>
            treasurer, whom he saw near him, “ Bid them give this <lb/>
            dangerous chatterer some purple shoes to take to his <lb/>
            enemy, who, as he gives me to understood, has made him- <lb/>
            self a robe of that colour; that so he may know how little <lb/>
            a worthless piece of cloth can help a man, without the <lb/>
            greatest strength.”</p>
          <p>12. But as such conduct as this is praiseworthy and <lb/>
            deserving the imitation of virtuous rulers, so it was a sad <lb/>
            thing and deserving of censure, that in his time it was <lb/>
            very hard for any one who was accused by any magistrate <lb/>
            to obtain justice, however fortified he might be- by pri- <lb/>
            vileges, or the number of his campaigns, or by a host of <lb/>
            friends. So that many persons being alarmed bought off <lb/>
            all such annoyances by secret bribes.</p>
          <p>13. Therefore, when after a long journey he had reached <lb/>
            Pylæ, a place on the frontiers of Cappadocia and Cilicia, <lb/>
            he received the ruler of the province, Celsus, already <lb/>
            known to him by his Attic studies, with a kiss, and taking <lb/>
            him up into his chariot conducted him with him into <lb/>
            Tarsus.</p>
          <p>14. From hence, desiring to see Antioch, the splendid <lb/>
            metropolis of the East, he went thither by the usual stages, <lb/>
            and when he came near the city he was received as if he <lb/>
            had been a god, with public prayers, so that he marvelled <lb/>
            at the voices of the vast multitude, who cried out that he <lb/>
            had come to shine like a star on the Eastern regions.</p>
          <p>15. It happened that just at that time, the annual period <lb/>
            for the celebration of the festival of Adonis, according to <lb/>
            the old fashion, came round ; the story being, as the poets <lb/>
            relate, that Adonis had been loved by Venus, and slain by <lb/>
            a boar's tusk, which is an emblem of the fruits of the <lb/>
            earth being cut down in their prime. And it appeared a <lb/>
            sad thing that when the emperor was now for the first <lb/>
            time making his entrance into a splendid city, the abode <lb/>
            of princes, wailing lamentations and sounds of mourning <lb/>
            should be heard in every direction.</p>
          <p>16. And here was seen a proof of his gentle disposition, <pb n="298"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXII. CH. X. </note> <lb/>
            shown indeed in a trifling, but very remarkable instance. <lb/>
            He had long hated a man named Thalassius, an officer in <lb/>
            one of the law courts, as having been concerned in plots <lb/>
            against his brother Gallus. He prohibited him from pay- <lb/>
            in- his salutations to him and presenting himself among the <lb/>
            men of rank ; which encouraged his enemies against whom <lb/>
            he had actions in the courts of law, the next day, when a <lb/>
            great crowd was collected in the presence of the emperor, <lb/>
            to cry out, " Thalassius, the enemy of your clemency, has <lb/>
            violently deprived us of our rights and Julian, thinking <lb/>
            that this was an opportunity for crushing him, replied, <lb/>
            “ I acknowledge that I am justly offended with the man <lb/>
            whom you mention, and so you ought to keep silence till <lb/>
            he has made satisfaction to me who am his principal <lb/>
            enemy." And he commanded the prefect who was sitting <lb/>
            by him' not to hear their business till he himself was <lb/>
            recognized by Thalassius, which happened soon afterwards.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE wintering at Antioch, according to his wish, he <lb/>
            yielded to none of the allurements of pleasure in which <lb/>
            all Syria abounds; but under pretence of repose, he <lb/>
            devoted himself to judicial affairs, which are not less diffi- <lb/>
            cult than those of war, and in which he expended exceed- <lb/>
            ing care, showing exquisite willingness to receive informa- <lb/>
            tion, and carefully balancing how to assign to every one <lb/>
            his due. And by his just sentence the wicked were <lb/>
            chastised with moderate punishments, and the innocent <lb/>
            were maintained in the undiminished possession of their <lb/>
            fortunes.</p>
          <p>2. And although in the discussion of causes he was <lb/>
            often unreasonable, asking at unsuitable times to what <lb/>
            religion each of the litigants adhered, yet none of his <lb/>
            decisions were found inconsistent with equity, nor could <lb/>
            lie ever be accused, either from considerations of religion <lb/>
            or of anything else, of having deviated from the strict <lb/>
            path of justice.</p>
          <p>3. For that is a desirable and right judgment which pro- <lb/>
            ceeds from repeated examinations of what is just and un- <lb/>
            just. Julian feared anything which might lead him away <lb/>
            from such, as a sailor fears dangerous rocks; and he was <pb n="299"/>
            <note type="margin"> A..D. 362.] </note> <lb/>
            the better able to attain to correctness, because, knowing <lb/>
            the levity of his own impetuous disposition, he used to <lb/>
            permit the prefects and his chosen counsellors to check, <lb/>
            by timely admonition, his own impulses when they were <lb/>
            inclined to stray; and he continually showed that he was <lb/>
            vexed if he committed errors, and was desirous of being <lb/>
            corrected.</p>
          <p>4. And when the advocates in some actions were once <lb/>
            applauding him greatly as one who had attained to per- <lb/>
            fect wisdom, he is said to have exclaimed with much <lb/>
            emotion, " I was glad and made it my pride to be praised <lb/>
            by those whom I knew to be competent to find fault with <lb/>
            me, if I had said or done anything wrong."</p>
          <p>5. But it will be sufficient out of the many instances of <lb/>
            his clemency which he afforded in judging causes to men- <lb/>
            tion this one, which is not irrelevant to our subject or in- <lb/>
            significant. A certain woman being brought before the <lb/>
            court, saw that her adversary, formerly one of the officers of <lb/>
            the palace, but who had been displaced, was now, contrary <lb/>
            to her expectation, re-established and girt in his official <lb/>
            dress, complained in a violent manner of this circum- <lb/>
            stance; and the emperor replied, " Proceed, 0 woman, if <lb/>
            you think that you have been injured in any respect; he <lb/>
            is girt as you see in order to go more quickly through the <lb/>
            mire; your cause will not suffer from it."</p>
          <p>6. And these and similar actions led to the belief, as he <lb/>
            was constantly saying, that that ancient justice which <lb/>
            Aratus states to have fled to heaven in disgust at the vices <lb/>
            of mankind, had returned to earth; only that sometimes <lb/>
            he acted according to his own will rather than according <lb/>
            to law, making mistakes which somewhat darkened the <lb/>
            glorious course of his renown.</p>
          <p>7. After many trials he corrected numerous abuses in <lb/>
            the laws, cutting away circuitous proceedings, and mak- <lb/>
            ing the enactments show more plainly what they com- <lb/>
            manded or forbade. But his forbidding masters of rhetoric <lb/>
            and grammar to instruct Christians was a cruel action, and <lb/>
            one deserving to be buried in everlasting silence. <pb n="300"/>

          <p>§ 1. AT this time, Gaudentius the secretary, whom I have <lb/>
            mentioned above as having been sent by Constantius to <lb/>
            oppose Julian in Africa, and a man of the name of Julian, <lb/>
            who had been a deputy governor, and who was an intem- <lb/>
            perate partisan of the late emperor, were brought back as <lb/>
            prisoners, and put to death.</p>
          <p>2. And at the same time, Artemius, who had been Duke <lb/>
            of Egypt, and against whom the citizens of Alexandria <lb/>
            brought a great mass of heavy accusations, was also put to <lb/>
            death, and the son of Marcellus too, who had been com- <lb/>
            mander both of the infantry and of the cavalry, was pub- <lb/>
            licly executed as one who had aspired to the empire by <lb/>
            force of arms. Romanus, too, and Vincentius, the tribunes <lb/>
            of the first and second battalion of the Scutarii, being <lb/>
            convicted of aiming at things beyond their due, were <lb/>
            banished.</p>
          <p>3. And after a short time, when the death of Artemius <lb/>
            was known, the citizens of Alexandria who had feared his <lb/>
            return, lest, as he threatened, he should come back among <lb/>
            them with power, and avenge himself on many of them for <lb/>
            the offences which he had received, now turned all their <lb/>
            anger against George, the bishop, by whom they had, so <lb/>
            to say, been often attacked with poisonous bites.</p>
          <p>4. George having been born in a fuller's shop, as was <lb/>
            reported, in Epiphania, a town of Cilicia, and having caused <lb/>
            the ruin of many individuals, was, contrary both to his own <lb/>
            interest and to that of the commonwealth, ordained bishop <lb/>
            of Alexandria, a city which from its own impulses, and <lb/>
            without any special cause, is continually agitated by <lb/>
            seditious tumults, as the oracles also show.</p>
          <p>5. Men of this irritable disposition were readily in- <lb/>
            censed by George, who accused numbers to the willing <lb/>
            ears of Constantius, as being opposed to his authority ; and, <lb/>
            forgetting his profession, which ought to give no counsel <lb/>
            but what is just and merciful, he adopted all the wicked <lb/>
            acts of informers.</p>
          <p>6. And among other things he was reported to have <lb/>
            maliciously informed Constantius that in that city all the <lb/>
            edifices which had been built by Alexander, its founder, <pb n="301"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> <lb/>
            at vast public expense, ought properly to be a source of <lb/>
            emolument to the treasury.</p>
          <p>7. To these wicked suggestions he added this also, which <lb/>
            soon afterwards led to his destruction. As he was return- <lb/>
            ing from court, and passing by the superb temple of the <lb/>
            Genius, escorted by a large train, as was his custom, he <lb/>
            turned his eyes towards the temple, and said, " How long <lb/>
            shall this sepulchre stand ?” And the multitude, hearing <lb/>
            this, was thunderstruck, and fearing that he would seek <lb/>
            to destroy this also, laboured to the utmost of their power <lb/>
            to effect his ruin by secret plots.</p>
          <p>8. When suddenly there came the joyful news that Arte- <lb/>
            mius was dead; on which all the populace, triumphing with <lb/>
            unexpected joy, gnashed their teeth, and with horrid out- <lb/>
            cries set upon George, trampling upon him and kicking <lb/>
            him, and tearing him to pieces with every kind of muti- <lb/>
            lation.</p>
          <p>9. With him also, Dracontius, the master of the mint, <lb/>
            and a count named Diodorus, were put to death, and <lb/>
            dragged with ropes tied to their legs through the street; <lb/>
            the one because he had overthrown the altar lately set up <lb/>
            in the mint, of which he was governor; the other because <lb/>
            while superintending the building of a church, he insolently <lb/>
            cut off the curls of the boys, thinking thus to affect the <lb/>
            worship of the gods.</p>
          <p>10. But the savage populace were not content with this ; <lb/>
            but having mutilated their bodies, put them on camels <lb/>
            and conveyed them to the shore, where they burnt them <lb/>
            and threw the ashes into the sea; fearing, as they ex- <lb/>
            claimed, lest their remains should be collectedand a temple <lb/>
            raised over them, as the relics of men who. being urged <lb/>
            to forsake their religion, had preferred to endure torturing <lb/>
            punishments even to a glorious death, and so, by keeping <lb/>
            their faith inviolate, earning the appellation of martyrs. <lb/>
            In truth the wretched men who underwent such cruel <lb/>
            punishment might have been protected by the aid of the <lb/>
            Christians, if both parties had not been equally exasperated <lb/>
            by hatred of George.</p>
          <p>11. When this event reached the emperor's ears, he <lb/>
            roused himself to avenge the impious deed; but when <lb/>
            about to inflict the extremity of punishment on the guilty, <lb/>
            he was appeased by the intercession of those about him, <pb n="302"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXII. CH XII </note> <lb/>
            and contented himself with issuing an edict in which he <lb/>
            condemned the crime which had been committed in stern <lb/>
            language, and threatening all with the severest vengeance <lb/>
            if anything should be attempted for the future contrary to <lb/>
            the principles of justice and law.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. IN the mean time, while preparing the expedition against <lb/>
            the Persians, which he had long been meditating with all <lb/>
            the vigour of his mind, he resolved firmly to avenge their <lb/>
            past victories; hearing from others, and knowing by his <lb/>
            own experience, that for nearly sixty years that most fero- <lb/>
            cious people had stamped upon the East bloody records of <lb/>
            massacre and ravage, many of our armies having often been <lb/>
            entirely destroyed by them.</p>
          <p>2..And he was inflamed with a desire for the war on two <lb/>
            grounds : first, because he was weary of peace, and dream- <lb/>
            ing always of trumpets and battles ; and secondly, because, <lb/>
            having been in his youth exposed to the attacks of savage <lb/>
            nations, the wishes of whose kings and princes were already <lb/>
            turning against us, and whom. as was believed, it would be <lb/>
            easier to conquer than to reduce to the condition of sup- <lb/>
            pliants, he was eager to add to his other glories the sur- <lb/>
            name of Parthicus.</p>
          <p>3. But when his inactive and malicious detractors saw <lb/>
            that these preparations were being pressed forward with <lb/>
            great speed and energy, they cried out that it was an un- <lb/>
            worthy and shameful thing for such unseasonable troubles <lb/>
            to be caused by the change of a single prince, and laboured <lb/>
            with all their zeal to postpone the campaign; and they <lb/>
            were in the habit of saying, in the presence of those whom <lb/>
            they thought likely to report their words to the emperor, <lb/>
            that, unless he conducted himself with moderation during <lb/>
            his excess of prosperity, he, like an over-luxuriant crop, <lb/>
            would soon be destroyed by his own fertility.</p>
          <p>4. And they were continually propagating sayings of <lb/>
            this kind, barking in vain at the inflexible prince with <lb/>
            secret attacks, as the Pygmies or the clown Thiodamas of <lb/>
            Lindus assailed Hercules.</p>
          <p>5. But he, as more magnanimous, allowed no delay to <lb/>
            take place, nor any diminution in the magnitude of Lis <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> <lb/>
            expedition, but devoted the most energetic care to prepare <lb/>
            everything suitable for such an enterprise.</p>
          <p>6. He offered repeated victims on the altars of the gods ; <lb/>
            sometimes sacrificing one hundred bulls, and countless <lb/>
            flocks of animals of all kinds, and white birds, which he <lb/>
            sought for everywhere by land and sea ; so that every day <lb/>
            individual soldiers who had stuffed themselves like boors <lb/>
            with too much meat, or who were senseless from the eager- <lb/>
            ness with which they had drunk, were placed on the <lb/>
            shoulders of passers-by, and carried to their homes through <lb/>
            the streets from the public temples where they had <lb/>
            indulged in feasts which deserved punishment rather than <lb/>
            indulgence. Especially the Petulantes and the Celtic <lb/>
            legion, whose audacity at this time had increased to a mar- <lb/>
            vellous degree.</p>
          <p>7. And rites and ceremonies were marvellously multi- <lb/>
            plied with a vastness of expense hitherto unprecedented; <lb/>
            and, as it was now allowed without hindrance, every one <lb/>
            professed himself skilful in divination, and all, whether <lb/>
            illiterate or learned, without any limit or any prescribed <lb/>
            order, were permitted to consult the oracles, and to inspect <lb/>
            the entrails of victims; and omens from the voice of birds, <lb/>
            and every kind of sign of the future, was sought for with an <lb/>
            ostentatious variety of proceeding.</p>
          <p>8. And while this was going on, as if it were a time of <lb/>
            profound peace, Julian, being curious in all such branches <lb/>
            of learning, entered on a new path of divination. He pro- <lb/>
            posed to reopen the prophetic springs of the fountain of <lb/>
            Castalia, which Hadrian was said to have blocked up with <lb/>
            a huge mass of stones, fearing lest, as he himself had <lb/>
            attained the sovereignty through obedience to the pre- <lb/>
            dictions of these waters, others might learn a similar <lb/>
            lesson ; and Julian immediately ordered the bodies which <lb/>
            had been buried around it to be removed with the same <lb/>
            ceremonies as those with which the Athenians had purified <lb/>
            the island of Delos.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. ABOUT the same time, on the 22nd of October, the <lb/>
            splendid temple of Apollo, at Daphne, which that furious <lb/>
            and cruel king Antiochus Epiphanes had built with the <pb n="304"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXII. CH. XIV. </note> <lb/>
            statue of the god, equal in size to that of Olympian Jupiter, <lb/>
            was suddenly burnt down.</p>
          <p>2. This terrible accident inflamed the emperor with <lb/>
            such anger, that he instantly ordered investigations of <lb/>
            unprecedented severity to be instituted, and the chief <lb/>
            church of Antioch to be shut up. For he suspected that <lb/>
            the Christians had done it out of envy, not being able to <lb/>
            bear the sight of the magnificent colonnade which sur- <lb/>
            rounded the temple.</p>
          <p>3. But it was reported, though the rumour was most <lb/>
            vague, that the temple had been burnt by means of Ascle- <lb/>
            piades the philosopher, of whom we have made mention <lb/>
            while relating the actions of Magnentius. He is said to <lb/>
            have come to the suburb in which the temple stood to pay <lb/>
            a visit to Julian, and being accustomed to carry with him <lb/>
            wherever he went a small silver statue of the Heavenly <lb/>
            Venus, he placed it at the feet of the image of Apollo, and <lb/>
            then, according to his custom, having lighted wax tapers <lb/>
            in front of it, he went away. At midnight, when no one <lb/>
            was there to give any assistance, some sparks flying about <lb/>
            stuck to the aged timbers; and from that dry fuel a fire <lb/>
            was kindled which burnt everything it could reach, how- <lb/>
            ever separated from it by the height of the building.</p>
          <p>4. The same year also, just as winter was approaching, <lb/>
            there was a fearful scarcity of water, so that some rivers <lb/>
            were dried up, and fountains too, which had hitherto <lb/>
            abounded with copious springs. But afterwards they all <lb/>
            were fully restored.</p>
          <p>. 5. And on the second of December, as evening was coming <lb/>
            on, all that remained of Nicomedia was destroyed by an <lb/>
            earthquake, and no small portion of Nicaea.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XIV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THESE events caused great concern to the emperor; <lb/>
            but still he did not neglect other affairs of urgency, till <lb/>
            the time of entering on his intended campaign should arrive. <lb/>
            But in the midst of his. important and serious concerns, <lb/>
            it appeared superfluous that, without any plausible reason, <lb/>
            and out of a mere thirst for popularity, he took measures <lb/>
            for producing cheapness ; a thing which often proves con- <lb/>
            trary to expectation and produces scarcity and famine. <pb n="305"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> 2. And when the magistrates of Antioch plainly proved <lb/>
            to him that his orders could not be executed, he would not <lb/>
            depart from his purpose, being as obstinate as his brother <lb/>
            Gallus, but not bloodthirsty. On which account, becoming <lb/>
            furious against them, as slanderous and obstinate, he com- <lb/>
            posed a volume of invectives which he called " The <lb/>
            Antiochean," or “ Misopogon," enumerating in a bitter <lb/>
            spirit all the vices of the city, and adding others be- <lb/>
            yond the truth ; and when on this he found that many <lb/>
            witticisms were uttered at his expense, he felt compelled <lb/>
            to conceal his feelings for a time; but was full of internal <lb/>
            rage.</p>
          <p>3. For he was ridiculed as a Cercops;l again, as a <lb/>
            dwarf spreading out his narrow shoulders, wearing a beard <lb/>
            like that of a goat, and taking huge strides, as if he had <lb/>
            been the brother of Otus and Ephialtes,2 whose height <lb/>
            Horace speaks of as enormous. At another time he was <lb/>
            " the victim-killer," instead of the worshipper, in allusion <lb/>
            to the numbers of his victims; and this piece of ridicule <lb/>
            was seasonable and deserved, as once out of ostentation <lb/>
            he was fond of carrying the sacred vessels before the priests, <lb/>
            attended by a train of girls. And although these and <lb/>
            similar jests made him very indignant, he nevertheless <lb/>
            kept silence, and concealed his emotions, and continued to <lb/>
            celebrate the solemn festivals.</p>
          <p>4. At last, on the day appointed for the holiday, he <lb/>
            ascended Mount Casius, a mountain covered with trees, <lb/>
            very lofty, and of a round form; from which at the second <lb/>
            crowing of the cock8 we can see the sun rise. And while <lb/>
            he was sacrificing to Jupiter, on a sudden he perceived <lb/>
            some one lying on the ground, who. with the voice of a <lb/>
            suppliant, implored pardon and his life; and when Julian <lb/>
            asked him who he was, he replied, that he was Theodotus, <lb/>
            formerly the chief magistrate of Hierapolis, who, when <lb/>
            Constantius quitted that city, had escorted him with other <lb/>
            men of rank on his way : basely flattering him as sure to <lb/>
            be victorious; and he had entreated him with feigned <lb/>
            tears and lamentations to send them the head of Julian as <note type="footnote">1 A people living in one of the islands near Sicily, and changed by <lb/>
            Jupiter as related, Ov. Met. xiv., into monkeys. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Two of the chief giants, Horn. Od. xi. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 A time spoken of by Pliny as before the fourth watch. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>

            that of an ungrateful rebel, in the same way as he recol- <lb/>
            lected the head of Magnentius had been exhibited.</p>
          <p>5. When Julian heard this, he said, " I have heard of <lb/>
            this before, from the relation of several persons. But go <lb/>
            thou home in security, being relieved of all fear by the <lb/>
            mercy of the emperor, who, like a wise man. has resolved <lb/>
            to diminish the number of his enemies, and is eager to in- <lb/>
            crease that of his friends."</p>
          <p>6. When he departed, having fully accomplished the <lb/>
            sacrifices, letters were brought to him from the governor <lb/>
            of Egypt, who informed him that after a long time he had <lb/>
            succeeded in finding a bull Apis, which he had been seek- <lb/>
            ing with great labour, a circumstance which, in the opinion <lb/>
            of the inhabitants of those regions, indicates prosperity, <lb/>
            abundant crops, and several other kinds of good fortune.</p>
          <p>7. On this subject it seems desirable to say a few words. <lb/>
            Among the animals which have been consecrated by the <lb/>
            reverence of the ancients, Mnevis and Apis are the most <lb/>
            eminent. Mnevis, concerning whom there is nothing re- <lb/>
            markable related, is consecrated to the sun, Apis to the <lb/>
            moon. But the bull Apis is distinguished by several <lb/>
            natural marks ; and especially by a crescent-shaped figure, <lb/>
            like that of a new moon, on his right side. After living <lb/>
            his appointed time, he is drowned in the sacred fountain <lb/>
            (for he is not allowed to live beyond the time fixed by the <lb/>
            sacred authority of their mystical books : nor is a cow <lb/>
            brought to him more than once a year, who also must be <lb/>
            distinguished with particular marks); then another is <lb/>
            sought amid great public mourning; and if one can be <lb/>
            found distinguished by all the required marks, he is led to <lb/>
            Memphis, a city of great renown, and especially celebrated <lb/>
            for the patronage of the god Æsculapius.</p>
          <p>8. And after he has been led into the city by one hundred <lb/>
            priests, and conducted into a chamber, he is looked upon as <lb/>
            consecrated, and is said to point out by evident means the <lb/>
            signs of future events. Some also of those who come to <lb/>
            him he repels by unfavourable signs; as it is reported he <lb/>
            formally rejected Cæsar Germanicus when he offered him <lb/>
            food; thus portending what shortly happened. <pb n="307"/>

          <p>§ 1. LET us then, since the occasion seems to require it, <lb/>
            touch briefly on the affairs of Egypt, of which we have <lb/>
            already made some mention in our account of the emperors <lb/>
            Hadrian and Severus, where we related several things which <lb/>
            we had seen.'</p>
          <p>2. The Egyptian is the most ancient of all nations, <lb/>
            except indeed that its superior antiquity is contested by <lb/>
            the Scythians : their country is bounded on the south2 by <lb/>
            the greater Syrtes, Cape Ras, and Cape Borion,' the <lb/>
            Garamantes, and other nations; on the east, by Elephan- <lb/>
            line, and Meroe, cities of the Ethiopians, the Catadupi, <lb/>
            the Red Sea, and the Scenite Arabs, whom we now call <lb/>
            Saracens. On the north it joins a vast track of land, <lb/>
            where Asia and the Syrian provinces begin ; on the west <lb/>
            it is bounded by the Sea of Issus, which some call the Par- <lb/>
            thenian Sea.</p>
          <p>3. We will also say a few words concerning that most <lb/>
            useful Of all rivers, the Nile, which Homer calls the <lb/>
            Ægyptus; and after that we will enumerate other things <lb/>
            worthy of admiration in these regions.</p>
          <p>4. The sources of the Nile, in my opinion, will be as <lb/>
            unknown to posterity as they are now. But since poets, <lb/>
            who relate fully, and geographers who differ from one <lb/>
            another, give various accounts of this hidden matter, I will <lb/>
            in a few words set forth such of their opinions as seem <lb/>
            to me to border on the truth.</p>
          <p>5. Some natural philosophers affirm that in the districts <lb/>
            beneath the North Pole, when the severe winters bind up <lb/>
            everything, the vast masses of snow congeal; and after- <lb/>
            wards, melted by the warmth of the summer, they make <lb/>
            the clouds heavy with liquid moisture, which, being driven <lb/>
            to the south by the Etesian winds, and dissolved into rain <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1 These books are lost. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We must remark here Ammianus's complete ignorance of compara- <lb/>
            tive geography and the bearings of the different countries of which he <lb/>
            speaks. The Syrtes and Cape Ras are due west, not south of Egypt. <lb/>
            The Ethiopians and Catadupi are on the north ; while the Arabs, whom <lb/>
            he places in the same line, are on the south-east. The Sea of Issus, on <lb/>
            the Levant, which he places on the west, is on the north. </note> <pb n="308"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXII. CH. XV </note> <lb/>
            by the heat of the sun, furnish abundant increase to the <lb/>
            Nile.</p>
          <p>6. Some, again, assert that the inundations of the river <lb/>
            at fixed times are caused by the rains in Ethiopia, which <lb/>
            fall in great abundance in that country during the hot <lb/>
            season; but both these theories seem inconsistent with the <lb/>
            truth-for rain never falls in Ethiopia, or at least only at <lb/>
            rare intervals.</p>
          <p>7. A more common opinion is, that during the continu- <lb/>
            ance of the wind from the north, called the Precursor, and <lb/>
            of the Etesian gales, which last forty-five days without <lb/>
            interruption, they drive back the stream and check its <lb/>
            speed, so that it becomes swollen with its waves thus dammed <lb/>
            back; then, when the wind changes, the force of the breeze <lb/>
            drives the waters to and fro, and the river growing rapidly <lb/>
            greater, its perennial sources driving it forward, it rises as <lb/>
            it advances, and covers everything, spreading over the <lb/>
            level plains till it resembles the sea.</p>
          <p>8. But King Juba, relying on the text of the Carthaginian <lb/>
            books, affirms that the river rises in a mountain situated <lb/>
            in Mauritania, which looks on the Atlantic Ocean, and he <lb/>
            says, too, that this is proved by the fact that fishes, and <lb/>
            herbs, and animals resembling those of the Nile are found <lb/>
            in the marshes where the river rises.</p>
          <p>9. But the Nile, passing through the districts of Ethiopia, <lb/>
            and many different countries which give it their own <lb/>
            names, swells its fertilizing stream till it comes to the <lb/>
            cataracts. These are abrupt rocks, from which in its pre- <lb/>
            cipitous course it falls with such a crash, that the Ati, <lb/>
            who used to live in that district, having lost their hearing <lb/>
            from the incessant roar, were compelled to migrate to a <lb/>
            more quiet region.</p>
          <p>10. Then proceeding more gently, and receiving no <lb/>
            accession of waters in Egypt, it falls into the sea through <lb/>
            seven mouths, each of which is as serviceable as, and re- <lb/>
            sembles, a separate river. And besides the several streams <lb/>
            which are derived from its channel, and which fall with <lb/>
            others like themselves, there are seven navigable with large <lb/>
            waves; named by the ancients the Heracleotic, the Seb- <lb/>
            ennitic, the Bolbitic, the Phatnitic, the Mendesian, the <lb/>
            Tanitic, and the Pelusian mouths.</p>
          <p>11. This river, rising as I have said, is driven on from <pb n="309"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> <lb/>
            the marshes to the cataracts, and forms several islands: <lb/>
            some of which are said to be of such extent that the stream <lb/>
            is three days in passing them.</p>
          <p>12. Among these are two of especial celebrity, Meroe and <lb/>
            Delta. The latter derives its name from its triangular <lb/>
            form like the Greek letter; but when the sun begins to <lb/>
            pass through the sign of Cancer, the river keeps increasing <lb/>
            till it passes into Libra; and then, after flowing at a great <lb/>
            height for one hundred days, it falls again, and its waters <lb/>
            being diminished it exhibits, in a state fit for riding on, <lb/>
            fields which just before could only be passed over in boats.</p>
          <p>13. If the inundation be too abundant it is mischievous, <lb/>
            just as it is unproductive if it be too sparing; for if the <lb/>
            flood be excessive, it keeps the ground wet too long, <lb/>
            and so delays cultivation; while if it be deficient, it <lb/>
            threatens the land with barrenness. No landowner wishes <lb/>
            it to rise more than sixteen cubits. If the flood be mo- <lb/>
            derate, then the seed sown in favourable ground sometimes <lb/>
            returns seventy fold. The Nile, too, is the only river <lb/>
            which does not cause a breeze.</p>
          <p>14. Egypt also produces many animals both terrestrial <lb/>
            and aquatic, and some which live both on the earth and in <lb/>
            the water, and are therefore called amphibious. In the <lb/>
            dry districts antelopes and buffaloes are found, and sphinxes, <lb/>
            animals of an absurd-looking deformity, and other monsters <lb/>
            which it is not worth while to enumerate.</p>
          <p>15. Of the terrestrial animals, the crocodile is abundant <lb/>
            in every part of the country. This is a most destructive <lb/>
            quadruped, accustomed to both elements, haying no tongue, <lb/>
            and moving only the upper jaw, with teeth like a comb, <lb/>
            which obstinately fasten into everything he can reach. <lb/>
            He propagates his species by eggs like those of a goose. ,</p>
          <p>16. And as he is armed with claws, if he had only thumbs <lb/>
            his enormous strength would suffice'to upset large vessels, <lb/>
            for he is sometimes ten cubits long. At night he sleeps <lb/>
            under water; in the day he feeds in the fields, trusting to <lb/>
            the'stoutness of his skin, which is so thick that missiles <lb/>
            from military engines will scarcely pierce the mail of his <lb/>
            back.</p>
          <p>17. Savage as these monsters are at all other times, yet <lb/>
            as if they had concluded an armistice, they are always <lb/>
            quiet, laying aside all their ferocity, during the seven da)f. <pb n="310"/>
            <note type="margin"> <unclear/>[BK. XXII. CH. XV </note> <lb/>
            of festival on which the priests at Mempnis celebrate the <lb/>
            birthday of Apis.</p>
          <p>18. Besides those which die accidentally, some are killed <lb/>
            by wounds which they receive in their bellies from the <lb/>
            dorsal fins of some fish resembling dolphins, which this <lb/>
            river also produces.</p>
          <p>19. Some also are killed by means of a little bird called <lb/>
            the trochilus, which, while seeking for some picking of <lb/>
            small food, and flying gently about the beast while asleep, <lb/>
            tickles its cheeks till it comes to the neighbourhood of its <lb/>
            throat. And when the hydrus, which is a kind of ich <lb/>
            neumon, perceives this, it penetrates into its mouth, which <lb/>
            the bird has caused to open, and descends into its sto- <lb/>
            mach, where it devours its entrails, and then comes forth <lb/>
            again.</p>
          <p>20. But the crocodile, though a bold beast towards those <lb/>
            who flee, is very timid when it finds a brave enemy. It <lb/>
            has a most acute sight, and for the four months of winter <lb/>
            is said to do without food.</p>
          <p>21. The hippopotamus, also, is produced in this country; <lb/>
            the most sagacious of all animals destitute of reason. He <lb/>
            is like a horse, with cloven hoofs, and a short tail. Of his <lb/>
            sagacity it will be sufficient to produce two instances.</p>
          <p>22. The animal makes his lair among dense beds of reeds <lb/>
            of great height, and while keeping quiet watches vigilantly <lb/>
            for every opportunity of sallying out to feed on the crops. <lb/>
            And when he has gorged himself, and is ready to return, he <lb/>
            walks backwards, and makes many tracks, to prevent any <lb/>
            enemies from following the straight road and so finding <lb/>
            and easily killing him.</p>
          <p>23. Again, when he feels lazy from having his stomach <lb/>
            swollen by excessive eating, it rolls its thighs and legs on <lb/>
            freshly-cut reeds, in order that the blood which is dis- <lb/>
            charged through the wounds thus made may relieve his <lb/>
            fat. And then he smears his wounded flesh with clay till <lb/>
            the wounds get scarred over.</p>
          <p>24. This monster was very rare till it was first exhibited <lb/>
            to the Roman people in the ædileship of Scaurus, the <lb/>
            father of that Scaurus whom Cicero defended, when he <lb/>
            charged the Sardinians to cherish the same opinion as the <lb/>
            rest of the world of the authority of that noble family. <lb/>
            Since that time, at different periods, many specimens have <pb n="311"/>
             <note type="margin">A.D. 362.] </note> <lb/>
            been brought to Rome, and now they are not to be found <lb/>
            in Egypt, having been driven, according to the conjecture <lb/>
            of the inhabitants, up to the Blemmyæ1 by being inces- <lb/>
            santly pursued by the people.</p>
          <p>25. Among the birds of Egypt, the variety of which is <lb/>
            countless, is the ibis, a sacred and amiable bird, also <lb/>
            valuable, because by heaping up the eggs of serpents in <lb/>
            its -nest for food it causes these fatal pests to diminish.</p>
          <p>26. They also sometimes encounter flocks of winged <lb/>
            snakes, which come laden with poison from the marshes of <lb/>
            Arabia. These, before they can quit their own region, <lb/>
            they overcome in the air, and then devour them. This <lb/>
            bird, we are told, produces its young through its mouth.</p>
          <p>27. Egypt also produces innumerable quantities of <lb/>
            serpents, destructive beyond all other creatures. Basilisks, <lb/>
            amphisbænas,2 scytalæ, acontiæ, dipsades, vipers, and many <lb/>
            others. The asp is the largest and most beautiful of all; <lb/>
            but that never, of its own accord, quits the Nile.</p>
          <p>28. There are also in this country many things exceed- <lb/>
            ingly worthy of observation, of which it is a good time now <lb/>
            to mention a few. Everywhere there are temples of great <lb/>
            size. There are seven marvellous pyramids, the difficulty <lb/>
            of building which, and the length of time consumed in the <lb/>
            work, are recorded by Herodotus. They exceed in height <lb/>
            anything ever constructed by human labour, being towers <lb/>
            of vast width at the bottom and ending in sharp points.</p>
          <p>29. And their shape received this name from the geo- <lb/>
            'metricians because they rise in a cone like fire (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πυ̃ρ</foreign>). And <lb/>
            huge as they are, as they taper off gradually, they throw <lb/>
            no shadow, in accordance with a principle of mechanics.</p>
          <p>30. There are also subterranean passages, and winding <lb/>
            retreats, which, it is said, men skilful in the ancient <lb/>
            mysteries, by means of which they divined the coming of <lb/>
            a flood, constructed in different places lest the memory of <lb/>
            all their sacred ceremonies should be lost. On the walls, <lb/>
            as they cut them out, they have sculptured several kinds <note type="footnote"> I The Blemmyæ were an Ethiopian tribe to the south of Egypt. </note><note type="footnote"> . 2These names seem derived from the real or fancied shape of the <lb/>

            ways, as it was believed to have a head at each end. The scytalas <lb/>
            was like "a staff;" the acontias, like "a javelin;" the dipsas was a <lb/>
            thirsty snake. </note> <pb n="312"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXII. CH. XVI. </note> <lb/>
            of birds and beasts, and countless other figures of animals, <lb/>
            which they call hieroglyphics.</p>
          <p>31. There is also Syene, where at the time of the summer <lb/>
            solstice the rays surrounding upright objects do not allow <lb/>
            the shadows to extend beyond the bodies. And if any one <lb/>
            fixes a post upright in the ground, or sees a man or a tree <lb/>
            standing erect, he will perceive that their shadow is con- <lb/>
            sumed at the extremities of their outlines. This also <lb/>
            happens at Meroe, which is the spot in Ethiopia nearest <lb/>
            to the equinoctial circle, and where for ninety days the <lb/>
            shadows fall in a way just opposite to ours, on account of <lb/>
            which the natives of that district are called Antiscii.1</p>
          <p>32. But as there are many other wonders which would <lb/>
            go beyond the plan of our little work, we must lead these <lb/>
            to men of lofty genius, and content ourselves with re- <lb/>

            Pentapolis, which has been detached from Libya.</p>
          <p>2. Thebais, among many other cities, can boast especially <lb/>
            of Hermopolis, Coptos, and Antinous, which Hadrian built <lb/>
            in honour of his friend Antinous. As to Thebes, with its <lb/>
            hundred gates, there is no one ignorant of its renown.</p>
          <p>3. In Augustamnica, among others, there is the noble <lb/>
            city of Pelusium, which is said to have been founded by <lb/>
            Peleus, the father of Achilles, who by command of the <lb/>
            gods was ordered to purify himself in the lake adjacent to <lb/>
            the walls of the city, when, after having slain his brother <lb/>
            Phocus, he was driven about by horrid images of the Furies; <lb/>
            and Cassium, where the tomb of the great Pompey is, and <lb/>
            Ostracine, and Rhinocolura.</p>
          <p>4. In Libya Pentapolis is Cyrene, a city of great an- <lb/>
            tiquity, but now deserted, founded by Battus the Spartan, <lb/>
            and Ptolemais, and Arsinoe, known also as Teuchira, and <lb/>
            Darnis, and Berenice, called also Hesperides. <note type="footnote"> 1 From <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντὶ</foreign>, opposite; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκιὰ</foreign>, shadow . </note> <pb n="313"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> 5. And in the dry Libya, besides a few other insignifi- <lb/>
            cant towns, there are Parsetonium, Chærecla, and N eapolis.</p>
          <p>6. Egypt proper, which ever since it has been united to <lb/>
            the Roman empire has been under the government of a <lb/>
            prefect, besides some other towns of smaller importance, is <lb/>
            distinguished by Athribis, and Oxyrynchus, and Thmuis, <lb/>
            and Memphis.</p>
          <p>7. But the greatest of all the cities is Alexandria, en- <lb/>
            nobled by many circumstances, and especially by the <lb/>
            grandeur of its great founder, and the skill of its architect <lb/>
            Dinocrates, who, when he was laying the foundation of its <lb/>
            extensive and beautiful walls, for want of mortar, which <lb/>
            could not. be procured at the moment, is said to have <lb/>
            marked out its outline with flour ; an incident which fore- <lb/>
            showed that the city should hereafter abound in supplies <lb/>
            of provisions.</p>
          <p>8. At Inibis the air is wholesome, the sky pure and <lb/>
            undisturbed; and, as the experience of a long series of <lb/>
            ages proves, there is scarcely ever a day on which the <lb/>
            inhabitants of this city do not see the sun.</p>
          <p>9. The shore is shifty and dangerous; and as in former <lb/>
            times it exposed sailors to many dangers, Cleopatra erected <lb/>
            a lofty tower in the harbour, which was named Pharos, <lb/>
            from the spot on which it was built, and which afforded <lb/>
            light to vessels by night when coming from the Levant or <lb/>
            the Libyan sea along the plain and level coast, without <lb/>
            any signs of mountains or towns or eminences to direct <lb/>
            them, they were previously often wrecked by striking into <lb/>
            the soft and adhesive sand.</p>
          <p>10. The same queen, for a well-known and necessary <lb/>
            reason, made a causeway seven furlongs in extent, admirable <lb/>
            for its size and for the almost incredible rapidity with <lb/>
            which it was made. The island of Pharos, where Homer <lb/>
            in sublime language relates that Proteus used to amues <lb/>
            himself with his herds of seals, is almost a thousand yards <lb/>
            from the shore on which the city stands, and was liable to <lb/>
            pay tribute to the Rhodians.</p>
          <p>11. And when on one occasion the fanners of this re- <lb/>
            venue came to make exorbitant demands, she, being a wily <lb/>
            woman, on a pretext of it being the season of solemn holi- <lb/>
            days, led them into the suburbs, and ordered the work to <lb/>
            be carried on without ceasing. And so seven furlongs were <pb n="314"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXII. CH. XVI. </note> <lb/>
            completed in seven days, being raised with the soil of the <lb/>
            adjacent shore. Then the queen, driving over it in her <lb/>
            chariot said that the Rhodians were making a blunder in <lb/>
            demanding port dues for what was not an island but part <lb/>
            of the mainland.</p>
          <p>. 12. Besides this there are many lofty temples, and <lb/>
            especially one to Serapis, which, although no words can <lb/>
            adequately describe it, we may yet say, from its splendid <lb/>
            halls supported by pillars, and its beautiful statues and <lb/>
            other embellishments, is so superbly decorated, that next to <lb/>
            the Capitol, of which the ever-venerable Rome boasts, the <lb/>
            whole world has nothing worthier of admiration.</p>
          <p>13. In it were libraries of inestimable value; and the <lb/>
            concurrent testimony of ancient records affirm that 70,000 <lb/>
            volumes, which had been collected by the anxious care of <lb/>
            the Ptolemies, were burnt in the Alexandrian war when <lb/>
            the city was sacked in the time of Cæsar the Dictator.</p>
          <p>14. Twelve miles from this city is Canopus, which, <lb/>
            according to ancient tradition, received its name from <lb/>
            the prophet of Menelaus, who was buried there. It is <lb/>
            a place exceedingly well supplied with good inns, of a <lb/>
            most wholesome climate, with refreshing breezes ; so that <lb/>
            any one who resides in that district might think himself <lb/>
            out of our world while he hears the breezes murmuring <lb/>
            through the sunny atmosphere.</p>
          <p>15. Alexandria itself was not, like other cities, gradually <lb/>
            embellished, but at its very outset it was adorned with <lb/>
            spacious roads. But after having been long torn by violent <lb/>
            seditions, at last, when Aurelian was emperor, and when <lb/>
            the intestine quarrels of its citizens had proceeded to <lb/>
            deadly strife, its walls were destroyed, and it lost the <lb/>
            largest half of its territory, which was called Bruchion, and <lb/>
            ha I long been the abode of eminent men.</p>
          <p>16. There had lived Aristarchus, that illustrious gram- <lb/>
            marian ; and Herodianus, that accurate inquirer into <lb/>
            the fine arts; and Saccas Ammonius, the master of Plotinus, <lb/>
            and many other writers in various useful branches of <lb/>
            literature, among whom Didymus, surnamed Chalcenterus, <lb/>
            a man celebrated for his writings on many subjects of <lb/>
            science, deserves especial mention ; who, in the six books <lb/>
            in which he, sometimes incorrectly, attacks Cicero, imi- <lb/>
            tating those malignant farce-writers, is justly blamed by <pb n="315"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 362.] </note> <lb/>
            the learned as a puppy barking from a distance with puny <lb/>
            voice against the mighty roar of the lion.</p>
          <p>17. And although, besides those I have mentioned,.there <lb/>
            were many other men of eminence in ancient times, yet <lb/>
            even now there is much learning in the same city; for <lb/>
            teachers of various sects flourish, and many kinds of secret <lb/>
            knowledge are explained by geometrical science. Nor is <lb/>
            music dead among them, nor harmony. And by a few, <lb/>
            observations of the motion of the world and of the stars <lb/>
            are still cultivated; while of learned arithmeticians the <lb/>
            number is considerable; and besides them there are many <lb/>
            skilled in divination.</p>
          <p>18. Again, of medicine, the aid of which in our present <lb/>
            extravagant and luxurious way of life is incessantly re- <lb/>
            quired, the study is carried on with daily increasing eager- <lb/>
            ness ; so that while the employment be of itself creditable, <lb/>
            it is sufficient as a recommendation for any medical man <lb/>
            to be able to say that he was educated at Alexandria. And <lb/>
            this is enough to say on this subject.</p>
          <p>19. But if any one in the earnestness of his intellect <lb/>
            wishes to apply himself to the various branches of divine <lb/>
            knowledge, or to the examination of metaphysics, he will <lb/>
            find that the whole world owes this kind of learning to <lb/>
            Egypt.</p>
          <p>20. Here first, far earlier than in any other country, men <lb/>
            arrived at the various cradles (if I may so say) of different <lb/>
            religions. Here they still carefully preserve the elements <lb/>
            of sacred rites as handed down in their secret volumes.</p>
          <p>21. It was in learning derived from Egypt that Pytha- <lb/>
            goras was educated, which taught him to worship the <lb/>
            gods in secret, to establish the principle that in whatever <lb/>
            he said or ordered his authority was final, to exhibit his <lb/>
            golden thigh at Olympia, and to be continually seen in <lb/>
            conversation with an eagle.</p>
          <p>22. Here it was that Anaxagoras derived the knowledge <lb/>
            which enabled him to predict that stones would fall from <lb/>
            heaven, and from the feeling of the mud in a well to foretell <lb/>
            impending earthquakes. Solon too derived aid from the <lb/>
            apophthegms of the priests of Egypt in the enactment of <lb/>
            his just and moderate laws, by which he gave great con- <lb/>
            firmation to the Roman jurisprudence. From this soure <lb/>
            too Plato, soaring amid sublime ideas, rivalling Jupiter <pb n="316"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXIII. </note> <lb/>
            himself in the magnificence of his voice, acquired his <lb/>
            glorious wisdom by a visit to Egypt.</p>
          <p>23. The inhabitants of Egypt are generally swarthy and <lb/>
            dark complexioned, and of a rather melancholy cast-of <lb/>
            countenance, thin and dry looking, quick in every motion; <lb/>
            fond of controversy, and bitter exactors of their rights. <lb/>
            Among them a man is ashamed who has not resisted the <lb/>
            payment of tribute, and who does not carry about him <lb/>
            wheals which he has received before he could be compelled <lb/>
            to pay it. Nor have any tortures been found sufficiently <lb/>
            powerful to make the hardened robbers of this country <lb/>
            disclose their names unless they do so voluntarily.</p>
          <p>24. It is well known, as the ancient annals prove, that <lb/>
            all Egypt was formerly under kings who were friendly to <lb/>
            us. But after Antony and Cleopatra were defeated in the <lb/>
            naval battle at Actium, it became a province under the <lb/>
            dominion of Octavianus Augustus. We became masters of <lb/>
            the dry Libya by the last will of king Apion. Cyrene <lb/>
            and the other cities of Libya Pentapolis we owe to the <lb/>
            liberality of Ptolemy. After this long digression, I will <lb/>
            now return to my original subject.</p>

          <p>§ 1. To pass over minute details, these were the principal <lb/>
            events of the year. But Julian, who in his third consul- <lb/>
            ship had taken as his colleague Sallustius, the prefect of <lb/>
            Gaul, now entered on his fourth year, and by a novel <lb/>
            arrangement took as his colleague a private individual; an <lb/>
            act of which no one recollected an instance since that of <lb/>
            Diocletian and Aristobulus.</p>
          <p>2. And although, foreseeing in his anxious mind the <lb/>
            various accidents that might happen, he urged on with <lb/>
            great diligence all the endless preparations necessary for <lb/>
            his expedition, yet distributing his diligence everywhere; <lb/>
            and being eager to extend the recollection of his reign by <lb/>
            the greatness of his exploits, he proposed to rebuild at a <lb/>
            vast expense the once magnificent temple of Jerusalem, <lb/>
            which after many deadly, contests was with difficulty taken <lb/>
            by Vespasian and Titus, who succeeded his father in the <lb/>
            conduct of the siege. And he assigned the task to Alypius <lb/>
            of Antioch, who had formerly been proprefect of Britain.</p>
          <p>3. But though Alypius applied himself vigorously to the <lb/>
            work, and though the governor of the province co-operated <lb/>
            with him, fearful balls of fire burst forth with continual <lb/>
            eruptions close to the foundations, burning several of the <lb/>
            workmen and making the spot altogether inaccessible. <lb/>
            And thus the very elements, as if by some fate, repelling <lb/>
            the attempt, it was laid aside.</p>
          <p>4. About the same time the emperor conferred various <lb/>
            honours on the ambassadors who were sent to him from the <lb/>
            Eternal City, being men of high rank and established ex- <lb/>
            cellence of character. He appointed Apronianus to be <lb/>
            prefect of Rome, Octavianus to be proconsul of Africa, <lb/>
            Venustus to be viceroy of Spain, and promoted Rufinus <lb/>
            Aradius to be count of the East in the room of his uncle <lb/>
            Julian, lately deceased.</p>
          <p>5. When all this had been carried out as he arranged, • <lb/>
            he was alarmed by an omen which, as the result showed, <lb/>
            indicated an event immediately at hand. Felix, the prin- <lb/>
            cipal treasurer, having died suddenly of a hemorrhage, <lb/>
            and Count Julian having followed him, the populace, look- <pb n="318"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXIII. CH. n. </note> <lb/>
            ing on their public titles, hailed Julian as Felix and <lb/>
            Augustus.</p>
          <p>6. Another bad omen had preceded this, for, on the very <lb/>
            first day of the year, as the emperor was mounting the <lb/>
            steps of the temple of the Genius, one of the priests, <lb/>
            the eldest of all, fell without any one striking him, <lb/>
            and suddenly expired; an event which the bystanders, <lb/>
            either out of ignorance or a desire to flatter, affirmed was <lb/>
            an omen affecting Sallustius, as the elder consul; but it <lb/>
            was soon seen that the death it portended was not to the <lb/>
            elder man, but to the higher authority.</p>
          <p>7. Besides these several other lesser signs from time to <lb/>
            time indicated what was about to happen ; for, at the very <lb/>
            beginning of the arrangements for the Parthian campaign, <lb/>
            news came that there had been an earthquake at Constan- <lb/>
            tinople, which those skilful in divination declared to be <lb/>
            an unfavourable omen to a ruler about to invade a foreign <lb/>
            country; and therefore advised Julian to abandon his <lb/>
            unreasonable enterprise, affiiming that these and similar <lb/>
            signs can only be disregarded with propriety when one's <lb/>
            country is invaded by foreign armies, as then there is one <lb/>
            everlasting and invariable law, to defend its safety by <lb/>
            every possible means, allowing no relaxation nor delay. <lb/>
            News also came by letter that at Rome the Sibylline <lb/>
            volumes had been consulted on the subject of the war by <lb/>
            Julian's order, and that they had in plain terms warned <lb/>
            him not to quit his own territories that year.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. BUT in the mean time embassies arrived from several <lb/>
            nations promising aid, and they were liberally received <lb/>
            and dismissed; the emperor with plausible confidence re- <lb/>
            plying that it by no means became the power of Rome <lb/>
            to rely on foreign aid to avenge itself, as it was rather <lb/>
            fitting that Rome should give support to its friends and <lb/>
            allies if necessity drove them to ask it.</p>
          <p>2. He only warned Arsaces, king of Armenia, to collect <lb/>
            a strong force, and wait for his orders, as he should soon <lb/>
            know which way to march, and what to do. Then, as <lb/>
            soon as prudence afforded him an opportunity, hastening <lb/>
            to anticipate every rumour of his approach by the occupa- <pb n="319"/>
            <note type="margin"> A D 303.] </note> <lb/>
            lion of the enemy's country, before spring had well set in, <lb/>
            he sent the signal for the advance to all his troops, com- <lb/>
            manding them to cross the Euphrates.</p>
          <p>3. As soon as the order reached them, they hastened to <lb/>
            quit their winter quarters ; and having crossed the river, <lb/>
            according to their orders, they dispersed into their various <lb/>
            stations, and awaited the arrival of the emperor. But he, <lb/>
            being about to quit Antioch, appointed a citizen of Helio- <lb/>
            polls, named Alexander, a man of turbulent and ferocious <lb/>
            character, to govern Syria, saying that he indeed had not <lb/>
            deserved such a post, but that the Antiochians, being <lb/>
            covetous and insolent, required a judge of that kind.</p>
          <p>4. When he was about to set forth, escorted by a pro- <lb/>
            miscuous multitude who wished him a fortunate march <lb/>
            and a glorious return, praying that he would be merciful <lb/>
            and kinder than he had been, he (for the anger which <lb/>
            their addresses and reproaches had excited in his breast <lb/>
            was not yet appeased) spoke with severity to them, and <lb/>
            declared that he would never see them again.</p>
          <p>5. For he said that he had determined, after his campaign <lb/>
            was over, to return by a shorter road to Tarsus in Cilicia, <lb/>
            to winter there: and that he had written to Memorius, the <lb/>
            governor of the city, to prepare everything that he might <lb/>
            require in that city. This happened not long afterwards ; <lb/>
            for his body was brought back thither and buried in the <lb/>
            suburbs with a very plain funeral, as he himself had com- <lb/>
            manded.</p>
          <p>6. As the weather, was now getting warm he set out <lb/>
            on the fifth of March, and by the usual stages arrived <lb/>
            at Hieropolis; and as he entered the gates of that large <lb/>
            city a portico on the left suddenly fell down, and as fifty <lb/>
            soldiers were passing under it at that moment it wounded <lb/>
            many, crushing them beneath the vast weight of the beams <lb/>
            and tiles.</p>
          <p>7. Having collected all his troops from thence, he <lb/>
            marched with such speed towards Mesopotamia, that before <lb/>
            any intelligence of his march could arrive (an object about, <lb/>
            which he was especially solicitous) he came upon the <lb/>
            Assyrians quite unexpectedly. Then having led his whole <lb/>
            army and the Scythian auxiliaries across the Euphrates <lb/>
            by a bridge of boats, he arrived at Batnæ, a town <lb/>
            Osdroene, and there again a sad omen met him. <pb n="320"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [BK. XXIII. CH. III. </note> 8. For when a great crowd of grooms was standing near <lb/>
            an enormously high haystack, in order to receive their <lb/>
            forage (for in this way those supplies used to be stored <lb/>
            in that country), the mass was shaken by the numbers <lb/>
            who sought to strip it, and falling down, overwhelmed, <lb/>
            fifty men.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. LEAVING this place with a heavy heart, he marched <lb/>
            with great speed, and arrived at Carrhæ, an ancient town <lb/>
            notorious for the disasters of Crassus and the Roman army. <lb/>
            From this town two royal roads branch off, both leading <lb/>
            into Persia; that on the left hand through Adiabena and <lb/>
            along the Tigris, that on the right through the Assyrians <lb/>
            and along the Euphrates.</p>
          <p>2. There he stayed some days, preparing necessary <lb/>
            supplies; and according to the custom of the district he <lb/>
            offered sacrifices to the moon, which is religiously wor- <lb/>
            shipped in that region; and it is said that while before <lb/>
            the altar, no witness to the action being admitted, he <lb/>
            secretly gave his own purple robe to Procopius, and bade <lb/>
            him boldly assume the sovereignty if he should hear that <lb/>
            he had died among the Parthians.</p>
          <p>3. Here while asleep his mind was agitated with dreams, <lb/>
            and foresaw some sad event about to happen; on which <lb/>
            account he and the interpreters of dreams consider- <lb/>
            ing the omens which presented themselves, pronounced <lb/>
            that the next day, which was the nineteenth of March, <lb/>
            ought to be solemnly observed. But, as was ascertained <lb/>
            subsequently, that very same night, while Apronianus <lb/>
            was prefect of Rome, the temple of the Palatine Apollo <lb/>
            was burnt in the Eternal City; and if aid from all quar-. <lb/>
            ters had not come to the rescue the violence of the confla- <lb/>
            gration would have destroyed even the prophetic volumes <lb/>
            of the Sibyl.</p>
          <p>4. After these things had happened in this manner, <lb/>
            and while Julian was settling his line of march, and <lb/>
            making arrangements for supplies of all kinds, his scouts <lb/>
            come panting in, and bring him word that some squadrons of <lb/>
            the enemy's, cavalry have suddenly passed the frontier in <pb n="321"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D 363.] </note> <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of the camp, and have driven off a <lb/>
            large booty.</p>
          <p>5. Indignant at such atrocity and at such an insult, he <lb/>
            immediately (as indeed he had previously contemplated) <lb/>
            put thirty thousand chosen men under the orders of Pro- <lb/>
            copius, who has been already mentioned, uniting with <lb/>
            him in this command Count Sebastian, formerly Duke of <lb/>
            Egypt; and he ordered them to act on this side of the <lb/>
            Tigris, observing everything vigilantly, so that no danger <lb/>
            might arise on any side where it was not expected, for <lb/>
            such things had frequently happened. He charged them <lb/>
            further, if it could be done, to join King Arsaces; and <lb/>
            march with him suddenly through Corduena and Moxoëne, <lb/>
            ravaging Chiliocomus, a very fertile district of Media, and <lb/>
            other places; and then to rejoin him while still in Assyria, <lb/>
            in order to assist him as he might require.</p>
          <p>6. Having taken these measures, Julian himself, pre- <lb/>
            tending to march by the line of the Tigris, on which road <lb/>
            he had purposely commanded magazines of provisions to <lb/>
            be prepared, turned towards the right, and after a quiet <lb/>
            night, asked in the morning for the horse which he was <lb/>
            accustomed to ride : his name was Babylonius. And when <lb/>
            he was brought, being suddenly griped and starting at the <lb/>
            pain, he fell down, and rolling about scattered the gold <lb/>
            and jewels with which his trappings were decked. Julian, <lb/>
            in joy at this omen, cried out, amid the applause of those <lb/>
            around, that " Babylon had fallen, and was stripped of <lb/>
            all her ornaments."</p>
          <p>7. Having delayed a little that he might confirm the <lb/>
            omen by the sacrifice of some victims, he advanced to <lb/>
            Davana, where he had a garrison-fortress, and where the <lb/>
            river Belias rises which falls into the Euphrates. Here <lb/>
            he refreshed his men with food and sleep, and the next <lb/>
            day reached Callinicus, a strong fortress, and also a great <lb/>
            commercial mart, where, on the 27th of March (the <lb/>
            day on which at Rome the annual festival in honour of <lb/>
            Cybele is celebrated, and the car in which her image is <lb/>
            borne is, as it is said, washed in the waters of the Almo), <lb/>
            he kept the same feast according to the manner of the <lb/>
            ancients, and then, retiring to rest, passed a triumphant <lb/>
            and joyful night.</p>
          <p>8. The next day he proceeded along the bank of the <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <pb n="322"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BK. XXIII. Cn. IV) </note> <lb/>
            river, which other streams began to augment, marching <lb/>
            with an armed escort; and at night he rested in a tent, <lb/>
            where some princes of the Saracenic tribes came as sup- <lb/>
            pliants, bringing him a golden crown, and adoring him as <lb/>
            the master of the world and of their own nations: he <lb/>
            received them graciously, as people well adapted for sur- <lb/>
            prises in war.</p>
          <p>9. And while addressing them a fleet arrived equal to <lb/>
            that of the mighty sovereign Xerxes, under the command <lb/>
            of the tribune Constantianus, and Count Lucillianus; they <lb/>
            threw a bridge over the broadest part of the Euphrates : <lb/>
            the fleet consisted of one thousand transports, of various <lb/>
            sorts and sizes, bringing large supplies of provisions, and <lb/>
            arms, and engines for sieges, and fifty ships of war, and as <lb/>
            many more suitable for the construction of bridges.</p>

            <title type="sub">IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. I AM reminded by the circumstances to explain instru- <lb/>
            ments of this kind briefly, as far as my moderate talent <lb/>
            may enable me to do, and first I will set forth the figure of <lb/>
            the balista.</p>
          <p>2. Between two axletrees a strong large iron bar is <lb/>
            fastened, like a great rule, round, smooth, and polished; <lb/>
            from its centre a square pin projects for some distance, <lb/>
            hollowed out into a narrow channel down its middle. <lb/>
            This is bound by many ligatures of twisted cords: to it <lb/>
            two wooden nuts are accurately fitted, by one of which <lb/>
            stands a skilful man who works it, and who fits neatly into <lb/>
            the hollow of the pin or pole a wooden arrow with a large <lb/>
            point; and as soon as this is done, some strong young men <lb/>
            rapidly turn a wheel.</p>
          <p>3. When the tip of the arrow's point has reached the <lb/>
            extremity of the cords, the arrow is struck by a blow from <lb/>
            the balista, and flies out of sight; sometimes even giving <lb/>
            forth sparks by its great velocity, and it often happens <lb/>
            that before the arrow is seen, it has given a fatal wound.</p>
          <p>4. The scorpion, which they now call the wild-ass, is in <lb/>
            the following form. Two axletrees of oak or box are. cut <lb/>
            out and slightly curved, so as to project in small humps, <lb/>
            and they are fastened together like a sawing machine, being <lb/>
            perforated with large holes on each side; and between <pb n="323"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 363.] </note> <lb/>
            them, through the holes, strong ropes are fastened to hold <lb/>
            the two parts together, and prevent them from starting <lb/>
            asunder.</p>
          <p>o. From these ropes thus placed a wooden pin rises in <lb/>
            an. oblique direction, like the pole of a chariot, and it is <lb/>
            so fastened by knotted cords as to be raised or depressed <lb/>
            at pleasure. To its top, iron hooks are fastened, from <lb/>
            which a sling hangs, made of either cord or iron. Below <lb/>
            the pin is a large sack filled with shreds of cloth, fastened <lb/>
            by strong ties, and resting on heaped-up turves or mounds <lb/>
            of brick. For an engine of this kind, if placed on a stone <lb/>
            wall, would destroy whatever was beneath it, not by its <lb/>
            weight, but by the violence of its concussion.</p>
          <p>6. Then when a conflict begins, a round stone is placed <lb/>
            on the sling, and four youths on each side, loosening the <lb/>
            bar to which the cords are attached, bend the pin back till <lb/>
            it points almost upright into the air; then.the worker of <lb/>
            the engine, standing by on high ground, frees by a blow <lb/>
            with the heavy hammer the bolt which keeps down the <lb/>
            whole engine; and the pin being, set free by the stroke, <lb/>
            and striking against the mass of cloth shreds, hurls forth <lb/>
            the stone with such force as to crush whatever it strikes.</p>
          <p>. 7. This engine is called a tormentum, because all its parts <lb/>
            are twisted (torquetur) ; or a scorpion, because it has an <lb/>
            erect sting; but modern times have given it the name of <lb/>
            the wild-ass, because when wild asses are hunted, they <lb/>
            throw the stones behind them by their kicks so as to <lb/>
            pierce the chests of those who pursue them, or to fracture <lb/>
            their skulls.</p>
          <p>8. Now let us come to the battering ram. A lofty <lb/>
            pine or ash is chosen, the top of which is armed with a <lb/>
            long and hard head of iron, resembling a lam, which form <lb/>
            has given the name to the engine. It is suspended from <lb/>
            iron beams running across on each side, like the top of a <lb/>
            pair of scales, and is kept in its place by ropes hanging <lb/>
            from a third beam. A number of men draw it back as far <lb/>
            as there is room, and then again drive it forward to <lb/>
            break down whatever opposes it by mighty blows, like a <lb/>
            ram which rises up and butts.</p>
          <p>9. By the frequent blows of this rebounding thunder- <lb/>
            bolt, buildings are torn asunder and walls are loosened <lb/>
            and thrown down. By this kind of engine, if worked with <lb/>
            proper vigour, garrisons are deprived of their defences, and <pb n="324"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXIII. CH. v </note> <lb/>
            the strongest cities are laid open and sieges rapidly brought <lb/>
            to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>10. Instead of these rams, which from their common use <lb/>
            came to be despised, a machine was framed called in <lb/>
            Greek the helepolis, by the frequent use of which Deme- <lb/>
            trius, the son of king Antigonus, took Rhodes and other <lb/>
            cities, and earned the surname of Poliorcetes.</p>
          <p>11. It is constructed in this manner. A vast testudo <lb/>
            is put together, strengthened with long beams and fastened <lb/>
            with iron nails; it is covered with bullocks' hides and <lb/>
            wickerwork made of freshly cut twigs, and its top is <lb/>
            smeared over with clay to keep off missiles and fiery darts.</p>
          <p>12. Along its front very sharp spears with three points <lb/>
            are fastened, heavy with iron, like the thunderbolts repre- <lb/>
            sented by painters or sculptors, and strong enough with <lb/>
            the projecting points to tear to pieces whatever it strikes.</p>
          <p>13. A number of soldiers within guide this vast mast <lb/>
            with wheels and ropes, urging with vehement impulse <lb/>
            against the weaker parts of the wall, so that, unless re- <lb/>
            pelled by the strength of the garrison above, it breaks <lb/>
            down the wall and lays open a great breach.</p>
          <p>14. The fire bolts, which are a kind of missile, are made <lb/>
            thus. They take an arrow of cane, joined together be- <lb/>
            tween the point and the reed with jagged iron, and made <lb/>
            in the shape of a woman's spindle, with which linen threads <lb/>
            are spun; this is cunningly hollowed out in the belly and <lb/>
            made with several openings, and in the cavity.fire and fuel <lb/>
            of some kind is placed.</p>
          <p>15. Then if it be shot slowly from a slack bow (for if it <lb/>
            be shot with too much speed the fire is extinguished), so <lb/>
            as to stick anywhere, it burns obstinately, and if sprinkled <lb/>
            with water it creates a still fiercer fire, nor will anything <lb/>
            but throwing dust upon it quench it. This is enough to <lb/>
            say of mural engines; let us now return to our original <lb/>
            subject.</p>

          <p>§ 1. HAVING received the reinforcements of the Saracens <lb/>
            which they so cheerfully offered, the emperor advanced <lb/>
            with speed, and at the beginning of April entered Cir- <lb/>
            cesium, a very secure fortress, and skilfully built: it is <lb/>
            surrounded by the two livers Aboras (or Chaboras) and <lb/>
            Euphrates, which make it as it were an island. <pb n="325"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D 363.] </note> 2. It had formerly been small and insecure, till Diocletian <lb/>
            surrounded it with lofty towers and walls when he was <lb/>
            strengthening his inner frontier within the very territories <lb/>
            of the barbarians, in order to prevent the Persians from <lb/>
            overrunning Syria, as had happened a few years before <lb/>
            to the great injury of the province.</p>
          <p>3. For it happened one day at Antioch, when the city <lb/>
            was in perfect tranquillity, a comic actor being on the stage <lb/>
            with his wife, acting some common play, while the people <lb/>
            were delighted with his acting, the wife suddenly ex- <lb/>
            claimed, " Unless I am dreaming, here are the Persians <lb/>
            and immediately the populace turning round, were put to <lb/>
            flight, and driven about in every direction while seeking <lb/>
            to escape the darts which were showered upon them; and <lb/>
            so the city being burnt and numbers of the citizens slain, <lb/>
            who, as is usual in time of peace, were strolling about care- <lb/>
            lessly, and all the places in the neighbourhood being burnt <lb/>
            and laid waste, the enemy loaded with booty returned in <lb/>
            safety to their own country after having burnt Mareades <lb/>
            alive, who had wickedly guided them to the destruction of <lb/>
            his fellow-citizens. This event took place in the time of <lb/>
            Gallienus.</p>
          <p>4. But Julian, while remaining at Circesium to give <lb/>
            time for his army and all its followers to cross the bridge <lb/>
            of boats over the Aboras, received letters with bad news <lb/>
            from Sallust, the prefect of Gaul, entreating him to suspend <lb/>
            his expedition against the Parthians, and imploring him <lb/>
            not in such an unseasonable manner to rush on irrevocable <lb/>
            destruction before propitiating the gods.</p>
          <p>5. But Julian disregarded his prudent adviser, and <lb/>
            advanced boldly; since no human power or virtue can ever <lb/>
            avail to prevent events prescribed by the order of the Fates. <lb/>
            And immediately, having crossed the river, he ordered <lb/>
            the bridge to be taken to pieces, that the soldiers might <lb/>
            have no hope of safety by quitting their ranks and <lb/>
            returning.</p>
          <p>6. Here also a bad omen was seen; the corpse of an <lb/>
            officer who had been put to death by the executioner, <lb/>
            whom Sallust, the prefect, while in this country had con- <lb/>
            demned to death, because, after having promised to deliver <lb/>
            an additional supply of provisions by an appointed day, he <lb/>
            disappointed him through some hindrance. But after the <lb/>
            unhappy man had been executed, the very next day there <pb n="326"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXIII. CH. r. </note> <lb/>
            arrived, as he had promised, another fleet heavily laden <lb/>
            with corn.</p>
          <p>7. Leaving Circesium, we came to Zait.ha, the name of <lb/>
            the place meaning an olive-tree. Here we saw the tomb <lb/>
            of the emperor Gordian, which is visible a long way off, <lb/>
            whose actions from his earliest youth, and whose most for- <lb/>
            tunate campaigns and treacherous murder we related at the <lb/>
            proper time,1 and when, in accordance with his innate <lb/>
            piety he had offered due honours to this deified emperor, <lb/>
            and was on his way to Dura, a town now deserted, he stood <lb/>
            without moving on beholding a large body of soldiers.</p>
          <p>8. And as he was doubting what their object was, they <lb/>
            brought him an enormous lion which had attacked their <lb/>
            ranks and had. been slain by their javelins. He, elated at <lb/>
            this circumstance, which he looked on as an omen of suc- <lb/>
            cess in his enterprise, advanced with increased exultation ; <lb/>
            but so uncertain is fortune, the event was quite contrary <lb/>
            to his expectation. The death of a king was certainly fore- <lb/>
            shown, but who was the king was uncertain.</p>
          <p>9. For we often read of ambiguous oracles, never under- <lb/>
            stood till the results interpreted them; as, for instance; <lb/>
            the Delphic prophecy, which foretold that after crossing <lb/>
            the Halys, Crœsus would overthrow a mighty kingdom; and <lb/>
            another, which by hints pointed out the sea to the Athe- <lb/>
            nians as the field of combat against the Medes ; and another, <lb/>
            later than these, but not less ambiguous :— <lb/>
            " 0 son of Æacus, <lb/>
            I say that you the Romans can subdue."</p>
          <p>10. The Etrurian soothsayers who accompanied him, <lb/>
            being men skilful in portents, had often warned him against <lb/>
            this campaign, but got no credit; so now they produced <lb/>
            their books of such signs, and showed that this was an <lb/>
            omen of a forbidding character, and unfavourable to a prince <lb/>
            who should invade the country of another sovereign how- <lb/>
            ever justly.</p>
          <p>11. But he spurned the opposition of philosophers; <lb/>
            whose authority he ought to have reverenced, though at <lb/>
            times they were mistaken, and though they were some- <lb/>
            times obstinate in cases which they did not thoroughly <lb/>
            understand. In truth, they brought forward as a plausible <lb/>
            argument to secure credit to their knowledge, that in time <note type="footnote">1 The book containing this account is lost. </note> <pb n="327"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 363.] </note> <lb/>
            past, when Cæsar Maximianus was about to fight Narses, <lb/>
            king of the Persians, a lion and a huge boar which had <lb/>
            been slain were at the same time brought to him, and <lb/>
            after subduing that nation he returned in safety; forget- <lb/>
            ting that the destruction which was now portended was <lb/>
            to him who invaded the dominions of another, and that <lb/>
            Narses had given the offence by being the first to make <lb/>
            an inroad into Armenia, a country under the Roman juris- <lb/>
            diction.</p>
          <p>12. On the next day, which was the 7th of April, as the <lb/>
            sun was setting, suddenly the air became darkened, and <lb/>
            all light wholly disappeared, and after repeated claps of <lb/>
            thunder and flashes of lightning, a soldier named Jovianus <lb/>
            was struck by the lightning and killed, with two horses <lb/>
            which he was leading back from the river to which he had <lb/>
            taken them to drink.</p>
          <p>13. When this was seen, the interpreters of such things <lb/>
            were sent for and questioned, and they with increased <lb/>
            boldness affirmed that this event forbade the campaign, <lb/>
            demonstrating it to be a monitory lightning (for this <lb/>
            term is applied to signs which advise or discourage any <lb/>
            line of action). And this, as they said, was to be the more <lb/>
            guarded against, because it had killed a soldier of rank, <lb/>
            with war-horses ; and the books which explain lightnings <lb/>
            pronounce that places struck in this manner should not be <lb/>
            trodden on, nor even looked upon.</p>
          <p>14. On the other hand, the philosophers declared that <lb/>
            the brilliancy of this sacred fire thus suddenly presented <lb/>
            to the eye had no special meaning, but was merely the <lb/>
            course of a fiercer breath descending by some singular <lb/>
            power from the sky to the lower parts of the world ; and <lb/>
            that if any foreknowledge were to be derived from such a <lb/>
            circumstance, it was rather an increase of renown which <lb/>
            was portended to the emperor now engaged in a glorious <lb/>
            enterprise ; since it is notorious that flame, if it meet with <lb/>
            no obstacle, does of its own nature fly upwards. s</p>
          <p>. 15..The bridge then, as has been narrated, having been <lb/>
            finished, and all the troops having crossed it, the emperor <lb/>
            thought it the most important of all things to address his <lb/>
            soldiers who were advancing resolutely, in full reliance <lb/>
            on their leader and on themselves. Accordingly, a signal <lb/>
            having been given by the trumpets, the centurions, cohorts, <lb/>
            and maniples assembled, and he, standing on a mound of <pb n="328"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXIII. CH. T. </note> <lb/>
            earth, and surrounded by a ring of officers of high rank, <lb/>
            spoke thus with a cheerful face, being favourably beard <lb/>
            with the unanimous good will of all present.</p>
          <p>16. " Seeing, my brave soldiers, that you are full of great <lb/>
            vigour and alacrity, I have determined to address you, to <lb/>
            prove to you by several arguments that the Romans are <lb/>
            not, as spiteful grumblers assert, now for the first time <lb/>
            invading the kingdom of Persia. For, to say nothing of <lb/>
            Lucullus or of Pompey, who, having forced his way <lb/>
            through the Albani and Massagetae, whom we call Alani, <lb/>
            penetrated through this nation also so as to reach the <lb/>
            Caspian lake; we know that Ventidius, the lieutenant of <lb/>
            Antony, gained many victories in these regions.</p>
          <p>17. " But to leave those ancient times, 1 will enumerate <lb/>
            other exploits of more recent memory. Trojan, and Verus, <lb/>
            and Severus have all gained victories and trophies in this <lb/>
            country; and the younger Gordian, whose monument we <lb/>
            have just been honouring would have reaped similar glory, <lb/>
            having conquered and routed the king of Persia at Resaina, <lb/>
            if he had not been wickedly murdered in this very place <lb/>
            by the faction of Philip, the prefect of the prætorium, with <lb/>
            the assistance of a few other impious men.</p>
          <p>18. "But his shade was not long left to wander un- <lb/>
            avenged, since, as if Justice herself had laboured in the <lb/>
            cause, all those who conspired against him have been put <lb/>
            to death with torture. Those men, indeed, ambition <lb/>
            prompted to the atrocious deed; but we are exhorted by <lb/>
            the miserable fate of cities recently taken, by the unavenged <lb/>
            shades of our slaughtered armies, by the heaviness of our <lb/>
            losses, and the loss of many camps and fortresses, to the <lb/>
            enterprise which we have undertaken. All men uniting <lb/>
            in their wishes that we may remedy past evils, and having <lb/>
            secured the honour and safety of the republic on this side, <lb/>
            may leave posterity reason to speak nobly of us.</p>
          <p>19. “By the assistance of the eternal deity, I, your <lb/>
            emperor, will be always among you as a leader and a com- <lb/>
            rade, relying, as I well believe, on favourable omens. But <lb/>
            if variable fortune shall defeat me in battle, it will still be <lb/>
            sufficient for me to have devoted myself for the welfare of <lb/>
            the Roman world, like ancient Curtii and Mucii, and the <lb/>
            illustrious family of the Decii. We have to abolish a <lb/>
            most pernicious nation, on whose swords the blood of our <lb/>
            kindred is not yet dry. <pb n="329"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 363.] </note> 20. " Our ancestors have before now devoted ages to <lb/>
            cause the destruction of. enemies who harassed them. <lb/>
            Carthage was overthrown after a long and distressing war; <lb/>
            and its great conqueror feared to let it survive his victory. <lb/>
            After a long and often disastrous siege, Scipio utterly <lb/>
            destroyed Numantia. Rome destroyed Fidenæ, that it <lb/>
            might not grow up as a rival to the empire; and so <lb/>
            entirely laid waste Falisci and Veil, that it is not easy to <lb/>
            attach so much faith to ancient records as to believe that <lb/>
            those cities ever were powerful.</p>
          <p>21. “These transactions I have related to you as one <lb/>
            acquainted with ancient history. It follows that all <lb/>
            should lay aside, as unworthy of him, the love of plunder, <lb/>
            which has often been the insidious bane of the Roman <lb/>
            soldier, and that every one should keep steadily to his own <lb/>
            troop and his own standard, when the necessity for fighting <lb/>
            arises, knowing that should he loiter anywhere he will <lb/>
            be hamstrung and left to his fate. I fear nothing of our <lb/>
            over-crafty enemies but their tricks and perfidy.</p>
          <p>22. “Finally, I promise you all, that when our affairs <lb/>
            have met with success, without entrenching myself behind <lb/>
            my imperial prerogative, so as to consider all my own <lb/>
            decisions and opinions irrefragably just and reasonable <lb/>
            because of my authority, I will give, if required, a full <lb/>
            explanation of all that I have done, that you may be able <lb/>
            to judge whether it has been wise or not.</p>
          <p>23. " Therefore, I entreat you, now summon all your <lb/>
            courage, in full reliance on your good fortune, sure at all <lb/>
            events that I will share all dangers equally with you, and <lb/>
            believing that victory ever accompanies justice."</p>
          <p>24. When he had ended his harangue with this pleasant <lb/>
            peroration, the soldiers, exulting in the glory of their chief, <lb/>
            and elated with the hopes of success, lifted up their <lb/>
            shields on high, and cried out that they should think <lb/>
            nothing dangerous nor difficult under an emperor who <lb/>
            imposed more toil on himself than on his common soldiers.</p>
          <p>25. And above all the rest his Gallic troops showed <lb/>
            this feeling with triumphant shouts, remembering how <lb/>
            often while he as their leader was marshalling their <lb/>
            ranks, they had seen some nations defeated and others <lb/>
            compelled to sue for mercy and peace. <pb n="330"/>

          <p>§ 1. OUR history here leads us to a digression explana- <lb/>
            tory of the situation of Persia. It has been already dilated <lb/>
            upon by those who describe different nations, though but <lb/>
            few of them have given a correct account; if my story <lb/>
            should be a little longer, it will contribute to a better <lb/>
            knowledge of the country. For whoever affects excessive <lb/>
            conciseness while speaking of things but little known, does <lb/>
            not so much consider how to explain matters intelligibly, <lb/>
            as how much he may omit.</p>
          <p>2. This kingdom, formerly but small, and one which had <lb/>
            been known by several names, from causes which we have <lb/>
            often mentioned, after the death of Alexander at Babylon <lb/>
            received the name of Parthia from Arsaces, a youth of <lb/>
            obscure birth, who in his early youth was a leader of <lb/>
            banditti, but who gradually improved his condition, and <lb/>
            rose to high renown from his illustrious actions. I</p>
          <p>3. After many splendid and gallant exploits he defeated <lb/>
            Nicator Scleucus, the successor of the above-named Alex- <lb/>
            ander, who had received the surname of N icator1 from his <lb/>
            repeated victories; and having expelled the Macedonian <lb/>
            garrisons, he lived for the remainder of his life in peace, <lb/>
            like a merciful ruler of willing subjects.</p>
          <p>4. At last, after all the neighbouring districts had been <lb/>
            brought under his power, either by force or by fear, or by <lb/>
            his reputation for justice, he died a peaceful death in <lb/>
            middle age, after he had filled all Persia with flourishing <lb/>
            cities and well-fortified camps and fortresses, and had. <lb/>
            made it an object of terror to its neighbours whom pre- <lb/>
            viously it used to fear. And he was the first of these <lb/>
            kings who had by the unanimous consent of all his coun- <lb/>
            trymen of all ranks, in accordance with the tenets of their <lb/>
            religion, had his memory consecrated as one now placed <lb/>
            among the stars.</p>
          <p>5. And it is from his era that the arrogant sovereigns <lb/>
            of that nation have allowed themselves to be entitled bro- <lb/>
            thers of the sun and moon. And, as the title of Augustus <lb/>
            is sought for and desired by our emperors, so now the <lb/>
            additional dignities first earned by the fortunate auspices <note type="footnote">1 From <foreign xml:lang="grc">νικάω</foreign>, to conquer. </note> <pb n="331"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 363.] </note> <lb/>
            of Arsaces are claimed by all the Parthian kings, who were <lb/>
            formerly abject and inconsiderable.</p>
          <p>6. So that they still worship and honour Arsaces a? a <lb/>
            god, and down to our day have given him so much honour <lb/>
            that, in conferring the royal power, one of his race has <lb/>
            been always preferred to any one else. And also in <lb/>
            intestine quarrels, such as are common in that nation, every <lb/>
            one avoids as sacrilege wounding any descendant of <lb/>
            Arsaces, whether in arms or living as a private individual.</p>
          <p>7. It is well known that this nation, after subduing <lb/>
            many others by force, extended its dominions as.far as the <lb/>
            'Propontis and Thrace;' but that it subsequently became <lb/>
            diminished and suffered great disasters, owing to the <lb/>
            arrogance of its ambitious monarchs, who carried their <lb/>
            licentious inroads into distant countries. First, in conse- <lb/>
            quence of the conduct of Cyrus, who crossed the Bosphorus <lb/>
            with a fabulous host, but was wholly destroyed by Tomyris, <lb/>
            queen of the Scythians, who thus terribly avenged her sons.</p>
          <p>8. After him, when Darius, and subsequently Xerxes, <lb/>
            changed the use1 of the elements and invaded Greece, they <lb/>
            had nearly all their forces destroyed by land and sea, and <lb/>
            could scarcely escape in safety themselves. I say nothing <lb/>
            of the wars of Alexander, and of his leaving the sovereignty <lb/>
            over the whole nation by will to his successor.</p>
          <p>9. Then, a long time after these events, while our re- <lb/>
            public was under consuls, and was afterwards brought <lb/>
            under the power of the Cæsars, that nation was constantly <lb/>
            warring with us, sometimes with equal fortune; being at <lb/>
            one time defeated, and at another victorious.</p>
          <p>10. Now I will in a few words describe the situation <lb/>
            and position of the country as well as I can. It is a <lb/>
            region of great extent both in length and breadth, entirely <lb/>
            surrounding on all sides the famous Persian gulf with its <lb/>
            many islands. The mouth of this gulf is so narrow, that <note type="footnote">1 As the Greek epigram has it-</note> <figure type="illustration">

              from Harmozon, the promontory of Carmania, the opposite <lb/>
              headland, which the natives call Maces, is easily seen.</p>
          <p>11. When the strait between these capes is passed, and <lb/>
            the water becomes wider, they are navigable up to the city <lb/>
            Teredon, where, after having suffered a great diminution <lb/>
            of its waters, the Euphrates falls into the sea. The entire <lb/>
            gulf, if measured round the shore, is 20,000 furlongs, being <lb/>
            of a circular form as if turned in a lathe. And all round <lb/>
            its coasts are towns and villages in great numbers; and <lb/>
            the vessels which navigate its waters are likewise very <lb/>
            numerous.</p>
          <p>12. Having then passed through this strait we come to <lb/>
            the gulf of Armenia on the east, the gulf of Cantichus on <lb/>
            the south, and on the west to a third, which they call <lb/>
            Chalites.' These gulfs, after washing many islands, of <lb/>
            which but few are known, join the great Indian Ocean, <lb/>
            which is the first to receive the glowing rising of the sun, <lb/>
            and is itself of an excessive heat.</p>
          <p>13. As the pens of geographers delineate it, the whole, <lb/>
            of the region which we have been speaking of is thus <lb/>
            divided. From the north to the Caspian gates it borders <lb/>
            on the Cadusii, and on many Scythian tribes, and on the <lb/>
            Arimaspi, a fierce one-eyed people. On the west it is <lb/>
            bounded by, the Armenians, and Mount Niphates, the <lb/>
            Asiatic Albani, the Red Sea. and the Scenite Arabs, whom <lb/>
            later times have called the Saracens. To the south it looks <lb/>
            towards Mesopotamia, on the east it reaches to the Ganges, <lb/>
            which falls into the Southern Ocean after intersecting the <lb/>
            countries of the Indians.</p>
          <p>14. The principal districts of Persia, under command of <lb/>
            the Vitaxæ, that is to say of the generals of the cavalry, <lb/>
            and of the king's Satraps for the many inferior provinces <lb/>
            it would be difficult and superfluous to enumerate, are <lb/>
            Assyria. Susiana, Media, Persia, Parthia, the greater <lb/>
            Carmania, Hyrcania, Margiana, the Bactrians, the Sogdians, <lb/>
            the Sacæ, Scythia beyond Mount Emodes. Serica, Aria, <lb/>
            the Paropanisadæ, Drangiana, Arachosia, and Gedrosia. <note type="footnote"> I The probability is that all these names are corrupt. Ammianus's <lb/>
            ignorance of the relative bearings of countries makes it difficult to <lb/>
            decide what they ought to be. If the proper reading of the last name <lb/>

            to a part of the Red Sea. A French translator of the last century <lb/>

            to us, Assyria, both in renown and extent, and its varied <lb/>
            riches and fertility. It was formerly divided among <lb/>
            several peoples and tribes, but is now known under one <lb/>
            common name as Assyria. It is in that country that amid <lb/>
            its abundance of fruits and ordinary crops, there is a lake <lb/>
            named Sosingites, near which bitumen is found. In this <lb/>
            lake the Tigris is for a while absorbed, flowing beneath its <lb/>
            bed, till, at a great distance, it emerges again.</p>
          <p>16. Here also is produced naphtha, an article of a pitchy <lb/>
            and glutinous character, resembling bitumen : on which if <lb/>
            ever so small a bird perches, it finds its flight impeded and <lb/>
            speedily dies. It is a species of liquid, and when once it <lb/>
            has taken fire, human ingenuity can find nc means of ex- <lb/>
            tinguishing it except that of heaping dust. on it.</p>
          <p>17. In the same district is seen an opening in the earth <lb/>
            from which a deadly vapour arises, which by its foul <lb/>
            odour destroys any animal which comes near it. The <lb/>
            evil arises from a deep well, and if that odour spread <lb/>
            beyond its wide mouth before it rose higher, it would <lb/>
            make all the country around uninhabitable by its fetid <lb/>
            offect.</p>
          <p>18. There used, as some affirm,- to be a similar chasm <lb/>
            near Hierapolis in Phrygia; from which a noxious vapour <lb/>
            rose in like manner with a fetid smell which never ceased, <lb/>
            and destroyed everything within the reach of its influence, <lb/>
            except eunuchs; to what this was owing we leave natural <lb/>
            philosophers to determine.</p>
          <p>19. Also near the temple of the Asbamæan Jupiter, in <lb/>
            Cappadocia (in which district that eminent philosopher <lb/>
            Apollonius is said to have been born near the town of <lb/>
            Tyana), a spring rises from a marsh, which, however <lb/>
            swollen with its rising floods, never overflows its banks.</p>
          <p>20. Within this circuit is Adiabene, which was formerly <lb/>
            called Assyria, but by long custom has received its present <lb/>
            name from the circumstance, that being placed between <lb/>
            the two navigable rivers the Ona and the Tigris, it <lb/>
            can never be approached by fording; for in Greek we <lb/>
            use <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαβαίνειν</foreign> for to " cross:" this was the belief of the <lb/>
            ancients.</p>
          <p>21. But we say that in this country there are two rivers <lb/>
            which never fail, which we ourselves have crossed, the <pb n="334"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXIII, CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            Diabas, and the Adiabas: both having bridges of boats <lb/>
            over them ; and that Adiabene has received its name <lb/>
            from this last, as Homer tells us Egypt received its name <lb/>
            from its great river, and India also, and Commagena <lb/>
            which was formerly called Euphratensis, as did the <lb/>
            country now called Spain, which was formerly called <lb/>
            Iberia from the Iberus.1 And the great Spanish province <lb/>
            of Bœtica from the river Boetis.</p>
          <p>22. In this district of Adiabene is the city of Nineveh, <lb/>
            named after Ninus, a most mighty sovereign of former <lb/>
            times, and the husband of Semiramis, who was formerly <lb/>
            queen of Persia, and also the cities of Ecbatana, Arbela, <lb/>
            and Gaugamela, where Alexander, after several other <lb/>
            battles, gave the crowning defeat to Darius.</p>
          <p>23. In Assyria there are many cities, among which one <lb/>
            of the most eminent is Apamia, surnamed Mesene, and <lb/>
            Teredon, and Apollonia, and Vologesia, and many others of <lb/>
            equal importance. But the most splendid and celebrated <lb/>
            are these three, Babylon, the walls -of which Semiramis <lb/>
            cemented with pitch; for its citadel indeed was founded <lb/>
            by that most eminent monarch. Belus. And Ctesiphon <lb/>
            which Vardanes built long ago, and which subsequently <lb/>
            King Pacorus enlarged by an immigration of many citizens, <lb/>
            fortifying it also with walls, and giving it a name, made <lb/>
            it the most splendid place in Persia-next to it Seleucia, <lb/>
            the splendid work of Seleucus Nicator.</p>
          <p>24. This, however, as we have already related, was <lb/>
            stormed by the generals of Verus Cæsar, who carried the <lb/>
            image of the Cumæn Apollo to Rome, and placed it in the <lb/>
            temple of the Palatine Apollo, where it was formally <lb/>
            dedicated to that god by his priests. But it is said that <lb/>
            after this statue was carried off, and the city was bumf, <lb/>
            the soldiers, searching the temple, found a narrow hole, <lb/>
            and when this was opened in the hope of finding some- <lb/>
            thing of value in it, from some deep gulf which the secret <lb/>
            science of the Chaldæans had closed up, issued a pestilence, <lb/>
            loaded with the force of incurable disease, which in the <lb/>
            time of Verus and Marcus Antoninus polluted the whole <lb/>
            world from the borders of Persia to the Rhine and Gaul <lb/>
            with contagion and death. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Ebro. </note><note type="footnote">2 The Guadalquivir.. </note> <pb n="335"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 363.] </note> 25: Near to this is the region of the Chaldæans, the <lb/>
            nurse of the ancient philosophy, as the Chaldæans them- <lb/>
            selves affirm; and where the art of true divination has <lb/>
            most especially been conspicuous. This district is watered <lb/>
            by the noble rivers already mentioned, by the Marses, <lb/>
            by the Royal river, and by that best of all, the Euphrates, <lb/>
            which divides into three branches, and is navigable in <lb/>
            them all, having many islands, and irrigating the fields <lb/>
            around in a manner superior to any industry of cultivators, <lb/>
            making them fit both for the plough and for the production <lb/>
            of trees.</p>
          <p>. 26. Next to these come the Susians, in whose province <lb/>
            there are not many towns ; though Susa itself is celebrated <lb/>
            as a city which has often been the home of kings, and <lb/>
            Arsiana, and Sele, and Ameba. The other towns in this <lb/>
            district are unimportant and obscure. Many rivers flow <lb/>
            through this region, the chief of which are the Creates, <lb/>
            the Harax, and the Meseus, passing through the narrow <lb/>
            sandy plain which separates the Caspian from the Red Sea, <lb/>
            and then fall into the sea.</p>
          <p>27. On the left, Media is bounded by the Hyrcanian <lb/>
            Sea ;1 a country which, before the reign of the elder Cyrus <lb/>
            and the rise of Persia, we read was the supreme mistress <lb/>
            of all Asia after the Assyrians had been conquered; the <lb/>
            greater part of whose cantons had their name changed <lb/>
            into one general appellation of Acrapatena, and fell by <lb/>
            right of war under the power of the Medes.</p>
          <p>28. They are a warlike nation, and the most formidable <lb/>
            of all the eastern tribes, next to the Parthians, by whom <lb/>
            alone they are conquered. The region which they inhabit <lb/>
            is in the form of a square. All the inhabitants of these <lb/>
            districts extend over great breadth of country, reaching to <lb/>
            the foot of a lofty chain of mountains known by the names <lb/>
            of Zagrus, Orontes, and Jasonium.</p>
          <p>: 29. There is another very lofty mountain called <lb/>
            Coronus ; and those who dwell on. its western side abound <lb/>
            in -corn land and vineyards, being blessed with a most <lb/>
            fertile soil, and one enr'ched by rivers and fountains.</p>
          <p>30: They have also green meadows, and breeds of noble <lb/>
            horses, on which (as ancient writers relate, and as we <note type="footnote"> 1 Ammianus seems to distinguish between the Hyrcanian and Caspian <lb/>
            Sea, which are only different names for the same sea or inland lake.. </note> <pb n="336"/>

            ourselves have witnessed) their men when going to battle <lb/>
            mount with great exultation. They call them Nesæi.1</p>
          <p>31. They have also as many cities as Media, and villages <lb/>
            as strongly built as towns in other countries, inhabited by <lb/>
            large bodies of citizens. In short, it is the richest quarter <lb/>
            of the kingdom.</p>
          <p>32. In these districts the lands of the Magi are fertile ; <lb/>
            and it may be as well to give a short account of that sect and <lb/>
            their studies, since we have occasion to mention their name. <lb/>
            Plato, that most learned deliverer of wise opinions, teaches <lb/>
            us that Magiæ is by a mystic name Machagistia,2 that is to <lb/>
            say, the purest worship of divine beings ; of which know. <lb/>
            ledge in olden times the Bactrian Zoroaster derived much <lb/>
            from the secret rites of the Chaldasans ; and after him <lb/>
            Hystaspes, a very wise monarch, the father of Darius.</p>
          <p>33. Who while boldly penetrating into the remoter dis- <lb/>
            tricts of upper India, came to a certain woody retreat, of <lb/>
            which with its tranquil silence the Brahmans, men of sub- <lb/>
            lime genius, were the possessors. From their teaching he <lb/>
            learnt the principles of the motion of the world and of the <lb/>
            stars, and the pure rites of sacrifice, as far as he could ; and <lb/>
            of what he learnt he infused some portion into the minds <lb/>
            of the Magi, which they have handed down by tradition to <lb/>
            later ages, each instructing his own children, and adding <lb/>
            to it their own system of divination.</p>
          <p>34. From his time, though many ages to the present era, <lb/>
            a number of priests of one and the same race has arisen, <lb/>
            dedicated to the worship of the gods. And they say, if it <lb/>
            can be believed, that they even keep alive in everlasting <lb/>
            fires a flame which descended from heaven among them; <lb/>
            a small portion of which, as a favourable omen, used to <lb/>
            be borne before the kings of Asia.</p>
          <p>35. Of this class the number among the ancients was <lb/>
            small, and the Persian sovereigns employed their ministry <lb/>
            in the solemn performance of divine sacrifices, and it was <lb/>
            profanation to approach the altars, or to touch a victim <lb/>
            before a Magus with solemn prayers had poured over it a <lb/>
            preliminary libation. But becoming gradually more <note type="footnote"> . 1 A name not very unlike Nejid, to this day the most celebrated <lb/>

            numerous they arrived at the dignity and reputation of a <lb/>
            substantial race ; inhabiting towns protected by no fortifi- <lb/>
            cations, allowed to live by their own laws, and honoured <lb/>
            from the regard borne to their religion.</p>
          <p>b6. It was of this race of Magi that the ancient volumes <lb/>
            relate that after the death of Cambyses, seven men seized on <lb/>
            the kingdom of Persia, who were put down by Darius, after <lb/>
            he obtained the kingdom through the neighing of his horse.</p>
          <p>37. In this district a medical oil is prepared with which <lb/>
            if an arrow be smeared, and it be shot gently from a loose <lb/>
            bow (for it loses its effect in a rapid flight), wherever it <lb/>
            sticks it burns steadily, and if any one attempts to quench <lb/>
            it with water it only burns more fiercely, nor can it be <lb/>
            put out by any means except by throwing dust on it.</p>
          <p>38. It is made in this manner. Those skilful in such <lb/>
            arts mix common oil with a certain herb, keep it a long <lb/>
            time, and when the mixture is completed they thicken it <lb/>
            with a material derived from some natural source, like a <lb/>
            thicker oil. The material being a liquor produced in <lb/>
            Persia, and called, as I have already said, naphtha in their <lb/>
            native language.</p>
          <p>39. In this district there are many cities, the most cele- <lb/>
            brated of which are Zombis, Patigran, and Gazaca; but the <lb/>
            richest and most strongly fortified are Heraclia, Arsacia, <lb/>
            Europos, Cyropolis, and Ecbatana, all of which are situated <lb/>
            in the Syromedian region at the foot of Mount Jasonius.</p>
          <p>40. There are many rivers in this country, the principal <lb/>
            of which are the Choaspes, the Gyndes, the Amardus, the <lb/>
            Charinda, the Cambyses, and the Cyrus, to which, on account <lb/>
            of its size and beauty, the elder Cyrus, that amiable king, <lb/>
            gave its present name, abolishing that which it used to <lb/>
            bear, when he was proceeding on his expedition against <lb/>
            Scythia; his reason being that it was strong, as he ac- <lb/>
            counted himself to be, and that making its way with great <lb/>
            violence, as he proposed to do, it falls into the Caspian Sea.</p>
          <p>41. Beyond this frontier ancient Persia, stretching to- <lb/>
            wards the south, extends as far as the sea, and is very <lb/>
            thickly peopled, being also rich in grain and date-trees, <lb/>
            and well supplied with excellent water. Many of its <lb/>
            rivers fall into the gulf already mentioned, the chief of <lb/>
            which are the Vatrachites, the Rogomanis, the Brisoana, <lb/>
            and the Bagrada. <note type="footnote">z </note> <pb n="338"/>

            tain why they built nothing remarkable on the sea-coast. <lb/>
            Those of most note are Persepolis, Ardea, Obroatis, and <lb/>
            Tragonice. The only islands visible from that coast are <lb/>
            these :—Tabiana, Fara, and Alexandria.</p>
          <p>43. On the borders of this ancient Persia towards the <lb/>
            north is Parthia, a country subject to snow and frost; the <lb/>
            principal river which intersects that region is the Choatres; <lb/>
            the chief towns are Genonia, Mœsia, Charax, Apamia, <lb/>
            Artacana, and Hecatompylos ; from its frontier along the <lb/>
            shores of the Caspian Sea to the Caspian gates is a distance <lb/>
            of 1040 furlongs.</p>
          <p>44. The inhabitants of all the countries in that district <lb/>
            are fierce and warlike, and they are so fond of war and <lb/>
            battle that he who is slain in battle is accounted the hap- <lb/>
            piest of men, while those who die a natural death are re- <lb/>
            proached as degenerate and cowardly.</p>
          <p>. 45. These tribes are bounded on the east and the south <lb/>
            by Arabia Felix, so called because it abounds equally in <lb/>
            corn, cattle, vines, and every kind of spice : a great portion <lb/>
            of that country reaches on the right down to the Red Sea, <lb/>
            and on its left extends to the Persian Gulf; so that the <lb/>
            inhabitants reap the benefits of both.</p>
          <p>46. There are in that country many havens and secure <lb/>
            harbours, and well-frequented marts; many spacious and <lb/>
            splendid abodes for their kings, and wholesome springs of <lb/>
            water naturally warm, and a great number of rivers and <lb/>
            streams; the climate is temperate and healthy, so that if <lb/>
            one considers the matter rightly, the natives seem to want <lb/>
            nothing to perfect their happiness.</p>
          <p>47. There are in it very many cities both on the coast <lb/>
            and inland; many fertile hills and valleys. The chief <lb/>
            cities are Geapolis, Nascon, Baraba, Nagara, Mephra, <lb/>
            Taphra, and Dioscurias. And in both seas it possesses <lb/>
            several islands lying off the coast, which it is not worth <lb/>
            while to enumerate. But the most important of them is <lb/>
            -Turgana, in which there is said to be a magnificent temple <lb/>
            of Serapis.</p>
          <p>48. Beyond the frontier of this nation is the greater <lb/>
            Carmania, lying on high ground, and stretching to the <lb/>
            Indian Sea ; fertile in fruit and timber trees, but neither <lb/>
            so productive nor so extensive as Arabia. With rivers it <pb n="339"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 363.] </note> <lb/>
            is as well supplied, and in grass and herbage scarcely <lb/>
            inferior.</p>
          <p>49. The most important rivers are the Sagareus, the <lb/>
            Saganis, and the Hydriacus. The cities are not numerous, <lb/>
            but admirably supplied with all the necessaries and luxuries <lb/>
            of life ; the most celebrated of them all are Carmania the <lb/>
            metropolis, Portospana, Alexandria, and Hermopolis.</p>
          <p>50. Proceeding inland, we next come to the Hyrcanians, <lb/>
            who live on the coast of the sea of that name. Here the <lb/>
            land is so poor that it kills the seed crops, so that agricul- <lb/>
            ture is not much attended to; but they live by hunting, <lb/>
            taking wonderful pleasure in every kind of sport. Thou- <lb/>
            sands of tigers are found among them, and all kinds of wild <lb/>
            beasts; we have already mentioned the various devices by <lb/>
            which they are caught.</p>
          <p>51. Not indeed that they are ignorant of the art of <lb/>
            ploughing, and some districts where the soil is fertile are <lb/>
            regularly sown; nor are trees wanting to plant in suitable <lb/>
            spots: many of the people too support themselves by <lb/>
            commerce.</p>
          <p>52. In this province are two rivers of universal celebrity <lb/>
            the Oxus and the Maxera, which tigers sometimes, when <lb/>
            urged by hunger, cross by swimming, and unexpectedly <lb/>
            ravage the neighbouring districts. It has also besides <lb/>
            other smaller towns some strong cities, two on the sea- <lb/>
            shore. named Socunda and Saramanna; and some inland,. <lb/>
            such as Azmorna and Sole, and Hyrcana, of higher reputa7 <lb/>
            tion than either.</p>
          <p>53. Opposite to this tribe, towards the north, live the- <lb/>
            Abii, a very devout nation, accustomed to trample under <lb/>
            foot all worldly things, and whom, as Homer somewhat <lb/>
            fabulously says, Jupiter keeps in view from Mount Ida.</p>
          <p>54. The regions next to the Hyrcaneans are possessed <lb/>
            by the Margiani, whose district is almost wholly sur- <lb/>
            rounded by high hills, by which they are separated from <lb/>
            the sea; and although the greater part of this province is <lb/>
            deserted from want of water, still there are some towns in <lb/>
            it; the best known of which are Jasonium Antiochia, and <lb/>
            Nisæa.</p>
          <p>55. Next to them are the Bactrians, a nation formerly <lb/>
            very warlike and powerful, and always hostile to the <lb/>
            Persians, till they drew all the nations around under theii <pb n="340"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXIII. CH. VI. </note> <lb/>
            dominion, and united them under their own name; and in <lb/>
            old time the Bactrian kings were formidable even to Arsaces.</p>
          <p>56. The greater part of their country, like that of <lb/>
            the Margiani, is situated far from the sea-shore, but its <lb/>
            soil is fertile, and the cattle which feed both on the plains <lb/>
            and on the mountains in that district are very large and <lb/>
            powerful; of this the camels which Mithridates brought <lb/>
            from thence, and which were first seen by the Romans at <lb/>
            the siege of Cyzicus, are a proof.</p>
          <p>57. Many tribes are subject to the Bactrians, the most <lb/>
            considerable of which are the Tochari: their country is <lb/>
            like Italy in the number of its rivers, some of which are <lb/>
            the Artemis and the Zariaspes, which were formerly <lb/>
            joined, and the Ochus and Orchomanes, which also unite <lb/>
            and afterwards fall into the Oxus, and increase that large <lb/>
            river with their streams.</p>
          <p>58. There are also cities in that country, many of them on <lb/>
            the border of different rivers, the best of which are Chatra, <lb/>
            Charte, Alicodra, Astacea, Menapila, and Bactra itself, <lb/>
            which has given its name both to the region and to the <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>59. At the foot of the mountains lie a people called the <lb/>
            Sogdians, in whose country are two rivers navigable for <lb/>
            large vessels, the Araxates and the Dymas, which, flowing <lb/>
            among the hills and through the valleys into the open plain, <lb/>
            form the extensive Oxian marsh. In this district the most <lb/>
            celebrated towns are Alexandria, Cyreschata, and Drepsa <lb/>
            the metropolis.</p>
          <p>60. Bordering on these are the Sacæ, a fierce nation <lb/>
            dwelling in a gloomy-looking district, only fit for cattle, <lb/>
            and on that account destitute of cities. They are at the <lb/>
            foot of Mount Ascanimia and Mount Comedus, along the <lb/>
            bottom of which, and by a town called tho Stone Tower, <lb/>
            is the long road much frequented by merchants which <lb/>
            leads to China.</p>
          <p>61. Around the glens at the bottom of the Imauian and <lb/>
            Tapurian mountains, and within the Persian frontier, is a <lb/>
            tribe of Scythians, bordering on the Asiatic Sarmatians, <lb/>
            and touching the furthest side of the Allemanni, who, like <lb/>
            dwellers in a secluded spot, and made for solitude, are <lb/>
            scattered over the regions at long distances from one <lb/>
            another, and live on hard and poor food. <pb n="341"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> A.D. 363.] </note> 62. And various tribes inhabit these districts, which, as <lb/>
            I am hastening to other topics, I think superfluous to <lb/>
            enumerate. But this is worth knowing, that among these <lb/>
            tribes, which are almost unapproachable on account of their <lb/>
            excessive ferocity, there are some races of gentle and <lb/>
            devout men, as the Jaxartæ and the Galactophagi, whom <lb/>
            Homer mentions in his verses:- <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_02_fig3.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>63. Among the many rivers which flow through this <lb/>
            land, either uniting at last with larger streams, or proceed- <lb/>
            in- straight to the sea, the most celebrated are the Rœm- <lb/>
            nus, the Jaxartes, and the Talicus. There are but three <lb/>
            cities there of any note, Aspabota, Chauriana, and Saga.</p>
          <p>64. Beyond the districts of the two Scythias, on the <lb/>
            eastern side, is a ring of mountains which surround Serica, <lb/>
            a country considerable both for its extent and the fertility <lb/>
            of its soil. This tribe on their western side border on <lb/>
            the Scythians, on the north and the east they look towards <lb/>
            snowy deserts; towards the south they extend as far as <lb/>
            India and the Ganges. The best known of its mountains <lb/>
            a e Annib, Nazavicium, Asmira, Emodon, and Opurocarra.</p>
          <p>65. The plain, which descends very suddenly from the <lb/>
            hills, and is of considerable extent, is watered by two <lb/>
            famous rivers, the Œchardes and the Bautis, which is <lb/>
            less rapid than the other. The character too of the dif- <lb/>
            ferent districts is very varied. One is extensive and level, <lb/>
            the other is on a gentle slope, and therefore very fertile in <lb/>
            corn, and cattle, and trees.</p>
          <p>66. The most fertile part of the country is inhabited by <lb/>
            various tribes, of which the Alitrophagi, the Annibi, the <lb/>
            Sisyges, and the Chardi lie to the north, exposed to the <lb/>
            frost; towards the east are the Rabannae, the Asmiræ, and <lb/>
            the Essedones, the most powerful of all, who are joined on <lb/>
            the west by the Athagoræ, and the Aspacaræ; and on the <lb/>
            south by the Betæ, who live on the highest slopes of the <lb/>
            mountains. Though they have not many cities they have <lb/>
            some of great size and wealth ; the most beautiful and re- <lb/>
            nowned of which are Asmira, Essedon, Asparata, and Sera.</p>
          <p>67. The Seres themselves live quietly, always avoid <note type="footnote">1 Il. xiii. 10. </note> <pb n="342"/>
            <note type="margin"> [Bx. XXIII. Cir. VI </note> <lb/>
            ing arms and battles ; and as ease is pleasant to moderate <lb/>
            and quiet men, they give trouble to none of their neigh- <lb/>
            bours. Their climate is agreeable and healthy; the sky <lb/>
            serene, the breezes gentle and delicious. They have <lb/>
            numbers of shining groves, the trees of which through <lb/>
            continued watering produce a crop like the fleece of a <lb/>
            sheep, which the natives make into a delicate wool, and <lb/>
            spin into a kind of fine cloth, formerly confined to the use <lb/>
            of the nobles but now procurable by the lowest of the people <lb/>
            without distinction.</p>
          <p>68. The natives themselves are the most frugal of men, <lb/>
            cultivating a peaceful life, and shunning the society of <lb/>
            other men. And when strangers cross their river to buy <lb/>
            their cloth, or any other of their merchandise, they inter- <lb/>
            change no conversation, but settle the price of the articles <lb/>
            wanted by nods and signs ; and they are so moderate that, <lb/>
            while selling their own produce, they never buy any <lb/>
            foreign wares.</p>
          <p>69. Beyond the Scres, towards the north, live the <lb/>
            Ariani; their land is intersected by a navigable river called <lb/>
            the Arias, which forms a huge lake known by the same <lb/>
            name. This district of Asia is full of towns, the most <lb/>
            illustrious of which are Bitaxa, Sarmatina, Sotera, Nisibis, <lb/>
            and Alexandria, from which last down the river to the <lb/>
            Caspian Sea is a distance of fifteen hundred furlongs.</p>
          <p>70. Close to their border, living on the slopes of the <lb/>
            mountains, are the Paropanisatæ, looking on the east to- <lb/>
            wards India, and on the west towards Mount Caucasus. <lb/>
            Their principal river is Ortogordomaris, which rises in <lb/>
            Bactria. They have some cities, the principal being Agazaca, <lb/>
            Naulibus, and Ortopana, from which if you coast along the <lb/>
            shore to the borders of Media which are nearest to the <lb/>
            Caspian gates, the distance is two thousand two hundred <lb/>
            furlongs.</p>
          <p>71. Next to them, among the hills, are the Drangiani, <lb/>
            whose chief river is the Arabis, so called because it rises <lb/>
            in Arabia ; and their two principal towns are Prophthasia <lb/>
            and Aniaspe, both wealthy and well known.</p>
          <p>72. Next to them is Arachosia, which on the right <lb/>
            extends as far as India. It is abundantly watered by a <lb/>
            river much smaller than the Indus, that greatest of rivers, <lb/>
            which gives its name to the surrounding regions; in fact <pb n="343"/>
            <note type="margin"> AJ). 363.J </note> <lb/>
            their river flows out of the Indus, and passes on till it <lb/>
            forms the marsh known as Arachotoscrene. Its leading <lb/>
            cities are Alexandria, Arbaca, and Choaspa.</p>
          <p>73. In the most inland districts of Persia is Gedrosia; <lb/>
            which on its right touches the frontier of India, and is <lb/>
            fertilized by several rivers, of which the greatest is the <lb/>
            Artabius. There the Barbitani mountains end, and from <lb/>
            their lowest parts rise several rivers which fall into the <lb/>
            Indus, losing their own names in the greatness of that <lb/>
            superior stream. They have several islands, and their <lb/>
            principal cities are Sedratyra and Gynæcon.</p>
          <p>74. We need not detail minutely every portion of the sea- <lb/>
            coast on the extremity of Persia, as it would lead us into <lb/>
            too long a digression. It will suffice to say that the sea <lb/>
            which stretches from the Caspian mountains along the <lb/>
            northern side to the straits above mentioned, is nine thou- <lb/>
            sand furlongs in extent; the southern frontier, from the <lb/>
            mouth of the Nile to the beginning of Carmania, is four- <lb/>
            teen thousand furlongs.</p>
          <p>75. In these varied districts of different languages, the <lb/>
            races of men are as different as the places. But to describe <lb/>
            their persons and customs in general terms, they are nearly <lb/>
            all slight in figure, swarthy or rather of a pale livid com- <lb/>
            plexion ; fierce-looking, with goat-like eyes, and eyebrows <lb/>
            arched in a semicircle and joined, with handsome beards, <lb/>
            and long hair. They at all times, even at banquets and <lb/>
            festivals, wear swords; a custom which that excellent <lb/>
            author Thucydides tells us the Athenians were the first of <lb/>
            the Greeks to lay aside.</p>
          <p>76. They are generally amazingly addicted to amatory <lb/>
            pleasures; each man scarcely contenting himself with a <lb/>
            multitude of concubines: from unnatural vices they are <lb/>
            free. Each man marries many or few wives, as he can <lb/>
            afford them, so that natural affection is lost among them <lb/>
            because of the numerous objects of their licence. They <lb/>
            are frugal in their banquets, avoiding immoderate indulg- <lb/>
            ence and especially hard drinking, as they would the plague.</p>
          <p>77. Nor, except at the king's table, have they any <lb/>
            settled time for dining, but each man's stomach serves as <lb/>
            his sun-dial; nor does any one eat after he is satisfied.</p>
          <p>78. They are marvellously temperate and cautious, so <lb/>
            that when sometimes marching among the gardens an! <pb n="344"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. XXIII. CH. vt </note> <lb/>
            vineyards of enemies, they neither desire nor touch any- <lb/>
            thing, from fear of poison or witcheraft.</p>
          <p>79. They perform all the secret functions of nature with <lb/>
            the most scrupulous secrecy and modesty.</p>
          <p>80. But they are so loose in their gait, and move with <lb/>
            such correct ease and freedom, that you would think them <lb/>
            effeminate, though they are most vigorous warriors; still <lb/>
            they are rather crafty than bold, and are most formi- <lb/>
            dable at a distance. They abound in empty words, and <lb/>
            speak wildly and fiercely; they talk big, are proud, un- <lb/>
            manageable, and threatening alike in prosperity and adver- <lb/>
            sity ; they are cunning, arrogant, and eruel, exercising the <lb/>
            power of life and death over their slaves, and all low-born <lb/>
            plebeians. They flay men alive, both piecemeal, and by <lb/>
            stripping off the whole skin. No servant while waiting <lb/>
            on them, or standing at their table, may gape, speak, or <lb/>
            spit, so that their mouths are completely shut.</p>
          <p>81. Their laws are remarkably severe ; the most stringent <lb/>
            are against ingratitude and against deserters ; some too <lb/>
            are abominable, inasmuch as for the crime of one man they <lb/>
            condemn all his relations.</p>
          <p>82. But as those only are appointed judges who are <lb/>
            men of proved experience and uprightness, and of such <lb/>
            wisdom as to stand in no need of advice, they laugh at <lb/>
            our custom of sometimes appointing men of eloquence <lb/>
            and skill in public jurisprudence as guides to ignorant <lb/>
            judges. The story that one judge was compelled to sit <lb/>
            on the skin of another, who had been condemned for his <lb/>
            injustice, is either an ancient fable, or else, if ever there <lb/>
            was sueh a custom, it has become obsolete.</p>
          <p>83. In military system and discipline, by eontinual ex- <lb/>
            ereises in the business of the camp, and the adoption of <lb/>
            the various manoeuvres which they have learnt from us, <lb/>
            they have become formidable even to the greatest armies ; <lb/>
            they trust chiefly to the valour of their cavalry, in which <lb/>
            all their nobles and rich men serve. Their infantry are <lb/>
            armed like mirmillos,1 and are as obedient as grooms ; and <lb/>
            they always follow the cavalry like a band condemned to <lb/>
            everlasting slavery, never receiving either pay or gratuity. <lb/>
            This nation, besides those whom it has permanently sub- <note type="correspondsTo" n="1 A kind of gladiator."/> <pb n="345"/>
            <note type="margin"> A.D. 363.) </note> <lb/>
            dued, has also compelled many others to go under the <lb/>
            yoke ; so brave is it and so skilful in all warlike exercises, <lb/>
            that it would be invincible were it not continually weak- <lb/>
            ened by civil and by foreign wars.</p>
          <p>84. Most of them wear garments brilliant with various <lb/>
            colours, so completely enveloping the body that even <lb/>
            though they leave the bosoms and sides of their robes <lb/>
            open so as to flutter in the wind, still from their shoes to <lb/>
            their head no part of their person is exposed. After con- <lb/>
            quering Crœsus and subduing Lydia, they learnt also to <lb/>
            wear golden armlets and necklaces, and jewels, especially <lb/>
            pearls, of which they had great quantities.</p>
          <p>85. It only remains for me to say a few words about the <lb/>
            origin of this stone. Among the Indians and Persians <lb/>
            pearls are found in strong white sea-shells, being created <lb/>
            at a regular time by the admixture of dew. For the shells, <lb/>
            desiring as it were a kind of copulation, open so as to <lb/>
            receive moisture from the nocturnal aspersion. Then <lb/>
            becoming big they produce little pearls in triplets, or <lb/>
            pairs, or unions, which are so called because the shells <lb/>
            when scaled often produce only single pearls, which then <lb/>
            are larger.</p>
          <p>86. And a proof that this produce arises from and is <lb/>
            nourished by some aerial derivation rather than by any <lb/>
            fattening power in the sea, is that the drops of morning <lb/>
            dew when infused into them make the stones bright and <lb/>
            round; while the evening dew makes them crooked and <lb/>
            red, and sometimes spotted. They become either small or <lb/>
            large in proportion to the quality of the moisture which <lb/>
            they imbibe, and other circumstances. When they are <lb/>
            shaken, as is often the case by thunder, the shells either <lb/>
            become empty, or produce only weak pearls, or such as <lb/>
            never come to maturity.</p>
          <p>87. Fishing for them is difficult and dangerous, and <lb/>
            this circumstance increases their value ; because, on account <lb/>
            of the snares of the fishermen they are said to avoid the <lb/>
            shores most frequented by them, and hide around rocks <lb/>
            which are difficult of access and the hiding places of <lb/>
            sharks.</p>
          <p>88. We are not ignorant that the same species of jewel <lb/>
            is also produced and collected in the remote parts of the <lb/>
            British sea; though of an inferior value.</p>

          <p>ARGUMENT.</p>
          <p>I. Julian invades Assyria with his army; receives the surrender of <lb/>
            Anatha, a fort on the Euphrates, and burns it.—II. Having made <lb/>
            attempts on other fortresses and towns, he burns some which were <lb/>
            deserted, and receives the surrender of Pirisabora, and burns it.- <lb/>
            III. On account of his successes, he promises his soldiers one <lb/>
            hundred denarii a man; and as they disdain so small a donation, <lb/>
            lie in a modest oration recalls them to a proper feeling.—IV. The <lb/>
            town of Maogamaleha is stormed by the Romans, and rased to the <lb/>
            ground.—V. The Romans storm a fort of great strength, both in <lb/>
            its situation and fortifications, and burn it.—VI. Julian defeats <lb/>
            the Persians, slays two thousand five hundred of them, with the <lb/>
            loss of hardly seventy of his own men; and in a public assembly <lb/>
            presents many of his soldiers with erowns.—VII. Being deterred <lb/>
            from laying siege to Ctesiphon, he rashly orders all his boats to <lb/>
            be burnt, and retreats from the river.—VIII. As he was neither <lb/>
            able to make bridges, nor to be joined by a portion of his forces, <lb/>
            he determines to return by Corduena.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER having ascertained the alacrity of his army, <lb/>
            which with ardour and unanimity declared with their <lb/>
            customary shout that their fortunate emperor was invin- <lb/>
            cible, Julian thinking it well to put an early end to his <lb/>
            enterprise, after a quiet night ordered the trumpets to <lb/>
            sound a march ; and everything being prepared which the <lb/>
            arduous difficulties of the war required, he at daybreak <lb/>
            entered the Assyrian territory in high spirits, riding in <lb/>
            front of his ranks, and exciting all to discharge the duties <lb/>
            of brave men in emulation of his own courage.</p>
          <p>2. And as a leader of experience and skill, fearing lest <lb/>
            his ignorance of the country might lead to his being sur- <lb/>
            prised by secret ambuscades, he began his march in line <lb/>
            of battle. He ordered fifteen hundred skirmishers to <lb/>
            precede him a short distance, who were to march slowly <lb/>
            looking out on each side and also in front, to prevent any <lb/>
            sudden attack. The infantry in the centre were under <lb/>
            his own command, they being the flower and chief strength <pb n="347"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            of the whole army, while on the right were some legions <lb/>
            under Nevitta, who was ordered to march along the banks <lb/>
            of the Euphrates. The left wing with the cavalry he <lb/>
            gave to Arinthæus and Hormisdas, with orders to lead <lb/>
            them in close order through the level and easy country <lb/>
            of the plain. The rear was brought up by Dagalaiphus <lb/>
            and Victor, and the last of all was Secundinus, Duke of <lb/>
            Osdruena.</p>
          <p>3. Then in order to alarm the enemy by the idea of his <lb/>
            superior numbers, should they attack him anywhere, or <lb/>
            perceive him from a distance, he opened his ranks so as <lb/>
            to spread both horses and men over a larger space, in such <lb/>
            a way that the rear was distant from the van nearly ten <lb/>
            miles : a manoeuvre of great skill which Pyrrhus of Epirus <lb/>
            is said to have often put in practice, extending his camp, <lb/>
            or his lines, and sometimes on the other hand compressing <lb/>
            them all, so as to present an appearance of greater or lesser <lb/>
            numbers than the reality, according to the circumstances of <lb/>
            the moment.</p>
          <p>4. The baggage, the sutlers, all the camp-followers, and <lb/>
            every kind of equipment, he placed between the two flanks <lb/>
            of troops as they marched, so as not to leave them unpro- <lb/>
            tected and liable to be carried off by any sudden attack, as <lb/>
            has often happened. The fleet, although the river was <lb/>
            exceedingly winding, was not allowed either to fall behind <lb/>
            or to advance before the army.</p>
          <p>5. After two days' march we came near a deserted <lb/>
            town called Dura, on the bank of the river, where many <lb/>
            herds of deer were found, some of which were slain by <lb/>
            arrows, and others knocked down with the heavy oars, so <lb/>
            that soldiers and sailors all had plenty of food ; though the <lb/>
            greater part of the animals, being used to swimming, <lb/>
            plunged into the rapid stream and could not be stopped <lb/>
            till they had reached their well known haunts.</p>
          <p>6. Then after an easy march of four days, as evening <lb/>
            came on, he embarked a thousand light-armed troops on <lb/>
            board his boats, and sent the Count Lucillianus to storm <lb/>
            the fortress of Anatha, which, like many other forts in that <lb/>
            country, is surrounded by the waters of the Euphrates; <lb/>
            Lncillianus having, as he was ordered, placed his ships in <lb/>
            suitable places, besieged the island, a cloudy night favour- <lb/>
            ing a secret assault.</p><pb n="348"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="(BK. XXIV. CH. I."/> 7. But as soon as it became light, one of the garrison <lb/>
            going out to get water, saw the enemy, and immediately <lb/>
            raised an outcry, which roused the awakened garrison to <lb/>
            arm in their defence. And presently, from a high watch- <lb/>
            tower, the emperor examined the situation of the fort, and <lb/>
            came up with all speed escorted by two vessels, and fol- <lb/>
            lowed by a considerable squadron laden with engines for <lb/>
            the siege.</p>
          <p>8. And as he approached the walls, and considered that <lb/>
            the contest could not be carried on without great risk, he <lb/>
            tried both by conciliatory and threatening language to in- <lb/>
            duce the garrison to surrender; and they, having invited <lb/>
            Hormisdas to a conference, were won over by his promises <lb/>
            and oaths to rely on the mercy of the Romans.</p>
          <p>9. At last, driving before them a crowned ox, which <lb/>
            among them is a sign of peace, they descended from the <lb/>
            fort as suppliants; the fort was burnt, and Pusæus, its <lb/>
            commander, who was afterwards Duke of Egypt, was <lb/>
            appointed to the rank of tribune. The rest of the garrison <lb/>
            with their families and property were conducted with all <lb/>
            kindness to the Syrian city of Chalcis.</p>
          <p>10. Among them was found a certain soldier, who <lb/>
            formerly, when Maximian invaded Persia, had been left in <lb/>
            this district as an invalid, though a very young man, but <lb/>
            who was now bent with age, and according to his own <lb/>
            account had several wives, as is the custom of that country, <lb/>
            and a numerous offspring. He now full of joy, professing <lb/>
            to have been a principal cause of the surrender, was led to <lb/>
            our camp, calling many of his comrades to witness that he <lb/>
            had long foreseen and often foretold that, though nearly a <lb/>
            hundred years' old, he should be buried in Roman ground. <lb/>
            After this event, the Saracens brought in some skirmishers <lb/>
            of the enemy whom they had taken ; these were received <lb/>
            with joy by the emperor, the Saracens rewarded, and sent <lb/>
            back to achieve similar exploits.</p>
          <p>11. The next day another disaster took place ; a whirl wind <lb/>
            arose, and made havoc in many places, throwing down many <lb/>
            buildings, tearing in pieces the tents, and throwing the <lb/>
            soldiers on their backs or on their faces, the violence of the <lb/>
            wind overpowering their steadiness of foot. And the same <lb/>
            day another equally perilous occurrence took place. For the <lb/>
            river suddenly overflowed its banks, and some of the ships <pb n="349"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D..363.]"/> <lb/>
            laden with provisions were wrecked, the piers and dams <lb/>
            which had been constructed of stone to check and repress <lb/>
            the waters being swept away ; and whether that was done <lb/>
            by treachery or through the weight of the waters could not <lb/>
            be known.</p>
          <p>12. After having stormed and burnt the chief city, and <lb/>
            sent away the prisoners, the army with increased conn- <lb/>
            dence raised triumphant shouts in honour of the emperor, <lb/>
            thinking that the gods were evidently making him the <lb/>
            object of their peculiar care.</p>
          <p>13. And because in these unknown districts they were <lb/>
            forced to be on unusual guard against hidden dangers, the <lb/>
            troops especially feared the craft and exceeding deceitful- <lb/>
            ness of the enemy; and therefore the emperor was every- <lb/>
            where, sometimes in front, sometimes with his light- <lb/>
            armed battalions protecting the rear, in order to see that <lb/>
            no concealed danger threatened it, reconnoitring the dense <lb/>
            jungles and valleys, and restraining the distant sallies of <lb/>
            his soldiers, sometimes with his natural gentleness, and <lb/>
            sometimes with threats.</p>
          <p>14. But he allowed the fields of the enemy which were <lb/>
            loaded with every kind of produce to be burnt with their <lb/>
            crops and cottages, after his men had collected all that they <lb/>
            could themselves make use of. And in this way the enemy <lb/>
            were terribly injured before they were aware of it; for <lb/>
            the soldiers freely used what they had acquired with their <lb/>
            own hands, thinking that they had found a fresh field for <lb/>
            their valour; and joyful at the abundance of their supplies, <lb/>
            they saved what they had in their own boats.-</p>
          <p>15. But one rash soldier, being intoxicated, and having <lb/>
            crossed over to the opposite bank of the river, was taken <lb/>
            prisoner before our eyes by the enemy, and was put to <lb/>
            death.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. AFTER this we arrived at a fort called Thilutha. situated <lb/>
            in the middle of the river on a very high piece of ground, <lb/>
            and fortified by nature as if by the art of man. The inha- <lb/>
            bitants were invited gently, as was best, to surrender, <lb/>
            since the height of their fort made it impregnable; but <lb/>
            they refused all terms as yet, though they answered that <lb/>
            when the Romans had advanced further so as to occupy the <pb n="350"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIV. CH. II."/> <lb/>
            interior of the country, they also as an appendage would <lb/>
            come over to the conqueror.</p>
          <p>2. Having made this reply they quietly looked down upon <lb/>
            our boats as they passed under the very walls without <lb/>
            attempting to molest them. When that fort was passed we <lb/>
            came to another called Achaiacala, also defended by the <lb/>
            river flowing round it, and difficult to scale, where we <lb/>
            received a similar answer, and so passed on. The next <lb/>
            day we came to another fort which had been deserted <lb/>
            because its walls were weak; and we burnt it and pro- <lb/>
            ceeded.</p>
          <p>3. In the two next days we marched two hundred fur- <lb/>
            longs, and arrived at a place called Paraxmalcha. We <lb/>
            then crossed the river, and seven miles further on we <lb/>
            entered the city of Diacira, which we found empty of <lb/>
            inhabitants but full of corn and excellent salt, and here we <lb/>
            saw a temple placed on the summit of a lofty height. We <lb/>
            burnt the city and put a few women to death whom we <lb/>
            found there, and having passed a bituminous spring, we <lb/>
            entered the town of Ozogardana, which its inhabitants had <lb/>
            deserted for fear of our approaching army ; in that town is <lb/>
            shown a tribunal of the emperor Trajan.</p>
          <p>4. This town also we burnt after we had rested there <lb/>
            two days to refresh our bodies. On the second day just <lb/>
            at nightfall, the Surena (who is the officer next in rank to <lb/>
            the king among the Persians), and a man named Malechus <lb/>
            Podosaces, the chief of the Assanite Saracens, who had long <lb/>
            ravaged our frontiers with great ferocity, laid a snare for <lb/>
            Hormisdas, whom by some means or other they had learnt <lb/>
            was about to go forth on a reconnoitring expedition, and <lb/>
            only failed because the river being very narrow at that <lb/>
            point, was so deep as to be unfordable.</p>
          <p>5. And so at daybreak, when the enemy were now in <lb/>
            sight, the moment that they were discovered by their <lb/>
            glittering helmets and bristling armour, our men sprang <lb/>
            up vigorously to the conflict, and dashed at them with <lb/>
            great courage; and although the enemy wielded their huge <lb/>
            bows with great strength, and the glistening of their <lb/>
            weapons increased the alarm of our soldiers, yet their rage, <lb/>
            and the compactness of their ranks, kept alive and added <lb/>
            fuel to their courage.</p>
          <p>6. Animated by their first success, our army advanced <pb n="351"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            to the village of Macepracta, where were seen vestiges <lb/>
            of walls half destroyed, which had once been of great <lb/>
            extent, and had served to protect Assyria from foreign <lb/>
            invasion.</p>
          <p>7. At this point a portion of the river is drawn off in <lb/>
            large canals which convey it to the interior districts of <lb/>
            Babylonia, for the service of the surrounding country and <lb/>
            cities. Another branch of the river known as the Naha- <lb/>
            malca, which means “the river of kings," passes by Ctesi- <lb/>
            phon at the beginning of this stream there is a lofty <lb/>
            tower like a lighthouse, by which our infantry passed on <lb/>
            a carefully constructed bridge.</p>
          <p>8. The cavalry and cattle then took the stream where <lb/>
            it was less violent, and swam across obliquely; another <lb/>
            body was suddenly attacked by the enemy with a storm of <lb/>
            arrows and javelins, but our light-armed auxiliaries as <lb/>
            soon as they reached the other side, supported them, and <lb/>
            put the enemy to flight, cutting them to pieces as they fled.</p>
          <p>9. After having successfully accomplished this exploit, <lb/>
            we arrived at the city of Pirisabora, of great size and <lb/>
            populousness, and also surrounded with water. But the <lb/>
            emperor having ridden all round the walls and recon- <lb/>
            noitred its position, began to lay siege to it with great <lb/>
            caution, as if he would make the townsmen abandon its <lb/>
            defence from mere terror. But after several negotiations <lb/>
            and conferences with them, as they would yield neither to <lb/>
            promises nor to threats, he set about the siege in earnest, <lb/>
            and surrounded the walls with three lines of soldiers. The <lb/>
            whole of the first day the combat was carried on with <lb/>
            missiles till nightfall.</p>
          <p>10. But the garrison, full of courage and vigour, spread- <lb/>
            ing cloths loose everywhere over the battlements to weaken <lb/>
            the attacks of our weapons, and protected by shields strongly <lb/>
            woven of osier, made a brave resistance, looking like figures <lb/>
            of iron, since they had plates of iron closely fitting over <lb/>
            every limb, which covered their whole person with a safe <lb/>
            defence.</p>
          <p>11. Sometimes also they earnestly invited Hormisdas as <lb/>
            a countryman and a prince of royal blood to a conference; <lb/>
            but when he came they reviled him with abuse and <lb/>
            reproaches as a traitor and deserter; and after a great part <lb/>
            of the day had been consumed in this slow disputing, at the <pb n="352"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIV. CH. a."/> <lb/>
            beginning of night many kinds of engines were brought <lb/>
            against the walls, and we began to fill up the ditches.</p>
          <p>12. But before it was quite dawn, the garrison perceived <lb/>
            what was being done, with the addition that a violent <lb/>
            stroke of a battering-ram had broken down a tower at one <lb/>
            corner; so they abandoned the double city wall, and occu- <lb/>
            pied a citadel close to the wall, erected on the level summit <lb/>
            of a ragged hill, of which the centre, rising up to a great <lb/>
            height in its round circle, resembled an Argive shield, <lb/>
            except that in the north it was not quite round, but at <lb/>
            that point it was protected by a precipice which ran sheer <lb/>
            down into the Euphrates ; the walls were built of baked <lb/>
            bricks and bitumen, a combination which is well known <lb/>
            to be the strongest of all materials.</p>
          <p>13. And now the savage soldiery, having traversed the <lb/>
            city, which they found empty, were fighting fiercely with <lb/>
            the defenders who poured all kinds of missiles on them from <lb/>
            the citadel. Being hard pressed by the catapults and <lb/>
            balistæ of our men, they also raised on the height huge <lb/>
            bows of great power, the extremities of which, rising high <lb/>
            on each side, could only be bent slowly; but the string, <lb/>
            when loosed by violent exertion of the fingers, sent forth <lb/>
            iron-tipped arrows with such force as to inflict fatal wounds <lb/>
            on any one whom they struck.</p>
          <p>14. Nevertheless, the fight was maintained on both sides <lb/>
            with showers of stones thrown by the hand, and as neither <lb/>
            gained any ground a fierce contest was protracted from <lb/>
            daybreak to nightfall with great obstinacy; and at last <lb/>
            they parted without any advantage to either side. The <lb/>
            next day the fight was renewed with great violence, and <lb/>
            numbers were slain on each side, and still the result was <lb/>
            even ; when the emperor, being eager amid this reciprocal <lb/>
            slaughter to try every chance, being guarded by a solid <lb/>
            column, and defended from the arrows of the enemy by <lb/>
            their closely packed shields, rushed forward with a rapid <lb/>
            charge up to the enemy's gates, which were faced with <lb/>
            stout iron.</p>
          <p>15. And although he was still in some danger, being <lb/>
            hard pressed with stones and bullets and other weapons, <lb/>
            still he cheered on his men with frequent war-cries while <lb/>
            they were preparing to force in the gates in order to effect <lb/>
            an entrance, and did not retreat till he found himself on <pb n="353"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="a.D. 333.] "/>the point of being entirely overwhelmed by the mass of <lb/>
            missiles which were poured down on him.</p>
          <p>16. However, he came off safe with only a few of his <lb/>
            men slightly wounded; not without feeling some modest <lb/>
            shame at being repulsed. For he had read that Scipio <lb/>
            AEmilianus, with the historian Polybius, a citizen of Mega- <lb/>
            lopolis in Arcadia, and thirty thousand soldiers, had, by a <lb/>
            similar attack, forced the gate of Carthage.</p>
          <p>17. But the account given by the old writers may serve <lb/>
            to defend this modern attempt; for Æmilianus approached <lb/>
            a gate protected by a stone-covered testudo, under which <lb/>
            he safely forced his way into the city while the garrison <lb/>
            was occupied in demolishing this stone roof. But Julian <lb/>
            attacked a place completely exposed, while' the whole face <lb/>
            of heaven was darkened by the fragments of rock and <lb/>
            weapons which were showered upon him, and was even <lb/>
            then with great difficulty repulsed and forced to retire.</p>
          <p>18. After this hasty and tumultuous assault, as the vast <lb/>
            preparations of sheds and mounds which were carried on <lb/>
            were attended with much difficulty, through the hindrances <lb/>
            offered by the garrison, Julian ordered an engine called <lb/>
            helepolis to be constructed with all speed; which, as we <lb/>
            have already mentioned, King Demetrius used, and earned <lb/>
            the title of Poliorcetes by the number of cities which he took.</p>
          <p>19. The garrison, anxiously viewing this engine, which <lb/>
            was to exceed the height of their lofty towers, and consi- <lb/>
            dering at the same time the determination of the besiegers, <lb/>
            suddenly betook themselves to supplications, and spreading <lb/>
            over the towers and walls, imploring the pardon and pro- <lb/>
            tection of the Romans with outstretched hands.</p>
          <p>20. And when they saw that the works of the Romans <lb/>
            were suspended, and that those who were constructing <lb/>
            them were doing nothing, which seemed a sure token of <lb/>
            peace, they requested an opportunity of conferring with <lb/>
            Hormisdas.</p>
          <p>21. And when this was granted, Mamersides, the com- <lb/>
            mander of the garrison, was let down by a rope, and con- <lb/>
            ducted to the emperor as he desired ; and having received <lb/>
            a promise of his own life, and of impunity to all his com- <lb/>
            rades. he was allowed to return to the city. And when <lb/>
            he related what had been done, the citizens unanimously <lb/>
            agreed to follow his advice and accept the terms; and <note type="footnote">2 A </note> <pb n="354"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIV. CH. III"/> <lb/>
            peace was solemnly made with all the sanctions of religion, <lb/>
            the gates were thrown open, and the whole population <lb/>
            went forth proclaiming that a protecting genius had shone <lb/>
            upon them in the person of the great and merciful Cæsar.</p>
          <p>22. The number of those who surrendered was two <lb/>
            thousand five hundred, for the rest of the citizens, expect- <lb/>
            ing the siege beforehand, had crossed the river in small <lb/>
            boats and abandoned the city. In the citadel a great store <lb/>
            of arms and provisions was found; and after they had <lb/>
            taken what they required, the conquerors burnt the rest as <lb/>
            well as the place itself.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THE day after these transactions, serious news reached <lb/>
            the emperor as he was quietly taking his dinner, that the <lb/>
            Surena, the Persian general, had surprised three squadrons <lb/>
            of our advanced guard, and slain a few, among whom was <lb/>
            one tribune; and had also taken a standard.</p>
          <p>2. Immediately Julian became violently exasperated, <lb/>
            and flew to the spot with an armed band, placing much <lb/>
            hope of success in the rapidity of his movements: he <lb/>
            routed the assailants disgracefully, cashiered the other <lb/>
            two tribunes as blunderers and cowards, and in imitation <lb/>
            of the ancient laws of Rome disbanded ten of the soldiers <lb/>
            who had fled, and then condemned them to death.</p>
          <p>3. Then, having burnt the city as I have already <lb/>
            mentioned, he mounted a tribunal which he had caused to <lb/>
            be erected, and having convoked his army, he thanked <lb/>
            them, and counted upon their achieving other similar ex- <lb/>
            ploits. He also promised them each a hundred pieces of <lb/>
            silver; but seeing that they were inclined to murmur, as <lb/>
            being disappointed at the smallness of the sum, he became <lb/>
            most indignant and said :-</p>
          <p>4. " Behold the Persians who abound in wealth of <lb/>
            every kind; their riches may enrich you if we only <lb/>
            behave gallantly with one unanimous spirit of resolution. <lb/>
            But after having been very rich, I assure you that the <lb/>
            republic is at this moment in great want, through the <lb/>
            conduct of those men who, to increase their own wealth, <lb/>
            taught former emperors to return home after buying peace <lb/>
            of the barbarians with gold.</p>
          <p>5 “ The treasury is empty, the cities are exhausted, <pb n="355"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.J"/> <lb/>
            the finances are stripped bare. I myself have neither <lb/>
            treasures, nor, noble as I am by birth, do I inherit any- <lb/>
            thing from my family but a heart free from all fear. Nor <lb/>
            shall I be ashamed to place all my happiness in the cul- <lb/>
            tivation of my mind, while preferring an honourable <lb/>
            poverty. For the Fabricii also conducted great wars <lb/>
            while poor in estate and rich only in glory.</p>
          <p>6. “ Of all these things you may have plenty, if, dis- <lb/>
            carding all fear, you act with moderation, obeying the <lb/>
            cautious guidance of God and myself, as far as human <lb/>
            reason can lead you safely; but if you disobey, and choose <lb/>
            to return to your former shameful mutinies, proceed.</p>
          <p>7. As an emperor should do, I by myself, having per- <lb/>
            formed the important duties which belong to me, will die <lb/>
            standing, despising a life which any fever may take fj om <lb/>
            me: or else 1 will abdicate my power, foi 1 have not lived <lb/>
            so as to be unable to descend to a private station. I <lb/>
            rejoice in, and feel proud of the fact that there are with <lb/>
            me many leaders of proved skill and courage, perfect in <lb/>
            every kind of military knowledge."</p>
          <p>8. By this modest speech of their emperor, thus un- <lb/>
            moved alike by prosperity and adversity, the soldiers <lb/>
            were for a time appeased, regaining confidence with an <lb/>
            expectation of better success; and unanimously promised <lb/>
            to be docile and obedient, at the same time extolling <lb/>
            Julian's authority and magnanimity to the skies; and, as <lb/>
            is their wont when their feelings are genuine and coi dial;, <lb/>
            they showed them by a gentle rattling of their arms.</p>
          <p>9. Then they returned to their tents, and refreshed <lb/>
            themselves with food, for which they had abundant <lb/>
            means, and with sleep during the night. But Julian <lb/>
            encouraged his army not by the idea of their families, but <lb/>
            by the thoughts of the greatness of the enterprises in <lb/>
            which they were embarked : continually making vows- <lb/>
            " So might he be able to make the Persians pass under <lb/>
            the yoke." " So might he restore the Roman power which <lb/>
            had been shaken in those regions,”—in imitation of Trajan, <lb/>
            who was accustomed frequently to confirm anything he <lb/>
            had said by the imprecations—“ So may I see Dacia re- <lb/>
            duced to the condition of a province ; so may I bridge over <lb/>
            the Danube and Euphrates,”—using many similar f. orms <lb/>
            of attestation. <pb n="356"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[DK. XXIV. CH. III."/> 10. Then after proceeding fourteen miles further wo <lb/>
            came to a certain spot where the soil is fertilized by the <lb/>
            abundance of water. But as the Persians had learnt that <lb/>
            we should advance by this road, they removed the dams, <lb/>
            and allowed the waters to flood the country.</p>
          <p>11. The ground being thereby, for a great distance, re- <lb/>
            duced to the state of a marsh, the emperor gave the soldiers <lb/>
            the next day for rest, and advancing in front himself, con- <lb/>
            structed a number of little bridges of bladders, and <lb/>
            coracles' made of skins, and rafts of palm-tree timber, and <lb/>
            thus led his army across, though not without difficulty.</p>
          <p>12. In this region many of the fields are planted with <lb/>
            vineyards and various kinds of fruit trees ; and palm-trees <lb/>
            grow there over a great extent of country, reaching as far <lb/>
            as Mcsene and the ocean, forming great groves. And <lb/>
            wherever any one goes he sees continual stocks and <lb/>
            suckers of palms, from the fruit of which abundance of <lb/>
            honey and wine is made, and the palms themselves are <lb/>
            said to be divided into male and female, and it is added <lb/>
            that the two sexes can be easily distinguished.</p>
          <p>13. They say further that the female trees produce fruit <lb/>
            when impregnated by the seeds of the male trees, and <lb/>
            even that they feel delight in their mutual love : and that <lb/>
            this is clearly shown by the fact that they lean towards <lb/>
            one another, and cannot be bent back even by strong <lb/>
            winds—and if by any unusual accident a female tree is not <lb/>
            impregnated by the male seed, it produces nothing but <lb/>
            imperfect fruit, and if they cannot find out with what <lb/>
            male tree any female tree is in love, they smear the trunk <lb/>
            of some tree with the oil which proceeds from her, and <lb/>
            then some other tree naturally conceives a fondness for the <lb/>
            odour; and these proofs create some belief in the story of <lb/>
            their copulation.</p>
          <p>14. The army then, having sated itself with these fruits, <lb/>
            passed by several islands, and instead of the scarcity which <lb/>
            they apprehended, the fear arose that they would become <lb/>
            too fat. At last, after having been attacked by an am- <lb/>
            buscade of the enemy's archers, but having avenged them- <lb/>
            selves well, they came to a spot where the larger portion <lb/>
            of the Euphrates is divided into a number of small streams. <note type="footnote"> 1 Small boats made of wicker and covered with hide; still used in <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. IN this district a city, which on account of the lowness <lb/>
            of its walls, had been deserted by its Jewish inhabitants, <lb/>
            was burnt by our angry soldiers. And afterwards the <lb/>
            emperor proceeded further on, being elated at the manifest <lb/>
            protection, as he deemed it, of the Deity.</p>
          <p>2. And when he had reached Maogamalcha, a city of <lb/>
            great size and surrounded with strong walls, he pitched <lb/>
            his tent, and took anxious care that his camp should not <lb/>
            be surprised by any sudden attack of the Persian cavalry ; <lb/>
            whose courage in the open plains is marvellously dreaded <lb/>
            by the surrounding nations.</p>
          <p>3. And when he had made his arrangements, he himself, <lb/>
            with an escort of a few light troops, went forth on foot to <lb/>
            reconnoitre the position of a city by a close personal <lb/>
            examination; but he fell into a dangerous snare from <lb/>
            which he with difficulty escaped with his life.</p>
          <p>4. For ten armed Persians stole out by a gate of the <lb/>
            town of which he was not aware, and crawled on their <lb/>
            hands and knees along the bottom of the hill, till they got <lb/>
            within reach so as to fall silently upon our men, and two <lb/>
            of them distinguishing the emperor by his superior appear- <lb/>
            ance, made at him with drawn swords; but he encountered <lb/>
            them with his shield raised, and protecting himself with <lb/>
            that, and fighting with great and noble courage, he ran <lb/>
            one of them through the body, while his guards killed the <lb/>
            other with repeated blows. The rest, of whom some were <lb/>
            wounded, were put to flight, and the two who were slain <lb/>
            were stripped of their arms, and the emperor led back his <lb/>
            comrades in safety, laden with their spoils, into the camp, <lb/>
            where he was received with universal joy.</p>
          <p>5. Torquatus took a golden necklace from one of the <lb/>
            enemy whom he had slain. Valerius by the aid of a crow <lb/>
            defeated a haughty Gaul and earned the surname of Cor- <lb/>
            vinus, and by this glory these heroes were recommended <lb/>
            to posterity. We do not envy them, but let this gallant <lb/>
            exploit be added to those ancient memorials.</p>
          <p>6. The next day a bridge was laid across the river, and <lb/>
            the army passed over it, and pitched their camp in a fresh <lb/>
            and more healthy place, fortifying it with a double <pb n="358"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIT. CH. IV."/> <lb/>
            rampart, since, as we have said, the open plains were <lb/>
            regaled with apprehension. And then he undertook the <lb/>
            siege of the town, thinking it too dangerous to march <lb/>
            forward while leaving formidable enemies in his rear.</p>
          <p>7. While he was making great exertions to complete <lb/>
            his preparations, the Surena, the enemy's general, fell <lb/>
            upon the cattle which were feeding in the palm groves, but <lb/>
            was repulsed by those of our squadrons who were ap- <lb/>
            pointed to that service, and, having lost a few men, he <lb/>
            retired.</p>
          <p>8. And the inhabitants of two cities which are made <lb/>
            islands by the rivers which surround them, fearing to trust <lb/>
            in their means of defence, fled for refuge to Ctesiphon, <lb/>
            some fleeing through the thick woods, others crossing the <lb/>
            neighbouring marches on canoes formed out of hollowed <lb/>
            trees, and thus made a long journey to the principal or <lb/>
            indeed the only shelter which existed for them, intending <lb/>
            to proceed to still more distant regions.</p>
          <p>9. Some of them were overtaken, and on their resist- <lb/>
            ance were put to death by our soldiers, who, traversing <lb/>
            various districts in barks and small boats, brought in from <lb/>
            time to time many prisoners. For it had been cleverly <lb/>
            arranged that, while the infantry was besieging the town, <lb/>
            the squadrons of cavalry should scour the country in small <lb/>
            bands in order to bring in booty. And by this system, <lb/>
            without doing any injury to the inhabitants of the pro- <lb/>
            vinees, the soldiers fed on the bowels of the enemy.</p>
          <p>10. And by this time the emperor was besieging with <lb/>
            all his might and with a triple line of heavily armed <lb/>
            soldiers this town which was fortified with a double wall; <lb/>
            and he had great hope of succeeding in his enterprise. <lb/>
            But if the attempt was indispensable, the execution was <lb/>
            very difficult. For the approach to the town lay every- <lb/>
            where over rocks of great-height and abruptness; across <lb/>
            which there was no straight road; and dangers of two <lb/>
            kinds seemed to render the place inaccessible. In the first <lb/>
            place there were towers formidable both for their height <lb/>
            and for the number of their garrison ; equalling in height <lb/>
            the natural mountain on which the citadel was built; and <lb/>
            secondly, a sloping plain reached down to the river, which <lb/>
            again was protected by stout ramparts.</p>
          <p>11. There was a third difficulty not less formidable that <pb n="359"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            the numerous garrison of picked men which defended the <lb/>
            place could not be won over by any caresses to surrender, <lb/>
            but resisted the enemy as if resolved either to conquer or <lb/>
            to perish amid the ashes of their country. The soldiers, <lb/>
            who desired to attack at once, and also insisted upon a <lb/>
            pitched battle in a fair field, could hardly be restrained, <lb/>
            and when the retreat was sounded they burnt with indig- <lb/>
            nation, being eager to make courageous onsets on the <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>12. But the wisdom of our leaders overcame the eager- <lb/>
            ness of mere courage; and the work being distributed, <lb/>
            every one set about his allotted task with great alacrity. <lb/>
            For on one side high mounds were raised; on another <lb/>
            other parties were raising the deep ditches to the level of <lb/>
            the ground ; in other quarters hollow pitfalls were covered <lb/>
            over with long planks; artisans also were placing mural <lb/>
            engines soon intended to burst forth with fatal roars.</p>
          <p>13. Nevitta and Dagalaiphus superintended the miners <lb/>
            and the erection of the vineæ, or penthouses ; but the begin- <lb/>
            ning of the actual conflict, and the defence of the machines <lb/>
            from fire or from sallies of the garrison, the emperor took <lb/>
            to himself. And when all the preparations for taking the <lb/>
            city had been completed by this variety of labour, and the <lb/>
            soldiers demanded to be led to the assault, a captain named <lb/>
            Victor returned, who had explored all the roads as far as <lb/>
            Ctesiphun, and now brought word that he had met with no <lb/>
            obstacles.</p>
          <p>14. At this news all the soldiers became wild with joy, <lb/>
            and being more elated and eager for the contest than ever; <lb/>
            they waited under arms for the signal.</p>
          <p>15. And now on both sides the trumpets sounded with <lb/>
            martial clang. and the Roman vanguard, with incessant <lb/>
            attacks and threatening cries, assailed the enemy, who <lb/>
            were covered from head to foot with thin plates of iron <lb/>
            like the feathers of a bird, and who had full confidence <lb/>
            that any weapons that fell on this hard iron would recoil; <lb/>
            while our close-packed shields with which our men <lb/>
            covered themselves as with a lestudo, opened loosely so <lb/>
            as to adapt themselves to their continual motion. On the <lb/>
            other hand the Persians, obstinately clinging to their walls, <lb/>
            laboured with all their might to avoid and frustrate our <lb/>
            deadly attacks.</p><pb n="360"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIV. On. IT"/> 16. But when the assailants, pushing the osier fences <lb/>
            before them, passed up to the walls, the archers, slingers <lb/>
            and others, rolling down huge stones, with firebrands and <lb/>
            fire-pots, repelled them to a distance. Then the balistæ, <lb/>
            armed with wooden arrows, were bent and loosened with a <lb/>
            horrid creak, and poured forth incessant storms of darts. <lb/>
            And the scorpions hurled forth round stones under the <lb/>
            guidance of the skilful hands of their workers.</p>
          <p>17. The combat was repeated and redoubled in violence, <lb/>
            till the heat increasing up to midday, and the sun burning <lb/>
            up everything with its evaporation, recalled from the <lb/>
            battle the combatants on both sides, equally intent as they <lb/>
            were on the works and on the fray, but thoroughly ex- <lb/>
            hausted by fatigue and dripping with sweat.</p>
          <p>18. The same plan was followed the next day, the two <lb/>
            parties contending resolutely in various modes of fight- <lb/>
            ing, and again they parted with equal valour, and equal <lb/>
            fortune. But in every danger the emperor was foremost <lb/>
            among the armed combatants, urging on the destruction of <lb/>
            the city lest, by being detained too long before its walls, he <lb/>
            should be forced to abandon other objects which he had <lb/>
            at heart.</p>
          <p>19. But in times of emergency nothing is so unim- <lb/>
            portant as not occasionally to influence great affairs, even <lb/>
            contrary to all expectation. For when, as had often <lb/>
            happened, the two sides were fighting slackly, and on the <lb/>
            point of giving over, a battering-ram which had just been <lb/>
            brought up, being pushed forward awkwardly, struck down <lb/>
            a tower which was higher than any of the others, and was <lb/>
            very strongly built of baked brick, and its fall brought <lb/>
            down all the adjacent portion of the wall with a mighty <lb/>
            crash.</p>
          <p>20. Then in the variety of incidents which arose, the <lb/>
            exertions of the besiegers and the gallantry of the besieged <lb/>
            were equally conspicuous with noble exploits. For to our <lb/>
            soldiers, inflamed with anger and indignation, nothing <lb/>
            appeared difficult. To the garrison, fighting for their safety, <lb/>
            nothing seemed dangerous or formidable. At last, when <lb/>
            the fierce contest had raged a long time and was still <lb/>
            undecided, great slaughter having been made on both <lb/>
            sides, the close of day broke it off, and both armies yielded <lb/>
            to fatigue.</p><pb n="361"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> 21. While these matters were thus going on in broad <lb/>
            daylight, news was brought to the emperor, who was full <lb/>
            of watchful care, that the legionary soldiers to whom the <lb/>
            digging of the mines had been intrusted, having hollowed <lb/>
            out their subterranean paths and supported them with <lb/>
            stout stakes, had now reached the bottom of the founda- <lb/>
            tions of the walls, and were ready to issue forth if he <lb/>
            thought fit.</p>
          <p>22. When therefore a great part of the night was passed, <lb/>
            the brazen trumpets sounded the signal for advancing to <lb/>
            battle, and the troops ran to arms; and as had been <lb/>
            planned, the wall was attacked on both its faces, in order <lb/>
            that while the garrison were running to and fro to repel <lb/>
            the danger, and while the noise of the iron tools of the <lb/>
            miners digging at the foundations was overpowered by the <lb/>
            din of battle, the miners should come forth on a sudden <lb/>
            without any one being at the mouth of the mine to resist <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>23. When these plans had all been arranged, and the <lb/>
            garrison was fully occupied, the mine was opened, and <lb/>
            Exsuperius, a soldier of the Victorian legion, sprung out, <lb/>
            followed by a tribune named Magnus, and Jovianus, a <lb/>
            secretary, and an intrepid body of common soldiers, who, <lb/>
            after slaughtering all the men found in the temple into <lb/>
            which the mine opened, went cautiously forward and slew <lb/>
            the sentinels, who were occupying themselves after the <lb/>
            fashion of their country in singing the praises, the justice, <lb/>
            and good fortune of their king.</p>
          <p>24. It was believed that Mars himself (if indeed the <lb/>
            gods are permitted to mingle with men) aided Luscinus <lb/>
            when he forced the camp of the Lucanians. And it was <lb/>
            the more believed because in the height of the conflict <lb/>
            there was seen an armed figure of enormous size carrying <lb/>
            ladders, who the next day, when the roll was called over, <lb/>
            though sought for very carefully, could not be found any- <lb/>
            where ; when if he had really been a soldier he would have <lb/>
            come forward of his own accord from a consciousness of <lb/>
            his gallant action. But though on that occasion it was <lb/>
            never known who performed that splendid achievement, <lb/>
            yet those who now behaved bravely were not unknown, <lb/>
            but received obsidional crowns, and were publicly praised <lb/>
            according to the ancient fashion.</p><pb n="362"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK.XXIV.CH. IV."/> 25. At last the fated city, its numerous entrances being <lb/>
            laid open, was entered by the Romans, and the furious <lb/>
            troops destroyed all whom they found, without regard to <lb/>
            age or sex. Some of the citizens, from dread of impending <lb/>
            destruction, threatened on one side with fire, on the other <lb/>
            with the sword, weeping threw themselves headlong over <lb/>
            the walls, and being crippled in all their limbs, led for a <lb/>
            few hours or days a life more miserable than any death, <lb/>
            till they were finally killed.</p>
          <p>26. But Nabdatcs, the captain of the garrison, was <lb/>
            taken alive with eighty of his guards ; and when he was <lb/>
            brought before the emperor, that magnanimous and merciful <lb/>
            prince ordered him to be kept in safety. The booty was <lb/>
            divided according to a fair estimate of the merits and <lb/>
            labours of the troops. The emperor, who was contented <lb/>
            with very little, took for his own share of the victory he <lb/>
            had thus gained three pieces of gold and a dumb child who <lb/>
            was brought to him, and who by elegant signs and gesticu- <lb/>
            lations explained all he knew, and considered that an <lb/>
            acceptable and sufficient prize.</p>
          <p>27. But of the virgins who were taken prisoners, and <lb/>
            who, as was likely in Persia, where female beauty is re- <lb/>
            markable, were exceedingly beautiful, he would neither <lb/>
            touch nor even see one; imitating Alexander and Scipio, <lb/>
            who refused similar opportunities, in order, after having <lb/>
            proved themselves unconquered by toil, not to show them- <lb/>
            selves the victims of desire.</p>
          <p>28. \\ hile the battle was going on, an engineer on our <lb/>
            side. whose name .1 do not know, who happened to be <lb/>
            standing just behind a scorpion, was knocked down and <lb/>
            killed by the recoil of a stone, which the worker of the <lb/>
            engine had fitted to the sling carelessly, his whole body <lb/>
            being so dislocated and battered that he could not even be <lb/>
            recognized.</p>
          <p>29. After the town was taken intelligence was brought <lb/>
            to the emperor that a troop was lying in ambuscade in <lb/>
            some concealed pits around the walls of the town just <lb/>
            taken (of which pits there are many in those districts), <lb/>
            with the intention of surprising the rear of our army by <lb/>
            a sudden attack.</p>
          <p>30. A body of picked infantry of tried courage was there- <lb/>
            fore sent to take the troop prisoners. But as they could <pb n="363"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            neither force their way into the pits, nor induce those con- <lb/>
            cealed in them to come forth to fight, they collected some <lb/>
            straw and faggots, and piled them up before the mouths of <lb/>
            the caves, and then set them on fire, from which the smoke <lb/>
            penetrated into the caverns through the narrow crevice, <lb/>
            being the more dense because of the small space through <lb/>
            which it was forced, and so suffocated some of them; others <lb/>
            the fire compelled to come forth to instant destruction; <lb/>
            and in this manner they were destroyed by sword or by <lb/>
            fire, and our men returned with speed to their camp. Thus <lb/>
            was this large and populous city, with its powerful garrison, <lb/>
            stormed by the Romans, and the city itself reduced to <lb/>
            ruins.</p>
          <p>31. After this glorious exploit the bridges which led <lb/>
            over several rivers were crossed in succession, and we <lb/>
            reached two forts, constructed with great strength and <lb/>
            skill, where the son of the king endeavoured to prevent <lb/>
            Count Victor, who was marching in the van of the army, <lb/>
            from crossing the river, having advanced for that purpose <lb/>
            from Ctesiphon with a large body of nobles and a con- <lb/>
            siderable armed force; but when he saw the numbers <lb/>
            which were following Victor, he retreated.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. So we advanced and came to some groves, and also to <lb/>
            some fields fertile with a great variety of crops, where we <lb/>
            found a palace built in the Roman fashion, which, so <lb/>
            pleased were we with the circumstance, we left unhurt.</p>
          <p>2. There was also in this same place a large round space, <lb/>
            enclosed, containing wild beasts, intended for the king's <lb/>
            amusement; lions with shaggy manes, tusked boars, and <lb/>
            bears of amazing ferocity (as the Persian bears are), and <lb/>
            other chosen beasts of vast size. Our cavalry, however, <lb/>
            forced the gates of this enclosure, and killed all the beasts <lb/>
            with hunting-spears and clouds of arrows.</p>
          <p>3. This district is rich and well cultivated: not far off <lb/>
            is Coche, which is also called Seleucia; where we fortified <lb/>
            a camp with great celerity, and rested there two days to <lb/>
            refresh the army with timely supplies of water and pro- <lb/>
            visions. The emperor himself in the meanwhile proceeded <lb/>
            with his advanced guard and reconnoitred a deserted city <lb/>
            which had been formerly destroyed by the Emperor Verus, <pb n="364"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIV. Cn. v."/> <lb/>
            where an everlasting spring forms a large tube which com- <lb/>
            mnnicatcs with the Tigris. Here we saw, hanging oil <lb/>
            gallows, many bodies of the relations of the man whom we <lb/>
            have spoken of above as having betrayed Pirisabora.</p>
          <p>4. Here also Nabdates was burnt alive, he whom I have <lb/>
            mentioned above as having been taken with eighty of his <lb/>
            garrison while hiding among the ruins of the city which <lb/>
            we had taken; because at the beginning of the siege he <lb/>
            had secretly promised to betray it, but afterwards had re- <lb/>
            sisted us vigorously, and after having been unexpectedly <lb/>
            pardoned had risen to such a pitch of violence as to launch <lb/>
            all kinds of abuse against Hormisdas.</p>
          <p>5. Then after advancing some distance we heard of a <lb/>
            sad disaster: for while three cohorts of the advanced <lb/>
            guard, who were in light marching order, were fighting <lb/>
            with a Persian division which had made a sally out of the <lb/>
            city gates, another body of the enemy cut off and slew our <lb/>
            cattle, which were following us on the other side of the <lb/>
            river, with a few of our foragers who were straggling <lb/>
            about in no great order.</p>
          <p>6. The emperor was enraged and indignant at this; he <lb/>
            was now near the district of Ctesiphon, and had just <lb/>
            reached a lofty and well-fortified castle. He went himself <lb/>
            to reconnoitre it, being, as he fancied, concealed, as he <lb/>
            rode with a small escort close to the walls: but as from <lb/>
            too much eagerness he got within bowshot, he was soon <lb/>
            noticed, and was immediately assailed by every kind of <lb/>
            missile, and would have been killed by an arrow shot from <lb/>
            an engine on the walls, if it had not struck his armour- <lb/>
            bearer, who kept close by his side. and he himself, being <lb/>
            protected by the closely-packed shields of his guards, fell <lb/>
            back, after having been exposed to great danger.</p>
          <p>7. At this he was greatly enraged, and determined to <lb/>
            lay siege to the fort: but the garrison was very resolute to <lb/>
            defend it, believing the place to be nearly inaccessible, and <lb/>
            that the king, who was advancing with great speed at the <lb/>
            head of a large army, would soon arrive to their assistance.</p>
          <p>8. And now, the vineæ and everything else required <lb/>
            for the siege being prepared, at the second watch, when <lb/>
            the night, which happened to be one of very bright <lb/>
            moonlight, made everything visible to the defenders on <lb/>
            the battlements, suddenly the whole multitude of the <pb n="365"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 383.]"/> <lb/>
            garrison formed into one body, threw open the gates and <lb/>
            sallied out, and attacking a division of our men who were <lb/>
            not expecting them, slew numbers, among whom one <lb/>
            tribune was killed as he was endeavouring to repel the <lb/>
            attack.</p>
          <p>9. And while this was going on, the Persians, haying <lb/>
            attacked a portion of our men in the same manner as <lb/>
            before from the opposite side of the river, slew some and <lb/>
            took others prisoners. And our men, in alarm, and because <lb/>
            they believed the enemy had come into the field in very <lb/>
            superior numbers, behaved at first with but little spirit; <lb/>
            but presently, when they recovered their courage, they <lb/>
            flew again to arms, and being roused by the sound of the <lb/>
            trumpets, they hastened to the charge with threatening <lb/>
            cries, upon which the Persians retired to the garrison <lb/>
            without further contest.</p>
          <p>10. And the emperor, being terribly angry, reduced <lb/>
            those of the cavalry who had shown a want of courage <lb/>
            when attacked to serve in the infantry, which is a severer <lb/>
            service and one of less honour.</p>
          <p>11. Then, being very eager to take a castle where he had <lb/>
            incurred so much danger, he devoted all his own labour <lb/>
            and care to that end, never himself retiring from the front <lb/>
            ranks of his men, in order that by fighting in the van <lb/>
            he might be an example of gallantry to his soldiers, and <lb/>
            might be also sure to see, and therefore able to reward, <lb/>
            every gallant action. And when he had exposed himself <lb/>
            a long time to imminent danger, the castle, having been <lb/>
            assailed by every kind of manoeuvre, weapon, and engine, <lb/>
            and by great valour on the part of the besiegers, was at <lb/>
            length taken and burnt.</p>
          <p>12. After this, in consideration of the great labour of <lb/>
            the exploits which they had performed, and which were <lb/>
            before them, he granted rest to his army, exhausted with <lb/>
            its excessive toil, and distributed among them provisions <lb/>
            in abundance. Then a rampart was raised round the camp, <lb/>
            with dense rows of palisades, and a deep fosse, as sudden <lb/>
            sallies and various formidable manoeuvres were dreaded, <lb/>
            since they were very near Ctesiphon.</p><pb n="366"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIV. CH VI."/> </p>

            <title type="sub">VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. FROM this place they advanced to a canal known as <lb/>
            Naharmalcha, a name which means " The River of Kings." <lb/>
            It was then dry. Long ago Trajan, and after him Severus, <lb/>
            had caused the soil to be dug out, and had given great <lb/>
            attention to constructing this as a canal of great size, so <lb/>
            that, being filled with water from the Euphrates, it might <lb/>
            enable vessels to pass into the Tigris.</p>
          <p>2. And for every object in view it appeared best that <lb/>
            this should now be cleaned out, as the Persians, fearing <lb/>
            such an operation, had blocked it up with a mass of stones. <lb/>
            After it had been cleared and the dams removed, a large <lb/>
            body of water was let in, so that our fleet, after a safe <lb/>
            voyage of thirty furlongs, passed into the Tigris. There <lb/>
            the army at once threw bridges across the river, and <lb/>
            passing over to the other side, marched upon Coche.</p>
          <p>3. And that after our fatigue we might enjoy seasonable <lb/>
            rest, we encamped in an open plain, rich with trees, vines, <lb/>
            and cypresses, in the middle of which was a shady and <lb/>
            delicious pavilion, having all over it, according to the <lb/>
            fashion of the country, pictures of the king slaying wild <lb/>
            beasts in the chase; for they never paint or in any way <lb/>
            represent anything except different kinds of slaughter and <lb/>
            war.</p>
          <p>4. Having now finished everything according to his <lb/>
            wish, the emperor, rising higher in spirit as his difficulties <lb/>
            increased, and building such hopes on Fortune, which had <lb/>
            not yet proved unfavourable to him, that he often pushed <lb/>
            his boldness to the verge of temerity, unloaded some of the <lb/>
            strongest of the vessels which were carrying provisions <lb/>
            and warlike engines, and put on board of them eight hUll- <lb/>
            dred armed men; and keeping the main part of the fleet <lb/>
            with him, which he divided into three squadrons, he <lb/>
            settled that one under the command of Count Victor should <lb/>
            start at nightfall, in order to cross the river with speed, <lb/>
            and so seize on the bank in possession of the enemy.</p>
          <p>5. The generals were greatly alarmed at this plan, and <lb/>
            unanimously entreated him to forego it; but as they could <lb/>
            not prevail, the signal for sailing was raised, as he com- <lb/>
            manded, and at once five ships hastened onwards out of <lb/>
            sight; and when they drew near to the bank they were <pb n="367"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D.363.]"/> <lb/>
            attacked with an incessant storm of fire-pots and every <lb/>
            kind of contrivance to handle flames, and they would have <lb/>
            been burnt soldiers and all if the emperor, being roused, <lb/>
            had not with great energy hastened to the spot, shouting <lb/>
            out that our men, as they were ordered, had made him a <lb/>
            signal that they were now masters of the bank of the river, <lb/>
            and ordering the whole fleet to hasten forward with all speed.</p>
          <p>6. In consequence of which vigour the ships were saved, <lb/>
            and the soldiers, though harassed by the enemy from their <lb/>
            commanding ground with stones and every kind of missile, <lb/>
            nevertheless after a fierce conflict made good their footing <lb/>
            on the high bank of the river, and established themselves <lb/>
            immovably.</p>
          <p>7. History marvels that Sertorius swam across the <lb/>
            Rhone with his arms and his breastplate; but on this <lb/>
            occasion, some soldiers, though disordered, fearing to re- <lb/>
            main behind after the signal for battle was raised, clinging <lb/>
            firmly to their shields, which are broad and concave, and <lb/>
            guiding them, though without much skill, kept pace with <lb/>
            the speed of the vessels through a river full of currents.</p>
          <p>8. The Persians resisted this attack with squadrons of <lb/>
            cuirassier cavalry in such close order that their bodies <lb/>
            dazzled the eye, fitting together, as it seemed, with their <lb/>
            brilliant armour; while their horses were all protected <lb/>
            with a covering of stout leather. As a reserve to support <lb/>
            them several maniples of infantry were stationed, protected <lb/>
            by crooked, oblong shields, made of wicker-work and raw <lb/>
            hides, behind which they moved in compact order. Behind <lb/>
            them were elephants, like so many walking hills, which by <lb/>
            every motion of their huge bodies threatened destruction <lb/>
            to all who came near them, and our men had been taught <lb/>
            to fear them by past experience.</p>
          <p>9. On this the emperor, according to the arrangement of <lb/>
            the Greek army as mentioned by Homer,1 allotted the <note type="footnote">1 See Il. iv. 297:— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              centre space between his two lines to his weakest infantry, <lb/>
              lest if they were placed in the front rank, and should then <lb/>
              misbehave, they should disorder the whole of his line ; or <lb/>
              lest, on the other hand, if posted in the rear, behind all the <lb/>
              other centuries, they should flee without shame, since there <lb/>
              would be no one to check them: he with his light-armed <lb/>
              auxiliaries moving as might be required between the lines.</p>
          <p>10. Therefore when the two armies beheld each other, <lb/>
            the' Romans glittering with their crested helmets, and <lb/>
            brandishing their shields, proceeded slowly, their bands <lb/>
            playing an anapæstic measure; and after a preliminary <lb/>
            skirmish, carried on by the missiles of the front rank, they <lb/>
            rushed to battle with such vehemence that the earth <lb/>
            trembled beneath them.</p>
          <p>11. The battle-shout was raised on all sides, as was <lb/>
            usual, the braying trumpets encouraged the eagerness of <lb/>
            the men : all fought in close combat with spears and drawn <lb/>
            swords, so that the soldiers were free from all danger of <lb/>
            arrows the more rapidly they pressed onwards. Mean- <lb/>
            while, Julian, like a gallant comrade, at the same time <lb/>
            that he was a skilful general, hasten to support his hardly- <lb/>
            pressed battalions with reserves, and to cheer on the <lb/>
            laggards.</p>
          <p>12. So the front line of the Persians wavered, having <lb/>
            been never very fierce; and at last, no longer able to <lb/>
            support the heat of their armour, they retreated in haste <lb/>
            to their city, which was near: they were pursued by <lb/>
            our soldiers, weary as they were with having fought in <lb/>
            those torrid plains from daybreak to sunset; and we, <lb/>
            pressing close on their heels, drove them, with their <lb/>
            choicest generals, Pigranes, the Snrena, and N arses, right <lb/>
            up to the walls of Ctesiphon, inflicting many wounds on <lb/>
            their legs and backs.</p>
          <p>13. And we should have forced our entrance into the <lb/>
            city if a general named Victor bad not, by lifting up his <lb/>
            hands and his voice, checked us, being himself pierced <lb/>
            through the shoulder with an arrow, and fearing lest if the <lb/>
            soldiers allowed themselves to be hurried within the walls <lb/>
            without any order, and could then find no means of re- <lb/>
            turning, they might be overwhelmed by the mass of their <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>14. Let the poets celebrate the ancient battles of Hector, <pb n="369"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            or extol the valour of the Thessalian Achilles ; let past ages <lb/>
            tell the praises of Sophanes, and Aminias, and Callimachus, <lb/>
            and Cyægirus, those thunderbolts of war in the struggles <lb/>
            of the Greeks against Persia; but it is evident by the con- <lb/>
            fession of all men that the gallantry displayed by some of <lb/>
            our troops on that day was equal to any of their exploits.</p>
          <p>15. After having laid aside their fears, and trampled on <lb/>
            the carcases of their enemies, the soldiers, still stained <lb/>
            with the blood so justly shed, collected round the tent <lb/>
            of the emperor, loading him with praises and thanks, <lb/>
            because, while behaving with such bravery that it was <lb/>
            hard to say whether he had been more a general or a <lb/>
            soldier, he had conducted the affair with such success <lb/>
            that not above seventy of our men had fallen, while nearly <lb/>
            two thousand five hundred of the Persians had been slain. <lb/>
            And he in his turn addressed by name most of those <lb/>
            whose steady courage and gallant actions he had wit- <lb/>
            nessed, presenting them with naval, civic, and military <lb/>
            crowns.</p>
          <p>16. Thinking that this achievement would surely be <lb/>
            followed by other similar successes, he prepared a large <lb/>
            sacrifice to Mars the Avenger. Ten most beautiful bulls <lb/>
            were brought for the purpose, nine of which, even before <lb/>
            they reached the altars, lay down of their own accord with <lb/>
            mournful countenances, but the tenth broke his bonds and <lb/>
            escaped, and was with difficulty brought back at all; and <lb/>
            when sacrificed displayed very unfavourable omens; <lb/>
            but when he saw this, Julian became very indignant, and <lb/>
            exclaimed, calling Jupiter to witness, that henceforth he <lb/>
            would offer no sacrifices to Mars. Nor did he recall his <lb/>
            vow, being cut off by a speedy death.</p>

          <p>§ 1. JULIAN, having discussed with his chief officers the <lb/>
            plan for the siege of Ctesiphon, it appeared to some of <lb/>
            them that it would be an act of unseasonable temerity to <lb/>
            attack that city, both because its situation made it almost <lb/>
            impregnable, and also because King Sapor was believed to <lb/>
            be hastening to its protection with a formidable army.</p>
          <p>2. The better opinion prevailed; and the sagacious em- <lb/>
            peror being convinced of its wisdom, sent Arinthæus with <note type="footnote"> 2 B </note> <pb n="370"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIV. CH. T."/> <lb/>
            a division of light infantry, to lay waste the surrounding <lb/>
            districts, which were rich both in herds and in crops, with <lb/>
            orders also to pursue the enemy with equal energy, for <lb/>
            many of them were wandering about, concealed amid over- <lb/>
            grown by-ways, and lurking-places known only to them- <lb/>
            selves. The booty was abundant.</p>
          <p>3. But Julian himself, being always eager to extend his <lb/>
            conquests, disregarded the advice of those who remon- <lb/>
            strated against his advance ; and reproaching his chiefs, as <lb/>
            men who out of mere laziness and a love of ease advised <lb/>
            him to let go the kingdom of Persia when he bad almost <lb/>
            made himself master of it, left the river on his left hand, <lb/>
            and led by unlucky guides, determined to proceed towards <lb/>
            the inland parts of the country by forced marches.</p>
          <p>4. And he ordered all his ships to be burnt, as if with <lb/>
            the fatal torch of Bellona herself, except twelve of the <lb/>
            smaller vessels, which he arranged should be carried on <lb/>
            waggons, as likely to be of use for building bridges. And <lb/>
            lie thought this a most excellently conceived plan, to prevent <lb/>
            his fleet if left behind from being of any use to the enemy, <lb/>
            or on the other hand to prevent what happened at the out- <lb/>
            set of the expedition, nearly twenty thousand men being <lb/>
            occupied in moving and managing the vessels.</p>
          <p>5. Then, as the men began in their alarm to grumble to <lb/>
            themselves (as indeed manifest truth pointed out), that the <lb/>
            soldiers if hindered from advancing by the height of the <lb/>
            mountains or the dryness of the country, would have no <lb/>
            means of returning to get water, and when the deserters, <lb/>
            on being put to the torture openly confessed that they had <lb/>
            made a false report, he ordered all hands to labour to extin- <lb/>
            guish the flames. But the fire, having got to a great <lb/>
            head, bad consumed most of them, so that only the twelve <lb/>
            could be preserved unhurt, which were set apart to be <lb/>
            taken care of.</p>
          <p>6. In this way the fleet being unseasonably destroyed, <lb/>
            Julian, relying on his army which was now all united, <lb/>
            having none of its divisions diverted to other occupations, <lb/>
            and so being strong in numbers, advanced inland, the rich <lb/>
            district through which he marched supplying him with an <lb/>
            abundance of provisions.</p>
          <p>7. When this was known, the enemy, with a view to <lb/>
            distressing us by want of supplies, burnt up all the grass <pb n="371"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            and the nearly ripe crops; and we, being unable to ad- <lb/>
            , vance by reason of the conflagration, remained stationary <lb/>
            in our camp till the fire was exhausted. And the Persians, <lb/>
            insulting us from a distance, sometimes spread themselves <lb/>
            widely on purpose, sometimes offered us resistance in a <lb/>
            compact body ; so that to us who beheld them from a dis- <lb/>
            tance it might seem that the reinforcements of the king <lb/>
            had come up, and we might imagine that it was on that <lb/>
            account that they had ventured on their audacious sallies <lb/>
            and unwonted enterprises.</p>
          <p>8. Both the emperor and the troops were greatly Vexed <lb/>
            at this, because they had no means of constructing a bridge, <lb/>
            since the ships had been inconsiderately destroyed, nor <lb/>
            could any check be offered to the movements of the- <lb/>
            strange enemy, whom the glistening brilliancy of their <lb/>
            arms showed to be close at hand; this armour of theirs <lb/>
            being singularly adapted to all the inflections of their body. <lb/>
            There was another evil of no small weight, that the rein- <lb/>
            forcements which we were expecting to arrive under the <lb/>
            command of Arsaces and some of our own generals, did <lb/>
            not make their appearance, being detained by the causes <lb/>
            already mentioned.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VIlI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THE emperor, to comfort his soldiers who-were made <lb/>
            anxious by these events, ordered the prisoners who were <lb/>
            of slender make, as the Persians usually are, and who were <lb/>
            now more than usually emaciated, to be brought before <lb/>
            the army: and looking at our men he said, " Behold what <lb/>
            those warlike spirits consider men, little ugly dirty goats ; <lb/>
            and creatures who, as many events have shown, throw <lb/>
            away their arms and take to flight before they can come to <lb/>
            blows."</p>
          <p>2. And when he bad said this, and had ordered the <lb/>
            prisoners to be removed, he held a consultation on what was <lb/>
            to be done ; and after many opinions of different kinds had. <lb/>
            been delivered, the common soldiers inconsiderately crying <lb/>
            out that it was best to return by the same way they hadi <lb/>
            advanced, the emperor steadily opposed this idea, and was <lb/>
            joined by several officers who contended that this could <lb/>
            not be done, since all the forage and crops, had been <lb/>
            destroyed throughout the plain, and the remains of. the- <pb n="372"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIV. Cn. v "/>villages which had been burnt were all in complete desti- <lb/>
            tution, and could afford no supplies; because also the whole <lb/>
            soil was soaked everywhere from the snows of winter, and <lb/>
            the rivers had overflowed their banks and were now for- <lb/>
            midable torrents.</p>
          <p>3. There was this further difficulty, that in those dis- <lb/>
            tricts where the heat and evaporation are great, every place <lb/>
            is infested with swarms of flies and gnats, and in such <lb/>
            numbers that the light of the sun and of the stars is com- <lb/>
            pletely hidden by them.</p>
          <p>4. And as human sagacity was of no avail in such a <lb/>
            state of affairs, we were long in doubt and perplexity; and <lb/>
            raising altars and sacrificing victims we consulted the will <lb/>
            of the gods; inquiring whether it was their will that we <lb/>
            should return through Assyria, or advancing slowly along <lb/>
            the foot of the mountain chain, should surprise and plunder <lb/>
            Chiliocomum near Corduena; but neither of these plans <lb/>
            was conformable to the omens presented by an inspection <lb/>
            of the sacrifices.</p>
          <p>5. However it was decided, that since there was no <lb/>
            better prospect before us, to seize on Corduena; and on <lb/>
            the 16th June we struck our camp, and at daybreak the <lb/>
            emperor set forth, when suddenly was seen either smoke <lb/>
            or a great cloud of dust; so that many thought it was <lb/>
            caused by herds of wild asses, of which there are countless <lb/>
            numbers in those regions, and who were now moving in a <lb/>
            troop, in order by their compactness to ward off the fero- <lb/>
            cious attacks of lions.</p>
          <p>6. Some, however, fancied that it was caused by the <lb/>
            approach of the Saracen chieftains, our allies, who had <lb/>
            heard that the emperor was besieging Ctesiphon in great <lb/>
            force : some again affirmed that the Persians were lying in <lb/>
            wait for us on our march.</p>
          <p>7. Therefore amid all these doubtful opinions, the trum- <lb/>
            pets sounded a halt, in order to guard against any re- <lb/>
            verse, and we halted in a grassy valley near a stream, <lb/>
            where, packing our shields in close order and in a circular <lb/>
            figure, we pitched our camp and rested in safety. Nor, so <lb/>
            dark did it continue till evening, could we distinguish what <lb/>
            it was that had so long obscured the view.</p><pb n="373"/>

          <p>I. The Persians attack the Romans on their march, but are gallantly <lb/>
            repelled.—II. The army is distressed by want of corn and forage; <lb/>
            Julian is alarmed by prodigies.—III. The emperor, while, in order <lb/>
            to repulse the Persians, who pressed him on all quarters, he <lb/>
            rashly rushes into battle without his breastplate, is wounded by <lb/>
            a spear, and is borne back to his tent, where he addresses those <lb/>
            around him, and, after drinking some cold water, dies.—IV. His <lb/>
            virtues and vices; his personal appearance.—V. Jovian, the <lb/>
            captain 1 of the imperial guards, is tumultuously elected em- <lb/>

            their march are continually attacked by the Persians and Sara- <lb/>
            cens, whom, however, they repulse with great loss.—VII. The <lb/>
            emperor Jovian, being influenced by the scarcity and distress with <lb/>
            which his army is oppressed, makes a necessary but disgraceful <lb/>
            peace with Sapor; abandoning five provinces, with the cities of <lb/>
            Nisibis and Singara.—VIII. The Romans having crossed the <lb/>
            Tigris, after a very long and terrible scarcity of provisions, which <lb/>
            they endured with great courage, at length reach Mesopotamia— <lb/>
            Jovian arranges the affairs of Illyricum and Gaul to the best of his <lb/>
            power.—IX. Bineses, a noble Persian, acting for Sapor, receives <lb/>
            from Jovian the impregnable city of Nisibis; the citizens are <lb/>
            unwilling to quit their country, but are compelled to migrate to <lb/>
            Amida—Five provinces, with the city of Singara, and sixteen <lb/>
            fortresses, are, according to the terms of the treaty, handed over <lb/>
            to the Persian nobles.–X. Jovian, fearing a revolution, marches <lb/>
            with great speed through Syria, Cilicia, Cappadocia, and Galatia, <lb/>
            and at Ancyra enters on the consulship, with his infant son Varro- <lb/>
            nianus, and soon afterwards dies suddenly at Dadastana.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THE night was dark and starless, and passed by us as <lb/>
            nights are passed in times of difficulty and perplexity; no <lb/>
            one out of fear daring to sit down, or to close his eyes. <lb/>
            But as soon as day broke, brilliant breastplates sur- <lb/>
            rounded with steel fringes, and glittering cuirasses, were <lb/>
            seen at a distance, and showed that the king's army was <lb/>
            at hand. <note type="footnote"> 1 Primicerius : he was the third officer of the guard; the first being <lb/>
            the lower ; the second, the tribune-answering, as one might say, to <lb/>
            our major. </note> <pb n="374"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. I."/> 2. The soldiers were roused at this sight, and hastened <lb/>
            to engage, since only a small stream separated them from <lb/>
            the Persians, but were checked by the emperor; a sharp <lb/>
            skirmish did indeed take place between our outposts and <lb/>
            the Persians, close to the rampart of our camp, in <lb/>
            which Machamæus, the captain of one of our squadrons, <lb/>
            was stricken down: his brother Maurus, afterwards Duke <lb/>
            of Phœnicia, flew to his support, and slew the man who <lb/>
            had killed Machamæus, and crushed all who came in his <lb/>
            way, till he himself was wounded in the shoulder by a <lb/>
            javelin ; but he still was able by great exertions to <lb/>
            bring off his brother, who was now pale with approaching <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>3. Both sides were nearly exhausted with the intolerable <lb/>
            violence of the heat and the repeated conflicts, but at <lb/>
            last the hostile battalions were driven back in great dis- <lb/>
            order. Then while we fell back to a greater distance, the <lb/>
            Saracens were also compelled to retreat from fear of our <lb/>
            infantry, but presently afterwards joining themselves to <lb/>
            the Persian host, they attacked us again, with more safety <lb/>
            to themselves for the purpose of carrying off the Roman <lb/>
            baggage. But when they saw the emperor they again <lb/>
            retreated upon their reserve.</p>
          <p>4. After leaving this district we reached a village called <lb/>
            Hucumbra, where we rested two days, procuring all kinds <lb/>
            of provisions and abundance of corn, so that we moved on <lb/>
            again after being refreshed beyond our hopes ; all that the <lb/>
            time would not allow us to take away we burnt.</p>
          <p>5. The next day the army was advancing more quietly, <lb/>
            when the Persians unexpectedly fell upon our last division, <lb/>
            to whom that day the duty fell of bringing up the rear, and <lb/>
            would easily have slain all the men, had not our cavalry, <lb/>
            which happened to be at hand, the moment that they <lb/>
            heard what was going on, hastened up, though scattered <lb/>
            over the wide valley, and repulsed this dangerous attack, <lb/>
            wounding all who had thus surprised them.</p>
          <p>6. In this skirmish fell Adaces, a noble satrap, who had <lb/>
            formerly been sent as ambassador to the emperor Constan- <lb/>
            tius, and had been kindly received by him. The soldier <lb/>
            who slew him brought his arms to Julian, and received <lb/>
            the reward he deserved.</p>
          <p>7. The same day one of our corps of cavalry, known as <pb n="375"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            the third legion, was accused of having gradually given <lb/>
            way, so that when the legions were on the point of break- <lb/>
            ing the enemy's line, they nearly broke the spirit of the <lb/>
            whole army.</p>
          <p>8. And Julian, being justly indignant at this, de- <lb/>
            prived them of their standards, broke their spears, and <lb/>
            condemned all those who were convicted of having mis- <lb/>
            behaved of marching among the baggage and prisoners; <lb/>
            while their captain, the only one of their number who had <lb/>
            behaved well, was appointed to the command of another <lb/>
            squadron, the tribune of which was convicted of having <lb/>
            shamefully left the field.</p>
          <p>9. And four other tribunes of companies were also <lb/>
            cashiered for similar misconduct; for the emperor was <lb/>
            contented with this moderate degree of punishment out of <lb/>
            consideration for his impending difficulties.</p>
          <p>10. Accordingly, having advanced seventy furlongs with <lb/>
            very scanty supplies, the herbage and the corn being all <lb/>
            burnt, each man saved for himself just as much of the <lb/>
            grain or forage as he could snatch from the flames and <lb/>
            carry.</p>
          <p>11. And having left this spot, when the army had <lb/>
            arrived at the district called Maranx, near daybreak an <lb/>
            immense, multitude of Persians appeared, with Merenes, <lb/>
            the captain of their cavalry, and two sons of the king, and <lb/>
            many nobles.</p>
          <p>12. All the troops were clothed in steel, in such a <lb/>
            way that their bodies were covered with strong plates, so <lb/>
            that the hard joints of the armour fitted every limb of <lb/>
            their bodies ; and on their heads were effigies of human <lb/>
            faces so accurately fitted, that their whole persons being <lb/>
            covered with metal, the only place where any missiles <lb/>
            which fell upon them could stick, was either where there <lb/>
            were minute openings to allow of the sight of the eyes <lb/>
            penetrating, or where holes for breathing were left at the <lb/>
            extremities of the nostrils.</p>
          <p>13. Part of them who were prepared to fight with pikes <lb/>
            stood immovable, so that you might have fancied they were <lb/>
            held in their places by fastenings of brass; and next to <lb/>
            them the archers (in which art that nation has always <lb/>
            been most skilful from the cradle) bent their, supple bows <lb/>
            with widely extended arms, so that the strings touched <pb n="376"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. ."/> <lb/>
            their right breasts, while the arrows lay just upon their <lb/>
            left. hands; and the whistling arrows flew, let loose with <lb/>
            great skill of finger, bearing deadly wounds.</p>
          <p>14. Behind them stood the glittering elephants in for- <lb/>
            midable array, whose grim looks our terrified men could <lb/>
            hardly endure; while the horses were still more alarmed <lb/>
            at their growl, odour, and unwonted aspect.</p>
          <p>15. Their drivers rode on them, an! bore knives with <lb/>
            handles fastened to their right hands, remembering the <lb/>
            disaster which they had experienced at Nisibis ; and if the <lb/>
            ferocious animal overpowered his. overseer, they pierced <lb/>
            the spine where the head is joined to the neck with a <lb/>
            vigorous blow, that the beast might not recoil upon their <lb/>
            own ranks, as had happened on that occasion, and trample <lb/>
            down their own people ; for it was found out by Hasdrubal, <lb/>
            the brother of Hannibal, that in this way these animals <lb/>
            might be very easily deprived of life.</p>
          <p>16. The sight of these beasts caused great alarm; and so <lb/>
            this most intrepid emperor, attended with a strong body <lb/>
            of his armed cohorts and many of his chief officers, as the <lb/>
            crisis and the superior numbers of the enemy required, <lb/>
            marshalled his troops in the form of a crescent with the <lb/>
            wings bending inwards to encounter the enemy.</p>
          <p>17. And to hinder the onset of the archers from dis- <lb/>
            ordering our columns, by advancing with great speed he <lb/>
            baffled the aim of their arrows; and after he bad given the <lb/>
            formal signal for fighting, the Roman infantry, in close <lb/>
            order, beat back the front of the enemy with a vigorous <lb/>
            effort.</p>
          <p>18. The struggle was fierce, and the clashing of the <lb/>
            shields, the din of the men, and the doleful whistle of the <lb/>
            javelins, which continued without intermission, covered the <lb/>
            plains with blood and corpses, the Persians falling in every <lb/>
            direction; and though they were often slack in fighting, <lb/>
            being accustomed chiefly to combat at a distance by means <lb/>
            of missiles, still now foot to foot they made a stout resist- <lb/>
            ance ; and when they found any of their divisions giving <lb/>
            way, they retreated like rain before the wind, still with <lb/>
            showers of arrows seeking to deter their foes from pur- <lb/>
            suing them. So the Parthians were defeated by prodigious <lb/>
            efforts, till our soldiers, exhausted by the heat of the <lb/>
            day, on the signal for retreat being sounded, returned to <pb n="377"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D..163.]"/> <lb/>
            their camp, encouraged for the future to greater deeds of <lb/>
            daring.</p>
          <p>19. In this battle, as I have said, the loss of the Persians <lb/>
            was very great-ours was very slight. But the most im- <lb/>
            portant death in our ranks was that of Vetranio, a gallant <lb/>
            soldier who commanded the legion of Zianni.1</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. AFTER this there was an armistice for three days, while <lb/>
            the men attended to their own wounds or those 'of their <lb/>
            friends, during which we were destitute of supplies, and <lb/>
            distressed by intolerable hunger; and since, as all the corn <lb/>
            and forage was burnt, both men and cattle were in extreme <lb/>
            danger of starvation, a portion of the food which the <lb/>
            horses of the tribunes and superior officers were carrying <lb/>
            was distributed among the lower classes of the soldiers, <lb/>
            who were in extreme want.</p>
          <p>2. And the emperor, who had no royal dainties pre- <lb/>
            pared for himself, but who was intending to sup under the <lb/>
            props of a small tent on a scanty portion of pulse, such as <lb/>
            would often have been despised by a prosperous common <lb/>
            soldier, indifferent to his own comfort, distributed what was <lb/>
            prepared for him among the poorest of his comrades.</p>
          <p>3. He gave a short time to anxious and troubled sleep ; <lb/>
            and when he awoke, and. as was his custom, began to <lb/>
            write something in his tent, in imitation of Julius Cæsar, <lb/>
            while the night was still dark, being occupied with the <lb/>
            consideration of the writings of some philosophers, he saw, <lb/>
            as he told his friends, in mournful guise, the vision of the <lb/>
            Genius of the Empire, whom, when he first became em- <lb/>
            peror, he had seen in Gaul, sorrowfully departing through <lb/>
            the curtains of his tent with the cornucopia, which he <lb/>
            bore in his hand veiled, as well as his head.</p>
          <p>4. And although for a moment he stood stupefied, yet <lb/>
            being above all fear, he commended the future to the will <lb/>
            of heaven; and leaving his bed, which was made on the <lb/>
            ground, he rose, while it was still but little past mid- <lb/>
            night, and supplicating the deities with sacred rites to <lb/>
            avert misfortune, he thought he saw a bright torch, falling, <note type="footnote">1 The Zianni were an Armenian tribe. The legion belonged to tile <lb/>
            Thracian establishment. </note> <pb n="378"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. II."/> <lb/>
            cut a passage through the air and vanish from his sight; <lb/>
            and then he was horror-stricken, fearing that the star of <lb/>
            Mars had appeared openly threatening him.</p>
          <p>5. For this brightness was of the kind which we call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δια</foreign>ï<foreign xml:lang="grc">́σσοντα</foreign>, not falling down or reaching the ground. <lb/>
            Indeed, he who thinks that solid substances can fall from <lb/>
            heaven is rightly accounted profane and mad. But these <lb/>
            occurrences take place in many ways, of which it will be <lb/>
            enough to enumerate a few.</p>
          <p>6. Some think that sparks falling off from the ethereal <lb/>
            fire, as they are able to proceed but a short distance, soon <lb/>
            become extinguished; or, perhaps, that rays of fire coming <lb/>
            against the dense clouds, sparkle from the suddenness of <lb/>
            the contact; or that some light attaches itself to a cloud, <lb/>
            and taking the form of a star, runs on as long as it is sup- <lb/>
            ported by the power of the fire; but being presently ex- <lb/>
            hausted by the magnitude of the space which it traverses, <lb/>
            it becomes dissolved into air, passing into that substance <lb/>
            from the excessive attrition of which it originally derived <lb/>
            its heat.</p>
          <p>7. Therefore, without loss of time, before daybreak, he <lb/>
            sent for the Etruscan soothsayers, and consulted them <lb/>
            what this new kind of star portended: who replied, that <lb/>
            he must cautiously avoid attempting any new enterprise at <lb/>
            present, showing that it was laid down in the works of <lb/>
            Tarquitius,l "on divine affairs," that when a light of this <lb/>
            kind is seen in heaven, no battle ought to be engaged in, <lb/>
            or any similar measure be undertaken.</p>
          <p>8. But as he despised this and many other similar warn- <lb/>
            ings, the diviners at least entreated him to delay his march <lb/>
            for some hours; but they could not prevail even to this <lb/>
            extent, as the emperor was always opposed to the whole <lb/>
            science of divination. So at break of day the camp was <lb/>
            struck.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHEN we set forward, the Persians, who had learnt <lb/>
            by their frequent defeats to shun pitched battles, laid <lb/>
            secret ambuscades on our road, and, occupying the hills on <lb/>
            each side, continually reconnoitred our battalions as they <note type="footnote"> 1 Tarquitius was an ancient Etruscan soothsayer, who had written on <lb/>
            the subject of his art. </note> <pb n="379"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            marched, so that our soldiers, being kept all day on the <lb/>
            watch, could neither find time to erect ramparts round <lb/>
            their camp, or to fortify themselves with palisades.</p>
          <p>2. And while our flanks were strongly guarded, and the <lb/>
            army proceeded onward in as good order as the nature of <lb/>
            the ground would allow, being formed in squares, though <lb/>
            not quite closed up, suddenly news was brought to 'the <lb/>
            emperor, who had gone on unarmed to reconnoitre the <lb/>
            ground in front, that our rear was attacked.</p>
          <p>3. He, roused to anger by this mishap, without stop- <lb/>
            ping to put on his breastplate, snatched up his shield in a <lb/>
            hurry, and while hastening to support his rear, was re- <lb/>
            called by fresh news that the van which he had quitted <lb/>
            was now exposed to a similar attack.</p>
          <p>4. Without a thought of personal danger, he now <lb/>
            hastened to strengthen this division, and then, on another <lb/>
            side, a troop of Persian cuirassiers attacked his centre, and <lb/>
            pouring down with vehemence on his left wing, which <lb/>
            began to give way, as our men could hardly bear up <lb/>
            against the foul smell and horrid cries of the elephants, <lb/>
            they pressed us hard with spears and clouds of arrows.</p>
          <p>5. The emperor flew to every part of the field where the <lb/>
            danger was hottest; and our light-armed troops dashing <lb/>
            out wounded the backs of the Persians, and the hocks of <lb/>
            the animals, which were turned the other way.</p>
          <p>6. Julian, disregarding all care for his own safety, made <lb/>
            signs by waving his hands, and shouted out that the <lb/>
            enemy were fleeing in consternation; and cheering on his <lb/>
            men to the pursuit, threw himself eagerly into the con- <lb/>
            flict. His guards called out to him from all sides to be-, <lb/>
            ware of the mass of fugitives who were scattered in con- <lb/>
            sternation, as he would beware of the fall of an ill-built <lb/>
            roof, when suddenly a cavalry spear, grazing the skin of <lb/>
            his arm, pierced his side, and fixed itself in the bottom of <lb/>
            his liver.</p>
          <p>7. He tried to pull it out with his right hand, and cut <lb/>
            the sinews of his fingers with the double-edged point of <lb/>
            the weapon; and, falling from his horse, he was borne <lb/>
            with speed by the men around him to his tent; and the <lb/>
            physician tried to relieve him.</p>
          <p>8. Presently, when his pain was somewhat mitigated, so <lb/>
            that his apprehensions were relieved, contending. against <pb n="380"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. IIL"/> <lb/>
            death with great energy, he asked for arms and a horse, <lb/>
            in order that, by revisiting his troops, who were still <lb/>
            engaged, he might restore their confidence, and appear <lb/>
            so secure of his own recovery as to have room for <lb/>
            anxiety for the safety of others; with the same energy, <lb/>
            though with a different object, with which the celebrated <lb/>
            leader, Epaminondas, when he was mortally wounded at <lb/>
            Mantinea, and had been borne out of the battle, asked <lb/>
            anxiously for his shield; and when he saw it he died of <lb/>
            his wound cheerfully, having been in fear for the loss of <lb/>
            his shield, while quite fearless about the loss of his <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>9. But as Julian's strength was inferior to his firmness, <lb/>
            and as he was weakened by the loss of blood, he remained <lb/>
            without moving: and presently he gave up all hope of <lb/>
            life ; because, on inquiry, he found that the place where <lb/>
            he had fallen was called Phrygia; for he had been assured <lb/>
            by an oracle that he was destined to die in Phrygia.</p>
          <p>10. When he was brought back to his tent, it was mar- <lb/>
            vellous with what eagerness the soldiers flew to avenge <lb/>
            him, agitated with anger and sorrow ; and striking their <lb/>
            spears against their, shields, determined to die if Fate <lb/>
            so willed it. And although vast clouds of dust obscured <lb/>
            their sight, and the burning heat hindered the activity of <lb/>
            their movements, still, as if they were released from all <lb/>
            military discipline by the loss of their chief, they rushed <lb/>
            unshrinkingly on the enemy's swords.</p>
          <p>11. On the other hand the Persians, fighting with in- <lb/>
            creased spirit, shot forth such clouds of arrows, that we <lb/>
            could hardly see the shooters through them; while the <lb/>
            elephants, slowly marching in front, by the vast size of <lb/>
            their bodies, and the formidable appearance of their crests, <lb/>
            terrified alike our horses and our men.</p>
          <p>12. And far off was heard the clashing of armed men, <lb/>
            the groans of the dying, the snorting of the horses, and the <lb/>
            clang of swords, till both sides were weary of inflicting <lb/>
            wounds, and the darkness of night put an end to the con- <lb/>
            test.</p>
          <p>13. Fifty nobles and satraps of the Persians, with a vast <lb/>
            number of the common soldiers, were slain ; and among <lb/>
            them, two of their principal generals, Merena and Noho- <lb/>
            dares. Let the grandiloquence of antiquity marvel at the <pb n="381"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="AD. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            twenty battles fought by Marcellus in different places ; let <lb/>
            it add Sicinius Dentatus, adorned with his mass of military <lb/>
            crowns; let it further extol Sergius, who is said to have <lb/>
            received twenty-three wounds in his different battles, <lb/>
            among whose posterity was that last Catiline, who tar- <lb/>
            nished the glories of his distinguished family by everlasting <lb/>
            infamy.</p>
          <p>14. But sorrow now overpowered the joy at this success. <lb/>
            While the conflict was thus carried on after the withdrawal <lb/>
            of the emperor, the right wing of the army was exhausted <lb/>
            by its exertions; and Anatolius, at that time the master <lb/>
            of the offices, was killed; Sallust the prefect was in <lb/>
            imminent danger, and was saved only by the exertions of <lb/>
            his attendant, so that at last he escaped, while Sophorius <lb/>
            his counsellor was killed; and certain soldiers, who, after <lb/>
            great danger, had thrown themselves into a neighbouring <lb/>
            fort, were unable to rejoin the main army till three days <lb/>
            afterwards.</p>
          <p>15. And while these events were taking place, Julian, <lb/>
            lying in his tent, thus addressed those who stood around <lb/>
            him sorrowing and mourning: “ The seasonable moment <lb/>
            for my surrendering this life, 0 comrades, has now ar- <lb/>
            rived, and, like an honest debtor, I exult in preparing <lb/>
            to restore what nature reclaims; not in affliction and <lb/>
            sorrow, since I have learnt, from the general teaching of <lb/>
            philosophers, how much more capable of happiness the <lb/>
            mind is than the body; and considering that when the <lb/>
            better part is separated from the worse, it is a subject of <lb/>
            joy rather than of mourning. Reflecting, also, that there <lb/>
            have been instances in which even the gods have given to <lb/>
            some persons of extreme piety, death as the best of all <lb/>
            rewards.</p>
          <p>16. “ And I well know that it is intended as a gift of <lb/>
            kindness to me, to save me from yielding to arduous diffi- <lb/>
            culties, and from forgetting or losing myself; knowing by <lb/>
            experience that all sorrows, while they triumph over the <lb/>
            weak, flee before those who endure them manfully.</p>
          <p>17. "Nor have I to repent of any actions; nor am I <lb/>
            oppressed by the recollection of any grave crime, either <lb/>
            when I was kept in the shade, and, as it were, in a corner, <lb/>
            or after I arrived at the empire, which, as an " honour con- <lb/>
            ferred on me by the gods, I have preserved, as I believe', <pb n="382"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. In, "/>unstained. In civil affairs I have ruled with moderation, <lb/>
            and, whether carrying on offensive or defensive war, have <lb/>
            always been under the influence of deliberate reason; <lb/>
            prosperity, however, does not always correspond to the <lb/>
            wisdom of man's counsels, since the powers above reserve <lb/>
            to themselves the regulation of results.</p>
          <p>18. “ But always keeping in mind that the aim of a just <lb/>
            sovereign is the advantage and safety of his subjects, I have <lb/>
            been always, as you know, inclined to peace, eradicating <lb/>
            all licentiousness—that great corruptress of things and <lb/>
            manners-by every part of my own conduct; and I am <lb/>
            glad to feel that in whatever instances the republic, like <lb/>
            an imperious mother, has exposed me deliberately to <lb/>
            danger, I have stood firm, inured to brave all fortuitous <lb/>
            disturbing events.</p>
          <p>19. “ Nor am I ashamed to confess that I have long <lb/>
            known, from prophecy, that I should fall by the sword. <lb/>
            And therefore do I venerate the everlasting God that I <lb/>
            now die, not by any secret treachery, nor by a long or <lb/>
            severe disease, or like a condemned criminal, but I quit <lb/>
            the world with honour, fairly earned, in the midst of a <lb/>
            career of flourishing glory. For, to any impartial judge, <lb/>
            that man is base and cowardly who seeks to die when <lb/>
            he ought not, or who avoids death when it is seasonable <lb/>
            for him.</p>
          <p>20. “ This is enough for me to say, since my strength is <lb/>
            failing me ; but I designedly forbear to speak of creating a <lb/>
            new emperor, lest I should unintentionally pass over some <lb/>
            worthy man ; or, on the other hand, if I should name one <lb/>
            whom I think proper, I should expose him to danger in <lb/>
            the event of some one else being preferred. But, as an <lb/>
            honest child of the republic, I hope that a good sovereign <lb/>
            will be found to succeed me."</p>
          <p>21. After having spoken quietly to this effect, he, as <lb/>
            it were with the last effort of his pen, distributed his <lb/>
            private property among his dearest friends, asking for <lb/>
            Anatolius, the master of the offices. And when the prefect <lb/>
            Sallust replied that he was now happy, he understood that <lb/>
            he was slain, and bitterly bewailed the death of his friend, <lb/>
            though he had so proudly disregarded his own.</p>
          <p>22. And as all around were weeping, he reproved them <lb/>
            with still undiminished authority, saying that it was a <pb n="383"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            humiliating thing to mourn for an emperor who was just <lb/>
            united to heaven and the stars.</p>
          <p>23. And as they then became silent, he entered into an <lb/>
            intricate discussion with the philosophers Maximus and <lb/>
            Priscus on the sublime nature of the soul, while the wound <lb/>
            of his pierced side was gaping wide. At last the swelling <lb/>
            of his veins began to choke his breath, and having drank <lb/>
            some cold water, which he had asked for, he expired quietly <lb/>
            about midnight, in the thirty-first year of his age. He <lb/>
            was born at Constantinople, and in his childhood lost <lb/>
            his father, Constantius, who, after the death of his <lb/>
            brother Constantine, perished amid the crowd of competi- <lb/>
            tors for the vacant crown. And at the same early age he <lb/>
            lost his mother, Basilina, a woman descended from a long <lb/>
            line of noble ancestors.</p>

          <p>§ 1. JULIAN was a man to be classed with heroic characters, <lb/>
            and conspicuous for the brilliancy of his exploits and his <lb/>
            innate majesty. For since, as wise men lay it down, there <lb/>
            are four cardinal virtues,-temperance, prudence, justice, <lb/>
            and fortitude,-with corresponding external accessaries, <lb/>
            such as military skill, authority, prosperity, and liberality, <lb/>
            he eagerly cultivated them all as if they had been but one.</p>
          <p>2. And in the first place, he was of a chastity so inviolate <lb/>
            that, after the loss of his wife he never indulged in any <lb/>
            sexual pleasures, recollecting what is told in Plato of <lb/>
            Sophocles the tragedian, that being asked when he was a <lb/>
            very old man whether he still had any commerce with <lb/>
            women, he said " No," with this further addition, that " he <lb/>
            was glad to say that he had at all times avoided such <lb/>
            indulgence as a tyrannous and cruel master."</p>
          <p>3. And to strengthen this resolution he often called to <lb/>
            mind the words of the lyric poet Bacchylides, whom he <lb/>
            used to read with pleasure, and who said that as a fine <lb/>
            painter makes a handsome face, so chastity adorns a life <lb/>
            that aims at greatness. And even when in the prime of <lb/>
            life he so carefully avoided this taint that there was never <lb/>
            the least suspicion of his becoming enamoured even of <lb/>
            any of his household, as has often happened.</p>
          <p>4. And this kind of temperance increased in him, being <lb/>
            strengthened by a sparing indulgence in eating and sleep- <pb n="384"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. IV."/> <lb/>
            ing, to which he rigidly adhered whether abroad or at <lb/>
            home. For in time of peace his frugal allowance of food <lb/>
            was a marvel to all who knew him, as resembling that of a <lb/>
            man always wishing to resume the philosopher's cloak. <lb/>
            And in his various campaigns he used commonly only to <lb/>
            take a little plain food while standing, as is the custom of <lb/>
            soldiers.</p>
          <p>5. And when after being fatigued by labour he had <lb/>
            refreshed his body with a short rest, as soon as he awoke he <lb/>
            would go by himself round all the sentries and outposts; <lb/>
            after which he retired to his serious studies.</p>
          <p>6. And if any voice could bear witness to his use of the <lb/>
            nocturnal lamp, by which he pursued his lucubrations, <lb/>
            it would show that there was a vast difference between <lb/>
            some emperors and him, who did not even indulge himself <lb/>
            in those pleasures permitted by the necessities of human <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>7. Of his prudence there were also many proofs, of <lb/>
            which it will be sufficient to recount a few. He was pro- <lb/>
            foundly skilled in war, and also in the arts of peace. He <lb/>
            was very attentive to courtesy, claiming just so much <lb/>
            respect as he considered sufficient to mark the difference <lb/>
            between contempt and insolence. He was older in virtue <lb/>
            than in years, being eager to acquire all kinds of know- <lb/>
            ledge. He was a most incorruptible judge, a rigid censor <lb/>
            of morals and manners, mild, a despiser of riches, and <lb/>
            indeed of all mortal things. Lastly, it was a common <lb/>
            saying of his, " That it was beneath a wise man, since he <lb/>
            had a soul, to aim at acquiring praise by his body."</p>
          <p>8. Of his justice there are many conspicuous proofs: <lb/>
            first, because, with all proper regard to circumstances and <lb/>
            persons, he inspired awe without being cruel; secondly, <lb/>
            because he repressed vice by making examples of a few, <lb/>
            and also because he threatened severe punishment more <lb/>
            frequently than he employed it.</p>
          <p>9. Lastly, to pass over many circumstances, it is certain <lb/>
            that he treated with extreme moderation some who were <lb/>
            openly convicted of plotting against him, and mitigated <lb/>
            the rigour of the punishment to which they were sentenced <lb/>
            with genuine humanity.</p>
          <p>10. His many battles and constant wars displayed his <lb/>
            fortitude, as did his endurance of extreme cold and heat. <pb n="385"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            From a common soldier we require the services of the <lb/>
            body, from an emperor those of the mind. But having <lb/>
            boldly thrown himself into battle, he would slay a ferocious <lb/>
            foe at a single blow; and more than once he by himself <lb/>
            checked the retreat of our men at his own personal risk. <lb/>
            And when he was putting down the rule of the furious <lb/>
            Germans, and also in the scorching sands of Persia, he en- <lb/>
            couraged his men by fighting in the front ranks of his army.</p>
          <p>11. Many well-known facts attest his skill in all that <lb/>
            concerns a camp; his storming of cities and castles amid <lb/>
            the most formidable dangers; the variety of his tactics for <lb/>
            battles, the skill he showed in choosing healthy spots <lb/>
            for his camps, the safe principles on which his lines of <lb/>
            defence and outposts were managed.</p>
          <p>12. So great was his authority, that while he was feared <lb/>
            he was also greatly loved as his men's comrade in their <lb/>
            perils and dangers. And in the hottest struggles he took <lb/>
            notice of cowards for punishment. And while he was yet <lb/>
            only Cæsar, he kept his soldiers in order while confront- <lb/>
            ing the barbarians, and destitute of pay as I have men- <lb/>
            tioned before. And haranguing his discontented troops, <lb/>
            the threat which he used was that he would retire into <lb/>
            private life if they continued mutinous.</p>
          <p>13. Lastly, this single instance will do as well as many, <lb/>
            by haranguing the Gallic legions, who were accustomed <lb/>
            to the frozen Rhine, in a simple address, he persuaded <lb/>
            them to traverse vast regions and to march through the <lb/>
            warm plains of Assyria to the borders of Media.</p>
          <p>14. His good fortune was so conspicuous that, riding as <lb/>
            it were on the shoulders of Fortune, who was long his <lb/>
            faithful guide, he overcame enormous difficulties in his <lb/>
            victorious career. And after he quitted the regions of the <lb/>
            west, they all remained quiet during his life-time, as if <lb/>
            under the influence of a wand powerful enough to tran- <lb/>
            quillize the world.</p>
          <p>15. Of his liberality there are many and undoubted <lb/>
            proofs. Among which are his light exactions of tribute, <lb/>
            nis remission of the tribute of crowns, and of debts long <lb/>
            due, his putting the rights of individuals on an equal <lb/>
            footing with those of the treasury, his restoration of their <lb/>
            revenues and their lands to different cities, with the ex- <lb/>
            ception of such as had been lawfully sold by former <note type="footnote">2G </note> <pb n="386"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. IT."/> <lb/>
            ,princes; and also the fact that he was never covetous of <lb/>
            money, which he thought was better kept by its owners, <lb/>
            often quoting the saying, " that Alexander the Great, when <lb/>
            he was asked where he kept his treasures, kindly answered <lb/>
            Among my friends.'"</p>
          <p>16. Having discussed those of his good qualities which <lb/>
            have come within our knowledge, let us now proceed to <lb/>
            unfold his faults, though they have been already slightly <lb/>
            noticed. He was of an unsteady disposition; but this <lb/>
            fault he corrected by an excellent plan, allowing people <lb/>
            to set him right when guilty of indiscretion.</p>
          <p>17. He was a frequent talker, rarely silent. Top much <lb/>
            devoted to divination, so much so as in this particular to <lb/>
            equal the emperor Adrian. He was rather a superstitious <lb/>
            than a legitimate observer of sacred rites, sacrificing count- <lb/>
            less numbers of victims; so that it was reckoned that if he <lb/>
            had returned from the Parthians there would have been <lb/>
            a scarcity of cattle. Like the celebrated case of Marcus <lb/>
            Cæsar,1 about whom it was written, as it is said, " The <lb/>
            white cattle to Marcus Cæsar, greeting. If you conquer <lb/>
            there is an end of us."</p>
          <p>18. He was very fond of the applause of the common <lb/>
            people, and an immoderate seeker after praise even in the <lb/>
            most trifling matters; often, from a desire of popularity, <lb/>
            indulging in conversation with unworthy persons.</p>
          <p>19. But in spite of all this he deserved, as he used; to <lb/>
            say himself, to have it thought that that ancient Justice, <lb/>
            whom Aratus says fled to heaven from disgust with the <lb/>
            vices of men, had in his reign returned again to the earth; <lb/>
            only that sometimes he acted arbitrarily and inconsistently.</p>
          <p>20. For he made some laws which, with but few excep- <lb/>
            tions, were not offensive, though they very positively en- <lb/>
            forced or forbade certain actions. Among the exceptions <lb/>
            was that cruel one which forbade Christian masters of <lb/>
            rhetoric and grammar to teach unless they came over to <lb/>
            the worship of the heathen gods.</p>
          <p>21. And this other ordinance was equally intolerable, <lb/>
            namely one which allowed some persons to be unjustly <lb/>
            enrolled in the companies of the municipal guilds, though <lb/>
            they were foreigners, or by privilege or birth wholly <lb/>
            . unconnected with such companies. <note type="footnote"> 1 That is Marcus Aurelius. </note> <pb n="387"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> 22. As to his personal appearance-it was this. He was <lb/>
            of moderate stature, with soft hair, as if he had carefully <lb/>
            dressed it, with a rough beard ending in a point, with <lb/>
            beautiful brilliant eyes, which displayed the subtlety of <lb/>
            ,his mind, with handsome eyebrows and a straight nose, a <lb/>
            rather large mouth, with a drooping lower lip, a thick and <lb/>
            stooping neck, large and broad shoulders. From head to <lb/>
            foot he was straight and well proportioned, which made <lb/>
            him strong and a good runner.</p>
          <p>23. And since his detractors have accused him of provok- <lb/>
            ing new wars, to the injury of the commonwealth, let them <lb/>
            know the unquestionable truth, that it was not Julian but <lb/>
            Constantius who occasioned the hostility of the Parthians <lb/>
            (by greedily acquiescing in the falsehoods of Metrodorus, <lb/>
            As we'have already set forth.</p>
          <p>24. In consequence of this conduct our armies were <lb/>
            .slain, numbers of our soldiers were taken prisoners, cities <lb/>
            were rased, fortresses were stormed and destroyed, pro- <lb/>
            vinces were exhausted by heavy expenses, and in short the <lb/>
            Persians, putting their threats into effect, were led to seek <lb/>
            to 'become masters of everything up to Bithynia and the <lb/>
            shores of the Propontis.</p>
          <p>25. While the Gallic wars grew more and more violent, <lb/>
            the Germans overrunning our territories, and being on the <lb/>
            point of forcing the passes of the Alps in order to invade <lb/>
            Italy, there was nothing to be seen but tears and consterna- <lb/>
            tion, the recollection of the past being bitter, the expecta- <lb/>
            tion of the future still more woeful. All these miseries, <lb/>
            this youth, being sent into the West with the rank of Cæsar, <lb/>
            put an end to with marvellous celerity, treating the kings <lb/>
            of those countries as base-born slaves.</p>
          <p>26. Then in order to re-establish the prosperity of the <lb/>
            east, with similar energy he attacked the Persians, and <lb/>
            would have gained in that country both a triumph and a <lb/>
            surname, if the will of heaven had bec-n in accordance with <lb/>
            -his glorious plai and actions.</p>
          <p>| 27. And as we know by experience that some men are <lb/>
            so rash and hasty that if conquered they return to battle, <lb/>
            if shipwrecked, to the sea, in short, each to the difficulties <lb/>
            ,-bywhich he h been frequently overcome, so some find <lb/>
            fault with this emperor for returning to similar exploits <lb/>
            after having been repeatedly victorious. <pb n="388"/>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER these events there was no time for lamentation <lb/>
            or weeping. For after he had been laid out as well as the <lb/>
            circumstances and time permitted, that he might be buried <lb/>
            where he himself had formerly proposed, at daybreak the <lb/>
            next morning, which was on the 27th of June, while the <lb/>
            enemy surrounded us on every side, the generals of the <lb/>
            army assembled, and having convened the chief officers of <lb/>
            the cavalry and of the legions, deliberated about the election <lb/>
            of an emperor.</p>
          <p>2. There were great and noisy divisions. Arinthæus <lb/>
            and Victor, and the rest of those who had been attached to <lb/>
            the court of Constantius, sought for a fit man of their own <lb/>
            party. On the other hand, N evitta and Dagalaiphus, and <lb/>
            the nobles of the Gauls, sought for a man among their own <lb/>
            ranks.</p>
          <p>a. While the matter was thus in dispute, they all unani- <lb/>
            mously agreed upon Sallustius. And when he pleaded ill <lb/>
            health and old age, one of the soldiers of rank observing <lb/>
            his real and fixed reluctance said," And what would you do <lb/>
            if the emperor while absent himself, as has often happened, <lb/>
            had intrusted you with the conduct of this war? Would <lb/>
            you not have postponed all other considerations and applied <lb/>
            yourself to extricating the soldiers at once from the <lb/>
            difficulties which press on them ? Do so now: and then, <lb/>
            if we are allowed to reach Mesopotamia, it will be time <lb/>
            enough for the united suffrages of both armies to declare a <lb/>
            lawful emperor."</p>
          <p>4. Amid these little delays in so important a matter, <lb/>
            before opinions were justly weighed, a few made an uproar, <lb/>
            as often happens in critical circumstances, and Jovian was <lb/>
            elected emperor, being the chief officer of the guards, arid <lb/>
            a man of fair reputation in respect of his father's services. <lb/>
            For he was the son of Varronianus, a distinguished count,' <lb/>
            who had not long since retired from military service to lead <lb/>
            a private life.</p>
          <p>5. And immediately he was clothed in the imperial <lb/>
            robes, and was suddenly led forth out of the tent and <note type="footnote">1 It must be remembered that throughout Ammianus's history a <lb/>
            count is always spoken of as of higher rank than a duke. </note> <pb n="389"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            passed at a quick pace through the army as it was pre- <lb/>
            paring to march.</p>
          <p>6. And as the line extended four miles, those in the van <lb/>
            hearing some persons salute Jovian as Augustus, raised the <lb/>
            same cry still more loudly, for they were caught by the <lb/>
            relationship, so to say, of the name, which differed only by <lb/>
            one letter from that of Julian, and so they thought that <lb/>
            Julian was recovered and was being led forth with great <lb/>
            acclamations as had often been the case. But when the <lb/>
            new emperor, who was both taller and less upright, was <lb/>
            seen, they suspected what had happened, and gave vent <lb/>
            to tears and lamentations.</p>
          <p>7. And if any lover of justice should find fault with <lb/>
            what was done at this extreme crisis as imprudent, he <lb/>
            might still more justly blame sailors who, having lost a <lb/>
            skilful pilot when both winds and waves are agitated by <lb/>
            a storm, commit the helm of their vessel to some one of <lb/>
            their comrades.</p>
          <p>8. This affair having been thus settled by a blind sort of <lb/>
            decision of Fortune, the standard-bearer of the Jovian <lb/>
            legion, which Varronianus had formerly commanded, having <lb/>
            had a quarrel with the new emperor while he was a private <lb/>
            individual, because he had been a violent disparager of his <lb/>
            father, now fearing danger at his hand, since he had risen <lb/>
            to a height exceeding any ordinary fortune, fled to the <lb/>
            Persians. And having been allowed to tell what he knew, <lb/>
            he informed Sapor, who was at hand, that the prince whom <lb/>
            he dreaded was dead, and that Jovian, who had hitherto <lb/>
            been only an officer of the guards, a man of neither energy <lb/>
            nor courage, had been raised by a mob of camp drudges <lb/>
            to a kind of shadow of the imperial authority.</p>
          <p>9. Sapor hearing this news, which he had always <lb/>
            anxiously prayed for, and being elated by this unexpected <lb/>
            good fortune, having reinforced the troops who had fought <lb/>
            against us with a strong body of the royal cavalry, sent <lb/>
            them forward with speed to attack the rear of our army.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. AND while these arrangements were being made, the <lb/>
            victims and entrails were inspected on behalf of Jovian, <lb/>
            and it was pronounced that he would ruin everything if he <pb n="390"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. VI."/> <lb/>
            remained in the camp, as he proposed, but that if he quitted <lb/>
            it he would have the advantage.</p>
          <p>2. And just as we were beginning our mareh, the <lb/>
            Persians attacked us, preceded by their elephants. Both <lb/>
            our horses and men were at first disordered by their roaring <lb/>
            and formidable onset; but the Jovian and Herculean le- <lb/>
            gions slew a few of the monsters, and made a gallant re2 <lb/>
            sistanee to the mounted euirassiers.</p>
          <p>3. Then the legions of the Jovii and Vietores coming up <lb/>
            to aid their comrades, who were in distress; also slew two <lb/>
            elephants and a great number of the enemy's troops. And <lb/>
            on our left wing three most gallant men were slain, Julian, <lb/>
            Maerobius, and Maximus, all tribunes of the legions which <lb/>
            were then the ehief of the whole army.</p>
          <p>4. When they were buried a.-, well as circumstances <lb/>
            permitted, as night was drawing on, and as we were press... <lb/>
            ing forward with all speed towards a fort called Sumere; <lb/>
            the dead body of Anatolius was recognized and buried with <lb/>
            a hurried funeral. Here also we were rejoined by sixty <lb/>
            soldiers and a party of the guards of the palaee, whom we <lb/>
            have mentioned as having taken refuge in a fort called <lb/>
            Vaccatum.</p>
          <p>5. Then on the following day we pitched our eamp in a <lb/>
            valley in as favourable a spot as the nature of the ground <lb/>
            permitted, surrounding it with a rampart like a wall, with <lb/>
            sharp stakes fixed all round like so many swords, with the <lb/>
            exception of one wide entrance.</p>
          <p>6. And when the enemy saw this they attacked us with <lb/>
            all kinds of missiles from their thickets, reproaching us <lb/>
            also as traitors and murderers of an excellent prince. For <lb/>
            they had heard by the vague report of some deserters that <lb/>
            Julian had fallen by the weapon of a Roman.</p>
          <p>7. And presently, while this was going on, a body of <lb/>
            cavalry ventured to foree their way in by the Prætorian <lb/>
            gate, and to advance almost up to the emperor's tent. But <lb/>
            they were vigorously repulsed with the loss of many of <lb/>
            their men killed and wounded.</p>
          <p>8. Quitting this eamp, the next night we reached a place <lb/>
            called Chareha, where we were safe, because .the artificial <lb/>
            mounds of the river had been broken to prevent the Saracens <lb/>
            from overrunning Armenia, so that no one was able to <lb/>
            harass our lines, as they had done before.. ' <pb n="391"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> r 9. Then on the 1st of July we marched thirty furlongs: <lb/>
            more, and came to a city called Dura, where our baggage- <lb/>
            horses were so jaded, that their drivers, being mostly re- <lb/>
            cruits, marched on foot till they were hemmed in by a <lb/>
            troop of Saracens; and they would all have been killed if <lb/>
            some squadrons of our light cavalry had not gone to their <lb/>
            assistance in their distress.</p>
          <p>10. We were exposed to the hostility of these Saracens, <lb/>
            because Julian had forbidden that the presents and gra- <lb/>
            tuities, to which they had been accustomed, should be <lb/>
            given to them; and when they complained to him, they, <lb/>
            were only told that a warlike and vigilant emperor had <lb/>
            iron, not gold.</p>
          <p>11. Here, owing to the obstinate hostility of the Persians, <lb/>
            we lost four days. For when we advanced they followed <lb/>
            us, compelling us to retrace our steps by their incessant <lb/>
            attacks. When we halted gradually to fight, they retired, <lb/>
            tormenting us by their long delay. And now (for when <lb/>
            men are in great fear even falsehoods please them) a report <lb/>
            being spread that we were at no great distance from our <lb/>
            own frontier, the army raised an impatient shout, and <lb/>
            demanded to be at once led across the Tigris.</p>
          <p>12. But the emperor and his officers opposed this de- <lb/>
            mand, and showed them that the river, now just at the <lb/>
            time of the rising of the Dogstar, was much flooded, en- <lb/>
            treated them not to trust themselves to its dangerous <lb/>
            currents, reminding them that most of them could not <lb/>
            swim, and adding likewise that the enemy had occupied <lb/>
            the banks of the river, swoln as it was at many parts..</p>
          <p>13. But when the demand was repeated over and over <lb/>
            again in the camp, and the soldiers with shouts and great <lb/>
            eagerness began to threaten violence, the order was given <lb/>
            very unwillingly that the Gauls, mingled with the northern <lb/>
            Germans, should lead the way into the river, in order that <lb/>
            if they were carried away by the violence of the stream <lb/>
            the obstinacy of the rest might be shaken ; or on the other <lb/>
            hand, if they accomplished the passage in safety the rest <lb/>
            might attempt it with more confidence.</p>
          <p>14. And men were selected suited to such an enterprise, <lb/>
            who from their childhood had been accustomed in their <lb/>
            native land to cross the greatest rivers. And when the- <lb/>
            darkness of night presented an opportunity for making the <pb n="392"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BE. XXV. CH. VII."/> <lb/>
            attempt unperceived, as if they had just escaped from a <lb/>
            prison, they reached the opposite bank sooner than could <lb/>
            have been expected; and having beaten down and slain <lb/>
            numbers of the Persians whom, though they had been <lb/>
            placed there to guard the passage, their fancied security <lb/>
            had lulled into a gentle slumber, they held up their hands, <lb/>
            and shook their cloaks so as to give the concerted signal <lb/>
            that their bold attempt had succeeded.</p>
          <p>15. And when the signal was seen, the soldiers became <lb/>
            eager to cross, and could only be restrained by the promise <lb/>
            of the engineers to make them bridges by means of bladders <lb/>
            and the hides of slaughtered animals.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. WHILE these vain attempts were going on, king Sapor, <lb/>
            both while at a distance, and also when he approached, <lb/>
            received from his scouts and from our deserters a true <lb/>
            account of the gallant exploits of our men, of the disgraceful <lb/>
            slaughter of his own troops, and also of his elephants in <lb/>
            greater numbers than he ever remembered to have lost <lb/>
            before. And he heard also that the Roman army, being <lb/>
            hardened by its continual labours since the death of its <lb/>
            glorious chief, did not now think so much, as they said, of <lb/>
            safety as of revenge; and were resolved to extricate them- <lb/>
            selves from their difficulties either by a complete victory <lb/>
            or by a glorious death.</p>
          <p>2. He looked on this news as formidable, being aware by <lb/>
            experience that our troops who were scattered over these <lb/>
            provinces could easily be assembled, and knowing also that <lb/>
            his own troops after their heavy losses were in a state of <lb/>
            the greatest alarm; he also heard that we had in Meso- <lb/>
            potamia an army little inferior in numbers to that before <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>3. And besides all this, his courage was damped by the <lb/>
            fact of five hundred men having crossed that swollen river <lb/>
            by swimming in perfect safety, and having slain his guards, <lb/>
            and so emboldening the rest of their comrades to similar <lb/>
            hardihood.</p>
          <p>4. In the mean time, as the violence of the stream pre- <lb/>
            vented any bridges from being constructed, and as every- <lb/>
            thing which could be eaten was consumed, we passed two <pb n="393"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            days in great misery, and the starving soldiers began to be <lb/>
            furious with rage, thinking it better to perish by the sword <lb/>
            than by hunger, that most degrading death.</p>
          <p>5. But the eternal providence of God was on our side, <lb/>
            and beyond our hopes the Persians made the first overtures, <lb/>
            sending the Surena and another noble as ambassadors to <lb/>
            treat for peace, and they themselves being in a state of <lb/>
            despondency, as the Romans, having proved superior in <lb/>
            almost every battle, weakened them daily.</p>
          <p>6. But the conditions which they proposed were difficult <lb/>
            and intricate, since they pretended that, out of regard for. <lb/>
            humanity, their merciful monarch was willing to permit <lb/>
            the remains of our army to return home, provided the <lb/>
            Cæsar, with his officers, would satisfy his demands.</p>
          <p>7. In reply, we sent as ambassadors on our part, Arin- <lb/>
            thæus and Sallustius; and while the proper terms were <lb/>
            being discussed with great deliberation, we passed four <lb/>
            more days in great suffering from want of provisions, more <lb/>
            painful than any kind of torture.</p>
          <p>8. And in this truce, if before the ambassadors were sent, <lb/>
            the emperor, being disabused, had retired slowly from the <lb/>
            territories of the enemy, he would have reached the forts <lb/>
            of Corduena, a rich region belonging to us, only one hun- <lb/>
            dred miles from the spot where these transactions were <lb/>
            being carried on.</p>
          <p>9. But Sapor obstinately demanded (to use his own <lb/>
            language) the restoration of those territories which had <lb/>
            been taken from him by Maximian; but as was seen in <lb/>
            the progress of the negotiation, he in reality required, as. <lb/>
            the price of our redemption, five provinces on the other <lb/>
            side of the Tigris,— Arzanena, Moxœna, Zabdicena, Rehe- <lb/>
            mena, and Corduena, with fifteen fortresses. besides Nisibis. <lb/>
            and Singara, and the important fortress called the camp of <lb/>
            the Moors.</p>
          <p>10. And though it would have been better to fight ten <lb/>
            battles than to give up one of them, still a set of flatterers <lb/>
            harassed our pusillanimous emperor with harping on the <lb/>
            dreaded name of Procopius, and affirmed that unless we <lb/>
            quickly reorossed the river, that chieftain, as soon as he <lb/>
            heard of the death of Julian, would easily bring about a <lb/>
            revolution which no one could resist, by means of the <lb/>
            fresh troops which he had under his command. <pb n="394"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. VIII"/> 11. Jovian, being wrought upon by the constant, reite- <lb/>
            ration of these evil counsels, without further delay gave <lb/>
            up everything that was demanded, with this abatement, <lb/>
            which he obtained with difficulty, that the inhabitants of <lb/>
            Nisibis and Singara should not be given up to the Persians- <lb/>
            as well as the cities themselves.; and that the Homan gar- <lb/>
            risons in the forts about to be surrendered should be <lb/>
            permitted to retire to fortresses of our own.</p>
          <p>12. To which another mischievous and unfair condition <lb/>
            was added, that after this treaty was concluded we were <lb/>
            not to be at liberty to assist Arsaces against the Persians, <lb/>
            if he implored our aid, though he had always been our <lb/>
            friend and trusty ally. And this was insisted on by Sapor <lb/>
            for two reasons, in order that the man might be punished' <lb/>
            who had laid waste Chiliocomum at the emperor's com- <lb/>
            mand, and also that facility might be given for invading <lb/>
            Armenia without a check. In consequence of this it fell <lb/>
            out subsequently that Arsaces was taken prisoner, and <lb/>
            that. amid different dissensions and disturbances, the <lb/>
            Parthians laid violent hands on the greater portion of <lb/>
            Armenia, where it borders on Media, and on the town of <lb/>
            Artaxata.</p>
          <p>13. This ignoble treaty being made, that nothing might <lb/>
            be done during the armistice, in contravention of its terms, <lb/>
            some men of rank were given as hostages on each side: <lb/>
            on ours, Remora, Victor, and Bellovædius, tribunes of dis- <lb/>
            tinguished legions : and on that of the enemy, one of their <lb/>
            chief nobles named Bineses, and three other satraps of. <lb/>
            note.</p>
          <p>14. So peace was made for thirty years, and ratified by <lb/>
            solemn oaths: and we, returning by another line of march, <lb/>
            because the parts near the river were rugged and difficult,; <lb/>
            suffered severely for want of water and piovisions.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THE peace which had been granted on pretence of <lb/>
            humanity was turned to the ruin of many who were so <lb/>
            exhausted by want of food as to be at the last gasp, and, <lb/>
            who in consequence could only creep along, and were' <lb/>
            either carried away by the current of the river from not <lb/>
            being able to swim, or if able to, overcome the force of the: <pb n="395"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            stream so far as to reach the bank, were either slain like <lb/>
            sheep by the Saracens or Persians (bccause, as we stated <lb/>
            some time back, the Germans had driven them out), or sent <lb/>
            to. a distance to be sold for slaves.</p>
          <p>2. But when the trumpets openly gave the signal for <lb/>
            crossing the river, it was dreadful to see with what ardour <lb/>
            every individual hastened to rush into this danger, pre- <lb/>
            ferring himself to all his comrades, in the desire of avoid- <lb/>
            ing the many dangers and distresses behind him. Some <lb/>
            tried to guide the beasts who were swimming about at <lb/>
            random, with hurdles hurriedly put together ; others, seated <lb/>
            on bladders, and others, being driven by necessity to all <lb/>
            kinds of expedients, sought to pass through the opposing <lb/>
            waves by crossing them obliquely.</p>
          <p>3. The emperor himself with a few others crossed over <lb/>
            in the small boats, which we said were saved when the <lb/>
            Sect was burnt, and then sent the same vessels backwards <lb/>
            and forwards till our whole body was brought across. <lb/>
            And at length all of us, except such as were drowned, <lb/>
            reached the opposite bank of the river, being saved amid <lb/>
            our difficulties by the favour of the Supreme Deity.</p>
          <p>4. While we were still oppressed with the fear of im- <lb/>
            pending disasters, we learnt from information brought in <lb/>
            by our outposts that the Persians were throwing a bridge <lb/>
            over the river some way off, at a point out of our sight, in <lb/>
            order that while all ideas of war were put an end to on our <lb/>
            side by the ratification of the treaty of peace, they might <lb/>
            come upon our invalids as they proceeded carelessly <lb/>
            onwards, and on the animals exhausted with-fatigue. Butt <lb/>
            when they found their purpose discovered, they relin- <lb/>
            quished their base design.</p>
          <p>5. Being now relieved from this suspicion, we hastened <lb/>
            on by rapid marches, and approached Hatra, an ancient: <lb/>
            town in the middle of a desert, which bad been long since- <lb/>
            abandoned, though at different times those, warlike em- <lb/>
            perors, Trajan and, Sevcrus, had attacked it with a view <lb/>
            to its destruction, but had been almost destroyed with <lb/>
            their armies, as'we have related in our history of their <lb/>
            exploits.</p>
          <p>6. Andas we now learnt that over the vast plain before: <lb/>
            us for seventy miles in that arid region no water could be <lb/>
            found butinch. as wasbrackish and fetid and no kind of <pb n="396"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. VII"/> <lb/>
            food but southern wood, wormwood, dracontium, and other <lb/>
            bitter herbs, we filled the vessels which we had with <lb/>
            sweet water, and having slain the camels and the rest of <lb/>
            the beasts of burden, we thus sought to insure some kind <lb/>
            of supplies, though not very wholesome.</p>
          <p>7. For six days the army marched, till at last even grass, <lb/>
            the last comfort of extreme necessity, could not be found; <lb/>
            when Cassianus, Duke of Mesopotamia, and the tribune <lb/>
            Mauricius, who had been sent forward with this object, <lb/>
            came to a fort called Ur, and brought some food from the <lb/>
            supplies which the army under Procopius and Sebastian, <lb/>
            by living sparingly, had managed to preserve.</p>
          <p>8. From this place another person of the name of Proco- <lb/>
            pius, a secretary, and Memoridus, a military tribune, was <lb/>
            sent forward to Illyricum and Gaul to announce the death <lb/>
            of Julian, and the subsequent promotion of Jovian to the <lb/>
            rank of emperor.</p>
          <p>9. And Jovian deputed them to present his father-in- <lb/>
            law Lucillianus (who, after giving up military service, <lb/>
            had retired to the tranquillity of private life, and who was <lb/>
            at that time dwelling at Sirmium) with a commission as <lb/>
            captain of the forces of cavalry and infantry, and to urge <lb/>
            him. at the same time to hasten to Milan, to support him <lb/>
            there in any difficulties which might arise, or (what he <lb/>
            feared most) to oppose any attempts which might be made <lb/>
            to bring about a revolution.</p>
          <p>10. And he also gave them still more secret letters, in <lb/>
            which he warned Lucillianus to bring him some picked <lb/>
            men of tried energy and fidelity, of whose aid he might <lb/>
            avail himself according as affairs should turn out.</p>
          <p>11. He also made a wise choice, and selected Malarichus, <lb/>
            who was at that time in Italy on his own private affairs, <lb/>
            sending him the ensigns of office that he might succeed <lb/>
            Jovinus as commander of the forces in Gaul, in which <lb/>
            appointment he had an eye on two important objects; <lb/>
            first, to remove a general of especial merit who was an <lb/>
            object of suspicion on that very account, and also by the <lb/>
            promotion to so high a position of a man whose hopes were <lb/>
            not set on anything so lofty to bind him to exert all his <lb/>
            zeal in supporting the doubtful position of the maker of <lb/>
            his fortunes.</p>
          <p>: 12. And the officers who went to perform these com- <pb n="397"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            mands were also enjoined to extol the emperor's con- <lb/>
            duct, and wherever they went to agree in reporting that <lb/>
            the Parthian campaign had been brought to an honourable <lb/>
            termination; they were also charged to prosecute their <lb/>
            journey with all speed by night and day, delivering as they <lb/>
            went letters from the new emperor to all the governors of <lb/>
            provinces and commanders of the forces on their road; <lb/>
            and when they had secretly learnt the opinions of them all, <lb/>
            to return to him with all speed, in order that when he <lb/>
            knew what was being done in the distant provinces, he might <lb/>
            be able to frame well-digested and wise plans for strength- <lb/>
            ening himself in his government.</p>
          <p>13. But Fame (being alway the most rapid bearer of bad <lb/>
            news), outstripping these couriers, flew through the differ- <lb/>
            ent provinces and nations ; and above all others struck the <lb/>
            citizens of Nisibis with bitter sorrow when they heard that <lb/>
            their city was surrendered to Sapor, whose anger and <lb/>
            enmity they dreaded; from recollecting the havoc and <lb/>
            slaughter which he had made in his frequent attempts to <lb/>
            take the place.</p>
          <p>14. For it was clear that the whole eastern empire would <lb/>
            have fallen under the power of Persia long before if it had <lb/>
            not been for the resistance which this city, strong in its <lb/>
            admirable position and its mighty walls, had been able to <lb/>
            offer. But miserable as they now were, and although they <lb/>
            were filled with a still greater fear of what might befall <lb/>
            them hereafter, they were supported by this slender hope, <lb/>
            that, either from his own inclination or from being won <lb/>
            over by their prayers, the emperor might consent to keep <lb/>
            their city in its existing state, as the strongest bulwark of <lb/>
            the east.</p>
          <p>15. While different reports were flying about of what <lb/>
            had taken place, the scanty supplies which I have spoken <lb/>
            of as having been brought, were consumed, and necessity <lb/>
            might have driven the men to eat one another, if the flesh <lb/>
            of the animals slain had not lasted them a little longer; <lb/>
            but the consequence of our destitute condition was, that <lb/>
            the arms and baggage were thrown away; for we were <lb/>
            so worn out with this terrible famine, that whenever a <lb/>
            single bushel of corn was found (which seldom happened), <lb/>
            it was sold for ten pieces of gold at the least.</p>
          <p>16. Marching on from thence, we come to Thilsaphata <pb n="398"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH.IX."/> <lb/>
            where Sebastian and Procopius, with the tribunes; and chief <lb/>
            officers of the legions which had been placed under their <lb/>
            command for the protection of Mesopotamia, came to meet <lb/>
            the emperor as the solemn occasion required, and being <lb/>
            kindly received, accompanied us on our march.</p>
          <p>17. After this, proceeding with all possible speed, we <lb/>
            rejoiced when we saw Nisibis, where the emperor pitched <lb/>
            a standing camp outside the walls ; and being most <lb/>
            earnestly entreated by the whole population to come to <lb/>
            .lodge in ,the palace according to the custom of his prede- <lb/>
            cessors, he positively refused, being ashamed that an im- <lb/>
            pregnable city should be surrendered to an enraged enemy <lb/>
            while he was within its walls.</p>
          <p>... 18. But as the evening was getting dark, Jovian, the chief <lb/>
            secretary, was seized while at supper, the man who at the <lb/>
            siege of the city Maogamaleha we have spoken of as escaping <lb/>
            with others by a subterranean passage, and being led to an <lb/>
            out-of-the-way place, was thrown headlong down a dry well, <lb/>
            and overwhelmed with a heap of stones which were thrown <lb/>
            down upon him, because after the death of. Julian he also <lb/>
            had been named by a few persons as fit to be made emperor; <lb/>
            and after the election of his namesake had not behaved <lb/>
            with any modesty, but had been heard to utter secret <lb/>
            whispers concerning the business, and had from time to <lb/>
            time invited some of the leading soldiers to entertainments.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IX.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THE next day Binescs, one of the Persians of whom <lb/>
            .wo, have spoken as the most distinguished among them, <lb/>
            hastening to execute the commission of his king, demanded <lb/>
            from Jovian the immediate performance of his promise; <lb/>
            and by his permission he entered the city of Nisibis, and <lb/>
            -raised the standard of his nation on the citadel, announcing <lb/>
            to the citizens a miserable emigration from their native <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>2. Immediately they were all commanded to expatriate <lb/>
            .themselves, in vain stretching forth their hands in entreaty <lb/>
            not to be compelled to depart, affirming that they by them- <lb/>
            selves, without drawing on the public resources for either <lb/>
            provisions or soldiers, were sufficient to defend their own <lb/>
            home in full confidence that Justice would be on their side <pb n="399"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D.63.]"/> <lb/>
            while fighting for the place of their birth, as they had often <lb/>
            found her to be before. Both nobles and common people <lb/>
            joined in this supplication ; but they spoke in vain as to the <lb/>
            winds, the emperor fearing the crime of perjury, as he <lb/>
            pretended, though in reality the object of his fear was <lb/>
            very different.</p>
          <p>3. Then a man of the name of Sabinus, eminent among <lb/>
            his fellow-citizens both for his fortune and birth, replied <lb/>
            with great fluency that Constantius too was at one time <lb/>
            defeated by the Persians in the terrible strife of fierce war, <lb/>
            that afterwards he fled with a small body of comrades to <lb/>
            the unguarded station of Hibita, where he lived on a scanty <lb/>
            and uncertain supply of bread which was brought him by <lb/>
            an old woman from the country; and yet that to the end <lb/>
            of his life he lost no territory; while Jovian, at the very <lb/>
            beginning of his reign, was yielding up the wall of his <lb/>
            provinces, by the protection of which barrier they bad <lb/>
            hitherto remained safe from the earliest ages.</p>
          <p>4. But as he could not prevail on the emperor, who per- <lb/>
            sisted obstinately in alleging the obligation of his oath, pre- <lb/>
            sently, when Jovian, who had for some time refused the <lb/>
            crown which was offered to him, accepted it under a show <lb/>
            of compulsion, an advocate, named Silvanus, exclaimed <lb/>
            boldly, " May you, 0 emperor, be so crowned in the rest <lb/>
            of your cities." But Jovian was offended at his words, <lb/>
            and ordered the whole body of citizens to quit the city <lb/>
            within three days, in despair as they were at the existing <lb/>
            -state of affairs.</p>
          <p>5. Accordingly, men were appointed to compel obedience <lb/>
            to this order, with threats of death to every one who de- <lb/>
            layed his departure ; and the whole city was a scene of <lb/>
            mourning and lamentation, and in every quarter nothing <lb/>
            was heard but one universal wail, matrons tearing their <lb/>
            'hair when about to be driven from their homes, in which <lb/>
            they had been born and brought up," the mother who had <lb/>
            'lost her children, or the wife her husband, about to be torn <lb/>
            from the place rendered sacred by their shades, clinging to <lb/>
            their doorposts, embracing their thresholds, and pouring <lb/>
            forth floods of tears.</p>
          <p>6. Every road was crowded, each person straggling <lb/>
            away as he could. Many, too, loaded themselves with as <lb/>
            much of their property as they thought they could carry <pb n="400"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="(BK. XXV. CH. IX"/> <lb/>
            while leaving behind them abundant and costly furniture, <lb/>
            for this they could not remove for want of beasts of <lb/>
            burden.</p>
          <p>7. Thou in this place, 0 fortune of the Roman world, <lb/>
            art justly an object of accusation, who, while storms were <lb/>
            agitating the republic, didst strike the helm from the <lb/>
            hand of a wise sovereign, to intrust it to an inexperienced <lb/>
            youth, whom, as he was not previously known for any re- <lb/>
            markable actions in his previous life, it is not fair either to <lb/>
            blame or praise.</p>
          <p>8. But it sunk into the heart of all good citizens, that <lb/>
            while, out of fear of a rival claimant of his power, and <lb/>
            constantly fancying some one in Gaul or in Illyricum <lb/>
            might have formed ambitious designs, he was hastening to <lb/>
            outstrip the intelligence of his approach, he should have <lb/>
            committed, under pretence of reverence for an oath, an <lb/>
            act so unworthy of his imperial power as to abandon <lb/>
            Nisibis, which ever since the time of Mithridates had been <lb/>
            the chief hindrance to the encroachments of the Persians <lb/>
            in the East.</p>
          <p>9. For never before since the foundation of Rome, if <lb/>
            one consults all its annals, I believe has any portion of our <lb/>
            territories been surrendered by emperor or consul to an <lb/>
            enemy. Nor is there an instance of a triumph having been <lb/>
            celebrated for the recovery of anything that had been lost, <lb/>
            but only for the increase of our dominions.</p>
          <p>10. On this principle, a triumph was refused to Publius <lb/>
            Scipio for the recovery of Spain, to Fulvius for the acqui- <lb/>
            sition of Capua after a long struggle, and to Opimius after <lb/>
            many battles with various results, because the people of <lb/>
            Fregellæ, who at that time were our implacable enemies, <lb/>
            had been compelled to surrender.</p>
          <p>11. For ancient records teach us that disgraceful treaties, <lb/>
            made under the pressure of extreme necessity, even after <lb/>
            the parties to them have sworn to their observance in set <lb/>
            terms, have nevertheless been soon dissolved by the renewal <lb/>
            of war; as in the olden time, after the legions had been <lb/>
            made to pass under the yoke at the Caudine Forks, in Sam. <lb/>
            nium; and also when an infamous peace was contemplate <lb/>
            by Albinus in Numidia; and when Mancinus, the author of <lb/>

            drawn, the city surrendered, and the tribune Constantiu <lb/>
            had been sent to deliver up to the Persian nobles the for- <lb/>
            tresses and districts agreed upon, Procopius was sent <lb/>
            forward with the remains of Julian, to bury them in the <lb/>
            suburbs of Tarsus, according to his directions while alive. <lb/>
            He departed, I say, to fulfil this commission, and as soon <lb/>
            as the body was buried, he quitted Tarsus, and though <lb/>
            sought for with great diligence, he could not be found <lb/>
            anywhere, till long afterwards he was suddenly seen at <lb/>
            Constantinople invested with the purple.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THESE transactions having been thus concluded, after <lb/>
            a long march we arrived at Antioch, where for several <lb/>
            days in succession many terrible omens were seen, as if <lb/>
            the gods were offended, since those who were skilled in <lb/>
            the interpretation of prodigies foretold that impending <lb/>
            events would be melancholy.</p>
          <p>2. For the statue of Maximian Cæsar, which was placed <lb/>
            in the vestibule of the palace, suddenly lost the brazen <lb/>
            globe, formed after the figure of the heavens, which it <lb/>
            bore in its hand. Also the beams in the council chamber <lb/>
            sounded with an ominous creak; comets were seen in the <lb/>
            daytime, respecting the nature of which natural philo- <lb/>
            sophers differ.</p>
          <p>3. For some think they have received the name because <lb/>
            they scatter fire wreathed like hair1 by a number of stars <lb/>
            being collected into one mass; others think that they <lb/>
            derive their fire from the dry evaporation of the earth <lb/>
            rising gradually to a greater height; some fancy that the <lb/>
            sunbeams as they rapidly pass, being prevented by dense <lb/>
            clouds from descending lower, by infusing their brilliancy <lb/>
            into a dense body show a light which, as it were, seems <lb/>
            spotted with stars to the eyes of mortals. Some again <lb/>
            have a fixed opinion that this kind of light is visible when <lb/>
            some cloud, rising to a greater height than usual, becomes <lb/>
            illuminated by its proximity to the eternal fires; or, that <lb/>
            at all events there are some stars like the rest, of which <lb/>
            the special times of their rising and setting are not under- <note type="footnote">1 From <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόμη</foreign>, hair. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2D </note> <pb n="402"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH. x."/> <lb/>
            stood by mail. There are many other suggestions about <lb/>
            comets which have been put forth by men skilled in mUll. <lb/>
            dane philosophy, but I must pass over them, as my subject <lb/>
            calls me in another direction.</p>
          <p>4. The emperor remained a short time at Antioch, dis- <lb/>
            tracted by many important cares, but desirous above all <lb/>
            things to proceed. And so, sparing neither man nor beast, <lb/>
            he started from that city in the depth of winter, though, <lb/>
            as I have stated, many omens warned him from such a <lb/>
            course, and made his entrance into Tarsus, a noble city <lb/>
            of Cilicia, the origin of which I have already related.</p>
          <p>5. Being in excessive haste to depart from thence, lie <lb/>
            ordered decorations for the tomb of Julian, which was <lb/>
            placed in the suburb, in the. road leading to the defiles of <lb/>
            Mount Taurus. Though a sound judgment would have <lb/>
            decided that the ashes of such a prince ought not to lie <lb/>
            within sight of the Cydnus, however beautiful and clear <lb/>
            that river is, but, to perpetuate the glory of his achieve- <lb/>
            ments, ought rather to be placed where they might be <lb/>
            washed by the Tiber as it passes through the Eternal <lb/>
            City and winds round the monuments of the ancient gods.</p>
          <p>6. Then quitting Tarsus, he reached by forced marches <lb/>
            Tyana, a town of Cappadocia, where Procopius the secro- <lb/>
            tary and Memoridus the tribune met him on their return, <lb/>
            and related to him all that occurred; beginning, as the <lb/>
            order of events required, at the moment when Lucillianus <lb/>
            (who had entered Milan with the tribunes Seniauchus and <lb/>
            Valentinian, whom he had brought with him, as soon as it <lb/>
            was known that Malarichus had refused to accept the post <lb/>
            which was offered to him) hastened on with all speed to <lb/>
            Rheims.</p>
          <p>7. There, as if it had been a time of profound tranquil- <lb/>
            lity, he went quite beside the mark, as we say, and while <lb/>
            things were still in a very unsettled state, he most unsea- <lb/>
            sonably devoted his attention to scrutinizing the accounts <lb/>
            of the commissary, who, being conscious of fraud and guilt, <lb/>
            fled to the standards of the soldiers, and pretended that <lb/>
            while Julian was still alive some one of the common <lb/>
            people had attempted a revolution. By this false report <lb/>
            the army became so greatly excited that they put Lucil- <lb/>
            lianus and Seniauchus to death. For Valentinian, who <lb/>
            soon afterwards became emperor, had been concealed by <pb n="403"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 364.]"/> <lb/>
            his host Primitivus in a safe place, overwhelmed with fear <lb/>
            and not knowing which way to flee.</p>
          <p>8. This disastrous intelligence was accompanied by one <lb/>
            piece of favourable news,-that the soldiers who had been <lb/>
            sent by Jovian were approaching (men known in the camp <lb/>
            as the heads of the classes), who brought word that the <lb/>
            Gallic army had cordially embraced the cause of Jovian.</p>
          <p>9. When this was known, the command of the second <lb/>
            class of the Scutarii was given to Valentinian, who had <lb/>
            returned with those men; and Vitalianus, who had been <lb/>
            a soldier of the Heruli, was placed among the body- <lb/>
            guards, and afterwards, when raised to the rank of count, <lb/>
            met with very ill success in Illyricum. And at the same <lb/>
            time Arinthæus was despatched into Gaul with letters for <lb/>
            Jovinus, with an injunction to maintain his ground and <lb/>
            act with resolution and constancy; and he was further <lb/>
            charged to make an example of the author of the disturb- <lb/>
            ance which had taken place, and to send the ringleaders of <lb/>
            the sedition as prisoners to the court.</p>
          <p>. 10. When these matters had been arranged as seemed <lb/>
            most expedient, the Gallic soldiers obtained an audience <lb/>
            of the emperor at Aspuna, a small town of Galatia, and <lb/>
            having been admitted into the council chamber, after <lb/>
            the message which they brought had been listened to with <lb/>
            approval, they received rewards and were ordered to re- <lb/>
            turn to their standards. '</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">A.D. 364.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>11. When the emperor had made his entry-into Ancyra, <lb/>
            everything necessary for his procession having been pre- <lb/>
            pared as well as the time permitted, Jovian entered on <lb/>
            the consulship, and took as his colleague his son Varroni- <lb/>
            anus, who was as yet quite a child, and whose cries as he <lb/>
            obstinately resisted being borne in the curule chair, ac- <lb/>
            cording to the ancient fashion, was an omen of what shortly <lb/>
            happened.</p>
          <p>12. Here also the appointed termination of life carried <lb/>
            off Jovian with rapidity. For when he had reached Dadas- <lb/>
            tana, a place on the borders of Bithynia and Galatia, he <lb/>
            was found dead in the night; and many uncertain reports. <lb/>
            were spread concerning his death.</p>
          <p>13. It was said that he had been unable to bear the <pb n="404"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXV. CH.X"/> <lb/>
            unwholesome smell of the fresh mortar with which his <lb/>
            bedehamber had been plastered. Also that his head had <lb/>
            swollen in consequence of a great fire of eoals, and that <lb/>
            this had been the cause of his death; others said that he <lb/>
            had died of a surfeit from over. eating. He was in the, <lb/>
            thirty-third year of his age. And though he and Scipio <lb/>
            Æmilianus both died in the same manner, we have not <lb/>
            found out that any investigation into the death of either <lb/>
            ever took place.</p>
          <p>14. Jovian was slow in his movements, of a eheerful <lb/>
            eountenanee, with blue eyes; very tall, so much so that <lb/>
            it was long before any of the royal robes eould be found to <lb/>
            fit him. He was anxious to imitate Constantius, often oe- <lb/>
            eupying himself with serious business till after midday, <lb/>
            and being fond of jesting with his friends in public.</p>
          <p>15. He was given to the study of the Christian law, <lb/>
            sometimes doing it marked honour; he was tolerably <lb/>
            learned in it, very well inclined to its professors, and <lb/>
            disposed to promote them to be judges, as was seen in <lb/>
            some of his appointments. He was fond of eating, ad- <lb/>
            dieted to wine and women, though he would perhaps have <lb/>
            eorreeted these propensities from a sense of what was due <lb/>
            to the imperial dignity.</p>
          <p>16. It was said that his father, Varronianus, through the <lb/>
            warning of a dream, had long sinee foreseen what hap- <lb/>
            pened, and had foretold it to two of his most faithful <lb/>
            friends, with the addition that he himself also should <lb/>
            become consul. But though part of his prophecy became <lb/>
            true, he could not procure the fulfilment of the rest. For <lb/>
            though he heard of his son's high fortune, he died before <lb/>
            he could see him.</p>
          <p>17. And because the old man had it foretold to him <lb/>
            in his sleep that the highest offiee was destined for his <lb/>
            name, his grandson Varronianus, while still an infant, was <lb/>
            made consul with his father Jovian, as we have related <lb/>
            above.</p><pb n="405"/>

            emperor at Nicæa, in his absence-A dissertation on leap-year.- <lb/>
            II. Valentinian, being summoned from Ancyra, comes with <lb/>
            speed to Nicæa, and is again unanimously elected emperor, and <lb/>
            having been clothed in the purple, and saluted as Augustus, <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. HAVING narrated with exceeding care the series of <lb/>
            transactions in my own immediate recollection, it is <lb/>
            necessary now to quit the track of notorious events, in <lb/>
            order to avoid the dangers often found in connection with <lb/>
            truth; and also to avoid exposing ourselves to unreason- <lb/>
            able critics of our work, who would make an outcry as if <lb/>
            they had been personally injured, if anything should be <lb/>
            passed over which the emperor has said at dinner, if any <lb/>
            cause should be overlooked for which the common soldiers <pb n="406"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. Cn. I."/> <lb/>
            were assembled round their standards, or if there were <lb/>
            not inserted a mention of every insignificant fort, however <lb/>
            little such things ought to have room. in a varied descrip- <lb/>
            tion of different districts. Or if the name of every one <lb/>
            who filled the office of urban prætor be not given, and <lb/>
            many other things quite impertinent to the proper idea <lb/>
            of a history, which duly touches on prominent oceur- <lb/>
            renees, and does not stoop to investigate petty details or <lb/>
            secret motives, which any one who wishes to know may <lb/>
            as well hope to be able to count those little indivisible <lb/>
            bodies flying through space, which we call atoms.</p>
          <p>2. Some of the ancients, fearing this kind of criticism, <lb/>
            though they composed accounts of various actions in a <lb/>
            beautiful style, forbore to publish them, as Tully, a wit- <lb/>
            ness of authority, mentions in a letter to Cornelius Nepos. <lb/>
            However, let us, despising the ignorance of people in <lb/>
            general, proceed with the remainder of our narrative.</p>
          <p>3. The course of events being terminated so mournfully, <lb/>
            by the death of two emperors at such brief intervals, <lb/>
            the army, having paid the last honours to the dead body <lb/>
            which was sent to Constantinople to be interred among <lb/>
            the other emperors, advanced towards Nicaea, which is <lb/>
            the metropolis of Bithynia, where the chief civil and <lb/>
            military authorities applied themselves to an anxious con- <lb/>
            sideration of the state of affairs, and as some of them <lb/>
            were full of vain hopes, they sought for a ruler of dignity <lb/>
            and proved wisdom.</p>
          <p>4. In reports, and the concealed whispers of a few <lb/>
            persons, the name of Equitius was ventilated, who was at <lb/>
            that time tribune of the first class of the Scutarii; but he <lb/>
            was disapproved by the most influential leaders as being <lb/>
            rough and boorish; and their inclinations rather tended <lb/>
            towards Januarins, a kinsman of Julian, who was the chief <lb/>
            commissary of the camp in Illyricum..</p>
          <p>5. However, he also was rejected because he was at a <lb/>
            distance ; and, as a man well qualified and at hand, Va- <lb/>
            lentinian was elected by the unanimous consent of all <lb/>
            men, and the manifest favour of the Deity. He was the <lb/>
            tribune of the second class of the Scutarii. and had been <lb/>
            left at Ancyra, it having been arranged that he should <lb/>
            follow afterwards. And. because no one denied that this <lb/>
            was for the advantage of the republic, messengers were sent <pb n="407"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A..D. 364.]"/> <lb/>
            to beg him to come with all speed ; and for ten days the <lb/>
            empire was without a ruler, which the soothsayer Marcus, <lb/>
            by an inspection of entrails at Rome, announced to be the <lb/>
            case at that moment in Asia.</p>
          <p>6. But in the meanwhile, to prevent any attempt to <lb/>
            overtum what had been thus settled, or any movement on <lb/>
            the part of the fickle soldiers to set aside the election in <lb/>
            favour of some one on the spot, Equitins and Leo, who <lb/>
            was acting as commissary under Dagalaiphus the com- <lb/>
            mander of the cavalry, and who afterwards incurred great <lb/>
            odium as master of the offices,1 strove with great prudence <lb/>
            and vigilance to establish, to the best of their power, what <lb/>
            had been the decision of the whole army, they being also <lb/>
            natives of Pannonia, and partisans of the emperor elect.</p>
          <p>7. When Valentinian arrived in answer to the summons <lb/>
            he had received, either in obedience to omens which <lb/>
            guided him in the prosecution of the affair, as was gene- <lb/>
            rally thought, or to repeated warnings conveyed in dreams, <lb/>
            he would not come into public or be seen by any one for <lb/>
            two days, because he wished to avoid the bissextile day of <lb/>
            February which came at that time, and which he knew to <lb/>
            have been often an unfortunate day for the Roman empire : <lb/>
            of this day I will here give a plain explanation.</p>
          <p>8. The ancients who were skilled in the motions of the <lb/>
            world and the stars, among whom the most eminent are <lb/>
            Meton, Euctemon, Hipparchus, and Archimedes, define it <lb/>
            as the period of the revolving year when the sun, in accord- <lb/>
            ance with the laws which regulate the heavens, having <lb/>
            gone through the zodiac, in three hundred and sixty-five <lb/>
            days and nights, returns to the same point: as, for instance, <lb/>
            when, after having moved on from the second degree of <lb/>
            the Ram, it returns again to it after having completed its <lb/>
            circuit.</p>
          <p>9. But the exact period of a year extends over the num- <lb/>
            ber of days above mentioned and six hours more. And <lb/>
            so the correct commencement of the next year will not <lb/>
            begin till after midday and ends in the evening. The <lb/>
            third year begins at the first watch, and lasts till the sixth <lb/>
            hour of the night. The fourth begins at daybreak.</p>
          <p>10. Now as the beginning of each year varies, one com- <lb/>
            mencing at the sixth hour of the day, another at the same <note type="footnote">1 Master of the Offices—v. Bohn's ' Gibbon,' ii., 223. </note> <pb n="408"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. If."/> <lb/>
            hour of the night, to prevent the calculation from throwing <lb/>
            all science into confusion by its perplexing diversity, and <lb/>
            the months of autumn from sometimes being found to come <lb/>
            in the spring, it has been settled that those six hours <lb/>
            which in a period of four years amount to twenty-four <lb/>
            shall be put together so as to make one day and night.</p>
          <p>11. And after much consideration it has been so arranged <lb/>
            with the concurrence of many learned men, that thus the <lb/>
            revolutions of the year may come to one regular end, <lb/>
            removed from all vagueness and uncertainty, so that the <lb/>
            theory of the heavens may not be clouded by any error, <lb/>
            and that the months may retain their appointed position.</p>
          <p>12. Before their dominions had reached any wide extent, <lb/>
            the Romans were for a long time ignorant of this fact, and <lb/>
            having been for many years involved in obscure difficulties, <lb/>
            they were in deeper darkness and error than ever, when <lb/>
            they gave the priests the power of intercalating, which <lb/>
            they, in profligate subservience to the interests of the far- <lb/>
            mers of the revenue, or people engaged in lawsuits, effected <lb/>
            by making additions or subtractions at their own pleasure.</p>
          <p>13. And from this mode of proceeding many other expe- <lb/>
            dients were adopted, all of which were fallacious, and which <lb/>
            I think it superfluous now to enumerate. But when they <lb/>
            were given up, Octavianus Augustus, in imitation of the <lb/>
            Greeks, corrected these disorderly arrangements and put <lb/>
            an end to these fluctuations, after great deliberation fixing <lb/>
            the duration of the year at twelve months and six hours, <lb/>
            during which the sun with its perpetual movement runs <lb/>
            through the whole twelve signs, and concludes the period <lb/>
            of a whole year.</p>
          <p>14. This rule of the bissextile year, Rome, which is <lb/>
            destined to endure to the end of time, established with the <lb/>
            aid of the heavenly Deity. Now let us return to our <lb/>
            history.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHEN this day, so little fit in the opinion of many for <lb/>
            beginning any great affair, had passed, at the approach of <lb/>
            evening, by the advice of the prefect Sallust, an order was <lb/>
            issued by general consent, and with the penalty of death <lb/>
            attached to any neglect of it, that no one of higher autho- <pb n="409"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 364.]"/> <lb/>
            rity, or suspected of aiming at any objects of ambition, <lb/>
            should appear in public the next morning.</p>
          <p>2. And when, while the numbers who allowed their <lb/>
            own empty wishes to torment them were weary of the <lb/>
            slowness of time, the night ended at last, and daylight <lb/>
            appeared, the soldiers were all assembled in one body, <lb/>
            and Valentinian advanced into the open space, and <lb/>
            mounting a tribunal of some height which had been <lb/>
            erected on purpose, he was declared ruler of the empire <lb/>
            as a man of due wisdom by this assembly, bearing the <lb/>
            likeness of a comitia, with the unanimous acclamations of <lb/>
            all present.</p>
          <p>3. Presently- he was clothed with the imperial robe, <lb/>
            and crowned, and saluted as Augustus with all the delight <lb/>
            which the pleasure of this novelty could engender; and <lb/>
            then he began to harangue the multitude in a premeditated <lb/>
            speech. But as he put forth his arm to speak more freely, <lb/>
            a great murmur arose, the centuries and maniples be- <lb/>
            ginning to raise an uproar, and the whole mass of the <lb/>
            cohorts presently urging that a second emperor should be <lb/>
            at once elected.</p>
          <p>4. And though some people fancied that this cry was <lb/>
            raised by a few corrupt men in order to gain the favour of <lb/>
            those who had been passed over, it appeared that that was <lb/>
            a mistake, for the cry that was raised did not resemble <lb/>
            a purchased clamour, but rather the unanimous voice <lb/>
            of the whole multitude all animated with the same wish, <lb/>
            because recent examples had taught them to fear the <lb/>
            instability of this high fortune. Presently the murmurs of <lb/>
            the furious and uproarious army appeared likely to give <lb/>
            rise to a complete tumult, and men began to fear that <lb/>
            the audacity of the soldiers might break out into some <lb/>
            atrocious act.</p>
          <p>5. And as Valentinian feared this above everything, he <lb/>
            raised his hand firmly with the vigour of an emperor full <lb/>
            of confidence, and venturing to rebuke some as obstinate <lb/>
            and seditious, he delivered the speech he had intended <lb/>
            without interruption.</p>
          <p>6. " I exult, 0 ye gallant defenders of our provinces, <lb/>
            and boast and always shall boast that your valour has con- <lb/>
            f'erred on me, who neither expected nor desired such an <lb/>
            honour, the government of the Roman empire, as the fittest <pb n="410"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. II."/> <lb/>
            man to discharge its duties. That which was in your <lb/>
            hands before an emperor was elected, you have completed <lb/>
            beneficially and gloriously, by raising to this summit of <lb/>
            honour a man whom you know by experience to have <lb/>
            lived from his earliest youth to his present age with <lb/>
            honour and integrity. Now then I entreat you to listen <lb/>
            with quietness to a few plain observations which I think <lb/>
            will be for the public advantage.</p>
          <p>7. " So numerous are the matters for the consideration <lb/>
            of an emperor, that I neither deny nor even doubt that it is <lb/>
            a desirable thing that he should have a colleague of equal <lb/>
            power to deal with every contingency. And I myself, as <lb/>
            a man, do also fear the great accumulation of cares which <lb/>
            must be mine, and the various changes of events. But <lb/>
            still we must use every exertion to insure concord, by <lb/>
            which even the smallest affairs give strength. And that <lb/>
            is easily secured if. your patience concurring with your <lb/>
            equity, you willingly grant mc what belongs to me in <lb/>
            this matter. For Fortune, the ally of all good coun- <lb/>
            sels, will I trust aid me, while to the very utmost of <lb/>
            my ability and power, I diligently search for a wise and <lb/>
            temperate partner. For as wise men lay it down, not <lb/>
            only in the case of empire where the dangers are frequent <lb/>
            and vast, but also in matters of private and everyday life, <lb/>
            a man ought rather to take a stranger into his friendship <lb/>
            after he has had opportunities of judging him to be wise, <lb/>
            than to ascertain his wisdom after he has made him his <lb/>
            friend.</p>
          <p>8. " This, in hopes of a happier fortune, I promise. Do <lb/>
            you, retaining your steadiness of conduct and loyalty, <lb/>
            recruit the vigour of your minds and bodies while rest <lb/>
            in your winter quarters allows you to do so. And you <lb/>
            shall soon receive what is your due on my nomination <lb/>
            as emperor."</p>
          <p>0. Having finished this speech, to which his unexpected <lb/>
            authority gave weight, the emperor by it brought all over <lb/>
            to his opinion. And even those who a few minutes before <lb/>
            with loud voices demanded something different, now, fol- <lb/>
            lowing his advice, surrounded him with the eagles and <lb/>
            standards, and, forming a splendid and formidable escort <lb/>
            of all classes and ranks of the army, conducted him to tho <lb/>
            palace. <pb n="411"/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the decisions of Fate were rapidly bringing these <lb/>
            events to pass in the East, Apronianus, the governor of <lb/>
            Rome, an upright and severe judge, among the grave cases <lb/>
            by which that prefecture is continually oppressed, was <lb/>
            labouring with most particular solicitude to suppress the <lb/>
            magicians, who were now getting scarce, and who, having <lb/>
            been taken prisoners, had been, after being put to the <lb/>
            question, manifestly convicted by the evidence of their <lb/>
            accomplices of having injured some persons. These he <lb/>
            put to death, hoping thus, by the punishment of a few, to <lb/>
            drive the rest, if any were still concealed, out of the city <lb/>
            through fear of similar treatment.</p>
          <p>2. And he is said to have acted thus energetically <lb/>
            because having been promoted by Julian while he was still <lb/>
            in Syria, he had lost one eye on his journey to take pos- <lb/>
            session of his office, and he suspected that this was owing <lb/>
            to his having been the object of some nefarious practices ; <lb/>
            therefore with just but unusual indignation he exerted <lb/>
            great industry in searching out these and similar crimes. <lb/>
            This made him appear cruel to some persons, because the <lb/>
            populace were continually pouring in crowds into the <lb/>
            amphitheatre while he was conducting the examination of <lb/>
            some of the greatest criminals.</p>
          <p>3. At last, after many punishments of this kind had <lb/>
            been inflicted, he condemned to death the charioteer Hila-' <lb/>
            rinus, who was convicted on his own confession of having <lb/>
            intrusted his son, who was but a very young boy, to a <lb/>
            sorcerer to be taught some secret mysteries forbidden by <lb/>
            the laws, in order that he might avail himself of unlawful <lb/>
            assistance without the privity of any one. But, as the- <lb/>
            executioner held him but loosely he suddenly escaped and <lb/>
            fled to a Christian altar, and had to be dragged from it, <lb/>
            when he was immediately beheaded.</p>
          <p>4. But soon ample precautions were taken against the <lb/>
            recurrence of this and similar offences, and there were <lb/>
            none or very few who ventured afterwards to insult the <lb/>
            rigour of the public law by practising these iniquities. But <lb/>
            at a later period long impunity nourished atrocious crimes; <lb/>
            and licentiousness increased to such a pitch that a certain- <pb n="412"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. IV."/> <lb/>
            senator followed the example of Hilarinus, and was con- <lb/>
            victed of having almost articled by a regular contract one <lb/>
            of his slaves to a teacher of the black art, to be instructed <lb/>
            in his impious mysteries, though he escaped punishment <lb/>
            by an enormous bribe, as common report went.</p>
          <p>5. And, as it was said, having thus procured an ac- <lb/>
            quittal, though he ought to have been ashamed even to have <lb/>
            such an accusation, he took no pains to efface the stain, <lb/>
            but as if, among a lot of infamous persons, he were the <lb/>
            only one absolutely innocent, he used to ride on a hand- <lb/>
            somely caparisoned horse through the streets, and is still <lb/>
            always attended by a troop of slaves, as if by a new and <lb/>
            curious fashion lie were desirous to attract particular ob- <lb/>
            servation, just as Duilius in ancient times after his glorious <lb/>
            naval victory became so arrogant as to cause a flute-player <lb/>
            to precede him with soft airs when he returned to his <lb/>
            house after any dinner-party.</p>
          <p>6. Under this same Apronianus all necessaries were so <lb/>
            abundant in Rome that not the slightest murmur because <lb/>
            of any scarcity of supplies was ever heard, which is very <lb/>
            common at Rome.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. BUT in Bithynia, Valentinian, as we have already <lb/>
            mentioned, having been declared emperor, having fixed the <lb/>
            next day but one for beginning his march, assembled his <lb/>
            chief officers, and, as if the course which he preferred was <lb/>
            to follow their advice, inquired whom they recommended <lb/>
            him to take for his colleague ; and when no one made him <lb/>
            any answer, Dagalaiphus, who at that time was commander <lb/>
            of the cavalry, boldly answered " If, 0 excellent emperor, <lb/>
            you love your own kindred, you have a brother; if you <lb/>
            love the republic, then seek the fittest man to invest."</p>
          <p>2. Valentinian was offended with this speech, but kept <lb/>
            silence, and dissembled his displeasure and his intentions. <lb/>
            And having-made a rapid journey he reached Nicomedia on <lb/>
            the first of March, where he appointed his brother Valens <lb/>
            master of the horse with the rank of tribune.</p>
          <p>3. And after that, when he reached Constantinople, <lb/>
            revolving many considerations in his mind, and considering <lb/>
            that he himself was already overwhelmed with the mag- <pb n="413"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 364.]"/> <lb/>
            nitude of pressing business, he thought that the emergency <lb/>
            would admit of no delay; and on the 28th of March he led <lb/>
            Valens into the suburbs, where, with the consent of all <lb/>
            men (and indeed no one dared to object), he declared him <lb/>
            emperor, bad him clothed in the imperial robes, and <lb/>
            crowned with a diadem, and then brought him back in the <lb/>
            same carriage with himself as the legitimate partner of his <lb/>
            power, though in fact he was to be more like an obedient <lb/>
            servant, as the remainder of my narrative will show.</p>
          <p>4. After these matters had been thus settled without <lb/>
            any interruption, the two emperors suffered a long time <lb/>
            from a violent fever; but when out of danger (as they <lb/>
            were more active in the investigation of evils than in <lb/>
            removing them) they intrusted the commission to in- <lb/>
            vestigate the secret causes of this malady to Ursatius the <lb/>
            master of the offices, a fierce Dalmatian, and to Juventius <lb/>
            Siscianus the quæstor, their real motive, as was constantly <lb/>
            reported, being to bring the memory of Julian and that <lb/>
            of his friends into odium, as if their illness had been owing <lb/>
            to their secret malpractices. But this insinuation was <lb/>
            easily disposed of, since not a word could be adduced to <lb/>
            justify any imputation of such treason.</p>
          <p>5. At this time the trumpet as it were gave signal for <lb/>
            way throughout the whole Roman world; and the bar- <lb/>
            barian tribes on our frontier were moved to make incur- <lb/>
            sion on those territories which lay nearest to them. The <lb/>
            Allemanni laid waste Gaul and Rhætia at the same time. <lb/>
            The Sarmatians and Quadi ravaged Pannonia. The Picts, <lb/>
            Scots, Saxons, and Atacotti harassed the Britons with in- <lb/>
            cessant invasions ; the Austoriani and other Moorish tribes <lb/>
            attacked Africa with more than usual violence. Predatory <lb/>
            bands of the Goths plundered Thrace.</p>
          <p>6. The king of the Persians poured troops into Armenia, <lb/>
            exerting all his power to reduce that people again into <lb/>
            subjection to his authority; without any just cause, <lb/>
            arguing, that after the death of Julian, with whom he <lb/>
            had made a treaty of peace, there was nothing that ought <lb/>
            to hinder him from recovering those lands which he could <lb/>
            prove to have belonged in former times to his ancestors. <pb n="414"/>

          <p>§ 1. So after the winter had passed off quietly, the two <lb/>
            emperors in perfect harmony, one having been formally <lb/>
            elected, and the other having been admitted to share that <lb/>
            honour, though ehiefly in appearance, having traversed <lb/>
            Thrace, arrived at Nissa, where in the suburb which is <lb/>
            known as Mediana, and is three miles from the city, they <lb/>
            divided the counts between them as if they were going to <lb/>
            separate.</p>
          <p>2. To the share of Valentinian, by whose will every- <lb/>
            thing was settled, there fell Jovinus, who had lately been <lb/>
            promoted by Julian to be the commander of the forces in <lb/>
            Gaul, and Dagalaiphus, on whom Jovian had conferred a <lb/>
            similar rank; while Victor was appointed to follow Valens <lb/>
            to the east: and he also had originally been promoted by <lb/>
            the decision of Julian; and to him was given Ariathæus <lb/>
            as a colleague. For Lupicinus, who in like manner had <lb/>
            sometime before been appointed by Jovian to command <lb/>
            the cavalry, was defending the eastern districts.</p>
          <p>3. At the same time Equitius received the command <lb/>
            of the army of Illyrieum, with the rank not of general but <lb/>
            of count; and Serenianus, who sometime before had re- <lb/>
            tired from the service, now, being a citizen of Pannonia, <lb/>
            returned to it, and joined Valens as commander of the <lb/>
            cohort of his guards. This was the way in which these <lb/>
            affairs were settled, and in which the troops were divided.</p>
          <p>4. After this, when the two brothers entered Sirmium, <lb/>
            they divided their courts also, and Valentinian as the chief <lb/>
            took Milan, while Valens retired to Constantinople.</p>
          <p>• 5. Sallust, with the authority of prefect, governed the <lb/>
            East, Mamertinus Italy with Africa and Illyrieum, and <lb/>
            Germanianus the provinces of Gaul.</p>
          <p>6. It was in the cities of Milan and Constantinople that <lb/>
            the emperors first assumed the consular robes. But the <lb/>
            whole year was one of heavy disaster to the Roman state.</p>
          <p>7. For the Allemanni burst through the limits of Ger- <lb/>
            many, and the cause of their unusual ferocity was this. <lb/>
            They had sent ambassadors to the court, and according to <pb n="415"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 365 1"/> <lb/>
            custom they were entitled to regular fixed presents, but <lb/>
            received gifts of inferior value; which, in great indigna- <lb/>
            tion, they threw away as utterly beneath them. For this <lb/>
            they were roughly treated by Ursatius, a man of a pas- <lb/>
            sionate and cruel temper, who at that time was master of <lb/>
            the offices ; and when they returned and related, with con- <lb/>
            siderable exaggeration, how they had been treated, they <lb/>
            roused the anger of their savage countrymen as if they had <lb/>
            been despised and insulted in their persons.</p>
          <p>8. About the same time, or not much later, Procopius <lb/>
            attempted a revolution in the east; and both these occur- <lb/>
            rences were announced to Valentinian on the same day, <lb/>
            the 1st of November, as he was on the point of making <lb/>
            his entry into Paris.</p>
          <p>9. He instantly sent Dagalaiphus to make head against <lb/>
            the Allemanni, who, when they had laid waste the land <lb/>
            nearest to them, had departed to a distance without blood- <lb/>
            shed. But with respect to the measures necessary to <lb/>
            crush the attempt of Procopius before it gained any <lb/>
            strength, he was greatly perplexed, being made especially <lb/>
            anxious by his ignorance whether Valens were alive or <lb/>
            dead, that Procopius thus attempted to make himself master <lb/>
            of the empire.</p>
          <p>- 10. For Equitius, as soon as he heard the account of the <lb/>
            tribune Antonius, who was in command of the army in the <lb/>
            interior of Dacia, before he was able to ascertain the real <lb/>
            truth of everything, brought the emperor a plain state- <lb/>
            ment of what had taken place.</p>
          <p>11. On this Valentinian promoted Equitius to the com- <lb/>
            mand of a division, and resolved on retiring to Illyricum <lb/>
            to prevent a rebel who was already formidable from over- <lb/>
            running Thrace and then carrying an hostile invasion into <lb/>
            Pannonia. For he was greatly terrified by recollecting <lb/>
            recent events, considering how, not long before, Julian, <lb/>
            despising an emperor who had been invariably successful <lb/>
            in every civil war, before he was expected or looked for, <lb/>
            passed on from city to city with incredible rapidity.</p>
          <p>12. But his eager desire to return was cooled by the <lb/>
            advice of those about him, who counselled and implored <lb/>
            him not to expose Gaul to the barbarians, who were <lb/>
            threatening it; nor to abandon on such a pretence pro- <lb/>
            vinces which were in need of great support. And then <pb n="416"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. VI."/> <lb/>
            prayers were seconded by embassies from several important <lb/>
            cities which entreated him not in a doubtful and disastrous <lb/>
            crisis to leave them wholly undefended, when by his pre- <lb/>
            sence he might at once deliver them from the greatest <lb/>
            dangers, by the mere terror which his mighty name would <lb/>
            strike into the Germans.</p>
          <p>13. At last, having given much deliberation to what <lb/>
            might be most advisable, he adopted the opinion of the <lb/>
            majority, and replied that Procopius was the foe only of <lb/>
            himself and his brother, but the Allemanni were the <lb/>
            enemies of the whole Roman world ; and so he determined <lb/>
            in the mean time not to move beyond the frontier of <lb/>
            Gaul.</p>
          <p>14. And advancing to Rhcims, being also anxious that <lb/>
            Africa should not be suddenly invaded, he appointed <lb/>
            Neotherius, who at that time was only a secretary, but who <lb/>
            afterwards became a consul, to go to the protection of that <lb/>
            country; and with him Masaucio, an officer of the domestic <lb/>
            guard, being induced to add him by the consideration that <lb/>
            he was well acquainted with the disturbed parts, since he <lb/>
            had been brought up there under his father Cretion, who <lb/>
            was formerly Count of Africa; he added further, Gauden- <lb/>
            tius, a commander of the Scutarii, a man whom he had <lb/>
            long known, and on whose fidelity he placed entire con- <lb/>
            fidence.</p>
          <p>15. Because therefore these sad disturbances arose on <lb/>
            both sides at one and the same time, we will here arrange <lb/>
            our account of each separately in suitable order; relating <lb/>
            first what took place in the East, and afterwards the war <lb/>
            with the barbarians; since the chief events both in the <lb/>
            West and the East occurred in the same months; lest, by <lb/>
            any other plan, if wc skipped over in haste from place to <lb/>
            place, we should present only a confused account of every- <lb/>
            thing, and so involve our whole narrative in perplexity and <lb/>
            disorder.</p>

          <p>§ 1. PROCOPIUS was born and bred in Cilicia, of a noble <lb/>
            family, and occupied an advantageous position from his <lb/>
            youth, as being a relation of Julian who afterwards became <lb/>
            emperor. He was very strict in his way of life and morals, <lb/>
            reserved and silent; but both as secretary, and afterwards as <pb n="417"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 365.]"/> <lb/>
            tribune distinguishing himself by his services in war, and <lb/>
            rising gradually to the highest rank. After the death of <lb/>
            Constantius, in the changes that ensued, he, being a kins. <lb/>
            man of the emperor, began to entertain higher aims, <lb/>
            especially after he was admitted to the order of counts ; <lb/>
            and it became evident that if ever he were sufficiently <lb/>
            powerful, he would be a disturber of the public peace.</p>
          <p>2. When Julian invaded Persia he left him in Mesopo- <lb/>
            tamia, in command of a strong division of troops, giving <lb/>
            him Sebastian for his colleague with equal power; and <lb/>
            he was enjoined (as an uncertain rumour whispered, for <lb/>
            no certain authority for the statement could be produced) <lb/>
            to be guided by the course of events, and if he should find <lb/>
            the republic in a languid state, and in need of further aid, <lb/>
            to cause himself without delay to be saluted as emperor.</p>
          <p>3. Procopius executed his commission in a courteous <lb/>
            and prudent manner; and soon afterwards heard of the <lb/>
            mortal wound and death of Julian, and of the elevation of <lb/>
            Jovian to the supreme authority; while at the same time <lb/>
            an ungrounded report had got abroad that Julian with his <lb/>
            last breath had declared that it was his will that the helm <lb/>
            of the state should be intrusted to Procopius. He therefore, <lb/>
            fearing that in consequence of this report he might be put <lb/>
            to death uncondemned, withdrew from public observation; <lb/>
            being especially alarmed after the execution of Jovian, <lb/>
            the principal secretary, who, as he heard, had been cruelly <lb/>
            put to death with torture, because after the death of <lb/>
            Julian he had been named by a few soldiers as one worthy <lb/>
            to succeed to the sovereignty, and on that account was <lb/>
            suspected of meditating a revolution.</p>
          <p>4. And because he was aware that he was sought for <lb/>
            with great care, he withdrew into a most remote and <lb/>
            secret district, seeking to avoid giving offence to any one. <lb/>
            Then, finding that his hiding-place was still sought out <lb/>
            by Jovian with increased diligence, he grew weary of <lb/>
            living like a wild beast (since he was not only driven <lb/>
            from high rank to a low station, but was often in distress <lb/>
            even for food, and deprived of all human society) ; so at <lb/>
            last, under the pressure of extreme necessity, he returned <lb/>
            by secret roads into the district of Chalcedon:</p>
          <p>5. Where, since that appeared a safer retreat, lie con- <lb/>
            cealed himself in the house of a trusty friend, a man of <note type="footnote">2 E </note> <pb n="418"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. VI."/> <lb/>
            the name of Strategius, who from being an officer about <lb/>
            the palace had risen to be a senator; crossing over at times <lb/>
            to Constantinople whenever he could do so without being <lb/>
            perceived ; as was subsequently learnt from the evidence <lb/>
            of this same Strategius after repeated investigations had <lb/>
            been made into the conduct of all who were accomplices in <lb/>
            his enterprise.</p>
          <p>6. Accordingly, like a skilful scout, since hardship and <lb/>
            want had so altered his countenance that no one knew <lb/>
            him, he collected the reports that were flying about, spread <lb/>
            by many who, as the present is always grievous, accused <lb/>
            Valens of being inflamed with a passion for seizing what <lb/>
            belonged to others.</p>
          <p>7. An additional stimulus to his ferocity was the em- <lb/>
            peror's father-in-law, Petronius, who, from the command <lb/>
            of the Martensian cohort, had been suddenly promoted to <lb/>
            be a patrician. He was a man deformed both in mind <lb/>
            and appearance, and cruelly eager to plunder every person <lb/>
            without distinction; torturing all, guilty and innocent, <lb/>
            and then binding them with fourfold bonds; exacting debts <lb/>
            due as far back as the time of the emperor Aurelian, an d <lb/>
            grieving if any one escaped without loss.</p>
          <p>8. And his natural cruelty was inflamed by this addi <lb/>
            tional incentive, that as he was enriched by the sufferings <lb/>
            of others, he was inexorable, cruel, hard hearted, and un- <lb/>
            feeling, incapable either of doing justice or of listening to <lb/>
            reason. He was more hated than even Oleander, who, as <lb/>
            we read, while prefect in the time of Commodus, oppressed <lb/>
            people of all ranks with his foolish arrogance; and more <lb/>
            tyrannical than Plautian, who was prefect under Severus, <lb/>
            and who with more than mortal pride would have thrown <lb/>
            everything into confusion, if he had not been murdered <lb/>
            out of revenge.</p>
          <p>9. The cruelties which in the time of Valens, who acted <lb/>
            under the influence of Petronius, closed many houses both <lb/>
            of poor men and nobles, and the fear of still worse im- <lb/>
            pending, sank deep into the hearts of both the provincials <lb/>
            and soldiers, who groaned under the same burdens; and <lb/>
            though the prayers breathed were silent and secret, yet <lb/>
            some change of the existing state of things by the inter- <lb/>
            position of the supreme Deity was unanimously prayed for.</p>
          <p>10. This state of affairs came home to the knowledge of <pb n="419"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 365.]"/> <lb/>
            Procopins, and he, thinking that if Fate were at all propi- <lb/>
            tious, he might easily rise to the highest power, lay in <lb/>
            wait like a wild beast which prepares to make its spring <lb/>
            the moment it sees anything to seize.</p>
          <p>11. And while he was eagerly maturing his plans, the <lb/>
            following chance gave him an opportunity which proved <lb/>
            most seasonable. After the winter was past, Valens has- <lb/>
            tened into Syria; and when he had reached the borders <lb/>
            of Bithynia he learnt from the accounts of the generals <lb/>
            that the nation of the Goths, who up to that time had never <lb/>
            come into collision with us, and who were therefore very <lb/>
            fierce and untractable, were all with one consent preparing <lb/>
            for an invasion of our Thracian frontier. \\ hen he heard <lb/>
            this, in order to proceed on his own journey without hill- <lb/>
            drance, he ordered a sufficient force of cavalry and infantry <lb/>
            to be sent into the districts in which the inroads of these <lb/>
            barbarians were apprehended.</p>
          <p>12. Therefore, as the emperor was now at a distance, <lb/>
            Procopius, being wearied by his protracted sufferings, and <lb/>
            thinking even a cruel death preferable to a longer endur- <lb/>
            ance of them, precipitately plunged into danger ; and not <lb/>
            fearing the last extremities, but being wrought up almost <lb/>
            to madness, he undertook a most audacious enterprise. His <lb/>
            desire was- to win over the legions known as the Divi- <lb/>
            tenses and the younger Tungricani, who were under orders <lb/>
            to march through Thrace for the coming campaign, and, <lb/>
            according to custom, would stop two days at Constan- <lb/>
            tinople on their way; and for this object he intended to. <lb/>
            employ some of them whom he knew, thinking it safer <lb/>
            to rely on the fidelity of a few, and dangerous and difficult <lb/>
            to harangue the whole body.</p>
          <p>13. Those whom he selected as emissaries, being secured <lb/>
            by the hope of great rewards, promised with a solemn oath <lb/>
            to do everything he desired ; and undertook also for the <lb/>
            goodwill of their comrades, among whom they had great <lb/>
            influence from their long and distinguished service.</p>
          <p>14. As was settled between them, when day broke,. <lb/>
            Procopius, agitated by all kinds of thoughts and plans,. <lb/>
            repaired to the Baths of Anastasia, so called from the sister <lb/>
            of Constantine, where he knew these legions were sta- <lb/>
            tioned ; and being assured by his emissaries that in an <lb/>
            assembly which had been held during the preceding night <pb n="420"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. VI."/> <lb/>
            all the men had declared their adherence to his party, he <lb/>
            received from them a promise of safety, and was gladly <lb/>
            admitted to their assembly; where, however, though treated <lb/>
            with all honour by the throng of mercenary soldiers, lie <lb/>
            found himself detained almost as a hostage; for they, like <lb/>
            the prætorians who after the death of Pertinax had ac- <lb/>
            cepted Julian as their emperor because he bid highest, <lb/>
            now undertook the cause of Procopius in the hope of <lb/>
            great gain to themselves from the unlucky reign he was <lb/>
            planning.</p>
          <p>15. Procopius therefore stood among them, looking <lb/>
            pale and ghost-like ; and as a proper royal robe could not <lb/>
            be found, he wore a tunic spangled with gold, like that of <lb/>
            an officer of the palace, and the lower part of his dress like <lb/>
            that of a boy at school; and purple shoes; he also bore <lb/>
            a spear, and carried a small piece of purple cloth in his <lb/>
            right hand, so that one might fancy that some theatrical <lb/>
            figure or dramatic personification had suddenly come upon <lb/>
            the stage.</p>
          <p>16. Being thus ridiculously put forward as if in mockery <lb/>
            of all honours, he addressed the authors of his elevation <lb/>
            with servile flattery, promising them vast riches and high <lb/>
            rank as the first-fruits of his promotion ; and then he <lb/>
            advanced into the streets, escorted by a multitude of <lb/>
            armed men; and with raised standards he prepared to pro- <lb/>
            ceed, surrounded by a horrid din of shields clashing with a <lb/>
            mournful clang, as the soldiers, fearing lest they might be <lb/>
            injured by stones or tiles from the housetops, joined them <lb/>
            together above their heads in close order.</p>
          <p>17. As he thus advanced boldly the people showed <lb/>
            him neither aversion nor favour; but he was encou- <lb/>
            raged by the love of sudden novelty, which is implanted <lb/>
            in the minds of most of the common people, and was <lb/>
            further excited by the knowledge that all men unani- <lb/>
            mously detested Petronius, who, as I have said before, was <lb/>
            accumulating riches by all kinds of violence, reviving <lb/>
            actions that had long been buried, and oppressing all ranks <lb/>
            with the exaction of forgotten debts.</p>
          <p>18. Therefore when Procopius ascended the tribunal, <lb/>
            and when, as all seemed thunderstruck and bewildered, <lb/>
            even the gloomy silence was terrible, thinking (or, indeed, <lb/>
            expecting) that he had only found a shorter way to death. <pb n="421"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 365.]"/> <lb/>
            trembling so as to be unable to speak, he stood for some <lb/>
            time in silence. Presently when he began, with a broken <lb/>
            and languid voice, to say a few words, in which he spoke <lb/>
            of his relationship to the imperial family, he was met at <lb/>
            first with but a faint murmur of applause from those whom <lb/>
            he had bribed ; but presently he was hailed by the tumul- <lb/>
            tuous clamours of the populace-in general as emperor, and <lb/>
            hurried off to the senate-house, where he found none of the <lb/>
            nobles, but only a small number of the rabble of the city ; <lb/>
            and so he went on with speed, but in an ignoble style, to <lb/>
            the palace.</p>
          <p>19. One might marvel that this ridiculous beginning, so <lb/>
            improvidently and rashly engaged in, should have led to <lb/>
            melancholy disasters for the republic, if one were ignorant <lb/>
            of previous history, and imagined that this was the first <lb/>
            time any such thing had happened. But, in tiuth, it <lb/>
            was in a similar manner that Andrisens of Adramyttium, <lb/>
            a man of the very lowest class, assuming the name of <lb/>
            Philip, added a third calamitous war to the previous <lb/>
            Macedonian wars. Again, while the emperor Macrinus <lb/>
            was at Antioch, it was then that Antoninus Heliogabalus <lb/>
            issued forth from Emessa. Thus also Alexander, and his <lb/>
            mother Mamæa, were put to death by the unexpected <lb/>
            enterprise of Maximinus. And in Africa the elder Gor- <lb/>
            dian was raised to the imperial authority, till, being over- <lb/>
            whelmed with agony at the dangers which threatened him, <lb/>
            be put an end to his life by hanging himself.</p>

          <p>§ 1. So the dealers in cheap luxuries, and those who were <lb/>
            about the palace, or who had ceased to serve, and al! <lb/>
            who, having been in the ranks of the army, had retired <lb/>
            to a more tranquil life, now embarked in this unusual and <lb/>
            doubtful enterprise, some against their will, and others <lb/>
            willingly. Some, however, thinking anything better than <lb/>
            the present state of affairs, escaped secretly from the city, <lb/>
            and hastened with all speed to the emperor's camp.</p>
          <p>2. They were all outstripped by the amazing celerity <lb/>
            of Sophronius, at that time a secretary, afterwards prefect <lb/>
            of Constantinople, who reached Valens as he was just <lb/>
            about to set out from Cæsarea in Cappadocia, in order, <pb n="422"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. VII."/> <lb/>
            now that the hot weather of Cilicia was over, to go to <lb/>
            Antioch; and having related to him all that had taken <lb/>
            place, brought him, though wholly amazed and bewildered <lb/>
            at so doubtful and perplexing a crisis, back into Galatia to <lb/>
            encounter the danger before it bad risen to a head.</p>
          <p>3. While Valens was pushing forward with all speed, <lb/>
            Procopius was using all his energy day and night, pro- <lb/>
            ducing different persons who with cunning boldness <lb/>
            pretended that they had arrived, some from the east, <lb/>
            some from Gaul, and who reported that Valentinian was <lb/>
            dead, and that everything was easy for the new and <lb/>
            favoured emperor.</p>
          <p>4. And because enterprises suddenly and wantonly <lb/>
            attempted are often strengthened by promptness of action, <lb/>
            and in order to neglect nothing, Nebridius, who had been <lb/>
            recently promoted through the influence of Petronius to <lb/>
            be prefect of the prætorium in the place of Sallust, and <lb/>
            Cæsarius, the prefect of Constantinople, were at once <lb/>
            thrown into prison; and Phronemius was intrusted with <lb/>
            the government of the city, with the customary powers; <lb/>
            and Euphrasius was made master of the offices, both <lb/>
            being Gauls, and men of known accomplishments and <lb/>
            good character. The government of the camp was in- <lb/>
            trusted to Gomoarius and Agile, who were recalled to <lb/>
            military service with that object—a very ill-judged ap- <lb/>
            pointment, as was seen by the result.</p>
          <p>5. Now because Count Julius, who was commanding <lb/>
            the forces in Thrace, was feared as likely to employ the <lb/>
            troops at the nearest stations to crush the rebels if he <lb/>
            received information of what was being done, a vigorous <lb/>
            measure was adopted ; and he was summoned to Constan- <lb/>
            tinople by letter, which Nebridius, while still in prison, <lb/>
            was compelled to write, as if he had been appointed by <lb/>
            Valens to conduct some serious measures in connection <lb/>
            with the movements of the barbarians; and as soon as he <lb/>
            arrived he was seized and kept in close custody. By this <lb/>
            cunning artifice the warlike tribes of Thrace were brought <lb/>
            over without bloodshed, and proved a great assistance to <lb/>
            this disorderly enterprise.</p>
          <p>6. After this success, Araxius, by a court intrigue, was <lb/>
            made prefect of the præptorium, as if at the recommenda- <lb/>
            tion of Agile, his son-in-law. Many others were admitted • <pb n="423"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 365.]"/> <lb/>
            to various posts in the palace, and to the government of <lb/>
            provinces ; some against their will, others voluntarily, and <lb/>
            even giving bribes for their promotion.</p>
          <p>7. And, as often happens in times of intestine commo- <lb/>
            tion, some men, from the very dregs of the populace, rose <lb/>
            to a high position, led by desperate boldness and insane <lb/>
            expectations ; while, on the contrary, others of noble <lb/>
            birth fell from the highest elevation down to exile and <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>8. When by these and similar acts the party of Pro- <lb/>
            copius seemed firmly established, the next thing was to <lb/>
            assemble a sufficient military force; and that was easily <lb/>
            managed, though sometimes, in times of public disorder, <lb/>
            a failure here has hindered great enterprises, and even <lb/>
            some which had a lawful origin.</p>
          <p>9. The divisions of cavalry and infantry which were <lb/>
            passing through Thrace were easily gained over, and <lb/>
            being kindly and liberally treated, were collected into one <lb/>
            body, and at once presented the appearance of an army; <lb/>
            and being excited by magnificent promises, they swore <lb/>
            with solemn oaths fidelity to Procopius, promising to <lb/>
            defend him with unswerving loyalty.</p>
          <p>10. For a most seasonable opportunity of gaining them <lb/>
            over was found ; because he carried in his arms the little <lb/>
            daughter of Constantius, whose memory was still held in <lb/>
            reverence, himself also claiming relationship with Julian. <lb/>
            He also availed himself of another seasonable incident, <lb/>
            namely, that it was while Faustina, the mother of the <lb/>
            child, was present that he had received the insignia of the <lb/>
            imperial rites.</p>
          <p>11. He employed also another expedient (though it re- <lb/>
            quired great promptitude) ; he chose some persons, as <lb/>
            stupid as they were rash, whom he sent to Illyricum, <lb/>
            relying on no support except their own impudence; but <lb/>
            also well furnished with pieces of gold stamped with the <lb/>
            head of the new emperor, and with other means suited to <lb/>
            win over the multitude. But these men were arrested by <lb/>
            Equitius, who was the commander of the forces in that <lb/>
            country, and were put to death by various methods.</p>
          <p>12. And then, fearing similar attempts by Procopius, he <lb/>
            blocked up the three narrowest entrances into the northern <lb/>
            province ; one through Dacia, along the course of the dif- <pb n="424"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. VII."/> <lb/>
            ferent rivers; another, and that the most frequented, <lb/>
            through the Succi; and the third through Macedonia, <lb/>
            which is known as the Acontisma. And in consequence <lb/>
            of these precautions the usurper was deprived of all hope <lb/>
            of becoming master of Illyricum, and lost one great re- <lb/>
            source for carrying on the war.</p>
          <p>13. In the mean time Valens, overwhelmed with the <lb/>
            strange nature of this intelligence, and being already on <lb/>
            his return through Gallo-Græcia, after he had heard what <lb/>
            had happened at Constantinople, advanced with great <lb/>
            diffidence and alarm; and as his sudden fears deprived <lb/>
            him of his usual prudence, he fell into such despondency <lb/>
            that he thought of laying aside his imperial robes as too <lb/>
            heavy a burden; and in truth he would have done so <lb/>
            if those about him had not hindered him from adopting so <lb/>
            dishonourable a resolution. So, being encouraged by the <lb/>
            opinions of braver men, he ordered two legions, known as <lb/>
            the Jovian and the Victorian, to advance in front to <lb/>
            storm the rebel camp.</p>
          <p>14. And when they approached, Procopius, who had <lb/>
            returned from Nicæa, to which city he had lately gone <lb/>
            with the legion of Divitenses and a promiscuous body of <lb/>
            deserters, which he had collected in a few days, hastened <lb/>
            to Mygdus on the Sangarius.</p>
          <p>15. And when the legions, being now prepared for <lb/>
            battle, assembled there, and while both sides were ex- <lb/>
            changing missiles as if wishing to provoke an attack, <lb/>
            Procopius advanced by himself into the middle, and under <lb/>
            the guidance of favourable fortune, he remarked in the <lb/>
            opposite ranks a man named Vitalianus (it is uncertain <lb/>
            whether he had known him before), and having given him <lb/>
            his hand and embraced him, he said, while both armies <lb/>
            were equally astonished.</p>
          <p>16. “ And is this the cud of the ancient fidelity of the <lb/>
            Roman armies, and of the oaths taken under the strictest <lb/>
            obligations of religion ! Have you decided, 0 gallant men, <lb/>
            to use your swords in defence of strangers, and that a <lb/>
            degenerate Pannonian should undermine and upset every- <lb/>
            thing, and so enjoy a sovereign power which he never <lb/>
            even ventured to picture to himself in his prayers, while <lb/>
            we lament over your ill-fortune and our own. Follow <lb/>
            rather the race of your own noble princes which is now <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            in arms, not with the view of seizing what does not belong <lb/>
            to it, but with the hope of recovering its ancestral posses- <lb/>
            sions and hereditary dignities."</p>
          <p>17. All were propitiated by this conciliatory speech, <lb/>
            and those who had come with the intention of fighting <lb/>
            now readily lowered their standards and eagles, and of <lb/>
            their own accord came over to him; instead of uttering <lb/>
            their fearful yells, they unanimously saluted Procopius <lb/>
            emperor, and escorted him to his camp, calling Jupiter <lb/>
            to witness, after their military fashion, that Procopius <lb/>
            should prove invincible.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. ANOTHER fortunate circumstance occurred to swell the <lb/>
            prosperity of the rebels. A tribune named Rumitalca, <lb/>
            who had joined the partisans of Procopius, having been <lb/>
            intrusted with the guard of the palace, digested a plan, <lb/>
            and after mingling with the soldiers, passed over by sea <lb/>
            to the town formerly known as Drepanum, but now as <lb/>
            Helenopolis, and thence marched upon Nicæa, and made <lb/>
            himself master of it before any one dreamt of such a step.</p>
          <p>2. Valens sent Vadomarius, who had formerly been <lb/>
            duke and king of the Allemanni, with a body of troops <lb/>
            experienced in that kind of work, to besiege Nicæa, and <lb/>
            proceeded himself to Nicomedia ; and passing on from that <lb/>
            city, he pressed the siege of Chalcedon with all his might; <lb/>
            but the citizens poured reproaches on him from the walls, <lb/>
            calling him Sabaiarius, or beer-drinker. Now Sabai is a <lb/>
            drink made of barley or other grain, and is used only by <lb/>
            poor people in Illyricum.</p>
          <p>3. At last, being worn out by the scarcity of supplies <lb/>
            and the exceeding obstinacy of the garrison, he was pre- <lb/>
            paring to raise the siege, when the garrison who were <lb/>
            shut up in Nicaea suddenly opened the gates and issued <lb/>
            forth, destroying a great portion of the works of the be- <lb/>
            siegers, and under the command of the faithful Rumitalca <lb/>
            hastened on eagerly in the hope of cutting off Valens, who <lb/>
            had not yet quitted the suburb of Chalcedon. And they <lb/>
            would have succeeded in their attempt if he had not <lb/>
            learnt the imminence of his danger from some rumour, <lb/>
            and eluded the enemy who were pressing on his track, <pb n="426"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. VIII."/> <lb/>
            by departing with all speed by a road lying between the <lb/>
            lake Sunon and the winding course of the river Gallus. <lb/>
            And through this circumstance Bithynia also fell into the <lb/>
            hands of Procopius.</p>
          <p>4. When Valens had returned by forced marches from <lb/>
            this city to Ancyra, and had learnt that Lupicinus was <lb/>
            approaching with no inconsiderable force from the East, <lb/>
            he began to entertain better hopes, and sent Arinthæus <lb/>
            as his most approved general to encounter the enemy.</p>
          <p>5. And when Arinthæus reached Dadastana, where we <lb/>
            have mentioned that Jovian died, he suddenly saw in his <lb/>
            front, Hyperechius, who had previously been only a su- <lb/>
            baltern, but who now, as a trusty friend, had received <lb/>
            from Procopius the command of the auxiliary forces. And <lb/>
            thinking it no credit to defeat in battle a man of no <lb/>
            renown, relying on his authority and on his lofty personal <lb/>
            stature, he shouted out a command to the enemy them- <lb/>
            selves to take and bind their commander; they obeyed, <lb/>
            and so this mere shadow of a general was arrested by the <lb/>
            hands of his own men.</p>
          <p>6. In the interim, a man of the name of Venustus, who <lb/>
            had been an officer of the treasury under Valens, and who <lb/>
            had some time before been sent to Nicomedia, to distribute <lb/>
            pay to the soldiers who were scattered over the East, <lb/>
            when he heard of this disaster, perceived that the time <lb/>
            was unfavourable for the execution of his commission, and <lb/>
            repaired in haste to Cyzicus with the money which he had <lb/>
            with him.</p>
          <p>7. There, as it happened, he met Serenianus, who was <lb/>
            at that time the count of the guards, and who had been <lb/>
            sent to protect the treasury, and who now, with a garrison <lb/>
            collected in a hurry, had undertaken the defence of the <lb/>
            city, which was impregnable in its walls, and celebrated <lb/>
            also for many ancient monuments, though Procopius, in <lb/>
            order, now that he had got possession of Bithynia, to make <lb/>
            himself master of the Hellespont, had sent a strong force <lb/>
            to besiege it.</p>
          <p>8. The siege went on slowly; often numbers of the <lb/>
            besiegers were wounded by arrows and bullets, and other <lb/>
            missiles ; and by the skill of the garrison a barrier of the <lb/>
            strongest iron chain was thrown across the mouth of the <lb/>
            harbour, fastened strongly to the land on each side, to, <pb n="427"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 365 ]"/> <lb/>
            prevent the ships of the enemy, which were armed with <lb/>
            beaks, from forcing their way in.</p>
          <p>9. This boom, however, after great exertions on the part <lb/>
            of both soldiers and generals, who were all exhausted by <lb/>
            the ficrce natur e of the struggle, a tribune of the name of <lb/>
            Aliso, an experienced and skilful warrior, cut through in <lb/>
            the following manner :-He fastened together three vessels, <lb/>
            and placed upon them a kind of testudo, thus,-on the <lb/>
            benches stood a body of armed men, united together by <lb/>
            their shields, which joined above their heads; behind them <lb/>
            was another row, who stooped, so as to be lower; a third <lb/>
            rank bent lower still, so as to form a regular gradation ; so <lb/>
            that the last row of all, resting on their haunches, gave the <lb/>
            whole formation the appearance of an arch. This kind of <lb/>
            machine is employed in contests under the walls of towns, <lb/>
            in order that white the blows of missiles and stones fall on <lb/>
            the slippery descent they may pass off like so much rain.</p>
          <p>10. Aliso then, being for a while defended from the <lb/>
            shower of missiles, by his own vast strength held a log <lb/>
            under this chain, while with a mighty blow of his axe <lb/>
            he cut it through, so that being driven asunder, it left the <lb/>
            broad entrance open, and thus the city was laid open un- <lb/>
            protected to the assault of the enemy. And on this <lb/>
            account, when, after the death of the originator of all this <lb/>
            confusion, cruel vengeance was taken on the members of <lb/>
            his party, the same tribune, from a recollection of his <lb/>
            gallant action, was granted his life and allowed to retain <lb/>
            his commission, and a long time afterwards fell in Isauria' <lb/>
            in a conflict with a band of ravagers. _ -</p>
          <p>11. When Cyzicus was thus opened to him, Procopius' <lb/>
            hastened thither, and pardoned all who had opposed him, <lb/>
            except Serenianus, whom be put in irons, and sent to <lb/>
            Nicæa, to be kept in close confinement.</p>
          <p>12. And immediately he appointed the young Hormisdas <lb/>
            (the son of the former Prince Hormisdas) proconsul <lb/>
            intrusting him in the ancient fashion with the command <lb/>
            both in civil and military affairs. He conducted himself, <lb/>
            as his natural disposition prompted him, with moderation, <lb/>
            but was almost seized by the soldiers whom Valens had <lb/>
            sent by the difficult passes of Phrygia; he saved himself, <lb/>
            however, by great energy, embarking on board a vessel <lb/>
            which he kept in readiness for any emergency, carrying ' <pb n="428"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. IX."/> <lb/>
            off also his wife, who followed him, and was nearly taken <lb/>
            prisoner, had he not protected her under a shower of <lb/>
            arrows. Site was a lady of high family and great wealth, <lb/>
            whose modesty and the glorious destiny reserved for her <lb/>
            subsequently saved her husband from great dangers.</p>
          <p>13. In consequence of this victory Procopius was elated <lb/>
            beyond measure, and not knowing that a man, however <lb/>
            happy, if Fortune turns her wheel may become most <lb/>
            miserable before evening, he ordered the house of Arbetio, <lb/>
            which he had previously spared as that of one of his own <lb/>
            partisans, to be rifled, and it was full of furniture of <lb/>
            countless value. The reason of his indignation against <lb/>
            Arbetio was, that though he had summoned him several <lb/>
            times to come to him, he had deferred his audience, <lb/>
            pleading old age and sickness.</p>
          <p>14. And this presumptuous man might, from the uncer- <lb/>
            tainty in human affairs, have feared some great change ; <lb/>
            but though without any resistance he could have overrun <lb/>
            the provinces of the East with the willing consent of the <lb/>
            natives themselves, who, from weariness of the severe rule <lb/>
            under which they then were, were eager for any change <lb/>
            whatever, he indolently lingered, hoping to gain over some <lb/>
            cities of Asia Minor, and to collect some men who were <lb/>
            skilful in procuring gold, and who would, be of use to him <lb/>
            in future battles, which he expected would be both nume- <lb/>
            rous and severe.</p>
          <p>15. Thus he was allowing himself to grow blunt, like <lb/>
            a rusty sword ; just as formerly Pescennius Niger, when <lb/>
            repeatedly urged by the Roman people to come to their <lb/>
            aid at a time of great extremity, lost a great deal of time <lb/>
            in Syria, and at last was defeated by Severus In the Gulf <lb/>
            of Issus (which is a town in Cilicia, where Alexander <lb/>
            conquered Darius), and was put to death by a common <lb/>
            soldier in a suburb of Antioch.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THESE events took place in the depth of winter, in <lb/>
            the consulship of Valentinian and Valens. But this high <lb/>
            office of consul was transferred to Gratian, who was as yet <lb/>
            only a private individual, and to Dagalaiphus. And then, <pb n="429"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 366.]"/> <lb/>
            having collected his forces at the approach of spring, <lb/>
            Valens, having united Lupicinus's troops, which were a <lb/>
            numerous body, to his own, marched with all speed to- <lb/>
            wards Pessinus, which was formerly reckoned a town of <lb/>
            Phrygia, but was now considered to belong to Galatia.</p>
          <p>2. Having speedily secured it with a garrison, to pre- <lb/>
            vent any unforeseen danger from arising in that district, be <lb/>
            proceeded along the foot of Mount Olympus by very diffi- <lb/>
            cult passes to Lycia, intending to attack Gomoarius, who <lb/>
            was loitering in that province.</p>
          <p>3. Many vehemently opposed this project from this con- <lb/>
            sideration, that his enemy, as has been already mentioned, <lb/>
            always bore with him on a litter the little daughter of <lb/>
            Constantius, with her mother Faustina, both when march- <lb/>
            ing and when preparing for battle, thus exciting the <lb/>
            soldiers to fight more resolutely for the imperial family, <lb/>
            with which, as he told them, he himself was connected. <lb/>
            So formerly, when the Macedonians were on the point of <lb/>
            engaging in battle with the Illyrians, they placed their <lb/>
            king, who was still an infant,1 in his cradle behind the <lb/>
            line of battle, and the fear lest he should be taken prisoner <lb/>
            made them exert themselves the more so as to defeat their <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>4. To counteract this crafty manoeuvre the emperor, in <lb/>
            the critical state of his affairs, devised a sagacious remedy, <lb/>
            and summoned Arbetio, formerly consul, but who was now <lb/>
            living in privacy, to join him, in order that the fierce <lb/>
            minds of the soldiers might be awed by the presence of <lb/>
            a general who had served under Constantine. And it <lb/>
            happened as he expected.</p>
          <p>5. For when that officer, who was older in years than all <lb/>
            around him, and superior in rank, showed his venerable <lb/>
            gray hairs to the numbers who were inclined to violate <lb/>
            their oaths, and accused Procopius as a public robber, and <lb/>
            addressing the soldiers who followed his guilty leadership <lb/>
            as his own sons and the partners of his former toils, en- <lb/>
            treated them rather to follow him as a parent known to <lb/>
            them before as a successful leader than obey a profligate <lb/>
            spendthrift who ought to be abandoned, and who would <lb/>
            soon fall.</p>
          <p>6. And when Gomoarius heard this, though he might <note type="footnote">1 The young king's name was Eropus, v. Justin. vii. 122. </note> <pb n="430"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. IX."/> <lb/>
            have escaped from the enemy and returned in safety to the <lb/>
            place from whence he came, yet, availing himself of the <lb/>
            proximity of the emperor's camp, he passed over under <lb/>
            the guise of a prisoner, as if he had been surrounded by the <lb/>
            sudden advance of a superior force.</p>
          <p>7. Encouraged by this, Valens quickly moved his camp <lb/>
            to Phrygia, and engaged the enemy near Nacolia, and the <lb/>
            battle was doubtful till Agile, the leader of Procopius's <lb/>
            forces, betrayed his side by a sudden desertion of his ranks; <lb/>
            and he was followed by many who, brandishing their <lb/>
            javelins and their swords, crossed over to the emperor, <lb/>
            .bearing their standards and their shields reversed, which is <lb/>
            the most manifest sign of defection.</p>
          <p>8. When this unexpected event took place, Procopius <lb/>
            abandoning all hope of safety, dismounted, and sought a <lb/>
            hiding-place on foot in. the groves and hills. He was <lb/>
            followed by Florentius and the tribune Barchalbas, who <lb/>
            having been known ever since the time of Constantine in <lb/>
            all the terrible wars which had taken place, was now <lb/>
            driven into treason by necessity not by inclination.</p>
          <p>9. So when the greater part of the night was passed, as <lb/>
            the moon, which had risen in the evening, by continuing <lb/>
            her light till dawn increased their fear, Procopius, finding it <lb/>
            impossible to escape, and having no resources, as is often <lb/>
            the case in moments of extreme danger, begun to blame his <lb/>
            mournful and disastrous fortune. And being overwhelmed <lb/>
            with care, he was on a sudden taken and bound by his own <lb/>
            comrades, and at daybreak led to the camp, and brought, <lb/>
            silent and downcast, before the emperor. He was imme- <lb/>
            diately beheaded; and his death put an end to the increas- <lb/>
            ing disturbances of civil war. His fate resembled that of <lb/>
            Perpenna of old, who, after Sertorius had been slain at a <lb/>
            banquet, enjoyed the power for a short time, but was <lb/>
            dragged out of the thicket where he was concealed, and <lb/>
            brought to Pompey, by whose orders he was put to death.</p>
          <p>10. Giving way to equal indignation against Florentius <lb/>
            and Barchalbas, though they delivered up Procopius, he <lb/>
            instantly ordered them also to be slain, without listening <lb/>
            to reason. For if they had betrayed their legitimate <lb/>
            prince. Justice herself would pronounce them justly slain ; <lb/>
            but if he whom they betrayed was a rebel and an- enemy to <lb/>
            the tranquillity of the state, as was alleged, then they ought <pb n="431"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 366.]"/> <lb/>
            to have received an ample reward for so memorable an <lb/>
            action.</p>
          <p>11. Procopius perished at the age of forty years and ten <lb/>
            months. He was of a goodly appearance, tall, inclined to <lb/>
            stoop, always looking on the ground as he walked, and in <lb/>
            his reserved and melancholy manners like Crassus, whom <lb/>
            Lucillius and Cicero record never to have smiled but once <lb/>
            in his life ; and what is very remarkable, as long as he lived <lb/>
            he never shed blood.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">X.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. ABOUT the same time, his kinsman Marcellus, an officer <lb/>
            of the guard, who commanded the garrison of Nicæa, hear- <lb/>
            in-- of the treachery of the soldiers and the death of <lb/>
            Procopius, attacked Serenianus, who was confined in the <lb/>
            palace, unexpectedly at midnight, and put him to death. <lb/>
            And his death was the safety of many.</p>
          <p>2. For if he, a man of rude manners, bitter temper, and <lb/>
            a love of injuring people, had survived Valens's victory, <lb/>
            having also great influence with Valens from the similarity <lb/>
            of his disposition and the proximity of their birthplaces, <lb/>
            he would have studied the secret inclinations of a prince <lb/>
            always inclined to cruelty, and would have shed the blood <lb/>
            of many innocent persons.</p>
          <p>3. Having killed him, Marcellus by a rapid march <lb/>
            seized on Chalcedon, and with the aid of a few people, <lb/>
            whom the lowness of their condition and despair urged <lb/>
            to crime, obtained a shadow of authority which proved <lb/>
            fatal to him, being deceived by two circumstances, because <lb/>
            he thought that the three thousand Goths who, after their <lb/>
            kings had been conciliated, had been sent to aid Procopius, <lb/>
            who had prevailed on them to support him by pleading his <lb/>
            relationship to Constantine, would at a small cost be easily <lb/>
            won over to support him, and also because he was igno- <lb/>
            rant of what had happened in Illyricum.</p>
          <p>4. While these alarming events were taking place, Equi- <lb/>
            tius, having learnt by trustworthy reports from his scouts <lb/>
            that the whole stress of the war was now to be found <lb/>
            in Asia, passed through the Succi, and made a vigorous <lb/>
            attempt to take Philippopolis, the ancient Eumolpias,' <note type="footnote">1 Called also Trimontium, from standing on three hills; the modern <lb/>
            name is Philippopoli. See Smith's ' Anc. Geography,’ p. 333. </note> <pb n="432"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. X"/> <lb/>
            which was, occupied by a garrison of the enemy. It was <lb/>
            a city in a most favourable position, and likely to prove an <lb/>
            obstacle to his approach if left in his rear, and if he, while <lb/>
            conducting reinforcements to Valens (for he was not yet <lb/>
            acquainted with what had happened at Nacolia), should be <lb/>
            compelled to hasten to the district around Mount Hamus.</p>
          <p>5. But when, a few days later, he heard of the foolish <lb/>
            usurpation of Marcellus, he sent against him a body of <lb/>
            bold and active troops, who seized him as a mischievous <lb/>
            slave, and threw him into prison. From which, some days <lb/>
            afterwards, he was brought forth, scourged severely with <lb/>
            his accomplices, and put to death, having deserved favour <lb/>
            by no action of his life except that he had slain Serenianus, <lb/>
            a man as cruel as Phalaris, and faithful only in barbarity, <lb/>
            which he displayed on the slightest pretext.</p>
          <p>6. The war being now at an end by the death of the leader, <lb/>
            many were treated with much greater severity than their <lb/>
            errors or faults required, especially the defenders of Philip- <lb/>
            popolis. who would not surrender the city or themselves <lb/>
            till they saw the head of Procopius, which was conveyed to <lb/>
            Gaul.</p>
          <p>7. Some, however, by the influence of intercessors, re- <lb/>
            ceived mercy, the most eminent of whom was Araxius, <lb/>
            who, when the crisis was at its height, had applied for and <lb/>
            obtained the office of prefect. He, by the intercession of <lb/>
            his son-in-law Agile, was punished only by banishment to <lb/>
            an island, from which he soon afterwards escaped.</p>
          <p>8. But Euphrasius and Phronemius were sent to the <lb/>
            west to be at the disposal of Valentinian. Euphrasius was <lb/>
            acquitted, but Phronemius was transported to the Cher- <lb/>
            sonesus, being punished more severely than the other, <lb/>
            though their case was the same, because he had been a <lb/>
            favourite with the late emperor Julian, whose memorable <lb/>
            virtues the two brothers now on the throne joined in <lb/>
            disparaging, though they were neither like nor equal to <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>9. To these severities other grievances of greater im- <lb/>
            portance, and more to be dreaded than any sufferings in <lb/>
            battle, were added. For the executioner, and the rack, and <lb/>
            bloody modes of torture, now attacked men of every rank, <lb/>
            class, or fortune, without distinction. Peace seemed as a <lb/>
            pretext for establishing a detestable tribunal, while all men <pb n="433"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 366.]"/> <lb/>
            cursed the ill-omened victory that had been gained as <lb/>
            worse than the most deadly war.</p>
          <p>10. For amid arms and trumpets the equality of every <lb/>
            one's chance makes danger seem lighter; and often the <lb/>
            might of martial valour obtains what it aims at; or else <lb/>
            a sudden death, if it befalls a man, is attended by no feel- <lb/>
            ing of ignominy, but brings an end to life and to suffering <lb/>
            at the same time. When, however, laws and statutes are <lb/>
            put forth as pretexts for wicked counsels, and judges, affect- <lb/>
            ing the equity of Cato or Cassius, sit on the bench, though <lb/>
            in fact everything is dono at the discretion of over-arrogant <lb/>
            power, on the whim of which every man's life or death <lb/>
            depends, the mischief is fatal and incurable.</p>
          <p>11. For at this time any one might go to the palace on <lb/>
            any pretext, and if he were inflamed with a desire of <lb/>
            appropriating the goods of others, though the person he <lb/>
            accused might be notoriously innocent, he was received by <lb/>
            the emperor as a friend to be trusted and deserving to be <lb/>
            enriched at the expense of others.</p>
          <p>12. For the emperor was quick to inflict injury, always <lb/>
            ready to listen to informers, admitting the most deadly <lb/>
            accusations, and exulting unrestrainedly in the diversity of <lb/>
            punishments devised; ignorant of the expression of Tully, <lb/>
            which teaches us that those men are unhappy who think <lb/>
            themselves privileged to do everything.</p>
          <p>13. This implacability, unworthy of a just cause, and <lb/>
            disgracing his victory, exposed many innocent men to the <lb/>
            torturers, crushing them beneath the rack, or slaying them <lb/>
            by the stroke of tho fierce executioner. Men who, if nature <lb/>
            had permitted, would rather have lost ten lives in battle <lb/>
            than be thus tortured while guiltless of all crime, having <lb/>
            their estates confiscated, as if guilty of treason, and their <lb/>
            bodies mutilated before death, which is the most bitter <lb/>
            kind of death.</p>
          <p>14. At last, when his ferocity was exhausted by his <lb/>
            cruelties, men of the highest rank were still exposed to <lb/>
            proscription, banishment, and other punishments which, <lb/>
            though severe, appear lighter to some people. And in order <lb/>
            to enrich some one else, men of noble birth, and perhaps <lb/>
            still more richly endowed with virtues, were stripped of <lb/>
            their patrimony and driven into exile, where they were <lb/>
            exhausted with misery, perhaps being even reduced to <note type="footnote">2 F </note> <pb n="434"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVI. CH. X."/> <lb/>
            subsist'by beggary. Nor was any limit put to the cruelties <lb/>
            which were inflicted till both the prince and those about <lb/>
            him were satiated with plunder and bloodshed.</p>
          <p>15. While the usurper, whose various acts and death we <lb/>
            have been relating, was still alive, on the 21st of July, in <lb/>
            the first consulship of Valentinian and his brother, fearful <lb/>
            dangers suddenly overspread the whole world, such as are <lb/>
            related in no ancient fables or histories.</p>
          <p>16. For a little before sunrise there was a terrible earth- <lb/>
            quake, preceded by incessant and furious lightning. The <lb/>
            sea was driven backwards, so as to recede from the land, <lb/>
            and the very depths were uncovered, so that many marine <lb/>
            animals were left sticking in the mud. And the depths of <lb/>
            its valleys and'the recesses of the hills, which from the <lb/>
            very first origin of all things had been lying beneath the <lb/>
            boundless waters, now beheld the beams of the sun.</p>
          <p>17. Many ships were stranded on the dry shore, while <lb/>
            people straggling about the shoal water picked up fishes <lb/>
            and things of that kind in their hands. In another quarter <lb/>
            the waves, as if raging against the violence with which <lb/>
            they had been driven back, rose, and swelling over the <lb/>
            boiling shallows, beat upon the islands and the extended <lb/>
            coasts of the mainland, levelling cities and houses wherever <lb/>
            they encountered them. All the elements were in furious <lb/>
            discord, and the whole face of the world seemed turned <lb/>
            upside down, revealing the most extraordinary sights.</p>
          <p>18. For the vast waves subsided when it was least ex- <lb/>
            pected, and thus drowned many thousand men. Even <lb/>
            ships were swallowed up in the furious currents of the <lb/>
            returning tide, and were seen to sink when the fury of the <lb/>
            sea was exhausted; and the bodies of those who perished <lb/>
            by shipwreck floated about on their backs or faces.</p>
          <p>19. Other vessels of great size were driven on shore by <lb/>
            the violence of the wind, and east upon the housetops, as <lb/>
            happened at Alexandria; and some were even driven two <lb/>
            miles inland, of which we ourselves saw one in Laeonia, <lb/>
            near the town of Mothone, which was lying and rotting <lb/>
            where it had been driven. <pb n="435"/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE these events which we have related were taking <lb/>
            place with various consequences in the east, the Allemanni, <lb/>
            After the many disasters and defeats which they had received <lb/>
            in their frequent contests with the emperor Julian, at <lb/>
            length, having recruited their strength, though not to a <lb/>
            degree equal to their former condition, for the reason which <lb/>
            has been already set forth, crossed the frontier of Gaul in <lb/>
            formidable numbers. And immediately after the beginning <lb/>
            of the year, while winter was still in, its greatest severity <lb/>
            in those frozen districts, a vast multitude poured forth in a <lb/>
            solid column, plundering all the places around in the most <lb/>
            licentious manner. <pb n="436"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="(BK. XXVII CH. a."/> 2. Their first division was met by Charietto, who at <lb/>
            that time had the authority of count in both the German <lb/>
            provinces, and who marched against them with his most <lb/>
            active troops, having with him as a colleague count Severi- <lb/>
            anus, a man of great age and feeble health, who had the <lb/>
            legions Divitcnsis and Tungricana under his command, <lb/>
            near Cabillonum (Châlons).1</p>
          <p>3. Then having formed the whole force into one solid <lb/>
            body, and having with great rapidity thrown a bridge over <lb/>
            a small stream, the Romans assailed the barbarians from a <lb/>
            distance with arrows and light javelins, which they shot <lb/>
            back at us with great vigour.</p>
          <p>4. But when the battalions met and fought with drawn <lb/>
            swords, our line was shaken by the vehement onset of the <lb/>
            enemy, and could neither resist nor do any valorous deeds <lb/>
            by way of attack, but were all put to flight as soon as they <lb/>
            saw Severianus struck down from his horse and severely <lb/>
            wounded by an arrow.</p>
          <p>5. Charietto, too, while labouring by the exposure of his <lb/>
            own person, and with bitter reproaches, to encourage his <lb/>
            men, who were giving way, and while by the gallantry <lb/>
            with which he maintained his own position he strove to <lb/>
            efface the disgrace they were incurring, was slain by a <lb/>
            mortal wound from a javelin.</p>
          <p>6. And after his death the standard of the Eruli and of <lb/>
            the Batavi was lost, and the barbarians raised it on high, <lb/>
            insulting it, dancing round it, but after a fierce struggle <lb/>
            it was recovered.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THE news of this disaster was received with great <lb/>
            sorrow, and Dagalaiphus was sent from Paris to restore <lb/>
            affairs to order. But as he delayed some time, and made <lb/>
            excuses, alleging that he was unable to attack the bar- <lb/>
            barians, who were dispersed over various districts, and as <lb/>
            he was soon after sent for to receive the consulship with <lb/>
            Gratian, who was still only a private individual, Jovinus <lb/>
            was appointed commander of the cavalry : and he being well <lb/>
            provided and fully prepared, attacked the fortress of Chur- <note type="footnote"> 1 Cabillonum is Châlons-sur-Soane, in Burgundy; Catalauni is Châ- <lb/>
            lons-sur-Marne, in Champagne. </note> <pb n="437"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 36?.]"/> <lb/>
            peigne, protecting both his wings and flanks with great <lb/>
            care. And at this place he fell on the barbarians un- <lb/>
            expectedly, before they could arm themselves, and in a <lb/>
            very short time utterly destroyed them.</p>
          <p>2. Then leading on the soldiers while exulting in the <lb/>
            glory of this easy victory, to defeat the other divisions, <lb/>
            and advancing slowly, he learnt from the faithful report of <lb/>
            his scouts that a band of ravagers, after having plundered <lb/>
            the villages around, were resting on the bank of the river. <lb/>
            And as he approached, while his army was concealed by <lb/>
            the lowness of the ground and the thickness of the trees, <lb/>
            he saw some of them bathing, some adorning their hair <lb/>
            after their fashion, and some carousing.</p>
          <p>3. And seizing this favourable opportunity, he sud- <lb/>
            denly bade the trumpet give the signal, and burst into the <lb/>
            camp of the marauders. On the other hand, the Germans <lb/>
            could do nothing but pour forth useless threats and shouts, <lb/>
            not being allowed time to collect their scattered arms, <lb/>
            or to form in any strength, so vigorously were they <lb/>
            pressed by the conquerors. Thus numbers of them fell <lb/>
            pierced with javelins and swords, and many took to flight, <lb/>
            and were saved by the winding and narrow paths.</p>
          <p>4. After this success, which was won by valour and good <lb/>
            fortune, Jovinus struck his camp without delay, and led <lb/>
            on his soldiers with increased confidence (sending out a <lb/>
            body of careful scouts in advance) against the third division. <lb/>
            And arriving at Châlons by forced marches, he there formed <lb/>
            the whole body ready for battle.</p>
          <p>5. And having constructed a rampart with seasonable <lb/>
            haste, and refreshed his men with food and sleep as well <lb/>
            as the time permitted, at daybreak he arranged his army <lb/>
            in an open plain, extending his line with admirable <lb/>
            skill, in order that by occupying an extensive space of <lb/>
            ground the Romans might appear to be equal in number to <lb/>
            the enemy: being in fact inferior in that respect though <lb/>
            equal in strength.</p>
          <p>6. Accordingly, when the trumpet gave the signal and <lb/>
            the battle began to rage at close quarters, the Germans <lb/>
            stood amazed, alarmed at the well-known appearance of <lb/>
            the shining standards. But though they were checked for <lb/>
            a moment, they presently recovered themselves, and the <lb/>
            conflict was protracted till the close of the day, when our <pb n="438"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. II."/> <lb/>
            valorous troops would have reaped the fruit of their <lb/>
            gallantry without any loss if it had not been for Balcho- <lb/>
            baudes, a tribune of the legions, who being as sluggish as <lb/>
            he was boastful, at the approach of evening retreated in <lb/>
            disorder to the camp. And if the rest of the cohorts had <lb/>
            followed his example and had also retired, the affair would <lb/>
            have turned out so ruinous that not one of our men would <lb/>
            have been left alive to tell what had happened.</p>
          <p>7. But our soldiers, persisting with energy and courage, <lb/>
            showed such a superiority in personal strength that they <lb/>
            wounded four thousand of the enemy and slew six thousand, <lb/>
            while they did not themselves lose more than twelve hun- <lb/>
            dred killed and two hundred wounded.</p>
          <p>8. At the approach of night the battle terminated, and <lb/>
            our weary men having recruited their strength, a little <lb/>
            before dawn our skilful general led forth his army in a <lb/>
            square, and found that the barbarians had availed them- <lb/>
            selves of the darkness to escape. And having no fear there <lb/>
            of ambuscade, he pursued them over the open plain, tramp- <lb/>
            ling on the dying and the dead, many of whom had perished <lb/>
            from the effect of the severity of the cold on their wounds.</p>
          <p>9. After he had advanced some way further, without <lb/>
            finding any of the enemy he returned, and then he learnt <lb/>
            that the king of the hostile army had been taken prisoner, <lb/>
            with a few followers, by the Ascarii,' whom he himself had <lb/>
            .,,ent by another road to plunder the tents of the Allemanni, <lb/>
            and they had hanged him. But the general being angry <lb/>
            at this, ordered the punishment of the tribune who had <lb/>
            ventured on such an act without consulting his superior <lb/>
            officer, and he would have condemned him if he had not <lb/>
            been able to establish by manifest proof that the atrocious <lb/>
            act had been committed by the violent impulse of the <lb/>
            boldiers.</p>
          <p>10. After this, when he returned to Paris with the glory <lb/>
            of this success, the emperor met him with joy, and appointed <lb/>
            him to be consul the next year, being additionally rejoiced <lb/>
            because at the very same time he received the head of <lb/>
            Proeopius, which had been sent to him by Valens.</p>
          <p>11. Besides these events, many other battles of inferior <note type="footnote">1 These seem to have been a tribe of the Batavi; but some editors <lb/>
            give, as a various reading, Hastarii, which may be translated, a detach- <lb/>
            ment of lancers. </note> <pb n="439"/>

            interest and importance took place in Gaul, which it would <lb/>
            be superfluous to recount, since they brought no results <lb/>
            worth mentioning, and it is not fit to spin out history with <lb/>
            petty details.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AT this time, or a little before, a new kind of prodigy <lb/>
            appeared in the corn district of Tuscany; those who were <lb/>
            skilful in interpreting such things being wholly ignorant <lb/>
            of what it portended. For in the town of Pistoja, at <lb/>
            about the third hour of the day, in the sight of many <lb/>
            persons, an ass mounted the tribunal, where he was heard <lb/>
            to bray loudly. All the bystanders were amazed, as were <lb/>
            all those who heard of the occurrence from the report of <lb/>
            others, as no one could conjecture what was to happen.</p>
          <p>2. But soon afterwards the events showed what was por- <lb/>
            tended, for a man of the name of Terence, a person of low <lb/>
            birth and a baker by trade, as a reward for having given <lb/>
            information against Orsitus, who had formerly been pre- <lb/>
            fect, which led to his being convicted of peculation, was <lb/>
            intrusted with the government of this same province. And <lb/>
            becoming elated and confident, he threw affairs into great <lb/>
            disorder, till he was convicted of fraud on transactions <lb/>
            relating to some ship-masters, as was reported, and was <lb/>
            executed while Claudius was prefect of Rome.</p>
          <p>3. But some time before this happened Symmachus <lb/>
            succeeded Apronianus; a man deserving to be named <lb/>
            among the most eminent examples of learning and mo- <lb/>
            deration ; under whose government the most sacred city <lb/>
            enjoyed peace and plenty in an unusual degree; being <lb/>
            also adorned with a magnificent and solid bridge which he <lb/>
            constructed, and opened amid the great joy of his un- <lb/>
            grateful fellow-citizens, as the result very plainly showed.</p>
          <p>4. For they some years afterwards burnt his beautiful <lb/>
            house on the other side of the Tiber, being enraged <lb/>
            because some worthless plebeian had invented a story, <lb/>
            which there was no evidence or witness to support, that <lb/>
            he had said that he would prefer putting out the limekilns <lb/>
            with his own wine, to selling the lime at the price expected <lb/>
            of him. <pb n="440"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BE. XXVII. CH. III."/> 5. After him the prefect of the city was Lampadius, wIlD <lb/>
            had been prefect of the prætorium, a man of such bound- <lb/>
            less arrogance, that he grew very indignant if he were not <lb/>
            praised even when he spat, as if he did that with more <lb/>
            grace than any one else; but still a man of justice, virtue, <lb/>
            and economy.</p>
          <p>6. When as prætor he was celebrating some splendid <lb/>
            games, and giving abundant largesses, being unable to <lb/>
            bear the tumult of the populace, which was often urgent <lb/>
            to have gifts distributed to those who were unworthy, in <lb/>
            order to show his liberality and his contempt for the <lb/>
            multitude, he sent for a crowd of beggars from the Vatican, <lb/>
            and enriched them with great presents.</p>
          <p>7. But, not to digress too much, it will be sufficient to <lb/>
            record one instance of his vanity, which, though of no <lb/>
            great importance, may serve as a warning to judges. In <lb/>
            every quarter of the city which had been adorned at the <lb/>
            expense of different emperors he inscribed his own name, <lb/>
            and that, not as if he were the restorer of old works, but <lb/>
            their founder. This same fault is said to have characterized <lb/>
            the emperor Trajan, from which the people in jest named <lb/>
            him “The Pellitory of the wall."</p>
          <p>8. While he was prefect he was disturbed by frequent <lb/>
            commotions, the most formidable being when a vast mob <lb/>
            of the lowest of the people collected, and with firebrands <lb/>
            and torches would have burnt his house near the baths of <lb/>
            Constantine, if they had not been driven away by the <lb/>
            prompt assistance of his friends and neighbours, who <lb/>
            pelted them with stones and tiles from the tops of the <lb/>
            houses.</p>
          <p>9. And he himself, being alarmed at a sedition, which <lb/>
            on this occasion had become so violent, retired to the <lb/>
            Mulvian bridge (which the elder Scaurus is said to have <lb/>
            built), and waited there till the discontent subsided, which <lb/>
            indeed had been excited by a substantial grievance.</p>
          <p>10. For when he began to construct some new buildings, <lb/>
            he ordered the cost to be defrayed, not from the customary <lb/>
            sources of revenue, but if iron, or lead, or copper, or any- <lb/>
            thing of that kind was required, he sent officers who, pre- <lb/>
            tending to try the different articles, did in fact seize them <lb/>
            without paying any price for them. This so enraged the <lb/>
            poor, since they suffered repeated losses from such a prao- <pb n="441"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 367.]"/> <lb/>
            tice, that it was all he could do to escape from them by a <lb/>
            rapid retreat.</p>
          <p>11. His successor had formerly been a quæstor of the <lb/>
            palace, his name was Juventius, a man of integrity and <lb/>
            prudence, a Pannonian by birth. His administration was <lb/>
            tranquil and undisturbed, and the people enjoyed plenty <lb/>
            under it. Yet he also was alarmed by nereo seditious <lb/>
            raised by the discontented populace, which arose from the <lb/>
            following occurrence.</p>
          <p>12. Damasus and Ursinus, being both immoderately eager <lb/>
            to obtain the bishopric, formed parties and carried on the <lb/>
            conflict with great asperity, the partisans of each carrying <lb/>
            their violence to actual battle, in which men were wounded <lb/>
            and killed. And as Juventius was unable to put an end <lb/>
            to, or even to soften these disorders, he was at last by their <lb/>
            violence compelled to withdraw to the suburbs.</p>
          <p>13. Ultimately Damasus got the best of the strife by the <lb/>
            strenuous efforts of his partisans. It is certain that on one <lb/>
            day one hundred and thirty-seven dead bodies were found <lb/>
            in the Basilica of Sicininus, which is a Christian church.' <lb/>
            And the populace who had been thus roused to a state of <lb/>
            ferocity were with great difficulty restored to order.</p>
          <p>14. I do not deny, when I consider the ostentation that <lb/>
            reigns at Rome, that those who desire such rank and <lb/>
            power may be justified in labouring with all possible exer- <lb/>
            tion and vehemence to obtain their wishes ; since after they <lb/>
            have succeeded, they will be secure for the future, being <lb/>
            enriched by offerings from matrons, riding in carriages, <lb/>
            dressing splendidly, and feasting luxuriously, so that their <lb/>
            entertainments surpass even royal banquets.</p>
          <p>15. And they might be really happy if, despising the <lb/>

            by their vices, they were to live in imitation of some of <lb/>
            the priests in the provinces, whom the most rigid absti- <lb/>
            nence in eating and drinking, and plainness of apparel, <lb/>
            and eyes always cast on the ground, recommend to the <lb/>
            everlasting Deity and his true worshippers as pure and <lb/>
            sober-minded men. This is a sufficient digression on this <lb/>
            subject: let us now return to our narrative. <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably the church of Santa Maria Maggiore; but see note in <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the events above mentioned were taking place <lb/>
            in Gaul and Italy, a new campaign was being prepared in <lb/>
            Thrace. For Valens, acting on the decision of his brother, <lb/>
            by whose will he was entirely governed, marched against <lb/>
            the Goths, having a just cause of complaint against them, <lb/>
            because at the beginning of the late civil war they had <lb/>
            sent assistance to Procopius. It will here be desirable to <lb/>
            say a few words of the origin of this people, and the situation <lb/>
            of their country.</p>
          <p>2. The description of Thrace would be easy if the pens <lb/>
            of ancient authors agreed on the subject; but as the <lb/>
            obscurity and variety of their accounts is of but little <lb/>
            assistance to a work which professes to tell the truth, it <lb/>
            will be sufficient for us to record what we remember to <lb/>
            have seen ourselves.</p>
          <p>3. The undying authority of Homer informs us that <lb/>
            these countries were formerly extended over an immense <lb/>
            space of tranquil plains and high rising grounds; since <lb/>
            that poet represents both the north and the west wind as <lb/>
            blowing from thence a statement which is either fabu- <lb/>
            lous, or else which shows that the extensive district in- <lb/>
            habited by all those savage tribes was formerly included <lb/>
            under the single name of Thrace.</p>
          <p>4. Part of this region was inhabited by the Scordisci, <lb/>
            who now live at a great distance from these provinces ; a <lb/>
            race formerly savage and uncivilized, as ancient history <lb/>
            proves, sacrificing their prisoners to Bellona and Mars,, <lb/>
            and drinking with eagerness human blood out of skulls. <lb/>
            Their ferocity engaged the Roman republic in many wars; <note type="footnote">1 See Iliad, ix. 5:— </note> <figure type="illustration">

              Heaps waves on waves, and bids th' Ægean roal. </note> <pb n="443"/>

              and -on one occasion led to the destruction of an entire army <lb/>
              with its general.1</p>
          <p>5. But we see that the country now, the district being in <lb/>
            the form of a crescent, resembles a splendid theatre ; it is <lb/>
            bounded on the west by mountains, on the abrupt summit <lb/>
            of which are the thickly wooded passes of the Sucei, which <lb/>
            separate Thrace from Dacia.</p>
          <p>6. On the left, or northern side, the heights of the <lb/>
            Balkan form the boundary, as in one part does the Danube <lb/>
            also, where it touches the Roman territory: a river with <lb/>
            many cities, fortresses, and castles on its banks.</p>
          <p>7. On the right, or southern side, lies Mount Rhodope ; <lb/>
            on the east, the country is bounded by a strait, which <lb/>
            becomes more rapid from being swollen by the waters of <lb/>
            the Euxine sea, and proceeds onwards with its tides <lb/>
            towards the Ægean, separating the continents of Europe <lb/>
            and Asia by a narrow space.</p>
          <p>8. At a confined corner on the eastward it joins the' <lb/>
            frontier of Macedonia by a strait and precipitous defile <lb/>
            named Acontisma; near to which are the valley and <lb/>
            station of Arethusa, where one may see the tomb of <lb/>
            Euripides, illustrious for his sublime tragedies; and Stagira, <lb/>
            where we are told that Aristotle, who as Cicero says pours: <lb/>
            from his mouth a golden stream, was born.</p>
          <p>9. In ancient times, tribes of barbarians occupied these <lb/>
            countries, differing from each other in customs and <lb/>
            language. The most formidable of which, from their <lb/>
            exceeding ferocity, were the Odrysæans, men so accustomed <lb/>
            to shed human blood, that when they could not find enemies <lb/>
            enough, they would, at their feasts, when they had eaten <lb/>
            and drunk to satiety, stab their own bodies as if they bo- <lb/>
            longed to others.</p>
          <p>10. But as the republic grew in strength while the <lb/>
            authority of the consular form of government prevailed, <lb/>
            Marcus Didius, with great perseverance, attacked these <lb/>
            tribes which had previously been deemed invincible, and <lb/>
            had roved about without any regard either to divine or <lb/>
            human laws. Drusus compelled them to confine themselves <note type="footnote">1 The contents of the sixty-third book of Livy record that C. Porcins <lb/>
            Cato lost his whole army in a campaign against the Scordici, who were <unclear/> <lb/>
            Pannonian tribe; but neither Livy nor any other writer, except <lb/>
            Ammianus, mentions that Cato himself was killed. </note> <pb n="444"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. IT"/> <lb/>
            to their own territories ; Minucius defeated them in a <lb/>
            great battle on the river Maritza, which flows down from <lb/>
            the lofty mountains of the Odrysæans; and after those <lb/>
            exploits, the rest of the tribes were almost destroyed in a <lb/>
            terrible battle by Appius Claudius the proconsul. And <lb/>
            the Roman fleets made themselves masters of the towns on <lb/>
            the Bosporus, and on the coast of the Sea of Marmora.</p>
          <p>11. After these generals came Lucullus; who was the <lb/>
            first of all our commanders who fought with the warlike <lb/>
            nation of the Bessi: and with similar vigour he crushed <lb/>
            the mountaineers of the district of the Balkan, in spite of <lb/>
            their obstinate resistance. And while he was in that <lb/>
            country the whole of Thrace was brought under the power <lb/>
            of our ancestors, and in this way, after many doubtful <lb/>
            campaigns, six provinces were added to the republic.</p>
          <p>12. Of these provinces the first one comes to, that which <lb/>
            borders on the lllyrians, is called by the especial name of <lb/>
            Thrace; its chief cities are Philippopolis, the ancient Eu- <lb/>
            molpias, and Beræa; both splendid cities. Next to this <lb/>
            the province of the Balkan boasts of Hadrianople, which <lb/>
            used to be called Uscudama, and Anchialos, both great <lb/>
            cities. Next comes Mysia, in which is Marcianopolis, so <lb/>
            named from the sister of the emperor Trajan, also Doros- <lb/>
            torus, and Nicopolis, Odyssus.</p>
          <p>13. Next comes Scythia, in which the chief towns are <lb/>
            Dionysiopolis, Tomis, and Calatis. The last of all is <lb/>
            Europa; which besides many municipal towns has two <lb/>
            principal cities, Apri and Perinthus, which in later times <lb/>
            has received the name of Heraclea. Beyond this is Rho- <lb/>
            dope, in which are the cities of Maximianopolis, Maronea, <lb/>
            and Ænus. after founding and leaving which, it was <lb/>
            thought Æneas proceeded onwards to Italy, of which. <lb/>
            after long wanderings, he became master, expecting by <lb/>
            the auspices to enjoy there perpetual prosperity.</p>
          <p>14. But it is certain, as the invariable accounts of all <lb/>
            writers represent, that these tribes were nearly all agri- <lb/>
            cultural, and, that living on the high mountains in these <lb/>
            regions above mentioned, they are superior to us in health, <lb/>
            vigour, and length of life; and they believe that this <lb/>
            superiority arises from the fact, that in their food they for <lb/>
            the most part abstain from all that is hot; also that the <lb/>
            constant dews besprinkle their persons with a cold and <pb n="445"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 367.]"/> <lb/>
            bracing moisture, and that they enjoy the freshness of a <lb/>
            purer atmosphere ; and that they are the first of all tribes <lb/>
            to feel the rays of the morning sun, which are instinct with <lb/>
            life, before they become tainted with any of the foulness <lb/>
            arising from human things. Having discussed this matter <lb/>
            let us now return to our original narrative.</p>

          <p>§ 1. After Procopius had been overpowered in Phrygia. and <lb/>
            all material for domestic discords had thus been removed, <lb/>
            Victor, the commander of the cavalry, was sent to the Goths <lb/>
            to inquire, without disguise, why a nation friendly to the <lb/>
            Romans, and bound to it by treaties of equitable peace, <lb/>
            had given the support of its arms to a man who was <lb/>
            waging war against their lawful emperor. And they, <lb/>
            to excuse their conduct by a valid defence, produced <lb/>
            the letters from the above-mentioned Procopius, in which <lb/>
            he alleged that he had assumed the sovereignty as his due, <lb/>
            as the nearest relation to Constantine's family; and they <lb/>
            asserted that this was a fair excuse for their error.</p>
          <p>2. When Victor reported this allegation of theirs, <lb/>
            Valens disregarding it as a frivolous excuse, marched <lb/>
            against them, they having already got information of his <lb/>
            approach. And at the beginning of spring he assembled <lb/>
            his army in a great body, and pitched his camp near a for- <lb/>
            tress named Daphne, where having made a bridge of boats <lb/>
            he crossed the Danube without meeting any resistance.</p>
          <p>3. And being now full of elation and confidence, as <lb/>
            while traversing the country in every direction he met <lb/>
            with no enemy to be either defeated or even alarmed by <lb/>
            his advance; they having all been so terrified at the <lb/>
            approach of so formidable a host, that they had fled to the <lb/>
            high mountains of the Serri, which were inaccessible to all <lb/>
            except those who knew the country.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, that he might not waste the whole summer <lb/>
            and return without having effected anything, he sent <lb/>
            forward Arinthæus, the captain of the infantry, with some <lb/>
            light forces, who seized on a portion of their families, <lb/>
            which were overtaken as they were wandering over the <lb/>
            plains before coming to the steep and winding denies of <lb/>
            the mountains. And having obtained this advantage, which <lb/>
            chance put in his way, he returned with his men without <pb n="446"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. v."/> <lb/>
            having suffered any loss, and indeed without having in- <lb/>
            flicted any.</p>
          <p>5. The next year he attempted with equal vigour again <lb/>
            to invade the country of the enemy ; but being checked in <lb/>
            his advance by the inundations of the Danube, which <lb/>
            covered a wide extent of country, he remained near the <lb/>
            town of Capri, where he pitched a camp in which he re- <lb/>
            mained till the autumn. And from thence, as he was pre- <lb/>
            vented from undertaking any operations on account of the <lb/>
            magnitude of the floods, lie retired to Marcianopolis into <lb/>
            winter quarters.</p>
          <p>6. With similar perseverance ho again invaded the land <lb/>
            of the barbarians a third year, having crossed the river by <lb/>
            a bridge of boats at Nivors; and by a rapid march he <lb/>
            attacked the Gruthungi, a warlike and very remote tribe, <lb/>
            and after some trivial skirmishes, he defeated Athanaric, <lb/>
            . at that time the most powerful man of the tribe, who <lb/>
            dared to resist him with what he fancied an adequate <lb/>
            force, but was compelled to flee for his life. And then <lb/>
            he returned himself with his army to Marcianopolis to <lb/>
            spend the winter there, as the cold was but slight in that <lb/>
            district.</p>
          <p>7. After many various events in the campaigns of three <lb/>
            years, there arose at last some very strong reasons in the <lb/>
            minds of the barbarians for terminating the war. In the <lb/>
            first place, because the fear of the enemy was increased by <lb/>
            the continued stay made by the emperor in that country. <lb/>
            Secondly, because as all their commerce was cut off they <lb/>
            began to feel great want of necessaries. So that they sent <lb/>
            several embassies with submissive entreaties for pardon <lb/>
            and peace.</p>
          <p>8. The emperor was as yet inexperienced, but still he <lb/>
            was a very just observer of events, till having been cap- <lb/>
            tivated by the pernicious allurements of flattery, he subsc- <lb/>
            quently involved the republic in an evcr-to-be-Iamented <lb/>
            disaster; and now taking counsel for the common good, he <lb/>
            determined that it was right to grant them peace.</p>
          <p>9. And in his turn he sent to them Victor and Arinthæus. <lb/>
            who at that time were the commanders of his infantry and <lb/>
            cavalry: and when they sent him letters truly stating that <lb/>
            the Goths were willing to agree to the conditions which <lb/>
            they had proposed, he appointed a suitable place for finally <pb n="447"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 367."/> <lb/>
            settling the terms of the peace. And since Athanaric <lb/>
            alleged that he was bound by a most dreadful oath, and <lb/>
            also forbidden by the strict commands of his father ever to <lb/>
            set foot on the Roman territory, and as he could not be <lb/>
            brought to do so, while, on the other hand, it would be <lb/>
            unbecoming and degrading for the emperor to cross over <lb/>
            to him, it was decided by negotiation that some boats <lb/>
            should be rowed into the middle of the river, on which the <lb/>
            emperor should embark with an armed guard, and that <lb/>
            there also the chief of the enemy should meet him with <lb/>
            his people, and conclude a peace as had been arranged.</p>
          <p>10. When this had been arranged, and hostages had <lb/>
            been given, Valens returned to Constantinople, whither <lb/>
            afterwards Athanaric fled, when he was driven from his <lb/>
            native land by a faction among his kinsmen; and he died <lb/>
            in that city, and was buried with splendid ceremony ac- <lb/>
            cording to the Roman fashion.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1.- In the mean time, Valentinian being attacked with a <lb/>
            violent sickness and at the point of death, at a secret <lb/>
            entertainment of the Gauls who were present in the <lb/>
            emperor's army, Rusticus Julianus, at that time master <lb/>
            of the records, was proposed as the future emperor ; a man <lb/>
            as greedy of human blood as a wild beast, seeming to be <lb/>
            smitten with some frenzy, as had been shown while govern- <lb/>
            ing Africa as proconsul.</p>
          <p>2. For in his prefecture of the city, a post which he was <lb/>
            filling when he died, fearing a change in the tyranny <lb/>
            through the exercise of which he, as if in a dearth of worthy <lb/>
            men, bad been raised to that dignity, he was compelled to <lb/>
            appear more gentle and merciful.</p>
          <p>. 3. Against his partisans others with higher aims were <lb/>
            exerting themselves in favour of Severus, who at that time <lb/>
            was captain of the infantry, as a man very fit for such a <lb/>
            dignity, who, although rough and unpopular, seemed yet <lb/>
            more tolerable than the other, and worthy of being pre- <lb/>
            ferred to him by any means that could be devised.</p>
          <p>4. But all these plans were formed to no purpose ; for in <lb/>
            the mean time, the emperor, through the variety of remedies <lb/>
            applied, recovered, and would scarcely believe that, his <pb n="448"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. VI"/> <lb/>
            life had been saved with difficulty. And he proposed <lb/>
            to invest his son Gratian, who was now on the point <lb/>
            of arriving at manhood, with the ensigns of the imperial <lb/>
            authority.</p>
          <p>5. And when everything was prepared, and the consent <lb/>
            of the soldiers secured, in order that all men might willingly <lb/>
            accept the new emperor, immediately upon the arrival of <lb/>
            Gratian, Valentinian advancing into the open space, mounted <lb/>
            the tribune, and surrounded by a splendid circle of nobles <lb/>
            and princes, and holding the boy by his right hand, showed <lb/>
            him to them all, and in the following formal harangue re- <lb/>
            commended their intended sovereign to the army.</p>
          <p>6. " This imperial robe which I wear is a happy indica- <lb/>
            tion of your good will towards me when you adjudged me <lb/>
            superior to many illustrious men. Now, with you as the <lb/>
            partners of my counsels and the favourers of my wishes, I <lb/>
            will proceed to a seasonable work of affection, relying on <lb/>
            the protecting promises of God, to whose eternal assistance <lb/>
            it is owing that the Roman state stands and ever shall stand <lb/>
            unshaken.</p>
          <p>7. “ Listen, I beseech you, 0 most gallant men, with <lb/>
            willing minds to my desire, recollecting that these <lb/>
            things which the laws of natural affection sanction, we <lb/>
            have in this instance not only wished to accomplish with <lb/>
            your perfect cognizance, but we have also desired to have <lb/>
            them confirmed by you as what is proper for us and likely <lb/>
            to prove beneficial.</p>
          <p>8. This, my grown-up son Gratian, to whom all of you <lb/>
            bear affection as -a common pledge, who has long lived <lb/>
            among your own children, I am, for the sake of securing <lb/>
            the public tranquillity on all sides, about to take as my <lb/>
            colleague in the imperial authority, if the propitious will <lb/>
            of the ruler of heaven and of your dignity, shall co-operate <lb/>
            with a parent's affection. He has not been trained by a <lb/>
            rigid education from his very cradle as we ourselves have; <lb/>
            nor has he been equally taught to endure hardships ; nor is <lb/>
            be as yet, as you see, able to endure the toils of war; but <lb/>
            in his disposition he is not unworthy of the glorious repu- <lb/>
            tation of his family, or the mighty deeds of his ancestors, <lb/>
            and, I venture to say, he is likely to grow up equal to still <lb/>
            greater actions.</p>
          <p>9. “ For as I often think when contemplating, as I a m <pb n="449"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D 367]"/> <lb/>
            wont to do, his manners and passions though not yet come <lb/>
            to maturity, he is so furnished with the liberal sciences, <lb/>
            and in all accomplishments and graces, that even now, <lb/>
            while only entering on manhood, he will be able to form <lb/>
            an accurate judgment of virtuous and vicious actions. He <lb/>
            will so conduct himself that virtuous men may see that <lb/>
            they are appreciated; he will be eager in the performance <lb/>
            of noble actions; he will never desert the military standards <lb/>
            and eagles; he will cheerfully bear heat, snow, frost, and <lb/>
            thirst; he will, if necessity should arise, never shrink from <lb/>
            fighting in defence of his country; he will expose his life to <lb/>
            save his comrades from danger, and (and this is the highest <lb/>
            and greatest work of piety) he will love the republic as his <lb/>
            own paternal and ancestral home."</p>
          <p>10. Before he had finished his speech, every soldier <lb/>
            hastened to anticipate his comrades as well as his position <lb/>
            permitted him, in showing that these words of the em- <lb/>
            peror met with their cheerful assent. And so, as par- <lb/>
            takers in his joy, and as convinced of the advantage of <lb/>
            his proposal, they declared Gratian emperor, mingling tho <lb/>
            propitious clashing of their arms with the loud roar of the <lb/>
            trumpets.</p>
          <p>11. When Valentinian saw this, his confidence increased ; <lb/>
            he adorned his son with a crown and with the robes befitting <lb/>
            his now supreme rank, and kissed him; and then thus <lb/>
            addressed him, brilliant as he appeared, and giving careful <lb/>
            attention to all his words:-</p>
          <p>12. “ You wear now," said he, " my Gratian, the impe- <lb/>
            Tial robe, as we have all desired, which has been conferred <lb/>
            on you with favourable auspices by my will and that of <lb/>
            our comrades. Therefore now, considering the weight of <lb/>
            the affairs which press upon us, gird yourself up as the <lb/>
            colleague of your father and your uncle; and accustom <lb/>
            yourself to pass fearlessly with the infantry over the Danube <lb/>
            and the Rhine, which are made passable by the frost, to <lb/>
            keep close to your soldiers, to devote your blood and your <lb/>
            very life with all skill and deliberation for the safety of <lb/>
            those under your command ; to think nothing unworthy of <lb/>
            your attention which concerns any portion of the Roman <lb/>
            empire.</p>
          <p>13. " This is enough by way of admonition to you at <lb/>
            the present moment, at other times I will not fail to give <note type="footnote">2 G </note> <pb n="450"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. VL"/> <lb/>
            further advice. Now you who remain, the defenders of the <lb/>
            state, I entreat, I beseech you to preserve with a steady <lb/>
            affection and loyalty your youthful emperor thus intrusted <lb/>
            to your fidelity."</p>
          <p>14. These words of the emperor were accepted and <lb/>
            ratified with all possible solemnity; Eupraxius, a native <lb/>
            of Mauritania Cæsariensis, at that time master of the <lb/>
            records, led the way by the exclamation, “ The family of <lb/>
            Gratian deserves this." And being at once promoted to <lb/>
            be quæstor, he set an example of judicious confidence <lb/>
            worthy of being imitated by all wise men; especially as <lb/>
            he in no wise departed from the habits of his fearless <lb/>
            nature, but was at all times a man of consistency and <lb/>
            obedient to the laws, which, as we have remarked, speak <lb/>
            to all men with one and the same voice under the most <lb/>
            varied circumstances.. He at this time was the more steady <lb/>
            in adhering to the side of justice which he always es- <lb/>
            poused, because on one occasion when he had given good <lb/>
            advice, the emperor had attacked him with violence and <lb/>
            threats.</p>
          <p>15. After this, the whole assembly broke out into praises <lb/>
            of both emperors, the elder and the new one; and especially <lb/>
            of the boy, whose brilliant eyes, engaging countenance <lb/>
            and person, and apparent sweetness of disposition, recom- <lb/>
            mended him to their favour. And these qualities would <lb/>
            have rendered him an emperor worthy to be compared to <lb/>
            the most excellent princes of former times, if fate had <lb/>
            permitted, and his relations who even then began to over- <lb/>
            shadow his virtue, before it was firmly rooted, with their <lb/>
            own wicked actions.</p>
          <p>16. But in this affair, Valentinian went beyond the <lb/>
            custom which had been established for several generations, <lb/>
            in making his brother and his son, not Cæsar, but emperors; <lb/>
            acting indeed in this respect with great kindness. Nor <lb/>
            had any one yet ever created a colleague with powers equal <lb/>
            to his own, except the emperor Marcus Aurelius, who <lb/>
            made his adopted brother Verus his colleague in the empire <lb/>
            without any inferiority of power. <pb n="451"/>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER these transactions had been thus settled to the <lb/>
            delight both of the prince and of the soldiers, but a few <lb/>
            days intervened; and then Avitianus, who had been <lb/>
            deputy, accused Mamertinus, the prefect of the prætorium, <lb/>
            of peculation, on his return from the city whither he had <lb/>
            gone to correct some abuses.</p>
          <p>2. And in consequence of this accusation he was <lb/>
            replaced by Rufinus, a man accomplished in every respect, <lb/>
            who had attained the dignity of an honourable old <lb/>
            age, though it is true that he never let slip any oppor- <lb/>
            tunity of making money when he thought he could do so <lb/>
            secretly.</p>
          <p>3. He now availed himself of his access to the emperor <lb/>
            to obtain permission for Orfitus, who had been prefect of <lb/>
            the city, but who was now banished, to receive back his <lb/>
            property which had been confiscated, and return home.</p>
          <p>4. And although Valentinian was a man of undisguised <lb/>
            ferocity, he nevertheless, at the beginning of his reign, <lb/>
            in order to lessen the opinion of his cruelty, took all <lb/>
            possible pains to restrain the fierce impetuosity of his <lb/>
            disposition. But this defect increasing gradually, from <lb/>
            having been checked for some time, presently broke out <lb/>
            more unrestrained to the ruin of many persons; and his <lb/>
            severity was increased by the vehemence of his anger. For <lb/>
            wise men define passion as a lasting ulcer of the mind, and <lb/>
            sometimes an incurable one, usually engendered from a <lb/>
            weakness of the intellect; and they have a plausible argu- <lb/>
            ment for asserting this in the fact that people in bad health <lb/>
            are more passionate than those who are well; women, than <lb/>
            men; old men, than youths; and people in bad circum- <lb/>
            stances than the prosperous.</p>
          <p>5. About this time, among the deaths of many persons <lb/>
            of low degree, that of Diodes, who had previously been <lb/>
            a treasurer of Illyricum, was especially remarked; the <lb/>
            emperor having had him burnt alive for some very slight <lb/>
            offence, as was also the execution of Diodorus, who had <lb/>
            previously had an honourable employment in the pro- <lb/>
            vinces, and also that of three officers of the vicar prefect <pb n="452"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH VII"/> <lb/>
            of Italy, who were all put to death with great cruelty <lb/>
            because the count of Italy had complained to the emperor <lb/>
            that Diodorus had, though in a constitutional manner, <lb/>
            implored the aid of the law against him; and that the <lb/>
            officers, by command of the judge, served a summons on <lb/>
            him as he was setting out on a journey, commanding him <lb/>
            to answer to the action according to law. And the <lb/>
            Christians at Milan to this day cherish their memory, and <lb/>
            call the place where they were buried, the tomb of the <lb/>
            innocents.</p>
          <p>6. Afterwards, in the affair of a certain Pannonian, <lb/>
            named Maxentius, on account of the execution of a sen- <lb/>
            tencc very properly commanded by the judge to be carried <lb/>
            out immediately, he ordered all the magistrates of these <lb/>
            towns to be put to death, when Eupraxius, who at that <lb/>
            time was quæstor, interposed, saying, “ Be more sparing, <lb/>
            0 most pious of emperors, for those whom you command to <lb/>
            be put to death as criminals, the Christian religion honours <lb/>
            as martyrs, that is as persons acceptable to the deity."</p>
          <p>7. And the prefect Florentius, imitating the salutary <lb/>
            boldness of Eupraxius, when he heard that the emperor <lb/>
            was in a similar manner very angry about some trifling and <lb/>
            pardonable matter, and that he had ordered the execution <lb/>
            of three of the magistrates in each of several cities, said <lb/>
            to him, " And what is to be done if any town has not got <lb/>
            so many magistrates? It will be necessary to suspend <lb/>
            the execution there till there are a sufficient number for <lb/>
            the purpose."</p>
          <p>8. And besides this cruel conduct there was another cir- <lb/>
            cumstance horrible even to speak of, that if any one came <lb/>
            before him protesting against being judged by a powerful <lb/>
            enemy, and requiring that some other judge might hear his <lb/>
            tase, he always refused it; and however just the arguments <lb/>
            of the man might be, he remitted his cause to the decision <lb/>
            of the very judge whom he feared. And there was another <lb/>
            very bad thing much spoken of; namely, that when it was <lb/>
            urged that any debtor was in such absolute want as to be <lb/>
            unable to pay anything, he used to pronounce sentence <lb/>
            of death on him.</p>
          <p>9. But some princes do these and other similar actions <lb/>
            with the more lofty arrogance, because they never allow <lb/>
            their friends any opportunity of setting them right in any <pb n="453"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 368.J"/> <lb/>
            mistake they make, either in a plan or in its execution ; <lb/>
            while they terrify their enemies by the greatness of their <lb/>
            power. There can be no question of mistake or error <lb/>
            raised before men who consider whatever they choose to do <lb/>
            to be in itself the greatest of virtues.</p>

          <p>§ 1. VALENTINIAN having left Amiens, and being on his <lb/>
            way to Treves in great haste, received the disastrous in- <lb/>
            telligence that Britain was reduced by the ravages of the <lb/>
            united barbarians to the lowest extremity of distress ; that <lb/>
            Nectaridus, the count of the sea-coast, had been slain in <lb/>
            battle, and the duke Fullofaudes had been taken prisoner <lb/>
            by the enemy in an ambuscade.</p>
          <p>2. This news struck him with great consternation, and <lb/>
            he immediately sent Severus, the count of the domestic <lb/>
            guards, to put an end to all these disasters if he could find <lb/>
            a desirable opportunity. Severus was soon recalled, and <lb/>
            Jovinus, who then went to that country, sent forward Pro- <lb/>
            vertuides with great expedition to ask for the aid of a <lb/>
            powerful army ; for they both affirmed that the imminence <lb/>
            of the danger required such a reinforcement.</p>
          <p>3. Last of all, on account of the many formidable reports <lb/>
            which a continual stream of messengers brought from that <lb/>
            island, Theodosius was appointed to proceed thither, and <lb/>
            ordered to make great haste. He was an officer already <lb/>
            distinguished for his prowess in war, and having collected <lb/>
            a numerous force of cavalry and infantry, he proceeded to <lb/>
            assume the command in full confidence.</p>
          <p>4. And since when I was compiling my account of <lb/>
            the acts of the emperor Constantine, I explained as well <lb/>
            as I could the movement of the sea in those parts at its <lb/>
            ebb and flow, and the situation of Britain, I look upon it <lb/>
            as superfluous to return to what has been once described; <lb/>
            as the Ulysses of Homer when among the Phæacians hesi- <lb/>
            tated to repeat his adventures by reason of the sufferings <lb/>
            they brought to mind.</p>
          <p>5. It will be sufficient here to mention that at that time <lb/>
            the Plots, who were divided into two nations, the Dicali- <lb/>
            clones and the Vecturiones, and likewise the Attacotti, a <lb/>
            very warlike people, and the Scots were all roving over <pb n="454"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK.XXVILCH. VIII."/> <lb/>
            different parts of the country and committing great ravages. <lb/>
            While the Franks and the Saxons who are on the frontiers <lb/>
            of the Gaul-, were ravaging their country wherever they <lb/>
            could effect an entrance by sea or land, plundering and <lb/>
            burning, and murdering all the prisoners they could take.</p>
          <p>6. To put a stop to these evils, if a favourable fortune <lb/>
            should afford an opportunity, the new and energetic general. <lb/>
            repaired to that island situated at the extreme corner of <lb/>
            the carth ; and when he had reached the coast of Boulogne, <lb/>
            which is separated from the opposite coast by a very narrow <lb/>
            strait of the sea, which there rises and falls in a strange <lb/>
            manner, being raised by violent tides, and then again <lb/>
            sinking to a perfect level like a plain, without doing any <lb/>
            injury to the sailors. From Boulogne he crossed the strait <lb/>
            in a leisurely manner, and reached Richborough, a very <lb/>
            tranquil station on the opposite coast.</p>
          <p>7. And when the Batavi. and Hcruli, and the Jovian <lb/>
            and Victorian legions who followed from the same place, <lb/>
            had also arrived, he then, relying on their number and <lb/>
            power, landed and marched towards Londinium, an ancient <lb/>
            town which has since been named Augusta; and dividing <lb/>
            his army into several detachments, he attacked the preda- <lb/>
            tory and straggling bands of the enemy who were loaded <lb/>
            with the weight of their plunder, and having speedily <lb/>
            routed them while driving prisoners in chains and cattle <lb/>
            before them, he deprived them of their booty which they <lb/>
            had carried off from these miserable tributaries of Rome.</p>
          <p>8. To whom he restored the whole except a small portion <lb/>
            which he allotted to his own weary soldiers; and then <lb/>
            joyful and triumphant lie made his entry into the city <lb/>
            which had just before been overwhelmed by disasters, but <lb/>
            was now suddenly re-established almost before it could <lb/>
            have hoped for deliverance.</p>
          <p>9. This success encouraged him to deeds of greater <lb/>
            daring, and after considering what counsels might be <lb/>
            the safest, he hesitated, being full of doubts as to the <lb/>
            future, and convinced by the confession of his prisoners <lb/>
            and the information given him by deserters, that so vast <lb/>
            a multitude, composed of various nations, all incredibly <lb/>
            savage, could only be vanquished by secret stratagems and <lb/>
            unexpected attacks.</p>
          <p>10. Then, by the publication of several edicts, in which <pb n="455"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 368.]"/> <lb/>
            he promised them impunity, he invited deserters and <lb/>
            others who were straggling about the country on furlough, <lb/>
            to repair to his camp. At this summons numbers came <lb/>
            in, and he, though eager to advance, being detained by <lb/>
            anxious cares, requested to have Civilis sent to him, <lb/>
            to govern Britain, with the rank of pro-prefect, a man of <lb/>
            quick temper, but just and upright; and he asked at the <lb/>
            same time for Dulcitius,. a general eminent for his military <lb/>
            skill.</p>
          <ab>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THESE were the events which occurred in Britain. <lb/>
            But in another quarter, from the very beginning of Valen- <lb/>
            tinian's reign, Africa had been overrun by the fury of the <lb/>
            barbarians, intent on bloodshed and rapine, which they <lb/>
            sought to carry on by audacious incursions. Their licen- <lb/>
            tiousness was encouraged by the indolence and general <lb/>
            covetousness of the soldiers, and especially by the conduct <lb/>
            of Count Romanus.</p>
          <p>2. Who, foreseeing what was likely to happen, and being <lb/>
            very skilful in transferring to others the odium which he <lb/>
            himself deserved, was detested by men in general for the <lb/>
            savageness of his temper, and also because it seemed as if <lb/>
            his object was to outrun even our enemies in ravaging <lb/>
            the provinces. He greatly relied on his relationship to <lb/>
            Remigius, at that time master of the offices, who sent all <lb/>
            kinds of false and confused statements of the condition of <lb/>
            the country, so that the emperor, cautious and wary as he <lb/>
            plumed himself on being, was long kept inignorance of <lb/>
            the terrible sufferings of the Africans.</p>
          <p>3. I will explain with great diligence the complete <lb/>
            series of all the transactions which took place in those <lb/>
            regions, the death of Ruricius the governor, and of his <lb/>
            lieutenants, and all the other mournful events which took <lb/>
            place, when the proper opportunity arrives.</p>
          <p>4. And since we are able here to speak freely, let us <lb/>
            openly say what we think, that this emperor was the first <lb/>
            of all our princes who raised the arrogance of the soldiers <lb/>
            to so great a height, to the great injury of the state, <unclear/> <lb/>
            y increasing their rank, dignity, and riches. And <lb/>
            (which was a lamentable thing, both on public and private <pb n="456"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. IX."/> <lb/>
            accounts) while he punished the errors of the common <lb/>
            soldiers with unrelenting severity, he spared the officers, <lb/>
            who, as if complete licence were given to their misconduct, <lb/>
            proceeded to all possible lengths of rapacity and cruelty <lb/>
            for the acquisition of riches, and acting as if they thought <lb/>
            that the fortunes of all persons depended directly on <lb/>
            their nod.</p>
          <p>5. The framers of our ancient laws had sought to repress <lb/>
            their pride and power, sometimes even condemning the <lb/>
            innocent to death, as is often done in cases when, from the <lb/>
            multitude concerned in some atrocity, some innocent men, <lb/>
            owing to their ill luck, suffer for the whole. And this <lb/>
            has occasionally extended even to the case of private <lb/>
            persons.</p>
          <p>6. But in Isauria the banditti formed into bodies and <lb/>
            roamed through the villages, laying waste and plundering <lb/>
            the towns and wealthy country houses : and by the mag- <lb/>
            nitude of their ravages they also greatly distressed Pam- <lb/>
            phylia and Cilicia. And when Musonius, who at that <lb/>
            time was the deputy of Asia Minor, having previously <lb/>
            been a master of rhetoric at Athens, had heard that they <lb/>
            were spreading massacre and rapine in every direction, <lb/>
            being filled with grief at the evil of which be had just <lb/>
            heard, and perceiving that the soldiers were rusting <lb/>
            in luxury and inactivity, he took with him a few light- <lb/>
            armed troops, called Diogmitæ, and resolved to attack the <lb/>
            first body of plunderers he could find. His way led <lb/>
            through a narrow and most difficult defile, and thus he <lb/>
            fell into an ambuscade, which he had no chance of <lb/>
            escaping. and was slain, with all the men under his <lb/>
            command.</p>
          <p>7. The robber bands became elated at this advantage, <lb/>
            and roamed over the whole country with increased boldness, <lb/>
            slaying many, till at last our army was aroused, and drove <lb/>
            them to take refuge amid the recesses of the rocks and <lb/>
            mountains they inhabit. And then, as they were not <lb/>
            allowed to rest, and were cut off from all means of ob- <lb/>
            taining necessary supplies, they at last begged for a truce, <lb/>
            as a prelude to peace, being led to this step by the advice <lb/>
            of the people of Germanicopolis, whose opinions always <lb/>
            had as much weight with them as standard-bearers have <lb/>
            with an army. And after giving hostages as they were <pb n="457"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 368.]"/> <lb/>
            desired, they remained for a long time quiet, without ven- <lb/>
            turing on any hostilities.</p>
          <p>8. While these events were taking place, Prætextatus <lb/>
            was administering the prefecture of the city in a noble <lb/>
            manner, exhibiting numerous instances of integrity and <lb/>
            probity, virtues for which he had been eminent from his <lb/>
            earliest youth ; and thus he obtained what rarely happens <lb/>
            to any one, that while he was feared, he did not at the <lb/>
            same time lose the affection of his fellow-citizens, which <lb/>
            is seldom strongly felt for those whom they fear as <lb/>
            judges.</p>
          <p>9. By his authority, impartiality, and just decisions, <lb/>
            a tumult was appeased, which the quarrels of the Chris- <lb/>
            tians had excited, and after Ursinus was expelled complete <lb/>
            tranquillity was restored, which best corresponded to the <lb/>
            wishes of the Roman people ; while the glory of their <lb/>
            illustrious governor, who performed so many useful actions, <lb/>
            continually increased.</p>
          <p>10. For he also removed all the balconies, which the <lb/>
            ancient laws of Home had forbidden to be constructed, and <lb/>
            separated from the sacred temples the walls of private <lb/>
            houses which had been improperly joined to them; and <lb/>
            established one uniform and proper weight in every <lb/>
            quarter, for by no other means could he check the covetous- <lb/>
            ness of those who made their scales after their own plea- <lb/>
            sure. And in the adjudication of lawsuits he exceeded all <lb/>
            men in obtaining that praise which Cicero mentions in his <lb/>
            panegyric of Brutus, that while he did nothing with a <lb/>
            view to please anybody, everything which he did pleased <lb/>
            everybody.</p>
          <ab>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. ABOUT the same time, when Valentinian had gone <lb/>
            forth on an expedition very cautiously as he fancied, a <lb/>
            prince of the Allemanni, by name Rando, who had been for <lb/>
            some time preparing for the execution of a plan which he <lb/>
            had conceived, with a body of light-armed troops equipped <lb/>
            only for a predatory expedition, surprised and stormed <lb/>
            Mayence, which was wholly destitute of a garrison.</p>
          <p>2. And as he arrived at the time when a great solemnity <lb/>
            of the Christian religion was being celebrated, he found <pb n="458"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. x."/> <lb/>
            no obstacle whatever in carrying off a vast multitude of <lb/>
            both men and women as prisoners, with no small quantity <lb/>
            of goods as booty.</p>
          <p>3. After this, for a short interval a sudden hope of <lb/>
            brighter fortune shone upon the affairs of Rome. For as <lb/>
            king Vithicabius, the son of Vadomarius, a bold and war- <lb/>
            like man, though in appearance effeminate and diseased, <lb/>
            was eontinually raising up the troubles of war against <lb/>
            us. great pains were taken to have him removed by some <lb/>
            means or other.</p>
          <p>4. And because after many attempts it was found im- <lb/>
            possible to defeat him or to procure his betrayal, his most <lb/>
            confidential servant was tampered with by one of our men, <lb/>
            and by his hand he lost his life; and after his death, <lb/>
            all hostile attacks upon us were laid aside for a while. <lb/>
            But his murderer, fearing punishment if the truth should <lb/>
            get abroad, without delay took refuge in the Roman <lb/>
            territory.</p>
          <p>5. After this an expedition on a larger scale than usual <lb/>
            was projected with great care and diligence against the <lb/>
            Allemanni, to consist of a great variety of troops : the <lb/>
            public safety imperatively required such a measure, since <lb/>
            the treacherous movements of that easily recruited nation <lb/>
            were regarded with continual apprehension, while our <lb/>
            soldiers were the more irritated, because, on account of the <lb/>
            constant suspicion which their character awakened, at one <lb/>
            time abjeet and suppliant, at another arrogant and threat- <lb/>
            ening, they were never allowed to rest in peace.</p>
          <p>6. Accordingly, a vast force was eolleeted from all <lb/>
            quarters, well furnished with arms and supplies of pro- <lb/>
            visions, and the count Sebastian having been sent for <lb/>
            with the lllyrian and Italian legions which he com- <lb/>
            manded, as soon as the weather got warm, Valentinian, <lb/>
            accompanied by Gratian, crossed the Rhine without re- <lb/>
            sistance. Having divided the whole army into four divi- <lb/>
            sions, he himself marched with the centre, while Jovinus <lb/>
            and Severus, the two captains of the camp, commanded the <lb/>
            divisions on eaeh side, thus protecting the army from any <lb/>
            sudden attack.</p>
          <p>7. And immediately under the guidance of men who <lb/>
            knew the roads, all the approaches having been recon- <lb/>
            noitred, the army advanced slowly through a most exten- <pb n="459"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 363.]"/> <lb/>
            sive district, the soldiers by the slowness of their march <lb/>
            being all the more excited to wish for battle, and gnash- <lb/>
            ing their teeth in a threatening manner, as if they had <lb/>
            already found the barbarians. And as, after many days <lb/>
            had passed, no one could be found who offered any le- <lb/>
            sistance, the troops applied the devouring flame to all the <lb/>
            houses and all the crops which were standing, with the <lb/>
            exception of such supplies for their own magazines as <lb/>
            the doubtful events of war compelled them to collect and <lb/>
            store up.</p>
          <p>8. After this the emperor advanced further, with no <lb/>
            great speed, till he arrived at a place called Solicinium, <lb/>
            where he halted, as if he had suddenly come upon some <lb/>
            barrier, being informed by the accurate report of his <lb/>
            advanced guard that the barbarians were seen at a dis- <lb/>
            tance.</p>
          <p>9. They, seeing no way of preserving their safety unless <lb/>
            they defended themselves by a speedy battle, trusting in <lb/>
            their acquaintance with the country, with one consent <lb/>
            occupied a lofty hill, abrupt and inaccessible in its rugged <lb/>
            heights on every side except the north, where the ascent <lb/>
            was gentle and easy. Our standards were fixed in the <lb/>
            usual manner, and the cry, " To arms!" was raised: and <lb/>
            the soldiers, by the command of the emperor and his <lb/>
            generals, rested in quiet obedience, waiting for the raising <lb/>
            of the emperor's banner as the signal for engaging in <lb/>
            battle.</p>
          <p>tO. And because little or no time could be spared for <lb/>
            deliberation, since on one side the impatience of the <lb/>
            soldiers was formidable, and on the other the Allemanni <lb/>
            were shouting out their horrid yells all around, the ne- <lb/>
            cessity for rapid operations led to the plan that Sebastian <lb/>
            with his division should seize the northern side of the <lb/>
            hill, where we have said the ascent was gentle, in which <lb/>
            position it was expected that, if fortune favoured him, <lb/>
            he would be able easily to destroy the flying barbarians. <lb/>
            And when he, as had been arranged, had moved forward <lb/>
            first, while Gratian was kept behind with the Jovian <lb/>
            legion, that young prince being as yet of an age unfit <lb/>
            for battle or for hard toil, Valentinian, like a deliberate <lb/>
            and prudent general, took off his helmet, and reviewed <lb/>
            his centuries and maniples, and not having informed any <pb n="460"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIL CH. X."/> <lb/>
            of the nobles of his secret intentions, and having sent <lb/>
            back his numerous body of guards, went forward himself <lb/>
            with a very small escort, whose courage and fidelity <lb/>
            he could trust, to reconnoitre the foot of the hill, de- <lb/>
            claring (as he was always apt to think highly of his own <lb/>
            skill) that it must be possible to find another path which <lb/>
            led to the summit besides that which the advanced guard <lb/>
            had reported.</p>
          <p>11. He then, as he advanced by a devious track over <lb/>
            ground strange to him, and across pathless swamps, was <lb/>
            very nearly being killed by the sudden attack of a band <lb/>
            placed in an ambuscade on his flank, and being driven <lb/>
            to extremities, only escaped by spurring his horse to a <lb/>
            gallop in a different direction over a deep swamp, so at <lb/>
            last, after being in the most imminent danger, he rejoined <lb/>
            his legions. But so great had been his peril that his <lb/>
            chamberlain, who was carrying his helmet, which was <lb/>
            adorned with gold and precious stones, disappeared, <lb/>
            helmet and all, while the man's body could never be <lb/>
            found, so that it could be known positively whether he <lb/>
            were alive or dead.</p>
          <p>12. Then, when the men had been refreshed by rest, <lb/>
            and the signal for battle was raised, and the clang of <lb/>
            warlike trumpets roused their courage, two youths -of <lb/>
            prominent valour, eager to be the first to encounter the <lb/>
            danger, dashed on with fearless impetuosity before the <lb/>
            line of their comrades. One was of the band of Scutarii, <lb/>
            by name Salvius, the other, Lupicinus, belonging to the <lb/>
            Gentiles. They raised a terrible shout, brandished their <lb/>
            spears, and when they reached the foot of the rocks, <lb/>
            in spite of the efforts of the Allemanni to repel them, <lb/>
            pushed steadily on to the higher ground; while behind <lb/>
            them came the main body of the army, which following <lb/>
            their lead over places rough with brambles and rugged, at <lb/>
            last, after vast exertions, reached the very summit of <lb/>
            the heights.</p>
          <p>13. Then again, with great spirit on both sides, the <lb/>
            conflict raged with spears and swords. On our side the <lb/>
            soldiers were more skilful in the art of war; on the other <lb/>
            side the barbarians, ferocious but incautious, closed with <lb/>
            them in the mighty fray; while our army extending itself, <lb/>
            outflanked them on both sides with its overlapping <pb n="461"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 368.]"/> <lb/>
            wings, the enemy's alarm being increased by our shouts, <lb/>
            the neighing of the horses, and the clang of trumpets.</p>
          <p>14. Nevertheless they resisted with indomitable courage, <lb/>
            and the battle was for some time undecided; both sides <lb/>
            exerted themselves to the utmost, and death was scattered <lb/>
            almost equally.</p>
          <p>15. At last the barbarians were beaten down by the <lb/>
            ardour of the Romans, and being disordered and broken, <lb/>
            were thrown into complete confusion ; and as they began <lb/>
            to retreat they were assailed with great effect by the spears <lb/>
            and javelins of their enemies. Soon the retreat became <lb/>
            a flight, and panting and exhausted, they exposed their <lb/>
            backs and the back sinews of their legs and thighs to <lb/>
            their pursuers. After many had been slain, those who <lb/>
            fled fell into the ambuscade laid for them by Sebastian, <lb/>
            who was posted with his reserve at the back of the moun- <lb/>
            tain, and who now fell unexpectedly on their flank, and <lb/>
            slew numbers of them, while the rest who escaped con- <lb/>
            cealed themselves in the recesses of the woods.</p>
          <p>16. In this battle we also suffered no inconsiderable <lb/>
            loss. Among those who fell was Valerian, the first officer <lb/>
            of the domestic guards, and one of the Scutarii, named <lb/>
            Natuspardo, a warrior of such pre-eminent courage that he <lb/>
            might be compared to the ancient Sicinius or Sergius.</p>
          <p>17. After these transactions, accompanied with this diver- <lb/>
            sity of fortune, the army went into winter quarters, and <lb/>
            the emperor returned to Treves.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">XI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. ABOUT this time, Vulcatius Rufinus died, while filling <lb/>
            the office of prefect of the prætorium, and Probus was sum- <lb/>
            moned from Rome to succeed him, a man well known to <lb/>
            the whole Roman world for the eminence of his family, and <lb/>
            his influence, as well as for his vast riches, for he possessed <lb/>
            a patrimonial inheritance which was scattered over the <lb/>
            whole empire; whether acquired justly or unjustly it is <lb/>
            not for us to decide.</p>
          <p>2. A certain good fortune, as the poets would represent <lb/>
            it, attended him from his birth, and bore him on her rapid <lb/>
            wings, exhibiting him sometimes as a man of beneficent <pb n="462"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. XI."/> <lb/>
            character, promoting the interests of his friends, though <lb/>
            often also a formidable intriguer, and cruel and mischievous <lb/>
            in the gratification of his enmities. As long as he lived <lb/>
            he had great power, owing to the magnificence of his gifts <lb/>
            and to his frequent possession of office, and yet he was at <lb/>
            times timid towards the bold, though domineering over the <lb/>
            timid; so that when full of self-confidence he appeared to <lb/>
            be spouting in the tragic buskin, and when he was afraid <lb/>
            he seemed more abased than the most abject character <lb/>
            in comedy.</p>
          <p>3. And as fishes, when removed from their natural <lb/>
            element, cannot live long on the land, so he began to <lb/>
            pine when not in some post of authority which he was <lb/>
            driven to be solicitous for by the squabbles of his troops <lb/>
            of clients, whose boundless cupidity prevented their ever <lb/>
            being innocent, and who thrust their patron forward into <lb/>
            affairs of state in order to be able to perpetrate all sorts of <lb/>
            crimes with impunity.</p>
          <p>4. For it must be confessed that though he was a man <lb/>
            of such magnanimity that he never desired any dependent <lb/>
            or servant of his to do an unlawful thing, yet if he found <lb/>
            that any one of them had committed a crime, he laid aside <lb/>
            all consideration of justice, would not allow the case to be <lb/>
            inquired into, but defended the man without the slightest <lb/>
            regard for right or wrong. Now this is a fault expressly <lb/>
            condemned by Cicero, who thus speaks: “ For what differ- <lb/>
            ence is there between one who has advised an action, and <lb/>
            one who approves of it after it is performed? or what <lb/>
            difference does it make whether I wished it be done, or <lb/>
            am glad that it is done?"</p>
          <p>5. He was a man of a suspicious temper, self-relying, <lb/>
            often wearing a bitter smile, and sometimes caressing a <lb/>
            man the more effectually to injure him.</p>
          <p>6. This vice is a very conspicuous one in dispositions of <lb/>
            that kind, and mostly so when it is thought possible <lb/>
            to conceal it. He was also so implacable and obstinate <lb/>
            in his enmities, that if he ever resolved to injure any <lb/>
            one he would never be diverted from his purpose by <lb/>
            any entreaties, nor be led to pardon any faults, so that <lb/>
            his ears seemed to be stopped not with wax but with <lb/>
            lead.</p>
          <p>7. Even when at the very summit of wealth and dignity <pb n="463"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 368.1"/> <lb/>
            he was always anxious and watchful, and therefore he was <lb/>
            continually subject to trifling illnesses.</p>
          <p>8. Such was the course of events which took place in <lb/>
            the western provinces of the empire.</p>

          <p>§ I. THE King of Persia, the aged Sapor, who from the <lb/>
            very commencement of his reign had been addicted to the <lb/>
            love of plunder, after the death of the Emperor Julian, <lb/>
            and the disgraceful treaty of peace subsequently made, <lb/>
            for a short time seemed with his people to be friendly to <lb/>
            us; but presently he trampled under foot the agreement <lb/>
            which he had made with Jovian, and poured a body of <lb/>
            troops into Armenia to annex that country to his own <lb/>
            dominions, as if the whole of the former arrangements had <lb/>
            been abolished.</p>
          <p>2. At first he contented himself with various tricks, <lb/>
            intrigues, and deceits, inflicting some trifling injuries on <lb/>
            the nation which unanimously resisted him, tampering <lb/>
            with some of the nobles and satraps, and making sudden <lb/>
            inroads into the districts belonging to others.</p>
          <p>3. Afterwards by a system of artful cajolery fortified by <lb/>
            perjury, he got their king Arsaces into his hands, having <lb/>
            invited him to a banquet, when he ordered him to be <lb/>
            seized and conducted to a secret chamber behind, where <lb/>
            his eyes were put out, and he was loaded with silver <lb/>
            chains, which in that country is looked upon as a solace <lb/>
            under punishment for men of rank, trifling though it be ; <lb/>
            then he removed him from his country to a fortress called <lb/>
            Agabana, where he applied to him the torture, and finally <lb/>
            put him to death.</p>
          <p>4. After this, in order that his perfidy might leave <lb/>
            nothing unpolluted, having expelled Sauromaces, whom <lb/>
            the authority of the Romans had made governor of Hiberia, <lb/>
            he conferred the government of that district on a man of <lb/>
            the name of Aspacuras, even giving him a diadem, to <lb/>
            mark the insult offered to the decision of our emperors.</p>
          <p>5. And after these infamous actions he committed the <lb/>
            charge of Armenia to an eunuch named Cylaces, and to <lb/>
            Artabannes, a couple of deserters whom he had received <lb/>
            some time before (one of them having been prefect of that <pb n="464"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. XII."/> <lb/>
            nation, and the other commander-in-chief); and he enjoined <lb/>
            them to use every exertion to destroy the town of Artoge- <lb/>
            rassa, a place defended by strong walls and a sufficient <lb/>
            garrison, in which were the treasures, and the wife and <lb/>
            son of Arsaces.</p>
          <p>6. These generals commenced the siege as they were <lb/>
            ordered. And as it is a fortress placed on a very rugged <lb/>
            mountain height, it was inaccessible at that time, while <lb/>
            the ground was covered with snow and frost: and so Cylaces <lb/>
            being an eunuch, and, as such, suited to feminine manœu- <lb/>
            vres, taking Artabannes with him, approached the walls; <lb/>
            after having received a promise of safety, and he and his <lb/>
            companion had been admitted into the city, he sought by a <lb/>
            mixture of advice and threats to persuade the garrison and <lb/>
            the queen to pacify the wrath of the implacable Sapor by <lb/>
            a speedy surrender.</p>
          <p>7. And after many arguments had been urged on both <lb/>
            sides, the woman bewailing the sad fortune of her husband, <lb/>
            these men, who had been most active in wishing to com- <lb/>
            pel her to surrender, pitying her distress, changed their <lb/>
            views ; and conceiving a hope of higher preferment, they <lb/>
            in secret conferences arranged that at an appointed hour of <lb/>
            the night the gates should be suddenly thrown open, and <lb/>
            a strong detachment should sally forth and fall upon the <lb/>
            ramparts of the enemy's camp, surprising it with sudden <lb/>
            slaughter; the traitors promising that, to prevent any <lb/>
            knowledge of what was going on, they would come forward <lb/>
            to meet them.</p>
          <p>8. Having ratified this agreement with an oath, they <lb/>
            quitted the town, and led the besiegers to acquiesce in <lb/>
            inaction by representing that the besieged had required <lb/>
            two days to deliberate on what course they ought to pur- <lb/>
            sue. Then in the middle of the night, when they were all <lb/>
            roundly asleep in fancied security, the gates of the city were <lb/>
            thrown open, and a strong body of young men poured forth <lb/>
            with great speed, creeping on with noiseless steps and <lb/>
            drawn swords, till they entered the camp of the unsuspect- <lb/>
            ing enemy, where they slew numbers of sleeping men, <lb/>
            without meeting with any resistance.</p>
          <p>8. This unexpected treachery of his officers, and the loss <lb/>
            thus inflicted on the Persians, caused a terrible quarrel <lb/>
            between us and Sapor; and another cause for his anger <pb n="465"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 368.J"/> <lb/>
            was added, as the Emperor Valens received Para, the son <lb/>
            of Arsaces, who at his mother's instigation had quitted the <lb/>
            fortress with a small escort, and had desired him to stay at <lb/>
            Neo-Cæsarea, a most celebrated city on the Black Sea, <lb/>
            where he was treated with great liberality and high respect. <lb/>
            Cylaces and Artabannes, being allured by this humanity of <lb/>
            Valens, sent envoys to him to ask for assistance, and to <lb/>
            request that Para might be given them for their king.</p>
          <p>10. However, for the moment assistance was refused <lb/>
            them; but Para was conducted by the general Terentius <lb/>
            back to Armenia, where he was to rule that nation without <lb/>
            any of the insignia of royalty; which was a very wise <lb/>
            regulation, in order that we might not be accused of break- <lb/>
            ing our treaty of peace.</p>
          <p>11. When this arrangement became known, Sapor was <lb/>
            enraged beyond all bounds, and collecting a vast army, <lb/>
            entered Armenia and ravaged it with the most ferocious <lb/>
            devastation. Para was terrified at his approach, as were <lb/>
            also Cylaces and Artabannes, and, as they saw no other <lb/>
            resource, fled into the recesses of the lofty mountains <lb/>
            which separate our frontiers from Lazica ; where they hid <lb/>
            in the depths of the woods and among the defiles of the <lb/>
            hills for -five months, eluding the various attempts of the <lb/>
            king to discover them.</p>
          <p>12. And Sapor, when he saw that he was losing his <lb/>
            labour in the middle of winter, burnt all the fruit trees, <lb/>
            and all the fortified castles and camps, of which he had <lb/>
            become master by force or treachery, and also burnt <lb/>
            Artogerassa, which had long been blockaded by his whole <lb/>
            army, and after many battles was taken through the ex- <lb/>
            haustion of the garrison ; and he carried off from thence <lb/>
            the wife of Arsaces and all his treasures.</p>
          <p>13. For these reasons, Arinthæus was sent into these dis- <lb/>
            tricts with the rank of count, to aid the Armenians if the <lb/>
            Persians should attempt to harass them by a second cam- <lb/>
            paign.</p>
          <p>14. At the same time, Sapor, with extraordinary CUll- <lb/>
            ning, being either humble or arrogant as best suited him, <lb/>
            under pretence of an intended alliance, sent secret mes- <lb/>
            sengers to Para to reproach him as neglectful of his own <lb/>
            dignity, since, with the appearance of royal majesty, he was <lb/>
            really the slave of Cylaces and Artabannes. On which <note type="footnote">2 H </note> <pb n="466"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVII. CH. XII."/> <lb/>
            Para, with great precipitation, cajoled them with caresses <lb/>
            till he got them in his power, and slew them, sending their <lb/>
            heads to Sapor in proof of his obedience.</p>
          <p>15. When the death of these men became generally <lb/>
            known, it caused such dismay that Armenia would have <lb/>
            been ruined without striking a blow in its own defence, if <lb/>
            the Persians had not been so alarmed at the approach of <lb/>
            Arinthæus that they forbore to invade it again, contenting <lb/>
            themselves with sending ambassadors to the emperor, <lb/>
            demanding of him not to defend that nation, according to <lb/>
            the agreement made between them and Jovian.</p>
          <p>16. Their ambassadors were rejected, and Sauromaces, <lb/>
            who, as we have said before, had been expelled from the <lb/>
            kingdom of Hiberia, was sent back with twelve legions <lb/>
            under the command of Terentius; and when he reached the <lb/>
            river Cyrus, Aspacuras entreated him that they might both <lb/>
            reign as partners, being cousins; alleging that he could <lb/>
            not withdraw nor cross over to the side of the Romans, <lb/>
            because his son Ultra was as a hostage in the hands of the <lb/>
            Persians.</p>
          <p>17. The emperor learning this, in order by wisdom and <lb/>
            prudence to put an end to the difficulties arising out of <lb/>
            this affair, acquiesced in the division of Hiberia, allowing <lb/>
            the Cyrus to be the boundary of the two divisions: Saure- <lb/>
            maces to have the portion next to the Armenians and <lb/>
            Lazians, and Aspacuras the districts which border on <lb/>
            Albania and Persia.</p>
          <p>18. Sapor, indignant at this, exclaimed that he was un- <lb/>
            worthily treated, because we had assisted Armenia con- <lb/>
            trary to our treaty, and because the embassy had failed <lb/>
            which he had sent to procure redress, and because the <lb/>
            kingdom of Hiberia was divided without his consent or <lb/>
            privity; and so, shutting as it were, the gates of friend- <lb/>
            ship, he sought assistance among the neighbouring nations, <lb/>
            and prepared his own army in order, with the return <lb/>
            of fine weather, to overturn all the arrangements which <lb/>
            the Romans had made with a view to their own interests <pb n="467"/>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE the perfidy of the king was exciting these un- <lb/>
            expected troubles in Persia, as we have related above, and <lb/>
            while war was reviving in the east, sixteen years and rather <lb/>
            more after the death of Nepotianus, Bellona, raging through <lb/>
            the eternal city, destroyed everything, proceeding from <lb/>
            trifling beginnings to the most lamentable disasters. <lb/>
            Would that they could be buried in everlasting silence, <lb/>
            lest perhaps similar things may some day be again <lb/>
            attempted, which will do more harm by the general <lb/>
            example thus set than even by the misery they occasion.</p>
          <p>2. And although after a careful consideration of different <lb/>
            circumstances, a reasonable fear would restrain me from <lb/>
            giving a minute account of the bloody deeds now perpe- <lb/>
            trated, yet, relying on the moderation of the present age, <pb n="468"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. I."/> <lb/>
            I will briefly touch upon the things most deserving of <lb/>
            record, nor shall I regret giving a concise account of the <lb/>
            fears which the events that happened at a former period <lb/>
            caused me.</p>
          <p>3. In the first Median war, when the Persians had <lb/>
            ravaged Asia, they laid siege to Miletus with a vast host, <lb/>
            threatening the garrison with torture and death, and at <lb/>
            last reduced the citizens to such straits, that they all, being <lb/>
            overwhelmed with the magnitude of their distresses, <lb/>
            slew their nearest relations, cast all their furniture and <lb/>
            movables into the fire, and then threw themselves in <lb/>
            rivalry with one another on the common funeral pile of <lb/>
            their perishing country.</p>
          <p>4. A short time afterwards, Phrynichus made this event <lb/>
            the subject of a tragedy which he exhibited on the stage at <lb/>
            Athens; and after he had been for a short time listened to <lb/>
            with complacency, when amid all its fine language the <lb/>
            tragedy became more and more distressing, it was eon- <lb/>
            demned by the indignation of the people, who thought that <lb/>
            it was insulting to produce this as the subject of a <lb/>
            dramatic poem, and that it had been prompted not by a <lb/>
            wish to console, but only to remind them to their own <lb/>
            disgrace of the sufferings which that beautiful city had <lb/>
            endured without receiving any aid from its founder and <lb/>
            parent. For Miletus was a colony of the Athenians, and <lb/>
            had been established there among the other Ionian states <lb/>
            by Neleus, the son of that Codrus who is said to have <lb/>
            devoted himself for his country in the Dorian war.</p>
          <p>5. Let us now return to our subject. Maximinus, <lb/>
            formerly deputy prefect of Rome, was born in a very <lb/>
            obscure rank of life at Sopianse, a town of Valeria ; his <lb/>
            father being only a elerk in the president's offiee, descended <lb/>
            from the posterity of those Carpi whom Dioeletian re- <lb/>
            moved from their ancient homes and transferred to <lb/>
            Pannonia.</p>
          <p>6. After a slight study of the liberal sciences, and <lb/>
            some small practice at the bar, he was promoted to be <lb/>
            governor of Corsica, then of Sardinia, and at last of <lb/>
            Tuscany. From hence, as his successor loitered a long <lb/>
            while on his road, he proceeded to superintend the supply- <lb/>
            ing of the eternal city with provisions, still retaining <lb/>
            the government of the province ; and three different con- <pb n="469"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 388.]"/> <lb/>
            siderations rendered him cautious on his first entrance into <lb/>
            office, namely:-</p>
          <p>7. In the first place, because he bore in mind the pre- <lb/>
            diction of his father, a man pre-eminently skilful in inter- <lb/>
            preting what was portended by birds from whom auguries <lb/>
            were taken, or by the note of such birds as spoke. And he <lb/>
            had warned him that though he would rise to supreme <lb/>
            authority, he would perish by the axe of the executioner; <lb/>
            secondly, because he had fallen in with a Sardinian (whom <lb/>
            he himself subsequently put to death by treachery, as <lb/>
            report generally affirmed) who was a man skilled in raising <lb/>
            up evil spirits, and in gathering presages from ghosts; and <lb/>
            as long as that Sardinian lived, he, fearing to be betrayed, <lb/>
            was more tractable and mild; lastly, because while he <lb/>
            was slowly making his way through inferior appointments, <lb/>
            like a serpent that glides underground, he was not yet of <lb/>
            power sufficient to perpetrate any extensive destruction or <lb/>
            executions.</p>
          <p>8. But the origin of his arriving at more extensive <lb/>
            power lay in the following transaction: Chilo, who had <lb/>
            been deputy, and his wife, named Maxima, complained to <lb/>
            Olybrius, at that time prefect of the city, asserting that <lb/>
            their lives had been attacked by poison, and with such <lb/>
            earnestness that the men whom they suspected were at <lb/>
            once arrested and thrown into prison. These were Serious, <lb/>
            a musician, Asbolius, a wrestling master, and Campensis, <lb/>
            a soothsayer.</p>
          <p>. 9. But as the affair began to cool on account of the long- <lb/>
            continued violence of some illness with which Olybrius <lb/>
            was attacked, the persons who had laid the complaint, <lb/>
            becoming impatient of delay, presented a petition in <lb/>
            which they asked to have the investigation of their charge <lb/>
            referred to the superintendent of the corn-market; and, <lb/>
            from a desire for a speedy decision, this request was <lb/>
            granted.</p>
          <p>10. Now, therefore, that he had an opportunity of doing <lb/>
            injury, Maximin displayed the innate ferocity which <lb/>
            was implanted in his cruel heart, just as wild beasts <lb/>
            exhibited in the amphitheatre often do when at length <lb/>
            released from their cages. And, as this affair was repre- <lb/>
            sented first in various ways, as if in a kind of prelude, and <lb/>
            some persons with their sides lacerated named certain <pb n="470"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. I."/> <lb/>
            nobles, as if by means of their clients and other low-born <lb/>
            persons known as criminals and informers, they had em- <lb/>
            ployed various artifices for injuring them. This infernal <lb/>
            delegate, carrying his investigations to an extravagant <lb/>
            length, presented a malicious report to the emperor, in <lb/>
            which he told him that such atrocious crimes as many <lb/>
            people had committed at Rome could not be investigated <lb/>
            nor punished without the severest penalties.</p>
          <p>11. When the emperor learnt this he was exasperated <lb/>
            beyond measure, being rather a furious than a rigorous <lb/>
            enemy to vice; and accordingly, by one single edict <lb/>
            applying to causes of this kind, which in his arrogance he <lb/>
            treated as if they partook of treason, he commanded that <lb/>
            all those whom the equity of the ancient law and the <lb/>
            judgment of the gods had exempted from examination by <lb/>
            torture, should, if the case seemed to require it, be put to <lb/>
            the rack.</p>
          <p>12. And in order that the authority to be established, <lb/>
            by being doubled and raised to greater distinction, might <lb/>
            be able to heap up greater calamities, he appointed Maximin <lb/>
            pro-prefect at Rome, and gave him as colleague in the <lb/>
            prosecution of these inquiries, which were being prepared <lb/>
            for the ruin of many persons, a secretary named Leo, <lb/>
            who was afterwards master of the ceremonies. He was <lb/>
            by birth a Pannonian, and by occupation originally a <lb/>
            brigand, as savage as a wild beast, and insatiable of <lb/>
            human blood.</p>
          <p>13. The accession of a colleague so much like himself, <lb/>
            inflamed the cruel and malignant disposition of Maximin, <lb/>
            which was further encouraged by the commission which <lb/>
            conferred this dignity on them; so that, flinging himself <lb/>
            about in his exultation, he seemed rather to dance than <lb/>
            to walk, while he studied to imitate the Brachmans who, <lb/>
            according to some accounts, move in the air amid the <lb/>
            altars.</p>
          <p>14. And now the trumpets of intestine discords sounded, <lb/>
            while all men stood amazed at the atrocity of the things <lb/>
            which were done. Among which, besides many other cruel <lb/>
            and inhuman actions so various and so numerous that it is <lb/>
            impossible for me to relate them all, the death of Marinus, <lb/>
            the celebrated advocate, was especially remarkable. He <lb/>
            was condemned to death on a charge which was not even <pb n="471"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 68.]"/> <lb/>
            attempted to be supported by evidence, of having en- <lb/>
            deavoured by wicked acts to compass a marriage with <lb/>
            Hispanilla.</p>
          <p>15. And since I think that perhaps some persons may <lb/>
            read this history who, after careful investigation, will <lb/>
            object to it that such and such a thing was done before <lb/>
            another ; or again that this or that circumstance has been <lb/>
            omitted, I consider that I have inserted enough, because it <lb/>
            is not every event which has been brought about by base <lb/>
            people that is worth recording; nor, if it were neces- <lb/>
            sary to relate them all, would there be materials for such <lb/>
            an account, not even if the public records themselves were <lb/>
            examined, when so many atrocious deeds were common, <lb/>
            and when this new frenzy was throwing everything into <lb/>
            confusion without the slightest restraint; and when what <lb/>
            was feared was evidently not a judicial trial but a total <lb/>
            cessation of all justice.</p>
          <p>16. At this time, Cethegus, a senator, who was accused of <lb/>
            adultery, was beheaded, and a young man of noble birth, <lb/>
            named Alypius, who had been banished for some trivial <lb/>
            misconduct, with some other persons of low descent, were <lb/>
            all publicly executed; while every one appeared in their <lb/>
            sufferings to see a representation of what they themselves <lb/>
            might expect, and dreamt of nothing but tortures, prisons, <lb/>
            and dark dungeons.</p>
          <p>17. At the same time also, the affair of Hymetius, a man <lb/>
            of very eminent character, took place, of which the circum- <lb/>
            stances were as follows. When he was governing Africa as <lb/>
            pro-consul, and the Carthaginians were in extreme distress <lb/>
            for want of food, he supplied them with corn out of the <lb/>
            granaries destined for the Roman people ; and shortly after- <lb/>
            wards, when there was a fine harvest, he without delay <lb/>
            fully replaced what he had thus consumed.</p>
          <p>18. But as at the time of the scarcity ten bushels <lb/>
            had been sold to those who were in want for a piece of <lb/>
            gold, while he now bought thirty for the same sum, he <lb/>
            sent the profit derived from the difference in price to the <lb/>
            emperor's treasury. Therefore, Valentinian, suspecting <lb/>
            that there was not as much sent as there ought to have <lb/>
            been as the proceeds of this traffic, confiscated a portion of <lb/>
            his property.</p>
          <p>19. And to aggravate the severity of this infliction, <pb n="472"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. I"/> <lb/>
            another circumstance happened about the sama time which <lb/>
            equally tended to his ruin. Amantius was a soothsayer <lb/>
            of pre-eminent celebrity at that period, and having been <lb/>
            accused by some secret informer of being employed by this <lb/>
            same Hymctius to offer a sacrifice for some evil purpose, <lb/>
            he was brought before a court of justice and put to the <lb/>
            ruck; but in spite of all his tortures, he denied the charge <lb/>
            with steadfast resolution.</p>
          <p>20. And as he denied it, some secret papers were brought <lb/>
            from his house, among which was found a letter in the <lb/>
            handwriting of Hymetius, in which he asked Amantius to <lb/>
            propitiate the gods by some solemn sacrifices to engage <lb/>
            them to make the disposition of the emperor favourable <lb/>
            to him; and at the end of the letter were found some <lb/>
            reproachful terms applied to the emperor as avaricious <lb/>
            and cruel.</p>
          <p>21. Valentinian learnt these facts from the report of <lb/>
            some informers, who exaggerated the offence given, and with <lb/>
            very unnecessary vigour ordered an inquiry to be made <lb/>
            into the affair; and because Frontinus, the assessor of <lb/>
            Hymetius, was accused of having been the instrument of <lb/>
            drawing up this letter, he was scourged with rods till he <lb/>
            confessed, and then he was condemned to exile in Britain. <lb/>
            But Amantius was subsequently convicted of some capital <lb/>
            crimes and was executed.</p>
          <p>22. After these transactions, Hymetius was conducted <lb/>
            to the town of Otricoli, to be examined by Ampelius, the <lb/>
            prefect of the city, and deputy of Maximin; and when <lb/>
            he was on the point of being condemned, as was manifest <lb/>
            to every one, he judiciously seized an opportunity that <lb/>
            was afforded to him of appealing to the protection of the <lb/>
            emperor, and being protected by his name, he came off for <lb/>
            the time in safety.</p>
          <p>23. The emperor, however, when he was consulted on <lb/>
            the matter, remitted it to the senate, who examined into <lb/>
            the whole affair with justice, and banished him to Boæ, a <lb/>
            village in Dalmatia, for which they were visited with <lb/>
            the wrath of the emperor, who was exceedingly enraged <lb/>
            when he heard that a man whom in his own mind he <lb/>
            had condemned to death had been let off with a milder <lb/>
            punishment.</p>
          <p>24. These and similar transactions led every one to fear <pb n="473"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=".D. 368.] "/>that the treatment thus experienced by a few was intended <lb/>
            for all: and that these evils should not, by being con- <lb/>
            cealed, grow greater and greater till they reached an <lb/>
            intolerable height, the nobles sent a deputation consisting <lb/>
            of Praetextatus, formerly a prefect of the city, Venustus, <lb/>
            formerly deputy, and Minervius, who had been a consular <lb/>
            governor, to entreat the emperor not to allow the punish- <lb/>
            ments to exceed the offences, and not to permit any <lb/>
            senator to be exposed to the torture in an unprecedented <lb/>
            and unlawful manner.</p>
          <p>25. But when these envoys were admitted into the <lb/>
            council chamber, Valentinian denied that he had ever given <lb/>
            such orders, and insisted that the charges made against him <lb/>
            were calumnies. He was, however, refuted with great <lb/>
            moderation by the prætor Eupraxius; and in consequence <lb/>
            of this freedom, the cruel injunction that had been issued, <lb/>
            and which had surpassed all previous examples of cruelty <lb/>
            was amended.</p>
          <p>26. About the same time, Lollianus, a youth of tender <lb/>
            age, the son of Lampadius, who had been prefect, being <lb/>
            accused before Maximin, who investigated his case with <lb/>
            great care, and being convicted of having copied out a <lb/>
            book on the subject of the unlawful acts (though, as his <lb/>
            age made it likely, without any definite plan of using it), <lb/>
            was, it seemed, on the point of being sentenced to banish- <lb/>
            ment, when, at the suggestion of his father, he appealed <lb/>
            to the emperor; and being by his order brought to court, <lb/>
            it appeared that he had, as the proverb has it, gone from <lb/>
            the frying-pan into the fire, as he was now handed over to <lb/>
            Phalangius, the consular governor of Bætica, and put to <lb/>
            death by the hand of the executioner.</p>
          <p>27. There were also Tarratius Bassus, who afterwards <lb/>
            became prefect of the city, his brother Camenius, a man of <lb/>
            the name of Marcian, and Eusapius, all men of great <lb/>
            eminence, who were prosecuted on the ground of having <lb/>
            protected the charioteer Auchenius, and being his accom- <lb/>
            plices in the act of poisoning. The evidence was very <lb/>
            doubtful, and they were acquitted by the decision of <lb/>
            Victorinus, as general report asserted; Victorinus being a <lb/>
            most intimate friend of Maximin.</p>
          <p>28. Women too were equally exposed to similar treat- <lb/>
            ment. For many of this sex also, and of noble birth, were <pb n="474"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. I"/> <lb/>
            put to death on being convicted of adultery or unchastity. <lb/>
            The most notorious cases were those of Claritas and, <lb/>
            Flaviana; the first of whom, when conducted to death, <lb/>
            was stripped of the clothes which she wore, not even <lb/>
            being permitted to retain enough to cover her with bare <lb/>
            decency; and for this the executioner also was con- <lb/>
            victed of having committed a great crime, and burnt to <lb/>
            death.</p>
          <p>29. Paphius and Cornelius; both senators, confessed that <lb/>
            they had polluted themselves by the wicked practice of <lb/>
            poisoning, and were put to death by the sentence of Maxi- <lb/>
            min ; and by a similar sentence the master of the mint was <lb/>
            executed. He also condemned Serious and Asbolius, who <lb/>
            have been mentioned before; and because while exhorting <lb/>
            them to name any others who occurred to them, he had <lb/>
            promised them with an oath that they should not them- <lb/>
            selves be punished either by fire or sword, he had them <lb/>
            slain by violent blows from balls of lead. After this he also <lb/>
            burnt alive Campensis the soothsayer, not having in his <lb/>
            case bound himself by any oath or promise.</p>
          <p>30. Here it is in my opinion convenient to explain the <lb/>
            cause which brought Aginatius headlong to destruction, a <lb/>
            man ennobled by a long race of ancestors, as unvarying <lb/>
            tradition affirms, though no proof of his ancestral renown <lb/>
            was ever substantiated.</p>
          <p>31. Maximin, full of pride and arrogance, and being <lb/>
            then also prefect of the corn-market, and having many en- <lb/>
            couragements to audacity, proceeded so far as to show his <lb/>
            contempt for Probus, the most illustrious of all the nobles, <lb/>
            and who was governing the provinces with the authority <lb/>
            of prefect of the prætorium.</p>
          <p>32. Aginatius, being indignant at this, and feeling it a <lb/>
            hardship that in the trial of causes Olybrius had preferred <lb/>
            Maximin to himself, while he was actually deputy at Rome, <lb/>
            secretly informed Probus in private letters that the arro- <lb/>
            gant and foolish man who had thus set himself against his <lb/>
            lofty merits, might easily be put down if he thought fit.</p>
          <p>33. These letters, as some affirm, Probus sent to <lb/>
            Maximin, hardened as he was in wickedness, because he <lb/>
            feared his influence with the emperor; letting none but <lb/>
            the bearer know the business. And when he had read <lb/>
            them, the cruel Maximin became furious, and henceforth <pb n="475"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 368.]"/> <lb/>
            set all his engines at work to destroy Aginatius, like a <lb/>
            serpent that had been bruised by some one whom it <lb/>
            knew.</p>
          <p>34. There was another still more powerful cause for in- <lb/>
            triguing against him, which ultimately became his destruc- <lb/>
            tion. For he charged Victorinus, who was dead, and from <lb/>
            whom he had received a very considerable legacy, with <lb/>
            having while alive made money of the decrees of Maximin; <lb/>
            and with similar maliciousness he had also threatened his <lb/>
            wife Anepsia with a lawsuit.</p>
          <p>35. Anepsia, alarmed at this, and to support herself <lb/>
            by the aid of Maximin, pretended that her husband in a <lb/>
            will which he had recently made, had left him three <lb/>
            thousand pounds weight of silver. He, full of covetous- <lb/>
            ness, for this too was one of his vices, demanded half the <lb/>
            inheritance, and afterwards, not being contented with that, <lb/>
            as if it were hardly sufficient, he contrived another device <lb/>
            which he looked upon as both honourable and safe; and <lb/>
            not to lose his hold of the handle thus put in his way <lb/>
            for obtaining a large estate, he demanded the daughter of <lb/>
            Anepsia, who was the stepdaughter of Victorinus, as a wife <lb/>
            for his son; and this marriage was quickly arranged with <lb/>
            the consent of the woman.</p>
          <p>36. Through these and other atrocities equally lamentable, <lb/>
            which threw a gloom over the whole of the eternal city, <lb/>
            this man, never to be named without a groan, grew by the <lb/>
            ruin of numerous other persons, and began to stretch out <lb/>
            his hands beyond the limits of lawsuits and trials : for it is <lb/>
            said that he had a small cord always suspended from a <lb/>
            remote window of the prastorium, the end of which had a <lb/>
            loop which was easily drawn tight, by means of which he <lb/>
            received secret informations supported by no evidence or <lb/>
            testimony, but capable of being used to the ruin of many <lb/>
            innocent persons. And he used often to send his officers, <lb/>
            Mucianus and Barbarus, men fit for any deceit or treachery, <lb/>
            secretly out of his house.</p>
          <p>37. Who then, as if bewailing some hardship which as <lb/>
            they pretended had fallen upon them, and exaggerating <lb/>
            the cruelty of the judge, with constant repetition assured <lb/>
            those who really lay under execution that there was no <lb/>
            remedy by which they could save themselves except that <lb/>
            of advancing heavy accusation against men of high rank; <pb n="476"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[DK. XXVIII. CII. L"/> <lb/>
            because if such men 'vere involved in such accusations, <lb/>
            they themselves would easily procure an acquittal.</p>
          <p>38. In this way, Maximin's implacable temper over- <lb/>
            whelmed those yet in his power; numbers were thrown <lb/>
            into prison, and persons of the highest rank were seen with <lb/>
            anxious faces and in mourning attire. Nor ought any one <lb/>
            of them to bo blamed for bowing down to the ground in <lb/>
            saluting this monster, when they heard him vociferating <lb/>
            with the tone of a wild beast, that no one could ever be <lb/>
            acquitted unless he choose.</p>
          <p>39. For sayings like that, when instantly followed by <lb/>
            their natural result, would have terrified even men like <lb/>
            Numa, Pompilius, or Cato. In fact things went on in such a <lb/>
            way that some persons never had their eyes dried of the <lb/>
            tears caused by the misfortunes of others, as often happens <lb/>
            in such unsettled and dangerous times.</p>
          <p>40. And the iron-hearted judge, continually disregarding <lb/>
            all law and justice, had but one thing about him which <lb/>
            made him endurable; for sometimes he was prevailed upon <lb/>
            by entreaties to spare some one, though this too is affirmed <lb/>
            to be nearly a vice in the following passage of Cicero. <lb/>
            “If anger be implacable, it is the extreme of seve- <lb/>
            rity ; if it yield to entreaties, it is the extreme of levity; <lb/>
            though in times of misfortune even levity is to be preferred <lb/>
            to cruelty."</p>
          <p>41. After these events, Leo arrived, and was received as <lb/>
            his successor, and Maximin was summoned to the emperor's <lb/>
            court and promoted to the office of prefect of the praetorium, <lb/>
            where he was as cruel as ever, having indeed greater power <lb/>
            of inflicting injury, like a basilisk serpent.</p>
          <p>42. Just at this time, or not long before, the brooms with <lb/>
            which the senate-house of the nobles was swept out were <lb/>
            seen to flower, and this portended that some persons of the <lb/>
            very lowest class would be raised to high rank and power.</p>
          <p>43. Though it is now time to return to the course of our <lb/>
            regular history, yet without neglecting the proper order of <lb/>
            time, we must dwell on a few incidents, which through <lb/>
            the iniquity of the deputy prefects of the city, were done <lb/>
            most unjustly, being in fact done at the word and will of <lb/>
            Maximin by those same officers, who seemed to look on <lb/>
            themselves as the mere servants of his pleasure.</p>
          <p>44. After him came Ursicinus, a man of a more merciful <pb n="477"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 368.]"/> <lb/>
            disposition, who, wishing to act cautiously and in confor- <lb/>
            mity to the constitution, confronted a man named Esaias <lb/>
            with some others who were in prison on a charge of <lb/>
            adultery with Rufina ; who had attempted to establish a <lb/>
            charge of treason against Marcellus her husband, formerly <lb/>
            in a situation of high trust. But this act led to his being <lb/>
            despised as a dawdler, and a person little fit to carry out <lb/>
            such designs with proper resolution, and so he was removed <lb/>
            from his place of deputy.</p>
          <p>45. He was succeeded by Simplicius of Emona, who had <lb/>
            been a schoolmaster, but was now the assessor of Maximin. <lb/>
            After receiving this appointment, he did not grow more <lb/>
            proud or arrogant, but assumed a supercilious look, which <lb/>
            gave a repulsive expression to his countenance. His <lb/>
            language was studiously moderate, while he meditated the <lb/>
            most rigorous proceedings against many persons. And <lb/>
            first of all he put Rufina to death with all the partners of <lb/>
            her adultery, and all who were privy to it, concerning <lb/>
            whom Ursicinus, as we have related, had already made a <lb/>
            report. Then he put numbers of others to death, without <lb/>
            any distinction between the innocent and the guilty.</p>
          <p>46. Running a race of bloodshed with Maximin, as if he <lb/>
            had, as it were, been his leader, he sought to surpass him <lb/>
            in destroying the noblest families, imitating Busiris and <lb/>
            Antæus of old, and Phalaris, so that he seemed to want <lb/>
            nothing but the bull of Agrigentum.</p>
          <p>47. After these and other similar transactions had taken <lb/>
            place, a certain matron named Hesychia, who was accused <lb/>
            of having attempted some crime, becoming greatly alarmed, <lb/>
            and being of a fierce and resolute disposition, killed herself <lb/>
            in the house of the officer to whom she was given in <lb/>
            custody, by muffling her face in a bed of feathers, and <lb/>
            stopping up her nostrils and so becoming suffocated.</p>
          <p>48. To all these calamities another of no less severity <lb/>
            was added. For Eumenius and Abienus, two men of the <lb/>
            highest class, having been accused, during Maximin's term, <lb/>
            of office, of adultery with Fausiana, a woman of rank, after: <lb/>
            the death of Victorinus, under whose protection they were <lb/>
            safe, being alarmed at the arrival of Simplicius, who was; <lb/>
            as full of audacity and threats as Maximin, withdrew to <lb/>
            some secret hiding-place. t <pb n="478"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. I."/> 49. But after Fausiana had been condemned they were <lb/>
            recorded among the accused, and were summoned by <lb/>
            public edict to appear, but they only hid themselves <lb/>
            the more carefully. And Abrenus was for a very long <lb/>
            time concealed in the house of Anepsia. But as it con- <lb/>
            tinually happens that unexpected accidents come to aggra- <lb/>
            vate the distresses of those who are already miserable, a <lb/>
            slave of Anepsia named Apaudulus, being angry because <lb/>
            his wife had been flogged, went by night to Simplicius, <lb/>
            and gave information of the whole affair, and officers <lb/>
            were sent to drag them both from their place of conceal- <lb/>
            ment.</p>
          <p>50. The charge against Abrenus was strengthened by <lb/>
            another charge which was brought against him, of having <lb/>
            seduced Anepsia, and he was condemned to death. But <lb/>
            Anepsia herself, to get some hope of saving her life by at <lb/>
            least procuring the delay of her execution, affirmed that <lb/>
            she had been assailed by unlawful arts, and had been <lb/>
            ravished in the house of Aginatius.</p>
          <p>51. Simplicius with loud indignation reported to the <lb/>
            emperor all that had taken place, and as Maximin, <lb/>
            who was now at court, hated Aginatius for the reason <lb/>
            which we have already explained, and having his rage <lb/>
            increased against him at the same time that his power was <lb/>
            augmented, entreated with great urgency that he might be <lb/>
            sentenced to death; and such a favour was readily granted <lb/>
            to this furious and influential exciter of the emperor's <lb/>
            severity.</p>
          <p>52. Then fearing the exceeding unpopularity which <lb/>
            would fall upon him if a man of patrician family should <lb/>
            perish by the sentence of Simplicius, who was his new <lb/>
            assessor and friend, he kept the imperial edict for the <lb/>
            execution by him for a short time, wavering and doubting <lb/>
            whom to pitch upon as a trusty and efficient perpetrator of <lb/>
            so atrocious a deed.</p>
          <p>53. At length, as like usually finds like, a certain <lb/>
            Gaul of the name of Doryphorianus was discovered, a <lb/>
            man daring even to madness; and as he promised to <lb/>
            accomplish the matter in a short time, he obtained for him <lb/>
            the post of deputy, and gave him the emperor's letter with <lb/>
            an additional rescript; instructing the man, who though <pb n="479"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=". A.D. 368.] "/>savage had no experience in such matters, how, if he used <lb/>
            sufficient speed, he would meet with no obstacle to his slay- <lb/>
            ing Aginatius; though, if there were any delay, he would <lb/>
            be very likely to escape.</p>
          <p>54. Doryphorianus, as he was commanded, hastened to <lb/>
            Rome by rapid journeys ; and while beginning to discharge <lb/>
            the duties of his new office, he exerted great industry to <lb/>
            discover how he could put a senator of eminent family to <lb/>
            death without any assistance. And when he learnt that <lb/>
            he had been some time before found in his own house <lb/>
            where he was still kept in custody, he determined to have <lb/>
            him brought before him as the chief of all the criminals, <lb/>
            with Anepsia, in the middle of the night; an hour at <lb/>
            which men's minds are especially apt to be bewildered by <lb/>
            terror; as, among many other instances, the Ajax of <lb/>
            Homer1 shows us, when he expresses a wish rather to die <lb/>
            by daylight, than to suffer the additional terrors of the <lb/>
            night.</p>
          <p>55. And as the judge, I should rather call him the <lb/>
            infamous robber, intent only on the service he had pro- <lb/>
            mised to perform, carried everything to excess, having <lb/>
            ordered Aginatius to be brought in, he also commanded the <lb/>
            introduction of a troop of executioners; and while the <lb/>
            chains rattled with a mournful sound, he tortured the slaves <lb/>
            who were already exhausted by their long confinement, till <lb/>
            they died, in order to extract from them matter affecting <lb/>
            the life of their master ; a proceeding which in a trial for <lb/>
            adultery our merciful laws expressly forbids.</p>
          <p>56. At last, when the tortures which were all but mortal <lb/>
            had wrung some hints from the maid-servant, without any <lb/>
            careful examination of the truth of her words, Aginatius <lb/>
            was at once sentenced to be led to execution, and without <lb/>
            being allowed to say a word in his defence, though with <note type="footnote"> See the Iliad, XVIII. 1. 645, where Ajax prays:— <lb/>
            " Lord of earth and air, <lb/>
            O King I 0 Father, hear my humble prayer! <lb/>
            Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore; <lb/>
            Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more I <lb/>
            If Greece must perish, we thy will obey, <lb/>
            But let us perish in the face of day." <lb/>

            loud outcries he appealed to and invoked the names of the <lb/>
            emperors, he was carried off and put to death, and Anepsia <lb/>
            was executed by a similar sentence. The eternal city was <lb/>
            filled with mourning for these executions which were per- <lb/>
            petrated either by Maximin himself when he was present <lb/>
            in the city, or by his emissaries when he was at a dis- <lb/>
            tance.</p>
          <p>57. But the avenging Furies of those who had been <lb/>
            murdered were preparing retribution. For, as I will after- <lb/>
            wards relate at the proper season, this same Maximin <lb/>
            giving way to his intolerable pride when Gratian was <lb/>
            emperor, was put to death by the sword of the executioner; <lb/>
            and Simplieius also was beheaded in Illyricum. Dorypho- <lb/>
            rianus too was condemned to death, and thrown into the <lb/>
            Tullian prison, but was taken from thence by the emperor <lb/>
            at his mother's suggestion, and when he was brought <lb/>
            back to his own country was put to death with terrible <lb/>
            torments. Let us now return to the point at which we <lb/>
            left our history. Such, however, was the state of affairs in <lb/>
            the city of Rome.</p>

          <p>§ 1. VALENTINIAN having several great and useful pro- <lb/>
            jects in his head, began to fortify the entire banks of the <lb/>
            Rhine, from its beginning in the Tyrol to the straits of <lb/>
            the oeean,1 with vast works; raising lofty castles and <lb/>
            fortresses, and a perfect range of towers in every <lb/>
            suitable place, so as to protect the whole frontier of Gaul; <lb/>
            and sometimes, by constructing works on the other side <lb/>
            of the river, he almost trenched upon the territories of the <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>. 2. At last considering that one fortress, of which he <lb/>
            himself had laid the very foundations, though sufficiently <lb/>
            high and safe, yet, being built on the very edge of the <lb/>
            river Neckar, was liable to be gradually undermined by <lb/>
            the violent beating of its waters, he formed a plan to <lb/>
            divert the river itself into another channel; and, having <lb/>
            sought out some workmen who were skilful in such works <note type="footnote"> 1 See Gibbon, vol. III. p. 97 (Bohn's edition). </note> <pb n="481"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 369.1"/> <lb/>
            and collected a strong military force, he began that arduous <lb/>
            labour.</p>
          <p>3. Day after day large masses of oaken beams were <lb/>
            fastened together, and thrown into the channel, and by <lb/>
            them huge piles were continually fixed and unfixed, being all <lb/>
            thrown into disorder by the rising of the stream, and after- <lb/>
            wards they were broken and carried away by the current.</p>
          <p>4. However, the resolute diligence of the emperor and <lb/>
            the labour of the obedient soldiery prevailed ; though the <lb/>
            troops were often up to their chins in the water while <lb/>
            at work; and at last, though not without considerable <lb/>
            risk, the fixed camp was protected against all danger from <lb/>
            the violence of the current, and is still safe and strong.</p>
          <p>5. Joyful and exulting in this success, the emperor, per- <lb/>
            ceiving that the weather and the season of the year did <lb/>
            not allow him any other occupation, like a good and active <lb/>
            prince began to apply his attention to the general affairs <lb/>
            of the republic. And thinking the time very proper for <lb/>
            completing one work which he had been meditating, he <lb/>
            began with all speed to raise a fortification on the other <lb/>
            side of the Rhine, on Mount Piri, a spot which belongs to <lb/>
            the barbarians. And as rapidity of action was one great <lb/>
            means of executing this design with safety, he sent orders <lb/>
            to the Duke Arator, through Syagrius, who was then a <lb/>
            secretary, but who afterwards became prefect and consul, <lb/>
            to attempt to make himself master of this height in the <lb/>
            dead of the night.</p>
          <p>6. The duke at once crossed over with the secretary, as <lb/>
            he was commanded; and was beginning to employ the <lb/>
            soldiers whom he had brought with him to dig out the <lb/>
            foundations, when he received a successor, Hermogenes. <lb/>
            At the very same moment there arrived some nobles of the <lb/>
            Allemanni, fathers of the hostages, whom, in accordance <lb/>
            with our treaty, we were detaining as important pledges <lb/>
            for the long continuance of the peace.</p>
          <p>7. And they, with bended knees entreated him not to <lb/>
            let the Romans, with an improvident disregard of all <lb/>
            safety (they whose fortune their everlasting good faith <lb/>
            had raised to the skies), now be misled by a base error to <lb/>
            trample all former agreements under foot, and attempt an <lb/>
            act unworthy of them.</p>
          <p>8. But since it was to no purpose that they used these <note type="footnote"> 2 I </note> <pb n="482"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. n "/>and similar arguments, as they were not listened to, and <lb/>
            finding that they had no chance of a conciliatory answer, <lb/>
            they reluctantly returned, bewailing the loss of their sons ; <lb/>
            and when they were gone, from a secret hiding-place <lb/>
            in a neighbouring hill a troop of barbarians sprang forth, <lb/>
            waiting, as far as was understood, for the answer which <lb/>
            was to be given to the nobles; and attacking our half- <lb/>
            naked soldiers, who were carrying loads of earth, drew <lb/>
            their swords and quickly slew them, and with them the <lb/>
            two generals.</p>
          <p>9. Nor was any one left to relate what had happened, <lb/>
            except Syagrius, who, after they were all destroyed returned <lb/>
            to the court, where by the sentence of his offended emperor <lb/>
            he was dismissed the service; on which he retired to his <lb/>
            own home; being judged by the severe decision of the <lb/>
            prince to have deserved this sentence because he was the <lb/>
            only one who escaped.</p>
          <p>10. Meanwhile the wicked fury of bands of robbers <lb/>
            raged through Gaul to the injury of many persons; since <lb/>
            they occupied the most frequented roads, and without any <lb/>
            hesitation seized upon everything valuable which came in <lb/>
            their way. Besides many other persons who were the <lb/>
            victims of these treacherous attacks, Constantianus, the <lb/>
            tribune of the stable, was attacked by a secret ambus- <lb/>
            cade and slain ; he was a relation of Valentinian, and the <lb/>
            brother of Cerealis and Justina.</p>
          <p>11. In other countries, as if the Furies were stirring up <lb/>
            similiar evils to afflict us on every side, the Maratocupreni, <lb/>
            those most cruel banditti, spread their ravages in every <lb/>
            direction. They were the natives of a town of the same <lb/>
            name in Syria, near Apamea; very numerous, mar- <lb/>
            vellously skilful in every kind of deceit, and an object of <lb/>
            universal fear, because, under the character of merchants <lb/>
            or soldiers of high rank, they spread themselves quietly <lb/>
            over the country, and then pillaged all the wealthy houses, <lb/>
            villages, and towns which came in their way.</p>
          <p>12. Nor could any one guard against their unexpected <lb/>
            attacks ; since they fell not upon any previously selected <lb/>
            victim, but in places in various parts, and at great dis- <lb/>
            tances, and carried their devastations wherever the wind <lb/>
            led them. For which reason the Saxons were feared <lb/>
            beyond all other enemies, because of the suddenness of <pb n="483"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 369.]"/> <lb/>
            their attacks. They then, in bands of sworn comrades, <lb/>
            destroyed the riches of many persons; and being under the <lb/>
            impulse of absolute fury, they committed the most mournful <lb/>
            slaughters, being not less greedy of blood than of booty. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, that I may not, by entering into too minute <lb/>
            details, impede the progress of my history, it will be suffi- <lb/>
            cient to relate one destructive device of theirs.</p>
          <p>. 13. A body of these wicked men assembled in one place, <lb/>
            pretending to be the retinue of a receiver of the revenue, or <lb/>
            of the governor of the province. In the darkness of the <lb/>
            evening they entered the city, while the crier made a <lb/>
            mournful proclamation, and attacked with swords the house <lb/>
            of one of the nobles, as if he had been proscribed and <lb/>
            sentenced to death. They seized all his valuable furni- <lb/>
            ture, because his servants, being utterly bewildered by the <lb/>
            suddenness of the danger, did not defend the house; they <lb/>
            slew several of them, and then before the return of day- <lb/>
            light withdrew with great speed.</p>
          <p>14. But being loaded with a great quantity of plunder, <lb/>
            since from their love of booty they had left nothing <lb/>
            behind, they were intercepted by a movement of the em- <lb/>
            peror's troop, and were cut off and all slain to a man. <lb/>
            And their children, who were at the time very young, <lb/>
            were also destroyed to prevent their growing up in <lb/>
            the likeness of their fathers: and their houses which <lb/>
            they had built with great splendour at the expense of <lb/>
            the misery of others, were all pulled down. These <lb/>
            things happened in the order in which they have been <lb/>
            related.</p>

          <p>§ 1. BUT Theodosius, a general of very famous reputation, <lb/>
            departed in high spirits from Augusta, which the ancients <lb/>
            used to call Londinium, with an army which he had col- <lb/>
            lected with great energy and skill; bringing a mighty aid <lb/>
            to the embarrassed and disturbed fortunes of the Britons. <lb/>
            His plan was to seek everywhere favourable situations for <lb/>
            laying ambuscades for the barbarians; and to impose no <lb/>
            duties on his troops of the performance of which he did not <lb/>
            himself cheerfully set the example.</p>
          <p>2. And in this way, while he performed the duties of a <pb n="484"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. m."/> <lb/>
            gallant soldier, and showed at the same time the prudence <lb/>
            of an illustrious general, he routed and vanquished the <lb/>
            various tribes in whom their past security had engendered <lb/>
            an insolence which led them to attack the Roman terri- <lb/>
            tories : and he entirely restored the cities and the fortresses <lb/>
            which through the manifold disasters of the time had been <lb/>
            injured or destroyed, though they had been originally <lb/>
            founded to secure the tranquillity of the country.</p>
          <p>3. But while he was pursuing this career, a great crime <lb/>
            was planned which was likely to have resulted in serious <lb/>
            danger, if it had not been crushed at the very beginning.</p>
          <p>4. A certain man named Valentine, in Valeria of <lb/>
            Pannonia, a man of a proud spirit, the brother-in-law of <lb/>
            Maximin, that wicked and cruel deputy, who afterwards <lb/>
            became prefect, having been banished to Britain for some <lb/>
            grave crime, and being a restless and mischievous beast, <lb/>
            was eager for any kind of revolution or mischief, began to <lb/>
            plot with great insolence against Theodosius, whom he <lb/>
            looked upon as the only person with power to resist his <lb/>
            wicked enterprise.</p>
          <p>5. But while both openly and privily taking many pre- <lb/>
            cautions, as his pride and covetousness increased, he began <lb/>
            to tamper with the exiles and the soldiers, promising them <lb/>
            rewards sufficient to tempt them as far at least as the cir- <lb/>
            cumstances and his enterprise would permit.</p>
          <p>6. But when the time for putting his attempt into <lb/>
            execution drew near, the duke, who had received from <lb/>
            some trustworthy quarter information of what was going <lb/>
            on, being always a man inclined to a bold line of conduct, <lb/>
            and resolutely bent on chastising crimes when detected, <lb/>
            seized Valentine with a few of his accomplices who were <lb/>
            most deeply implicated, and handed them over to the general <lb/>
            Dulcitius to be put to death. But at the same time con- <lb/>
            jecturing the future, through that knowledge of the soldiers <lb/>
            in which he surpassed other men, he forbade the institution <lb/>
            of any examination into the conspiracy generally, lest if <lb/>
            the fear of such an investigation should affect many, fresh <lb/>
            troubles might revive in the province.</p>
          <p>7. After this he turned his attention to make many <lb/>
            necessary amendments, feeling wholly free from any <lb/>
            danger in such attempts, since it was plain that all his <lb/>
            enterprises were attended by a propitious fortune. So <pb n="485"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 369.]"/> <lb/>
            he restored cities and fortresses, as we have already men- <lb/>
            tioned, and established stations and outposts on our fron- <lb/>
            tiers ; and he so completely recovered the province which <lb/>
            had yielded subjection to the enemy, that through his <lb/>
            agency it was again brought under the authority of its <lb/>
            legitimate ruler, and from that time forth was called <lb/>
            Valentia, by desire of the emperor, as a memorial of his <lb/>
            Success.</p>
          <p>8. The Areans, a class of men instituted in former <lb/>
            times, and of whom we have already made some mention <lb/>
            in recording the. acts of Constans, had now gradually fallen <lb/>
            into bad practices, for which he removed them from their <lb/>
            stations; in fact they had been undeniably convicted of <lb/>
            yielding to the temptation of the great rewards which <lb/>
            were given and promised to them, so as to have con- <lb/>
            tinually betrayed to the barbarians what was done among <lb/>
            us. For their business was to traverse vast districts, and <lb/>
            report to our generals the warlike movements of the <lb/>
            neighbouring nations.</p>
          <p>9. In this manner the affairs which I have already <lb/>
            mentioned, and others like them, having been settled, he <lb/>
            was summoned to the court, and leaving the provinces in <lb/>
            a state of exultation, like another Furius Camillus or <lb/>
            Papirius Cursor, he was celebrated everywhere for his <lb/>
            numerous and important victories. He was accompanied <lb/>
            by a large crowd of well-wishers to the coast, and crossing <lb/>
            over with a fair wind, arrived at the emperor's camp, <lb/>
            where he was received with joy and high praise, and <lb/>
            appointed to succeed Valens Jovinus, who was commander <lb/>
            of the cavalry.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. I HAVE thus made a long and extensive digression <lb/>
            from the affairs of the city, being constrained by the <lb/>
            abundance of events which took place abroad; and now I <lb/>
            will return to give a cursory sketch of them, beginning <lb/>
            with the tranquil and moderate exercise of the prefect's <lb/>
            authority by Olybrius, who never forgot the rights of <lb/>
            humanity, but was continually anxious and careful that no <lb/>
            word or deed of his should ever be harsh or cruel. He <lb/>
            was a merciless punisher of calumnies; he restrained the <lb/>
            exactions ofthe treasury wherever he could; he was a <pb n="486"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK:. XXVIII. CH. IT."/> <lb/>
            careful discriminator of right and wrong; an equitable <lb/>
            judge, and very gentle towards those placed under his <lb/>
            authority.</p>
          <p>2. But all these good qualities were clouded by one <lb/>
            vice which, though not injurious to the commonwealth, <lb/>
            was very discreditable to a judge of high rank; namely, <lb/>
            that his private life was one of great luxury, devoted <lb/>
            to theatrical exhibitions, and to amours, though not such <lb/>
            as were either infamous or incestuous.</p>
          <p>3. After him Ampelius succeeded to the government <lb/>
            of the city; he also was a man addicted to pleasure, a <lb/>
            native of Antioch, and one who from having been master <lb/>
            of the offices was twice promoted to a proconsulship, <lb/>
            and sometime afterwards to that supreme rank, the prefec- <lb/>
            ture. In other respects he was a cheerful man, and one <lb/>
            admirably suited to win the favour of the people; though <lb/>
            sometimes over-severe, without being as firm in his pur- <lb/>
            poses as might have been wished. Had he been, he would <lb/>
            have corrected, though perhaps not effectually, the glut- <lb/>
            tonous and debauched habits which prevailed; but, as it <lb/>
            was, by his laxity of conduct, he lost a glory which other- <lb/>
            wise might have been enduring.</p>
          <p>4. For he had determined that no wine-shop should be <lb/>
            opened before the fourth hour of the day; and that none <lb/>
            of the common people, before a certain fixed hour, should <lb/>
            either warm water or expose dressed meat for sale; and <lb/>
            that no one of respectable rank should be seen eating in <lb/>
            public.</p>
          <p>5. Since these unseemly practices, and others still <lb/>
            worse, owing to long neglect and connivance, had grown <lb/>
            so frequent that even Epimenides of Crete, if, according to <lb/>
            the fabulous story, he could have risen from the dead and <lb/>
            returned to our times, would have been unable by himself <lb/>
            to purify Rome ; such deep stains of incurable vices over- <lb/>
            whelmed it.</p>
          <p>6. And in the first place we will speak of the faults of <lb/>
            the nobles, as we have already repeatedly done as far as <lb/>
            our space permitted; and then we will proceed to the <lb/>
            faults of the common people, touching, however, only <lb/>
            briefly and rapidly on either.</p>
          <p>7. Some men, conspicuous for the illustriousness of their <lb/>
            ancestry as they think, gave themselves immoderate <pb n="487"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D.369.J"/> <lb/>
            airs, and call themselves Reburri, and Fabunii, and <lb/>
            Pagonii,' and Geriones, Dalii, Tarracii, or Perrasii, and <lb/>
            other finely-sounding appellations, indicating the antiquity <lb/>
            of their family.</p>
          <p>8. Some also are magnificent in silken robes, as if they <lb/>
            were being led to execution, or, to speak without words <lb/>
            of so unfavourable an omen, as if after the army had <lb/>
            passed they were bringing up the rear, and are followed <lb/>
            by a vast troop of servants, with a din like that of a com- <lb/>
            pany of soldiers.</p>
          <p>9. Such men when, while followed by fifty servants <lb/>
            apiece, they have entered the baths, cry out with threaten- <lb/>
            ing voice, " Where are my people ?” And if they sud- <lb/>
            denly find out that any unknown female slave has appeared, <lb/>
            or any worn-out courtesan who has long been subservient <lb/>
            to the pleasures of the townspeople, they run up, as if to <lb/>
            win a race, and patting and caressing her with dis- <lb/>
            gusting and unseemly blandishments, they extol her, as <lb/>
            the Parthians might praise Semiramis, Egypt her Cleo- <lb/>
            patra, the Carians Artemisia, or the Palmyrene citizens <lb/>
            Zenobia. And men do this, whose ancestor, even though <lb/>
            a senator, would have been branded with a mark of infamy <lb/>
            because he dared, at an unbecoming time, to kiss his wife <lb/>
            in the presence of their common daughter.</p>
          <p>10. Some of these, when any one meets and begins to <lb/>
            salute them, toss their heads like bulls preparing to butt, <lb/>
            offering their flatterers their knees or hands to kiss, think- <lb/>
            ing that quite enough for their perfect happiness; while <lb/>
            they deem it sufficient attention and civility to a stranger <lb/>
            who may happen to have laid them under some obligation <lb/>
            to ask him what warm or cold bath he frequents, or what <lb/>
            house he lives in.</p>
          <p>11. And while they are so solemn, looking upon them- <lb/>
            selves as especial cultivators of virtue, if they learn that <lb/>
            any one has brought intelligence that any fine horses or <lb/>
            skilful coachmen are coming from any place, they rush <lb/>
            with as much haste to see them, examine them, and put <lb/>
            questions concerning them, as their ancestors showed on <lb/>
            beholding the twin-brothers Tyndaridæ,1 when they filled <note type="footnote">1 This is an allusion to the story of Castor and Pollux bringing news <lb/>
            of the victory gained at the battle of Regillus to Domitius (B.C. 496). <lb/>
            The legend adds that they stroked his black beard, which immediately </note> <pb n="488"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="BKXXVIII CH. IT"/> <lb/>
            the whole city with joy by the announcement of that an- <lb/>
            cicnt victory.</p>
          <p>12. A number of idle chatterers frequent their houses, <lb/>
            and, with various pretended modes of adulation, applaud <lb/>
            every word uttered by men of such high fortune; resem- <lb/>
            bling the parasites in a comedy, for as they puff up bragging <lb/>
            soldiers, attributing to them, as rivals of the heroes of old, <lb/>
            sieges of cities, and battles, and the death of thousands of <lb/>
            enemies, so these men admire the construction of the lofty <lb/>
            pillars, and the walls inlaid with stones of carefully chosen <lb/>
            colours, and extol these grandees with superhuman praises.</p>
          <p>13. Sometimes scales are sent for at their entertain- <lb/>
            ments to weigh the fish, or the birds, or the dormice <lb/>
            which are set on the table ; and then the size of them is <lb/>
            dwelt on over and over again, to the great weariness of <lb/>
            those present, as something never seen before; especially <lb/>
            when near thirty secretaries stand by, with tablets and <lb/>
            memorandum books, to record all these circumstances; so <lb/>
            that nothing seems to be wanting but a schoolmaster.</p>
          <p>14. Some of them, hating learning as they hate poison, <lb/>
            read Juvenal and Marius Maximus1 with tolerably careful <lb/>
            study; though, in their profound laziness, they never touch <lb/>
            any other volumes ; why, it does not belong to my poor <lb/>
            judgment to decide.</p>
          <p>15. For, in consideration of their great glories and long <lb/>
            pedigrees, they ought to read a great variety of books; <lb/>
            in which, for instance, they might learn that Socrates, <lb/>
            when condemned to death and thrown into prison, asked <lb/>
            some one who was playing a song of the Greek poet <lb/>
            Stesichorus with great skill, to teach him also to do that, <lb/>
            while it was still in his power; and when the musician <lb/>
            asked him of what use this skill could be to him, as he <lb/>
            was to die the next day, he answered, " that I may know <lb/>
            something more before I die."</p>
          <p>16. And there are among them some who are such severe <lb/>
            judges of offences, that if a slave is too long in bringing <lb/>
            them hot water, they will order him to be scourged with <lb/>
            three hundred stripes; but should he intentionally have <note type="footnote">became red; from which he and his posterity derived the surname of <lb/>
            Ænobarbus.—See Dion. Hal. vi. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> 1Marius Maximus was an author who wrote an account of the lives <lb/>

            killed a man, while numbers insist that he ought to be <lb/>
            unhesitatingly condemned as guilty, his master will exclaim, <lb/>
            " What can the poor wretch do ? what can one expect <lb/>
            from a good-for-nothing fellow like that?" But should <lb/>
            any one else venture to do anything of the kind, he <lb/>
            would be corrected.</p>
          <p>17. Their ideas of civility are such that a stranger had <lb/>
            better kill a man's brother than send an excuse to them if he <lb/>
            be asked to dinner; for a senator fancies that he has suffered <lb/>
            a terrible grievance, equal to the loss of his entire patri- <lb/>
            mony, if any guest be absent, whom, after repeated deli- <lb/>
            berations, he has once invited.</p>
          <p>18. Some of them, if they have gone any distance to see <lb/>
            their estates in the country, or to hunt at a meeting col- <lb/>
            lected for their amusement by others, think they have <lb/>
            equalled the marches of Alexander the Great, or of Cæsar; <lb/>
            or if they have gone in some painted boats from Lake <lb/>
            Avernus to Pozzuoli or Cajeta, especially if they have <lb/>
            ventured on such an exploit in warm weather. Where <lb/>
            if, amid their golden fans, a fly should perch on the silken <lb/>
            fringes, or if a slender ray of the sun should have pierced <lb/>
            through a hole in their awning, they complain that they <lb/>
            were not born among the Cimmerians.</p>
          <p>19. Then, when they come from the bath of Silvanus, or <lb/>
            the waters of Mamma, which are so good for the health, <lb/>
            after they come out of the water, and have wiped themselves <lb/>
            with cloths of the finest linen, they open the presses, and <lb/>
            take out of them robes so delicate as to be transparent, <lb/>
            selecting them with care, till they have got enough to <lb/>
            clothe eleven persons; and at length, after they have <lb/>
            picked out all they choose, they wrap themselves up in them, <lb/>
            and take the rings which they had given to their attendants <lb/>
            to hold, that they might not be injured by the damp; and <lb/>
            then they depart when their fingers are properly cooled.</p>
          <p>20. Again, if any one having lately quitted the military <lb/>
            service of the emperor, has retired to his home.1 ...</p>
          <p>21. Some of them, though not many, wish to avoid the <lb/>
            name of gamblers, and prefer to be called dice-players; <lb/>
            the difference being much the same as that between a thief <lb/>
            and a robber. But this must be confessed that, while all <note type="footnote">1 § 20 is mutilated, so that no sense can be extracted from the re <lb/>
            mainder of it. </note> <pb n="490"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. Cn. IV."/> <lb/>
            friendships at Rome are rather cool, those alone which <lb/>
            are engendered by dice are sociable and intimate, as if <lb/>
            they had been formed amid glorious exertions, and were <lb/>
            firmly cemented by exceeding affection; to which it is <lb/>
            owing that some of this class of gamblers live in such har- <lb/>
            mony that you might think them the brothers Quintilii.1 <lb/>
            And so you may sometimes see a man of base extraction, <lb/>
            who knows all the secrets of the dice, as grave as Porcius <lb/>
            Cato when he met with a repulse which he had never <lb/>
            expected nor dreamt of, when a candidate for the prætorship, <lb/>
            with affected solemnity and a serious face, because at some <lb/>
            grand entertainment or assembly some man of proconsular <lb/>
            rank has been preferred to himself.</p>
          <p>22. Some lay siege to wealthy men, whether old or <lb/>
            young, childless or unmarried, or even with wives and <lb/>
            children (for with such an object no distinction is ever <lb/>
            regarded by them), seeking by most marvellous tricks to <lb/>
            allure them to make their wills; and then if, after observing <lb/>
            'all the forms of law, they bequeath to these persons what <lb/>
            they have to leave, being won over by them to this com- <lb/>
            pliance, they speedily die.2</p>
          <p>23. Another person, perhaps only in some subordinate <lb/>
            office, struts along with his head up, looking with so slight <lb/>
            and passing a glance upon those with whom he was pre- <lb/>
            viously acquainted, that you might fancy it must be Marcus <lb/>
            Marcellus just returned from the capture of Syracuse.</p>
          <p>24. Many among them deny the existence of a superior <lb/>
            Power in heaven, and yet neither appear in public, nor <lb/>
            dine, nor think that they can bathe with any prudence, <lb/>
            before they have carefully consulted an almanac, and <lb/>
            learnt where (for example) the planet Mercury is, or in <lb/>
            what portion of Cancer the moon is as she passes through <lb/>
            the heavens.</p>
          <p>25. Another man, if he perceives his creditor to be <lb/>
            importunate in demanding a debt, flies to a charioteer <lb/>
            who is bold enough to venture on any audacious enterprise, <lb/>
            and takes care that he shall be harassed with dread of <lb/>
            persecution as a poisoner; from which he cannot be released <lb/>
            without giving bail and incurring a very heavy expense. <note type="footnote"> 1 Two brothers who had been colleagues in several important <lb/>

            One may add to this, that he includes under this head a <lb/>
            debtor who is only so through the engagements into which <lb/>
            he has entered to avoid a prosecution, as if he were a real <lb/>
            debtor, and that he never lets him go till he has obtained <lb/>
            the discharge of the debt.</p>
          <p>26. On the other side, a wife, who, as the old proverb <lb/>
            has it, hammers on the same anvil day and night, to compel <lb/>
            her husband to make his will, and then the husband is <lb/>
            equally urgent that his wife shall do the same. And men <lb/>
            learned in the law are procured on each side, the one in <lb/>
            the bedchamber, and his opponent in the dining-room, <lb/>
            to draw up counter-documents. And under their employ <lb/>
            are placed ambiguous interpreters of the contracts of <lb/>
            their victims, who, on the one side, promise with great <lb/>
            liberality high offices, and the funerals of wealthy matrons ; <lb/>
            and from these they proceed to the obsequies of the hus- <lb/>
            bands, giving hints that everything necessary ought to be <lb/>
            prepared; and! ..... as Cicero says, "Nor in the <lb/>
            affairs of men do they understand anything good, except <lb/>
            what is profitable; and they love those friends most (as <lb/>
            they would prefer sheep) from whom they expect to derive <lb/>
            the greatest advantage.”2</p>
          <p>27. And when they borrow anything, they are si <lb/>
            humble and cringing, you would think you were at &amp; <lb/>
            comedy, and seeing Micon or Laches; when they are con <lb/>
            strained to repay what they have borrowed, they become <lb/>
            so turgid and bombastic that you would take them for those <lb/>
            descendants of Hercules, Cresphontes and Temenus. This <lb/>
            is enough to say of the senatorial order. —</p>
          <p>28. And let us come to the idle and lazy common <lb/>
            people, among whom some, who have not even got shoes <lb/>
            boast of high-sounding names ; calling themselves Cimes. <lb/>
            sores, Statarii. Semicupæ, Serapina, or Cicimbricus, oi <lb/>
            Gluturiorus, Trulla, Lucanicus, Pordaca, or Salsula," <lb/>
            with numbers of other similar appellations. These <lb/>
            men spend their whole lives in drinking, and gam- <lb/>
            bling, and brothels, and pleasures, and public spectacles; <lb/>
            and to them the Circus Maximus is their temple, their <note type="footnote">1 This passage, again, seems hopelessly mutilated. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cicero, de Amieitia, c. xxi. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 These are not in reality noble names, but names derived from <lb/>

            home, their public assembly; in fact, their whole hope <lb/>
            and desire.1</p>
          <p>29. And you may see in the forum, and roads, and streets, <lb/>
            and places of meeting, knots of people collected, quarrel- <lb/>
            ling violently with one another, and objecting to one <lb/>
            another, and splitting themselves into violent parties.</p>
          <p>30. Among whom those who have lived long, having <lb/>
            influence by reason of their age, their gray hairs and <lb/>
            wrinkles, are continually crying out that the republic <lb/>
            cannot stand, if in the contest which is about to take place, <lb/>
            the skilful charioteer, whom some individual backs, is. not <lb/>
            foremost in the race, and does not dextrously shave the <lb/>
            turning-post with the trace-horses.</p>
          <p>31. And when there is so much ruinous carelessness, when <lb/>
            the wished-for day of the equestrian games dawns, before <lb/>
            the sun has visibly risen, they all rush out with headlong <lb/>
            haste, as if with their speed they would outstrip the very <lb/>
            chariots which are going to race; while as to the event of <lb/>
            the contest they are all torn asunder by opposite wishes, <lb/>
            and the greater part of them, through their anxiety, pass <lb/>
            sleepless nights.</p>
          <p>32. From hence, if you go to some cheap theatre, the <lb/>
            actors on the stage are driven off by hisses, if they have <lb/>
            not taken the precaution to conciliate the lowest of the <lb/>
            people by gifts of money. And if there should be no <lb/>
            noise, then, in imitation of the people in the Taurio <lb/>
            Chersonese, they raise an outcry that the strangers ought <lb/>
            to be expelled (on whose assistance they have always <lb/>
            relied for their principal support), using foul and ridiculous <lb/>
            expressions; such as are greatly at variance with the <lb/>
            pursuits and inclinations of that populace of old, whose <lb/>
            many facetious and elegant expressions are recorded by <lb/>
            tradition and by history.</p>
          <p>33. For these clever gentlemen have now devised a new <lb/>
            method of expressing applause, which is, at every spectacle <lb/>
            to cry out to those who appear at the end, whether they <lb/>
            are couriers, huntsmen, or charioteers-in short, to the <lb/>
            whole body of actors, and to the magistrates, whether of <lb/>
            great or small importance, and even to nations, " It is to <note type="footnote">1 Compare Juvenal's description of the circumspect in his time <lb/>

            your school that he ought to go." But what he is to learn <lb/>
            there no one can explain.</p>
          <p>34. Among these men are many chiefly addicted to fat- <lb/>
            tening themselves up by gluttony, who, following the <lb/>
            scent of any delicate food, and the shrill voices of the <lb/>
            women who, from cockcrow, cry out with a shrill scream, <lb/>
            like so many peacocks, and gliding over the ground on <lb/>
            tiptoe, get an entrance into the halls, biting their nails <lb/>
            while the dishes are getting cool. Others fix their eyes <lb/>
            intently on the tainted meat which is being cooked, that <lb/>
            you might fancy Democritus, with a number of anatomists, <lb/>
            was gazing into the entrails of sacrificed victims, in order <lb/>
            to teach posterity how best to relieve internal pains.</p>
          <p>35. For the present this is enough to say of the affairs of <lb/>
            the city; now let us return to other events which various <lb/>
            circumstances brought to pass in the provinces.</p>

          <p>§ 1. IN the third consulship of the emperors a vast multi- <lb/>
            tude of Saxons burst forth, and having crossed the difficult <lb/>
            passage of the ocean, made towards the Roman frontier by <lb/>
            rapid marches, having before often battened on the slaughter <lb/>
            of our men. The first storm of this invasion fell upon the <lb/>
            count Nannenus, who was in command in that district, <lb/>
            being a veteran general of great merit and experience.</p>
          <p>2. He now engaged in battle with a host which <lb/>
            fought as if resolved on death; but when he found that <lb/>
            he had lost many of his men, and that he himself, having <lb/>
            been wounded, would be unequal to a succession of battles, <lb/>
            he sent word to the emperor of what was necessary, and <lb/>
            prevailed on him to send Severus, the commander of <lb/>
            the infantry, to aid him at this crisis.</p>
          <p>3. That general brought with him a sufficient body of <lb/>
            troops, and when he arrived in the country he so arrayed <lb/>
            his men that he terrified the barbarians, and threw them <lb/>
            into such disorder, even before any battle took place, that <lb/>
            they did not venture to engage him, but, panic-stricken at <lb/>
            the brilliant appearance of the standards and eagles, they <lb/>
            implored pardon and peace.</p>
          <p>4. The question of granting it to them was long dis- <lb/>
            cussed, with variety of opinion, between the Roman com- <pb n="494"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. T"/> <lb/>
            manders; but at last, as it seemed for the advantage of the <lb/>
            republic, a truce was granted, and after they had agreed, <lb/>
            to the conditions proposed, one of which was that they <lb/>
            should furnish a number of young men suitable for military <lb/>
            service, the Saxons were permitcd to withdraw, but without <lb/>
            their baggage, and to return to their own country.</p>
          <p>5. But when they, being now freed from all fear, were <lb/>
            preparing to return, some of our infantry were sent for- <lb/>
            ward, who secretly laid an ambuscade in a certain hidden <lb/>
            defile, from which they would easily be able to attack <lb/>
            them as they passed. But the matter turned out very <lb/>
            differently from what was expected.</p>
          <p>6. For some of our men being roused by the noise of the <lb/>
            Saxons, sprang from their ambush unseasonably; and <lb/>
            being suddenly seen, while they were hastening to esta- <lb/>
            blish themselves, the barbarians, with a terrible yell, put <lb/>
            them to flight. Presently, however, they halted in a <lb/>
            solid body, and being now driven to extremities, were <lb/>
            compelled to fight, though their strength was far from <lb/>
            great. The slaughter was great, and they would have <lb/>
            been all cut off to a man, had not a column of cuirassier <lb/>
            cavalry, which had been similarly placed in ambuscade at <lb/>
            a place where the road divided, in order there also to <lb/>
            attack the barbarians in their passage, been roused by the <lb/>
            uproar, and come up suddenly.</p>
          <p>7. Then the battle raged more fiercely, and with daunt- <lb/>
            less breasts the Romans pressed forward on all sides, and <lb/>
            with drawn swords hemmed in their enemies, and slew <lb/>
            them; nor did any of them ever return home, for not <lb/>
            one survived the slaughter. And although an impartial <lb/>
            judge will blame the action as treacherous and dis- <lb/>
            graceful, still if he weighs all the circumstances, he <lb/>
            will not regret that a mischievous band of robbers was <lb/>
            at length destroyed when such an opportunity presented <lb/>
            itself.</p>
          <p>8. After these affairs had been consummated thus suc- <lb/>
            cessfully, Valentinian revolving in his mind a great variety <lb/>
            of opinions, was filled with anxious solicitude, considering <lb/>
            and contemplating different measures for breaking the <lb/>
            pride of the Allemanni and their king Macrianus, who <lb/>
            were incessantly and furiously disturbing the republic <lb/>
            with their restless movements. <pb n="495"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 370.]"/> 9. For that ferocious nation, though from its earliest <lb/>
            origin diminished by various disasters, yet continually <lb/>
            revives, so that it might be considered as having been free <lb/>
            from attacks for many ages. At last, after the emperor <lb/>
            had considered and approved of one plan after another, it <lb/>
            was finally determined to excite the Burgundians to attack <lb/>
            them, the Burgundians being a warlike people, with an <lb/>
            immense population of active youths, and therefore for- <lb/>
            midable to all their neighbours.</p>
          <p>10. And the emperor sent repeated letters to their <lb/>
            chiefs by some silent and trustworthy messengers, to urge <lb/>
            them to attack the Allemanni at a certain fixed time, and <lb/>
            promising that he likewise would cross the Rhine with the <lb/>
            Roman legions, and attack their forces when in disorder, <lb/>
            and seeking to escape the unexpected attack of the Bur- <lb/>
            gundians.</p>
          <p>11. The letters of the emperor were received with joy, <lb/>
            for two reasons : first, because for many ages the Burgun- <lb/>
            dians had looked upon themselves as descended from the <lb/>
            Romans; and secondly, because they had continual quarrels <lb/>
            with the Allemanni about their salt-pits and their borders. <lb/>
            So they sent against them some picked battalions, which, <lb/>
            before the Roman soldiers could be collected, advanced <lb/>
            as far as the banks of the Rhine, and, while the emperor <lb/>
            was engaged in the construction of some fortresses, caused <lb/>
            the greatest alarm to our people.</p>
          <p>12. Therefore, after waiting for some time, Valentinian <lb/>
            having failed to come on the appointed day as promised, <lb/>
            and finding that none of his engagements were performed, <lb/>
            they sent ambassadors to the court, requesting assistance <lb/>
            to enable them to return in safety to their own land, and to <lb/>
            save them from exposing their rear unprotected to their <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>13. But when they perceived that their request was <lb/>
            virtually refused by the excuses and pleas for delay with <lb/>
            which it was received, they departed from the court in <lb/>
            sorrow and indignation; and when the chiefs of the Bur- <lb/>
            gundians received their report, they were very furious, <lb/>
            thinking they had been mocked; and so they slew all <lb/>
            their prisoners and returned to their native land.</p>
          <p>14. Among them their king is called by one general name <lb/>
            of “Hendinos," and according to a very ancient custom <pb n="496"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. VI"/> <lb/>
            of theirs, is deposed from his authority if under his go- <lb/>
            vernment the state meets with any disaster in war: or if <lb/>
            the earth fails to produce a good crop ; in the same way as <lb/>
            the Egyptians are accustomed to attribute calamities of <lb/>
            that kind to their rulers. The chief priest among the <lb/>
            Burgundians is called " the Sinistus." But he is irre- <lb/>
            movable and not exposed to any such dangers as the <lb/>
            kings.</p>
          <p>15. Taking advantage of this favourable opportunity, <lb/>
            Theodosius, the commander of the cavalry, passed through <lb/>
            the Tyrol and attacked the Allemanni, who, out of fear <lb/>
            of the Burgundians, had dispersed into their villages. <lb/>
            He slew a great number, and took some prisoners, whom <lb/>
            by the emperor's command he sent to Italy, where some <lb/>
            fertile districts around the Po were assigned to them, which <lb/>
            they still inhabit as tributaries.</p>

          <p>§ 1. LET us now migrate, as it were, to another quarter of <lb/>
            the world, and proceed to relate the distresses of Tripoli, <lb/>
            a province of Africa; distresses which, in my opinion, <lb/>
            even Justice herself must have lamented, and which burst <lb/>
            out rapidly like flames. I will now give an account both <lb/>
            of them and of their causes.</p>
          <p>2. The Asturians are barbarians lying on the frontier of <lb/>
            this province, a people always in readiness for rapid in- <lb/>
            vasions, accustomed to live on plunder and bloodshed ; <lb/>
            and who, after having been quiet for a while, now relapsed <lb/>
            into their natural state of disquiet, alleging the following <lb/>
            as the serious cause for their movements.</p>
          <p>3. One of their countrymen, by name Stachao, while <lb/>
            freely traversing our territories, as in time of peace, did <lb/>
            some things forbidden by the laws; the most flagrant <lb/>
            of his illegal acts being that he endeavoured, by every <lb/>
            kind of deceit and intrigue, to betray the province, as <lb/>
            was shown by the most undeniable evidence, for which <lb/>
            crime he was burnt to death.</p>
          <p>4. To avenge his death, the Asturians, claiming him <lb/>
            as their clansman, and affirming that he had been un- <lb/>
            justly condemned, burst forth from their own territory <lb/>
            like so many mad wild beasts during the reign of Jovian, <pb n="497"/>

            but fearing to approach close to Leptis, which was a city <lb/>
            with a numerous population, and fortified by strong walls, <lb/>
            they occupied the district around it, which is very fertile, <lb/>
            for three days : and having slain the agricultural popula- <lb/>
            tion on it, whom terror at their sudden inroad had deprived <lb/>
            of all spirit, or had driven to take refuge in paves, and <lb/>
            burnt a great quantity of furniture which could not be <lb/>
            carried off, they returned home, loaded with vast plunder, <lb/>
            taking with them as prisoner a man named Silva, the <lb/>
            principal noble' of Leptis, whom they found with his <lb/>
            family at his country house.</p>
          <p>5. The people of Leptis being terrified at this sudden <lb/>
            disaster, not wishing to incur the further calamities with <lb/>
            which the arrogance of the barbarians threatened them, <lb/>
            implored the protection of Count Romanus, who had <lb/>
            recently been promoted to the government of Africa. <lb/>
            But when he came at the head of an army, and received <lb/>
            their request to come to their immediate assistance in <lb/>
            their distress, he declared that he would not move a step <lb/>
            further unless abundant magazines and four thousand <lb/>
            camels were provided for his troops.</p>
          <p>6. At this answer the wretched citizens were stupefied, <lb/>
            and declared to him, that after the devastations and con- <lb/>
            flagrations to which they had been exposed, it was im <lb/>
            possible for them to make such exertions, even for thr <lb/>
            reparation of the cruel disasters which they had suffered ; <lb/>
            and, after waiting forty days there with vain pretences <lb/>
            and excuses, the count retired without attempting any <lb/>
            enterprise.</p>
          <p>7. The people of Tripoli, disappointed in their hopes, <lb/>
            and dreading the worst extremities, at their next council <lb/>
            day, appointed Severus and Flaccianus ambassadors to <lb/>
            carry to Valentinian some golden images of victory in <lb/>
            honour of his accession to the empire, and to state fully <lb/>
            and boldly to him the miserable distress of the province.</p>
          <p>8. When this step became known, Romanus sent a swift <lb/>
            horseman as a messenger to the master of the offices, <lb/>
            Remigius, his own kinsman and his partner in plunder, <lb/>
            bidding him take care, that by the emperor's decision, the <lb/>
            investigation into this matter should be committed to the <lb/>
            deputy and himself.</p>
          <p>9. The ambassadors arrived at the court, and having <note type="footnote">2 K </note> <pb n="498"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. VI"/> <lb/>
            of theirs, is deposed from his authority if under his go- <lb/>
            vernment the state meets with any disaster in war; or if <lb/>
            the earth fails to produce a good crop ; in the same way as <lb/>
            the Egyptians are accustomed to attribute calamities of <lb/>
            that kind to their rulers. The chief priest among the <lb/>
            Burgundians is called " the Sinistus." But he is irre- <lb/>
            movable and not exposed to any such dangers as the <lb/>
            kings.</p>
          <p>15. Taking advantage of this favourable opportunity, <lb/>
            Theodosius, the commander of the cavalry, passed through <lb/>
            the Tyrol and attacked the Allemanni, who, out of fear <lb/>
            of the Burgundians, had dispersed into their villages. <lb/>
            He slew a great number, and took some prisoners, whom <lb/>
            by the emperor's command he sent to Italy, where some <lb/>
            fertile districts around the Po were assigned to them, which <lb/>
            they still inhabit as tributaries.</p>

          <p>§ 1. LET us now migrate, as it were, to another quarter of <lb/>
            the world, and proceed to relate the distresses of Tripoli, <lb/>
            a province of Africa; distresses which, in my opinion, <lb/>
            even Justice herself must have lamented, and which burst <lb/>
            out rapidly like flames. I will now give an account both <lb/>
            of them and of their causes.</p>
          <p>2. The Asturians are barbarians lying on the frontier of <lb/>
            this province, a people always in readiness for rapid in- <lb/>
            vasions, accustomed to live on plunder and bloodshed; <lb/>
            and who, after having been quiet for a while, now relapsed <lb/>
            into their natural state of disquiet, alleging the following <lb/>
            as the serious cause for their movements.</p>
          <p>3. One of their countrymen, by name Stachao, while <lb/>
            freely traversing our territories, as in time of peace, did <lb/>
            some things forbidden by the laws; the most flagrant <lb/>
            of his illegal acts being that he endeavoured, by every <lb/>
            kind of deceit and intrigue, to betray the province, as <lb/>
            was shown by the most undeniable evidence, for which <lb/>
            crime he was burnt to death.</p>
          <p>4. To avenge his death, the Asturians, claiming him <lb/>
            as their clansman, and affirming that he had been un- <lb/>
            justly condemned, burst forth from their own territory <lb/>
            like so many mad wild beasts during the reign of Jovian, <pb n="499"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 370.1"/> <lb/>
            but fearing to approach close to Leptis, which was a city <lb/>
            with a numerous population, and fortified by strong walls, <lb/>
            they occupied the district around it, which is very fertile, <lb/>
            for three days : and having slain the agricultural popula- <lb/>
            tion on it, whom terror at their sudden inroad had deprived <lb/>
            of all spirit, or had driven to take refuge in paves, and <lb/>
            burnt a great quantity of furniture which could not be <lb/>
            carried off, they returned home, loaded with vast plunder, <lb/>
            taking with them as prisoner a man named Silva, the <lb/>
            principal noble' of Leptis, whom they found with his <lb/>
            family at his country house.</p>
          <p>5. The people of Leptis being terrified at this sudden <lb/>
            disaster, not wishing to incur the further calamities with <lb/>
            which the arrogance of the barbarians threatened them, <lb/>
            implored the protection of Count Romanus, who had <lb/>
            recently been promoted to the government of Africa. <lb/>
            But when he came at the head of an army, and received <lb/>
            their request to come to their immediate assistance in <lb/>
            their distress, he declared that he would not move a step <lb/>
            further unless abundant magazines and four thousand <lb/>
            camels were provided for his troops.</p>
          <p>6. At this answer the wretched citizens were stupefied, <lb/>
            and declared to him, that after the devastations and con- <lb/>
            flagrations to which they had been exposed, it was im <lb/>
            possible for them to make such exertions, even for the <lb/>
            reparation of the cruel disasters which they had suffered ; <lb/>
            and, after waiting forty days there with vain pretences <lb/>
            and excuses, the count retired without attempting any <lb/>
            enterprise.</p>
          <p>7. The people of Tripoli, disappointed in their hopes, <lb/>
            and dreading the worst extremities, at their next council <lb/>
            day, appointed Severus and Flaccianus ambassadors to <lb/>
            carry to Valentinian some golden images of victory in <lb/>
            honour of his accession to the empire, and to state fully <lb/>
            and boldly to him the miserable distress of the province.</p>
          <p>8. When this step became known, Romanus sent a swift <lb/>
            horseman as a messenger to the master of the offices, <lb/>
            Remigius, his own kinsman and his partner in plunder, <lb/>
            bidding him take care, that by the emperor's decision, the <lb/>
            investigation into this matter should be committed to the <lb/>
            deputy and himself.</p>
          <p>9. The ambassadors arrived at the court, and having <note type="footnote">2 K </note> <pb n="500"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. VI"/> <lb/>
            the palace, the chief part of the money for the soldiers <lb/>
            pay which he had brought over, and they obeyed him.</p>
          <p>18. So he, having been thus suddenly enriched, reached <lb/>
            Leptis; and that he might arrive at a knowledge of the <lb/>
            truth, he took with him to the districts that had been laid <lb/>
            waste, Erecthius and Aristomenes, two citizens of great <lb/>
            eloquence and reputation, who freely unfolded to him the <lb/>
            distress which their fellow-citizens and the inhabitants <lb/>
            of the adjacent districts had suffered. They showed him <lb/>
            everything openly ; and so he returned after seeing the <lb/>
            lamentable desolation of the province : and reproaching <lb/>
            Romanus for his "inactivity, he threatened to report to <lb/>
            the emperor an accurate statement of everything which <lb/>
            he had seen.</p>
          <p>19. He, inflamed with anger and indignation, retorted <lb/>
            that he also should soon make a report, that the man <lb/>
            who had been sent as an incorruptible secretary had con- <lb/>
            verted to his own uses all the money which had been <lb/>
            sent out as a donation to the soldiers.</p>
          <p>20. The consequence was that Palladius, being hampered <lb/>
            by the consciousness of his flagitious conduct, proceeded <lb/>
            from henceforth in harmony with Romanus, and when he <lb/>
            returned to court, he deceived Valentinian with atrocious <lb/>
            falsehoods, affirming that the citizens of Tripoli complained <lb/>
            without reason. Therefore he was sent back to Africa a <lb/>
            second time with Jovinus, the last of all the ambassadors <lb/>
            (for Pancratius had died at Treves), in order that he, in <lb/>
            conjunction with the deputy, might inquire into every- <lb/>
            thing connected with the second embassy. And besides <lb/>
            this, the emperor ordered the tongues of Erecthius and <lb/>
            Aristomenes to be cut out, because this same Palladius <lb/>
            had intimated that they made some malignant and disloyal <lb/>
            statements.</p>
          <p>21. The secretary, following the deputy, as had been <lb/>
            arranged, came to Tripoli. When his arrival was known, <lb/>
            Romanus sent one of his servants thither with all speed, <lb/>
            and Cæcilius, his assessor, who was a native of the pro- <lb/>
            vince ; and by their agency (whether they employed <lb/>
            bribery or deceit is doubtful) all the citizens were won <lb/>
            over to accuse Jovinus, vigorously asserting that he had <lb/>
            never issued any of the commands which he had reported <lb/>
            to the empelor ; carrying their iniquity to such a pitch, <pb n="501"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 370.]"/> <lb/>
            that Jovinus himself was compelled by them to confess, to <lb/>
            his own great danger, that he had made a false report to <lb/>
            the emperor.</p>
          <p>22. When these events were learnt from Palladius on <lb/>
            his return, Valentinian, being always inclined to severe <lb/>
            measures, commanded the execution of Jovinus as the <lb/>
            author of such a report, and of Cælestinus, Concordius, <lb/>
            and Lucius, as privy to it, and partners in it. He also <lb/>
            commanded Ruricius, the president, to be put to death for <lb/>
            falsehood ; the charge against him being aggravated by the <lb/>
            circumstance that his report contained some violent and <lb/>
            intemperate expressions.</p>
          <p>23. Ruricius was executed at Sitifis ; the rest were con- <lb/>
            demned at Utica by the sentence of the deputy Crescens. <lb/>
            But before the death of the ambassadors, Flaccianus, while <lb/>
            being examined by the deputy and the count, and while re- <lb/>
            solutely defending his own safety, was assailed with abuse, <lb/>
            and then attacked with loud outcries and violence by the <lb/>
            angry soldiers, and was nearly killed; the charge which <lb/>
            they made against him being that the cause which had <lb/>
            prevented the people of Tripoli from being defended was, <lb/>
            that they had refused to furnish necessaries for the use of <lb/>
            any expedition.</p>
          <p>24. On this account he was thrown into prison, till the <lb/>
            emperor could be consulted on his case, and should decide <lb/>
            what ought to be done; but his gaolers were tampered <lb/>
            with, as was believed, and he escaped from prison and fled <lb/>
            to Rome, where he concealed himself for some time, till his <lb/>
            death. '</p>
          <p>25. In consequence of this memorable catastrophe, Tri- <lb/>
            poli, which had been often harassed by external and do- <lb/>
            mestic calamities, brought forward no further accusations <lb/>
            against those who had left it undefended, knowing that the <lb/>
            eternal eye of justice was awake, as well as the avenging <lb/>
            furies of the ambassadors and the president. And a long <lb/>
            time afterwards the following event took place :—Palladius, <lb/>
            having been dismissed from the military service, and <lb/>
            stript of all that nourished his pride, retired into private <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>26. And when Theodosius, that magnificent commander <lb/>
            of armies, came into Africa to put down Firmus, who <lb/>
            was entertaining some pernicious designs, and, as he <pb n="502"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXVIII. CH. VI."/> <lb/>
            was ordered, began to examine the moveable effects of <lb/>
            Romanus, he found among his papers a letter of a certain <lb/>
            person named Meterius, containing this passage: "Mete- <lb/>
            rius, to his lord and patron, Romanus;" and at the end of <lb/>
            the letter many expressions unconnected with its general <lb/>
            subject. " Palladius, who has been cashiered, salutes you. <lb/>
            He who says he was cashiered for no other reason than that <lb/>
            in the case of the people of Tripoli he made a false report <lb/>
            to the sacred ears."</p>
          <p>27. When this letter was sent to the court and read, <lb/>
            Meterius was arrested by order of Valentinian, and con- <lb/>
            fessed that the letter was his writing. Therefore Palladius <lb/>
            also was ordered to appear, and reflecting on all the crimes <lb/>
            lie had committed, while at a halting place on the road, <lb/>
            he watched an opportunity afforded him by the absence <lb/>
            of his guards, as soon as it got dark (for. as it was a fes- <lb/>
            tival of the Christian religion, they passed the whole night <lb/>
            in the church), and hanged himself.</p>
          <p>- 28. The news of this propitious event-the death of <lb/>
            the principal cause of their sad troubles-being known, <lb/>
            Erecthius and Aristomenes, who when they first heard that <lb/>
            their tongues were ordered to be cut out for sedition, <lb/>
            had escaped, now issued from their hiding-places. And <lb/>
            when the emperor Gratian was informed of the wicked <lb/>
            deceit that had been practised (for by this time Valen- <lb/>
            tinian was dead), their fears vanished, and they were sent <lb/>
            to have their cause heard before Hesperus the proconsul <lb/>
            and Flavian the deputy, men whose justice was supported <lb/>
            by the righteous authority of the emperor, and who, after <lb/>
            putting Cæcilius to the torture, learnt from his clear con- <lb/>
            fession that he himself had persuaded the citizens to bring <lb/>
            false accusations against the ambassadors. These actions <lb/>
            were followed by a report which gave the fullest possible <lb/>
            account of all that had taken place, to which no answer <lb/>
            was given.</p>
          <p>29. And that the whole story might want nothing of <lb/>
            tragic interest, the following occurrence also took place <lb/>
            after the curtain had fallen. Romanus went to court, <lb/>
            taking with him Cæcilius, with the intent to accuse the <lb/>
            judges as having been unduly biassed in favour of the <lb/>
            province; and being received graciously by Merobaudes, <lb/>
            he demanded that some more necessary witnesses should <pb n="503"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n=". A.D. 371.] "/>be summoned. And when they had come to Milan, and <lb/>
            had shown by proofs which seemed correct, though these <lb/>
            were false, that they had been falsely accused, they were <lb/>
            acquitted, and returned home. Valentinian was still <lb/>
            alive, when after these events which we have related, <lb/>
            Remigius also retired from public life, and afterwards <lb/>
            hanged himself, as we shall relate in the proper place.</p>

            being full of cruelty and arrogance from the confidence <lb/>
            engendered by his former battles, having completed his <lb/>
            army to its full number, and greatly strengthened it, sent <lb/>
            out a force of cuirassiers, archers, and mercenary troops, <lb/>
            to make an invasion of our territories.</p>
          <p>2. Against this force, Count Trajan and Vadomarius, the <lb/>
            ex-king of the Allemanni, advanced with a mighty army, <lb/>
            having been enjoined by the emperor to remember his <lb/>
            orders to act on the defensive rather than on the offensive <lb/>
            against the Persians. <pb n="504"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH."/> 3. When they arrived at Vagabanta, a place well suited <lb/>
            for the manoeuvres of the legions, they supported against <lb/>
            their will a rapid charge which was made upon them by <lb/>
            the squadrons of the enemy, and retreated with the design <lb/>
            not to be the first to slay any of the hostile soldiers, and <lb/>
            not to be looked upon as guilty of having broken the treaty. <lb/>
            At last, under the pressure of extreme necessity, they came <lb/>
            to an engagement with the barbarians, and after having <lb/>
            slain a great number of them, were victorious.</p>
          <p>4. During the cessation of regular operations which <lb/>
            ensued, several slight skirmishes occurred through the <lb/>
            impatience of both armies, which ended with different <lb/>
            results; and at last the summer ended, and a truce was <lb/>
            agreed to by common consent, and the two armies se- <lb/>
            parated, though the generals were violently inflamed <lb/>
            against each other. The king of Parthia, intending to <lb/>
            pass the winter at Ctesiphon, returned to his own home, <lb/>
            and the Roman emperor went to Antioch; and while he <lb/>
            tarried there, in complete security from foreign enemies, <lb/>
            he had very nearly perished through domestic treachery, <lb/>
            as shall be related in the coming narrative.</p>
          <p>5. A certain Procopius, a restless man, at all times <lb/>
            covetous and fond of disturbances, had persuaded Anato- <lb/>
            lius and Spudasius, officers about the palace, who had <lb/>
            been ordered to restore what they had appropriated from <lb/>
            the treasury, to bring a plot against the Count Fortuna- <lb/>
            tianus, who was especially obnoxious as being represented <lb/>
            to be the principal demander of this restitution. He, <lb/>
            being a man of naturally harsh temper, was thereupon <lb/>
            inflamed almost to insanity, and exercising the authority <lb/>
            of the office which he filled, he delivered up to trial before <lb/>
            the tribunal of the prefect a person of the lowest birth, <lb/>
            named Palladius, for being a poisoner in the train of <lb/>
            Anatolius and Spudasius; Helidorus, also an interpreter <lb/>
            of the Fates from the events which happened at any one's <lb/>
            birth ; with the intent that they should be compelled by <lb/>
            torture to relate all that they knew.</p>
          <p>6. And when they came with rigid scrutiny to inquire <lb/>
            into what had been done or attempted, Palladius boldly <lb/>
            exclaimed, that the matters now under investigation were <lb/>
            trivial, and such as might well be passed over; that he <lb/>
            himself, if he might be allowed to speak, could bring <pb n="505"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            forward some circumstances both formidable and more <lb/>
            important, which, having been prepared with great exer- <lb/>
            tion, would throw everything into confusion, if they <lb/>
            were not provided against beforehand. Being ordered <lb/>
            to explain without fear all he knew, he made a deposition <lb/>
            at great length, affirming that Fidustius the president, and <lb/>
            Pergamius and Irenæus, had secretly learnt, by the detest- <lb/>
            able arts of magic, the name of the person who should <lb/>
            become emperor after Valens.</p>
          <p>7. Fidustius was at once arrested (for he happened by <lb/>
            chance be on the spot), and being brought secretly before <lb/>
            the emperor, when confronted with the informer, he did <lb/>
            not attempt by any denial to throw a doubt on what was <lb/>
            already revealed, but laid open the whole of this wretched <lb/>
            plot; confessing in plain words, that he himself, with <lb/>
            Hilarius and Patricius, men skilled in the art of sooth- <lb/>
            saying, of whom Hilarius had filled high offices in the <lb/>
            palace, had held consultations about the future possessors <lb/>
            of the empire; that by secret arts they had searched into the <lb/>
            Fates, which had revealed to them the name of an excellent <lb/>
            emperor, admonishing them at the same time that a mise- <lb/>
            rable end awaited the investigators of these omens.1</p>
          <p>8. And while they were hesitating, unable to decide <lb/>
            who at that moment was superior to all other men in <lb/>
            vigour of mind, Theodorus appeared to excel all the <lb/>
            rest, a man who had already arrived at the second class of <lb/>
            secretaries. And in truth he deserved the opinion which <lb/>
            they entertained of him; for he was descended from an <lb/>
            ancient and illustrious family in Gaul; he had been <lb/>
            liberally educated from his earliest childhood; he was <lb/>
            eminent for modesty, prudence, humanity, courtesy, and <lb/>
            literature. He always appeared superior to the post or <lb/>
            place which he was filling, and was equally popular <lb/>
            among high and low, and he was nearly the only man <lb/>
            whose tongue was never unbridled, but who always re- <lb/>
            flected on what he was going to say, yet without ever <lb/>
            being restrained by any fear of danger.</p>
          <p>9. Fidustius, who had been tortured so severely that he <lb/>
            was at the point of death, added further, that all that <note type="footnote">1 For an account of this incantation, see Gibbon, Bohn's edition! <lb/>
            vol. iii., p. 75, note. </note> <pb n="506"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH.,"/> <lb/>
            he had now stated he had communicated to Theodorus by <lb/>
            .the intervention of Eucærius, a man of great literary <lb/>
            accomplishments, and of very high reputation; indeed, he <lb/>
            had a little time before governed Asia with the title of <lb/>
            proprefect.</p>
          <p>10. Eucærius was now thrown into prison; and when <lb/>
            a report of all that had taken place was, as usual, laid <lb/>
            before the emperor, his amazing ferocity burst out more <lb/>
            unrestrainedly than ever, like a burning firebrand, being <lb/>
            fed by the base adulation of many persons, and especially <lb/>
            of Modestus, at that time prefect of the prætorium.</p>
          <p>11. He, being every day alarmed at the prospect of a <lb/>
            successor, addressed himself to the task of conciliating <lb/>
            Valens, who was of a rustic and rather simple character, <lb/>
            by tickling him with all kinds of disguised flattery and <lb/>
            caresses, calling his uncouth language and rude expres- <lb/>
            sions " flowers of Cieeronian eloquence.” Indeed, to raise <lb/>
            his vanity higher, he would have promised to raise him <lb/>
            up to the stars if he had desired it.</p>
          <p>12. So Theodorus also was ordered to be arrested with <lb/>
            all speed at Constantinople, to which city he had repaired <lb/>
            on some private business, and to be brought to the court. <lb/>
            A.nd while he was on his way back, in consequence of <lb/>
            various informations and trials which were carried on <lb/>
            day and night, numbers of people were dragged away <lb/>
            from the most widely separated countries—men eminent <lb/>
            for their birth and high authority.</p>
          <p>13. The public prisons, being now completely filled, <lb/>
            could no longer contain the crowds which were confined <lb/>
            in them, while private houses were equally crammed to <lb/>
            suffocation, for nearly every one was a prisoner, and every <lb/>
            man shuddered to think when it might be his turn or <lb/>
            that of his nearest relations.</p>
          <p>14. At last Theodorus himself arrived, in deep mourn- <lb/>
            ing, and half dead through fear. And while he was kept <lb/>
            concealed in some obscure place in the vicinity, and all <lb/>
            things were being got ready for his intended examina- <lb/>
            tion, the trumpet of civil discord suddenly sounded.</p>
          <p>• 15. And because that man who knowingly passes over <lb/>
            facts appears to be an equally unfaithful historian with <lb/>
            him who invents circumstances which never happened, <lb/>
            we do not deny (what, in fact, is quite undoubted) that the <pb n="507"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            safety of Valens had often before been attacked by secret <lb/>
            machinations, and was now in the greatest possible danger. <lb/>
            And that a sword, as one may say, was presented to his <lb/>
            throat by the officers of the army, and only averted by <lb/>
            Fate, which was reserving him for lamentable misfortunes <lb/>
            'in Thrace.</p>
          <p>16. For one day as he was taking a gentle nap in the <lb/>
            afternoon, in a shady spot between Antioch and Seleucia, <lb/>
            he was attacked by Sallust, at that time an officer of the <lb/>
            Scutarii; and on various other occasions he was plotted <lb/>
            against by many other persons, from whose treacherous <lb/>
            .designs he only escaped because the precise moment of <lb/>
            his death had been determined at his birth by Destiny.</p>
          <p>17. As sometimes happened in the times of the em- <lb/>
            perors Commodus and Severus, whose safety was con- <lb/>
            tinnally assailed with extreme violence, so that after many <lb/>
            various dangers at the hands of their countrymen, the one <lb/>
            was dangerously wounded by a dagger in the amphi- <lb/>
            theatre, as he entered it for the purpose of witnessing <lb/>
            an entertainment, by a senator named Quintianus, a man <lb/>
            of wicked ambition. The other, when extremely old, was <lb/>
            assailed as he was lying in his bed-chamber, by a cen- <lb/>
            turion of the name of Saturninus, who was instigated to <lb/>
            the act by Plautian the prefect, and would have been <lb/>
            killed if his youthful son had not come to his assistance.</p>
          <p>18. Valens, therefore, was to be excused for taking <lb/>
            every precaution to defend his life, which traitors were <lb/>
            endeavouring to take. But it was an unpardonable fault in <lb/>
            him that, through tyrannical pride, he, with haste and with <lb/>
            inconsiderate and malicious persecution, inflicted the same <lb/>
            severities on the innocent as on the guilty, making no <lb/>
            distinction between their deserts ; so that while the judges <lb/>
            were still doubting about their guilt, the emperor had <lb/>
            made up his mind about their punishment, and men learnt <lb/>
            that they were condemned before they knew that they <lb/>
            were suspected.</p>
          <p>19. But his obstinate resolution was strengthened since <lb/>
            it. received -a spur from his own avarice, and that also of <lb/>
            those who at that time were about the palace, and were <lb/>
            constantly seeking new sources of gain; while if on any <lb/>
            rare occasion any mention was made of humanity, they <lb/>
            styled if slackness; and by their bloodthirsty Batteries <pb n="508"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH."/> <lb/>
            perverted the resolution of a 'man who bore men's lives <lb/>
            on the tip of his tongue, guiding it in the worst direction, <lb/>
            and assailing everything with unseemly confusion, while <lb/>
            seeking to accomplish the total ruin of the most opulent <lb/>
            houses.</p>
          <p>20. For Valens was a man who was especially exposed <lb/>
            and open to the approaches of treacherous advisers, being <lb/>
            tainted with two vices of a most mischievous character: <lb/>
            one, that when he was ashamed of being angry, that very <lb/>
            shame only rendered him the more intolerably furious; <lb/>
            and secondly, that the stories which, with the easiness of <lb/>
            access of a private individual, he heard in secret whispers, <lb/>
            he took at once to be true and certain, because his haughty <lb/>
            idea of the imperial dignity did not permit him to examine <lb/>
            whether they were true or not.</p>
          <p>21. The consequence was that, under an appearance of <lb/>
            clemency, numbers of innocent men were driven from their <lb/>
            homes, and sent into exile: and their property was con- <lb/>
            fiscated to the public treasury, and then seized by himself <lb/>
            for his private uses; so that the owners, after their con- <lb/>
            demnation, had no means of subsistence but such as they <lb/>
            could beg; and were worn out with the distresses of the <lb/>
            most miserable poverty. For fear of which that wise old <lb/>
            poet Theognis advises a man to rush even into the sea.'</p>
          <p>22. And even if any one should grant that these sen- <lb/>
            tences were in some instances right, yet it surely was an <lb/>
            odious severity; and from this conduct of his it was re- <lb/>
            marked that the maxim was sound which says, “that <lb/>
            there is no sentence more cruel than that which, while <lb/>
            seeming to spare, is still harsh."</p>
          <p>23. Therefore all the chief magistrates and the prefect <lb/>
            of the prætorium, to whom the conduct of these investiga- <lb/>
            tions was committed, having been assembled together, the <note type="footnote">1 The lines of Theognis are-</note> <figure type="illustration">

              racks were got ready, and the weights, and lead, and <lb/>
              scourges, and other engines of torture. And all places re- <lb/>
              sounded with the horrors of the cruel voice of the execu- <lb/>
              tioners, and the cries uttered amid the clanking of chains: <lb/>
              " Hold him !" " Shut him up !” " Squeeze him!" " Hide <lb/>
              him!” and other yells uttered by the ministers of those <lb/>
              hateful duties.</p>
          <p>24. And since we saw numbers condemned to death after <lb/>
            having endured cruel torture, everything being thrown <lb/>
            into complete confusion as if in perfect darkness, because <lb/>
            the complete recollection of everything which then took <lb/>
            place has in some degree escaped me, I will mention <lb/>
            briefly what I do remember.</p>
          <p>25. Among the first who were summoned before the <lb/>
            bench, was Pergamius, who, as we have already mentioned, <lb/>
            was betrayed by Palladius, who accused him of having <lb/>
            arrived at a foreknowledge of certain events through <lb/>
            wicked incantations. As he was a man of exceeding elo- <lb/>
            quence, and very likely to say dangerous things, and after <lb/>
            some very trivial interrogatories had been put to him, <lb/>
            seeing that the judges were hesitating what questions to <lb/>
            put first and what last, he began himself to harangue them <lb/>
            boldly, and shouting out the names with a loud voice and <lb/>
            without any cessation, he named several thousand persons <lb/>
            as accomplices with himself, demanding that people should <lb/>
            be brought forward to be accused of great crimes from <lb/>
            every part of the empire, up to the very shores of the great <lb/>
            Atlantic. The task that he thus seemed-to be putting <lb/>
            together for them was too arduous; so they comdemned <lb/>
            him to death ; and afterwards put whole troops of others to <lb/>
            death, till they came to the case of Theodorus, which <lb/>
            was regarded, after the manner of the Olympian games, as <lb/>
            a crowning of the whole.</p>
          <p>26. The same day, among other circumstances, this <lb/>
            melancholy event took place, that Salia, who a little while <lb/>
            before had been the chief treasurer in Thrace, when he <lb/>
            was about to be brought out of his prison to have his cause <lb/>
            heard, and was putting on his shoes, as if suddenly over- <lb/>
            whelmed by the dread of his impending destruction, died <lb/>
            in the hands of his gaolers.</p>
          <p>27. So when the court was opened, and when the judges <lb/>
            exhibited the decrees of the law, though, in accordance <pb n="510"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. "/> <lb/>
            with the desire of the emperor, they moderated the severity <lb/>
            of the charges brought before them, one general alarm <lb/>
            seized all people. For Valens had now so wholly departed <lb/>
            from justice, and had become so accomplished in the inflic <lb/>
            tion of injury, that he was like a wild beast in an amphi- <lb/>
            theatre ; and if any one who had been brought before the <lb/>
            court escaped, he grew furious beyond all restraint.</p>
          <p>28. Presently Patricius and Hilarius were brought <lb/>
            before the court, and were ordered to enumerate the whole <lb/>
            series of their actions : and as they differed a little at the <lb/>
            beginning of their statement, they were both put to the <lb/>
            torture, and presently the tripod which they had used was <lb/>
            brought in ;1 and they, being reduced now to the greatest <lb/>
            extremity, gave a true account of the whole affair from <lb/>
            the very beginning. And first Hilarius spoke as follows :—</p>
          <p>29. " We did construct, most noble judges, under most <lb/>
            unhappy auspices, this little unfortunate tripod which yon <lb/>
            see, in the likeness of that at Delphi, making it of laurel <lb/>
            twigs: and having consecrated it with imprecations of <lb/>
            mysterious verses, and with many decorations and repeated <lb/>
            ceremonies, in all proper order, we at last moved it; and the <lb/>
            manner in which we moved it as often as we consulted it <lb/>
            upon any secret affair, was as follows :-</p>
          <p>30. “It was placed in the middle of a building, carefully <lb/>
            purified on all sides by Arabian perfumes; and a plain <lb/>
            round dish was placed upon it, made of different metals. <lb/>
            On the outer side of which the four-and-twenty letters of <lb/>
            the alphabet were engraved with great skill, being sepa- <lb/>
            rated from one another by distances measured with great <lb/>
            precision.</p>
          <p>31. " Then a person clothed in linen garments, and shod <lb/>
            with slippers of linen, with a small linen cap on his head, <lb/>
            bearing in his hand sprigs of vervain as a plant of good <lb/>
            omen. in set verses, propitiated the deity who presides <lb/>
            over foreknowledge, and thus took his station by this dish, <lb/>
            according to all the rules of the ceremony. Then over the <lb/>
            tripod he balanced a ring which he held suspended by a <lb/>
            flaxen thread of extreme fineness, and which had also <lb/>
            been consecrated with mystic ceremonies. And as, this <lb/>
            ring touched and bounded off from the different letters <lb/>
            which still preserved their distances distinct, he made <note type="footnote">1 For the purposes of divination. </note> <pb n="511"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D 371.J"/> <lb/>
            with these letters, by the order in which he touched them; <lb/>
            verses in the heroic metre, corresponding to the questions <lb/>
            which we had asked; the verses being also perfect in <lb/>
            metre and rhythm; like the answers of the Pythia which <lb/>
            are so celebrated, or those given by the oracles of the <lb/>
            Branchidse.</p>
          <p>32. " Then, when we asked who should succeed the <lb/>
            present emperor, since it was said that it would be a person <lb/>
            of universal accomplishments, the ring bounded up, and <lb/>
            touched the two syllables <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΘΕΟ</foreign>; and then as it added <lb/>
            another letter, some one of the bystanders exclaimed that <lb/>
            Theodorus was pointed out by the inevitable decrees of <lb/>
            Fate. We asked. no further questions concerning the <lb/>
            matter: for it seemed quite plain to us that he was the <lb/>
            man who was intended."</p>
          <p>33. And when he had with this exactness laid the know- <lb/>
            ledge of this affair open to the eyes of the judges, he added <lb/>
            with great benevolence, that Theodorus knew nothing of <lb/>
            the matter. When after this they were asked whether the <lb/>
            oracles which they had consulted had given them any fore- <lb/>
            knowledge of their present sufferings, they repeated these <lb/>
            well-known verses which clearly pronounce that this em- <lb/>
            ployment of investigating those high secrets would cost <lb/>
            them their lives. Nevertheless, they added, that the Furies <lb/>
            equally threatened the judges themselves, and also the <lb/>
            emperor, breathing only slaughter and conflagration against <lb/>
            them. It will be enough to quote the three final verses. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_02_fig7.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>“Thy blood shall not fall unaveng'd on earth ; <lb/>
            The fierce Tisiphone still keeps her eye <lb/>
            Fixed on thy slayers ; arming evil fate <lb/>
            Against them when arrayed on Mima's plain <lb/>
            They seek to stem the tide of horrid war."</p>
          <p>When he had read these verses they were both tortured <lb/>
            with great severity, and carried away dead.</p>
          <p>34. Afterwards, that the whole workshop where the <lb/>
            wickedness had been wrought might be disclosed to the <lb/>
            world, a great number of men of rank were brought in <lb/>
            among whom were some of the original promoters of the <lb/>
            whole business. And when each, regarding nothing but <pb n="512"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="IBit. XXIX. CH. I."/> <lb/>
            his own personal safety, sought to turn the destruction <lb/>
            which menaced himself in some other quarter, by the per- <lb/>
            mission of the judges, Thcodorus began to address them. <lb/>
            First of all, he humbled himself with entreaties for pardon; <lb/>
            then being compelled to answer more precisely to the <lb/>
            charges alleged, he proved that he, after having been in- <lb/>
            formed of the whole affair by Eucærius, was prevented by <lb/>
            him from repeating it to the emperor, as he had often <lb/>
            attempted to do : since Eucærius affirmed that what did not <lb/>
            spring from a lawless desire of reigning, but from some <lb/>
            fixed law of inevitable fate, would surely come to pass.</p>
          <p>35. Eucærius, when cruelly tortured, confirmed this <lb/>
            statement by his own confession. His own letters were <lb/>
            employed to convict Theodorus, letters which he had <lb/>
            written to Hilarius full of indirect hints, which showed that <lb/>
            he had conceived a sure hope of such events from the pro- <lb/>
            phecies of the soothsayers; and was not inclined to delay, <lb/>
            but was looking for an opportunity of attaining the object <lb/>
            of his desires.</p>
          <p>36. After the establishment of these facts, the prisoners <lb/>
            were removed; and Eutropius, who at that time was <lb/>
            governing Asia with the rank of proconsul, having been <lb/>
            involved in the accusation as having been a partisan of <lb/>
            theirs, was nevertheless acquitted; being exculpated by <lb/>
            Pasiphilus the philosopher, who, though cruelly tortured <lb/>
            to make him implicate Eutropius by a wicked lie, could <lb/>
            not be moved from his vigorous resolution and fortitude.</p>
          <p>37. To that was added the philosopher Simonides, a <lb/>
            young man, but the most rigidly virtuous of all men in <lb/>
            our time. An information had been laid against him as <lb/>
            having been made aware of what was going on by Fi- <lb/>
            dustius, as he saw that his cause depended, not on its <lb/>
            truth, but on the will of one man, avowed that he had <lb/>
            known all that was alleged, but had forborne to mention it <lb/>
            out of regard for his character for constancy.</p>
          <p>38. When all these matters had been minutely inquired <lb/>
            into, the emperor, in answer to the question addressed <lb/>
            to him by the judges, ordered them all to be condemned <lb/>
            and at once executed: and it was not without shuddering <lb/>
            that the vast populace beheld the mournful spectacle; <lb/>
            filling the whole air with lamentations (since they looked <lb/>
            on the misery of each individual as threatening the whole <pb n="513"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            community with a similar fate) when the whole number <lb/>
            of accused persons, except Simon ides, were executed in a <lb/>
            melancholy manner. Simonides being reserved to be <lb/>
            burnt alive by the express command of the savage judge, <lb/>
            who was enraged at his dignified constancy.</p>
          <p>39. And he, abandoning life as an imperious mistress, <lb/>
            and defying the sudden destruction thus coming on him, was <lb/>
            burnt without giving any sign of shrinking; imitating, in <lb/>
            his death, the philosopher Peregrinus, surnamed Proteus, <lb/>
            who having determined to quit the world, at the quin- <lb/>
            quennial games of Olympia, in the sight of all Greece, <lb/>
            mounted a funeral pile which he had built himself, and <lb/>
            was there burnt alive.</p>
          <p>40. After his death, on the ensuing days a vast multi- <lb/>
            tude of almost all ranks, whose names it would be too <lb/>
            arduous a task to enumerate, being convicted by calumnious <lb/>
            accusations, were despatched by the executioners, after <lb/>
            having been first exhausted by every description of torture. <lb/>
            Some were put to death without a moment's breathing-time <lb/>
            or delay, while the question was still being asked whether <lb/>
            they deserved to be punished at all; in fact, men were <lb/>
            slaughtered like sheep in all directions.</p>
          <p>41. After this, innumerable quantities of papers, and <lb/>
            many heaps of volumes were collected, and burnt under <lb/>
            the eyes of the judges, having been taken out of various <lb/>
            houses as unlawful books; in order to lessen the unpo- <lb/>
            pularity arising from so many executions, though in fact, <lb/>
            the greater part of them were books teaching various kinds <lb/>
            of liberal accomplishments, or books of law.</p>
          <p>42. Not long afterwards, Maximus, the celebrated phi- <lb/>
            losopher, a man of vast reputation for learning, from <lb/>
            whose eloquent discourses the emperor Julian derived his <lb/>
            great learning and wisdom, being accused of having been <lb/>
            acquainted with the verses of the oracle mentioned above, <lb/>
            and confessing that he had known something of them, but <lb/>
            that he had not divulged what he knew, as being bound to <lb/>
            keep silence out of consideration for his promise; but <lb/>
            adding that he had of his own accord predicted that those <lb/>
            who had consulted the oracle would perish by public exe- <lb/>
            cution, was conducted to Ephesus, his native place, and <lb/>
            here beheaded. And thus by his own forfeiture of life, he <lb/>
            found that the injustice of a judge is the worst of all crimes. <note type="footnote"> 2 L </note> <pb n="514"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CII. II."/> <lb/>
            43. Diogenes, too, a man of noble family, great forensic <lb/>
            eloquence and pre-eminent courtesy, who had some time <lb/>
            before been governor of Bithynia, being entangled in the <lb/>
            toils of wicked falsehood, was put to death in order to <lb/>
            afford a pretext for seizing on his ample patrimony.</p>
          <p>44. Alypius also, who had been governor of Britain, <lb/>
            a man of most delightful mildness of temper, and who <lb/>
            had lived a tranquil and retired life (since even against <lb/>
            such as him did Injustice stretch forth her hands), was <lb/>
            involved in the greatest misfortune ; and was accused, <lb/>
            with Hierocles his son, a youth of most amiable disposition, <lb/>
            of having been guilty of poisoning, on the unsupported <lb/>
            information of a low fellow named Diogenes, who had <lb/>
            been tortured with extreme severity to force him to <lb/>
            make confessions which might please the emperor, or <lb/>
            rather, which might please his accuser. When his limbs <lb/>
            could no longer endure their punishment, he was burnt <lb/>
            alive ; and Alypius, after having had his property confis- <lb/>
            cated, was condemned to banishment, though by an extra- <lb/>
            ordinary piece of good fortune he received back his son <lb/>
            after he had been condemned, and had actually been led <lb/>
            out to suffer a miserable death.</p>

          <p>§ 1. DURING all this time, Palladius, the original cause of <lb/>
            these miseries, whom we have already spoken of as <lb/>
            having been arrested by Fortunatianus, being, from the <lb/>
            lowness of his original condition, a man ready to fall into <lb/>
            every kind of wickedness, by heaping one murder on <lb/>
            another diffused mourning and lamentation over the whole <lb/>
            empire.</p>
          <p>2. For being allowed to name any persons he chose, <lb/>
            without distinction of rank, as men contaminated by the <lb/>
            practice of forbidden arts, like a huntsman who has <lb/>
            learnt to mark the secret tracks of wild beasts, he en- <lb/>
            closed many victims within his wretched toils, some as <lb/>
            being polluted with a knowledge of poisonings, others as <lb/>
            accomplices of those who were guilty of treason.</p>
          <p>3. And that wives too might not have leisure to weep over <lb/>
            the miseries of their husbands, officers were sent at once to <pb n="515"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            seal up the house of any one who was condemned, and <lb/>
            who, while examining all the furniture, slipped in among <lb/>
            it old women's incantations, or ridiculous love-tokens, con- <lb/>
            trived to bring destruction on the innocent; and then, <lb/>
            when these things were mentioned before the bench, <lb/>
            where neither law, nor religion, nor equity were present <lb/>
            to separate truth from falsehood, those whom they thus <lb/>
            accused, though utterly void of offence, without any distinc- <lb/>
            tion, youths, and decrepit old men, without being heard <lb/>
            in their defence, found their property confiscated, and were <lb/>
            hurried off to execution in litters.</p>
          <p>4. One of the consequences in the eastern provinces was, <lb/>
            that from fear of similar treatment, people burnt all their <lb/>
            libraries; so great was the terror which seized upon all <lb/>
            ranks. For, to cut my story short, at that time all of us <lb/>
            crawled about as if in Cimmerian darkness, in the same <lb/>
            kind of dread as the guest of Dionysius of Sicily; who, <lb/>
            while feasting at a banquet more irksome than famine <lb/>
            itself, saw a sword suspended over his head by a single <lb/>
            horsehair. ,</p>
          <p>5. There was a man named Bassianus, of most noble <lb/>
            family, a secretary, and eminently distinguished for his <lb/>
            military services, who, on a charge of having entertained <lb/>
            ambitious projects, and of having sought oracles concern- <lb/>
            ing their issue, though he declared he had only consulted <lb/>
            the oracles to know the sex of his next child, was saved <lb/>
            indeed from death by the great interest made for him by <lb/>
            his relations who protected him; but he was stripped of <lb/>
            all his splendid inheritance.</p>
          <p>6. Amid all this destruction and ruin, Heliodorus, that <lb/>
            hellish colleague of Palladius in bringing about these <lb/>
            miseries (being what the common people call a mathema- <lb/>
            tician), having been admitted into the secret conferences <lb/>
            of the imperial palace, and been tempted by every kind <lb/>
            of caress and cajolery to relate all he knew or could <lb/>
            invent, was putting forth his fatal stings.</p>
          <p>7. For he was carefully feasted on the most delicate <lb/>
            food, and furnished with large sums of money to give to <lb/>
            his concubines; and he strutted about in every direction <lb/>
            with a pompous, haughty countenance, and was universally <lb/>
            dreaded. Being the more confident and arrogant, because <lb/>
            as he was high chamberlain, he could go constantly and <pb n="516"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B. XXIX. CH. no "/>openly to the brothels, in which, as he desired, he was <lb/>
            freely entertained, while revealing the edicts of the <lb/>
            " parental guardian of the state," which were destined to <lb/>
            be disastrous to many.</p>
          <p>8. And through his means, as an advocate at the bar, <lb/>
            Valens was instructed beforehand in what would most <lb/>
            contribute to success-what to place in the first part of his <lb/>
            speech, and with what figures, and what inventions to work <lb/>
            up splendid passages.</p>
          <p>9. And as it would take a long time to enumerate all <lb/>
            the devices of that villain, I will mention this one only, <lb/>
            which, in its rash boldness, assailed the very pillars of the <lb/>
            patrician dignity. As I have said before, he was raised to <lb/>
            exceeding arrogance by being admitted to the secret con- <lb/>
            ferences of the princes; and being, from the lowness of <lb/>
            his birth, a man ready for any wickedness, he laid an in- <lb/>
            formation against that illustrious pair of consuls, the <lb/>
            brothers Eusebius and Hypatius, relations of the former <lb/>
            emperor Constantius, as having conceived desires of a <lb/>
            higher fortune, aLid formed projects and entered into enter- <lb/>
            prises for the attainment of supreme power. Adding, <lb/>
            in order to procure additional credit for this falsehood, <lb/>
            that Eusebius had had a set of imperial robes prepared <lb/>
            for him.</p>
          <p>10. And when the story had been swallowed willingly, <lb/>
            Valens raging and threatening, a prince who never ought <lb/>
            to have had any power at all, because he thought that every- <lb/>
            thing, even injustice, was in his power, was incessantly <lb/>
            active in causing the production, even from the most dis- <lb/>
            tant countries, of all those whom the lawless accuser in <lb/>
            profound security had insisted ought to be produced; and <lb/>
            further commanded a prosecution to be instituted on the <lb/>
            criminal charge.</p>
          <p>11. And when equity had long been tossed to and <lb/>
            fro by knotty difficulties, while that abandoned profligate <lb/>
            persisted with unyielding obstinacy in maintaining the <lb/>
            truth of his assertions, while the severest tortures were un- <lb/>
            able to wring any confession from the prisoners, and when <lb/>
            every circumstance proved that those eminent men were <lb/>
            free from all consciousness of anything of the kind, still the <lb/>
            false accuser was treated with the same respect as he had <lb/>
            previously received. But though the prisoners were sen- <pb n="517"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            tenced to exile and a heavy fine, a short time afterwards <lb/>
            they were recalled from banishment, restored to their <lb/>
            former rank and dignity, and their fine repaid.</p>
          <p>12. Still after all these shameful transactions, the prince <lb/>
            did not proceed with any more moderation or decency than <lb/>
            before; never considering that in a wise government it is <lb/>
            well not to be too keen in hunting out offences, even as a <lb/>
            means of inflicting distress upon one's enemies; and that <lb/>
            nothing is so unbecoming as to display a bitterness of dis- <lb/>
            position in connection with supreme authority.</p>
          <p>, 13. But when Heliodorus died, whether of sickness or <lb/>
            through some deliberate violence is uncertain (I should not <lb/>
            like to say, and I wish that the facts themselves were equally <lb/>
            silent), many men of rank in mourning robes, among whom <lb/>
            were these two brothers of consular rank,, by the express <lb/>
            command of the emperor, attended his funeral when he was <lb/>
            borne to his grave by the undertakers.</p>
          <p>14. At that time, and in that place, the whole vile- <lb/>
            ness and stupidity of the ruler of the empire was publicly <lb/>
            displayed. When he was entreated to abstain from <lb/>
            abandoning himself to inconsolable grief, he remained <lb/>
            obstinately inflexible, as if he had stopped his ears with <lb/>
            wax to pass. the rocks of the Sirens.</p>
          <p>15. But at last, being overcome by the pertinacious <lb/>
            entreaties of his court, he ordered some persons to go on <lb/>
            foot, bareheaded, and with their hands folded, to the burial- <lb/>
            place of this wretched gladiator to do him honour. One <lb/>
            shudders now to recollect the decree by which so many men <lb/>
            of high rank were .humiliated, especially some of consular <lb/>
            dignity, after all their truncheons and robes of honour, and <lb/>
            all the worldly parade of having their names recorded in <lb/>
            the annals of their nation.</p>
          <p>16. Among them all, our friend Hypatius was most con- <lb/>
            spicuous, recommended as he was to every one by the <lb/>
            beauty of the virtues which he had practised from his <lb/>
            youth ; being a man of quiet and gentle wisdom, preserv- <lb/>
            ing an undeviating honesty combined with the greatest <lb/>
            courtesy of manner, so that he conferred a fresh lustre on <lb/>
            the glory of his ancestors, and was an ornament to his <lb/>
            posterity, by the memorable actions which he performed <lb/>
            in the office of prefect, to which he was twice appointed.</p>
          <p><unclear/> 17. At the same time, this circumstance came to crown <pb n="518"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. II."/> <lb/>
            the other splendid actions of Valens, that, while in the <lb/>
            case of others he gave way to such furious violence, that he <lb/>
            was even vexed when the severity of their punishment was <lb/>
            terminated by death, yet he pardoned Pollentianus, the <lb/>
            tribune, a man stained with such enormous wickedness, <lb/>
            that at that very time he was convicted on his own con- <lb/>
            fession of having cut out the womb of a living woman and <lb/>
            taken from it her child, in order to summon forth spirits <lb/>
            from the shades below, and to consult them about a change <lb/>
            in the empire. He looked on this wretch with the eye of <lb/>
            friendship, in spite of the murmurs of the whole bench of <lb/>
            senators, and discharged him in safety, suffering him to <lb/>
            retain not only his life, but his vast riches and full rank in <lb/>
            the army.</p>
          <p>18. 0 most glorious learning, granted by the express <lb/>
            gift of heaven to happy mortals, thou who hast often re- <lb/>
            fined even vicious natures! How many faults in the <lb/>
            darkness of that age wouldst thou have corrected if Valens <lb/>
            had ever been taught by thee that, according to the defi- <lb/>
            nition of wise men, empire is nothing else but the care of the <lb/>
            safety of others; and that it is the duty of a good emperor <lb/>
            to restrain power, to resist any desire to possess all things, <lb/>
            and all implacability of passion, and to know, as the dic- <lb/>
            tator Caesar used to say, " That the recollection of cruelty <lb/>
            was an instrument to make old age miserable!" And there- <lb/>
            fore that it behoves any one who is about to pass a sentence <lb/>
            affecting the life and existence of a man, who is a portion <lb/>
            of the world, and makes up the complement of living crea- <lb/>
            tures, to hesitate long and much, and never to give way to <lb/>
            intemperate haste in a case in which what is done is irre- <lb/>
            vocable. According to that example well known to all <lb/>
            antiquity.</p>
          <p>19. When Dolabella was proconsul in Asia, a matron <lb/>
            at Smyrna confessed that she had poisoned her son and <lb/>
            her husband, because she had discovered that they had <lb/>
            murdered a son whom she had had by a former husband. <lb/>
            Her case was adjourned-the council to whom it had <lb/>
            been referred being in doubt how to draw a line between <lb/>
            just revenge and unprovoked crime; and so she was re- <lb/>
            mitted to the judgment of the Areopagus, those severe <lb/>
            Athenian judges, who are said to have decided disputes <lb/>
            even among the gods. They, when they had heard the <pb n="519"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            case, ordered the woman and her accuser to appear before <lb/>
            them again in a hundred years, to avoid either acquitting <lb/>
            a poisoner, or punishing one who had been the avenger <lb/>
            of her kindred. So that is never to be thought too slow <lb/>
            which is the last of all things.</p>
          <p>20. After all the acts of various iniquity already men- <lb/>
            tioned, and after even the free persons who were allowed to <lb/>
            survive had been thus shamefully branded, the eye of Jus- <lb/>
            tice which never sleeps, that unceasing witness and avenger <lb/>
            of events, became more attentive and vigilant. For the <lb/>
            avenging Furies of those who had been put to death, work- <lb/>
            ing on the everlasting deity with their just complaints, <lb/>
            kindled the torches of war, to confirm the truth of the <lb/>
            oracle, which had given warning that no crime can be per- <lb/>
            petrated with impunity.</p>
          <p>21. While the affairs thus narrated were taking place, <lb/>
            Antioch was exposed to great distress through domestic <lb/>
            dissension, though not molested by any attacks on the <lb/>
            side of Parthia. But the horrid troop of Furies, which <lb/>
            after having caused all sorts of miseries there, had quitted <lb/>
            that city, now settled on the neck of the whole of Asia, <lb/>
            as will be seen in what follows.</p>
          <p>22. A certain native of Trent, by name Festus, a man <lb/>
            of the lowest obscurity of birth, being a relation of <lb/>
            Maximin, and one who had assumed the manly robe at the <lb/>
            same time with himself, was cherished by him as a coin- <lb/>
            panion, and by the will of the Fates had now crossed over <lb/>
            to the east, and having there become governor of Syria, <lb/>
            and master of the records, he set a very good and respect- <lb/>
            able example of lenity. From this he was promoted to <lb/>
            govern Asia with the rank of proconsul, being thus, as the <lb/>
            saying is, borne on with a fair wind to glory.</p>
          <p>23. And hearing that Maximin caused the destruction of <lb/>
            every virtuous man, he began from this time to denounce his <lb/>
            actions as mischievous and disgraceful. But when he saw <lb/>
            that, in consequence of the removal of those persons whom <lb/>
            he had impiously put to death, that wicked man had <lb/>
            arrived at the dignity of prefect, he began to be excited to <lb/>
            similar conduct and similar hopes. And suddenly chang- <lb/>
            in,-, his character like an actor, he applied himself to the <lb/>
            study of doing injury, and went about with fixed and <lb/>
            severe eyes, trusting that he also should soon become a <pb n="520"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. It."/> <lb/>
            prefect, if he only polluted himself with the blood of <lb/>
            innocent men.</p>
          <p>24. And although there are many and various instances <lb/>
            in which, to put the best construction on them, he acted <lb/>
            with great harshness, still it will be sufficient to enumerate <lb/>
            a few, which are notorious and commonly spoken of, seem- <lb/>
            ing to be done in rivalry of the deeds which were com- <lb/>
            mitted at Rome ; for the principle of good and bad actions <lb/>
            is the same everywhere, even if the importance of the cir- <lb/>
            cumstances be unequal.</p>
          <p>25. There was a philosopher named Cæranius, a man of <lb/>
            no inconsiderable merit, whom he put to death with the <lb/>
            most cruel tortures, and without any one coming forward <lb/>
            to avenge him, because, when writing familiarly to his <lb/>
            wife, he had put a postscript in Greek, 11 <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὺ δὲ νόει, καὶ <lb/>
            στέφε τὴν πύλην</foreign>."—" Do you take care and adorn the gate," <lb/>
            which is a common expression to let the hearer know that <lb/>
            something of importance is to be done.</p>
          <p>26. There was a certain simple old woman who was wont <lb/>
            to cure intermittent fever by a gentle incantation, whom he <lb/>
            put to death as a witch, after she had been summoned, with <lb/>
            his consent, to his daughter, and had cured her.</p>
          <p>27. There was a certain citizen of high respectability, <lb/>
            among whose papers, when they were searched by the <lb/>
            officers on some business or other, was found the nativity <lb/>
            of some one of the name of Valens. He, when asked on <lb/>
            what account he had troubled himself about the star of the <lb/>
            emperor, had repelled the accusation by declaring that it <lb/>
            was his own brother Valens whose nativity was thus found, <lb/>
            and when he promised to bring abundant proof that he had <lb/>
            long been dead, the judges would not wait for evidence of <lb/>
            the truth of his assertion, but put him to the torture and <lb/>
            cruelly slew him.</p>
          <p>28. A young man was seen in the bath to put the fingers <lb/>
            of each hand alternately against the marble and against his <lb/>
            own chest, and then to repeat the names of the seven <lb/>
            vowels, fancying that a remedy for a pain in the stomach. <lb/>
            For this he was brought before the court, put to the tor- <lb/>
            ture, and then beheaded. <pb n="521"/>

          <p>§ 1. THESE events, and the account of Gaul to which I am <lb/>
            now about to proceed, will cause some interruption to <lb/>
            the narration of occurrences in the metropolis. Among <lb/>
            many terrible circumstances, I find that Maximin was still <lb/>
            prefect, who by the wide extent of his power was a cruel <lb/>
            prompter to the emperor, who combined the most un- <lb/>
            restrained licence with unbounded power. Whoever, <lb/>
            therefore, considers what I have related, must also reflect <lb/>
            on the other facts which have been passed over, and, like a <lb/>
            prudent man, he will pardon me if I do not record every- <lb/>
            thing which the wickedness of certain counsels has occa- <lb/>
            sioned by exaggerating every accusation ?</p>
          <p>2. For while severity, the foe of all right principles, in- <lb/>
            creased, Yalentinian, being a man of a naturally ferocious <lb/>
            disposition, when Maximin arrived, having no one to give <lb/>
            him good advice or to restrain him, proceeded, as if <lb/>
            hurried on by a storm of winds and waves, to all kinds of <lb/>
            cruel actions; so that when angry, his voice, his counte- <lb/>
            nance, his gait, and his complexion, were continually <lb/>
            changing. And of this passionate intemperance there are <lb/>
            many undoubted instances, of which it will be sufficient to <lb/>
            recount a few.</p>
          <p>3. A certain grown-up youth, of those called pages, <lb/>
            having been appointed to take care of a Spartan hound <lb/>
            which had been brought out for hunting, let him loose <lb/>
            before the appointed moment, because the animal, in its <lb/>
            efforts to escape, leaped upon him and bit him; and for <lb/>
            this he was beaten to death and buried the same day.</p>
          <p>4. The master of a workshop, who had brought the <lb/>
            emperor an offering of a breastplate most exquisitely <lb/>
            polished, and who was therefore in expectation of a <lb/>
            reward, was ordered by him to be put to death because <lb/>
            the steel was of less weight than he considered requisite. <lb/>
            .... There was a certain native, of Epirus, a <lb/>
            priest of the Christian religion.' .... <note type="footnote"> 1 This sentence is so mutilated as to be unintelligible, but is filled <lb/>
            up by conjecture, founded on a knowledge of the facts, thus : " who waa <lb/>
            executed because he had not given up Octavian, who had been <lb/>
            formerly proconsul of Africa, and who had taken refuge in his house <lb/>
            when accused of some crime." </note> <pb n="522"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. III."/> 5. Constantianus, the master of the stables, having <lb/>
            ventured to change a few of the horses, to select which <lb/>
            he had been despatched to Sardinia, was, by his order, <lb/>
            stoned to death. Athanasius, a very popular character, <lb/>
            being suspected by him of some levity in the language <lb/>
            he held among the common people, was sentenced to <lb/>
            be burnt alive if he ever did anything of the kind again; <lb/>
            and not long afterwards, being accused of having practised <lb/>
            magic, he was actually burnt, no pardon being given even <lb/>
            to one whose devices had often afforded the emperor great <lb/>
            amusement.</p>
          <p>6. Africanus was an advocate of great diligence, residing <lb/>
            in Rome; he had had the government of one province, and <lb/>
            aspired to that of another. But when Theodosius, the <lb/>
            commander of the cavalry, supported his petition for such <lb/>
            an office, the emperor answered him somewhat rudely, <lb/>
            " Away with you, 0 count, and change the head of the <lb/>
            man who wishes to have his province changed." And <lb/>
            by this sentence a man of great eloquence perished, only <lb/>
            because, like many others, he wished for higher preferment.</p>
          <p>7. Claudian and Sallust were officers of the Jovian legion, <lb/>
            who had gradually risen to the rank of tribunes; but they <lb/>
            were accused by some man of the most despicable baseness <lb/>
            of having said something in favour of Procopius when he <lb/>
            aimed at the imperial power. And when a diligent in- <lb/>
            vestigation into this charge had proved ineffectual, the <lb/>
            emperor gave orders to the captains of the cavalry who <lb/>
            had been employed in it, to condemn Claudian to banish- <lb/>
            ment, and to pass sentence of death upon Sallust, promising <lb/>
            that he would reprieve him as he was being led to execu- <lb/>
            tion. The sentence was passed, as he commanded; but <lb/>
            Sallust was not reprieved, nor was Claudian recalled from <lb/>
            exile till after the death of Valentinian.' ... After <lb/>
            they had been exposed to frequent tortures.</p>
          <p>8. N evertheless after so many persons had been put to the <lb/>
            question, some of whom had even expired under the se- <lb/>
            verity of their tortures, still no traces of the alleged crimes <lb/>
            could be discovered. In this affair some of the body- <lb/>
            guards, who had been sent to arrest certain persons, were, <lb/>
            in a most unusual manner, beaten to death.</p>
          <p>9. The mind shudders at the idea of recapitulating all <lb/>
            that took place, and, indeed, dreads to do so, lest we should <pb n="523"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            appear to make a business of pointing out the vices of an <lb/>
            emperor who, in other respects, had many good qualities. <lb/>
            But this one circumstance may not be passed over in <lb/>
            silence nor suppressed, that he kept two ferocious she-bears <lb/>
            who were used to eat men; and they had names, Golden <lb/>
            Camel and Innocence, and these beasts he took such care <lb/>
            of that he had their dens close to his bedchamber; and <lb/>
            appointed over them trusty keepers who were bound to take <lb/>
            especial care that the odious fury of these monsters should <lb/>
            never be checked. At last he had Innocence sot free, after <lb/>
            he had seen the burial of many corpses which she had torn <lb/>
            to pieces, giving her the range of the forests as a reward <lb/>
            for her services.'</p>

          <p>§ 1. THESE actions are the most undeniable proof of his <lb/>
            habits and real character; but even the most obstinate <lb/>
            disparager of his disposition cannot deny him the praise of <lb/>
            great ability, which never forgot the interests of the state; <lb/>
            especially when it is recollected, that perhaps it is a greater <lb/>
            and more beneficial, as well as difficult, task to control the <lb/>
            barbarians by means of an army, than to repulse them. <lb/>
            And when ... If any one of the enemy moved, he was <lb/>
            seen from the watch-towers and immediately overwhelmed.</p>
          <p>2. But among many other subjects of anxiety, the first <lb/>
            and most important thing of all which was agitated, was <lb/>
            to seize alive, either by force or by trickery, as Julian had <lb/>
            formerly taken Vadomarius, Macrianus, the king, who, <lb/>
            through all the changes which had taken place, had ob- <lb/>
            tained a considerable increase of power, and was rising up <lb/>
            against our people with full-grown strength: and after all <lb/>
            the measures had been taken which seemed required by <lb/>
            the affair itself and the time, and when it had been learnt <lb/>
            by information collected from deserters when the aforesaid <lb/>
            monarch could be seized before he expected anything of <lb/>
            the kind, the emperor threw a bridge of boats across the <lb/>
            Rhine with as much secrecy as was possible, lest any one <lb/>
            should interpose any obstacle to such a work.</p>
          <p>3. Severus, who was the commander of the infantry, led <note type="footnote">1 The end of this chapter also is lost, as are one or two passages in <lb/>
            the beginning of Chapter IV. </note> <pb n="524"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. IV."/> <lb/>
            the van of the army towards Wiesbaden; and then, reflect- <lb/>
            ing on his scanty numbers, halted in consternation ; being <lb/>
            afraid lest, as he should be quite unequal to resist them, <lb/>
            he should be overwhelmed by the mass of the hostile army <lb/>
            if it attacked him.</p>
          <p>4. And because he suspected that the dealers who <lb/>
            brought slaves for sale, whom he found at that place by <lb/>
            chance, would be likely to repair with speed to the king to <lb/>
            tell him what they had seen, he stripped them of all their <lb/>
            merchandise, and then put them all to death.</p>
          <p>5. Our generals were now encouraged by the arrival of <lb/>
            more troops; and speedily contrived a temporary camp, <lb/>
            because none of the baggage-beasts had arrived, nor had <lb/>
            any one a proper tent, except the emperor, for whom one <lb/>
            was constructed of carpets and tapestry. Then waiting a <lb/>
            short time on account of the darkness of the night, at day- <lb/>
            break the army quitted the camp and proceeded onwards; <lb/>
            being led by guides well acquainted with the country. <lb/>
            The cavalry, under Theodosius, its captain, was appointed <lb/>
            to lead the way ... was inconvenienced by the great <lb/>
            noise made by his men ; whom his repeated commands <lb/>
            could not restrain from- rapine and incendiarism. For the <lb/>
            guards of the enemy being roused by the crackling of the <lb/>
            flames, and suspecting what had happened, put the king <lb/>
            on a light carriage and carrying him off with great speed, <lb/>
            hid him among the defiles of the neighbouring mountains.</p>
          <p>6. Valentinian being defrauded of the glory of taking <lb/>
            him, and that neither through any fault of his own or of <lb/>
            his generals, but through the insubordination of his soldiers, <lb/>
            which was often the cause of great misfortunes to the <lb/>
            Roman state, laid waste all the enemy's country for fifty <lb/>
            miles with fire and sword ; and then returned dejected to <lb/>
            Treves.</p>
          <p>7. Where like a lion raging for the loss of a deer or a <lb/>
            goat and champing with empty jaws, while fear was <lb/>
            breaking and dividing the enemy, he proceeded to com- <lb/>
            mand the Bucenobantes, who are a tribe of the Allemanni <lb/>
            opposite to Mayence, to elect Fraomarius as their king in <lb/>
            place of Macrianus. And, shortly afterwards, when a <lb/>
            fresh invasion had entirely desolated that canton, he <lb/>
            removed him to Britain, where he-gave him the authority <lb/>
            of a tribune, and placed a number.of the Allemanni under <pb n="525"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            his command, forming for him a division strong both in <lb/>
            its numbers and the excellence of its appointments. He <lb/>
            also gave two other nobles of the same nation, by name <lb/>
            Bitheridus and Hortarius, commands in his army; of <lb/>
            whom Hortarius, being betrayed by the information of <lb/>
            Florentius, Duke of Germany, who accused him of having <lb/>
            written letters to Macrianus and the chieftains of the <lb/>
            barbarians, containing language unfavourable to the re- <lb/>
            public, was put to the torture, and having been compelled <lb/>
            to confess the truth, was condemned to be burnt alive.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER this ... it seems best to relate these <lb/>
            matters in one connected narrative, lest the introduction <lb/>
            of other affairs wholly unconnected with them, and which <lb/>
            took place at a distance, should lead to confusion, and <lb/>
            prevent the reader from acquiring a correct knowledge of <lb/>
            these numerous and intricate affairs.</p>
          <p>2. Nubel, who had been the most powerful chieftain <lb/>
            among the Mauritanian nations, died, and left several <lb/>
            sons, some legitimate, others born of concubines, of whom <lb/>
            Zamma, a great favourite of the Count Romanus, was slain <lb/>
            by his brother Firmus; and this deed gave rise to civil <lb/>
            discords, and wars. For the count being exceedingly eager <lb/>
            to avenge his death, made formidable preparations for the <lb/>
            destruction of his treacherous enemy. And as continual <lb/>
            reports declared, most exceeding pains were taken in the <lb/>
            palace, that the despatches of Romanus, which contained <lb/>
            many most unfavourable statements respecting Firmus, <lb/>
            should be received and read by the prince; while many <lb/>
            circumstances strengthened their credibility. And, on the <lb/>
            other hand, that those documents which Firmus frequently, <lb/>
            for the sake of his own safety, endeavoured to lay before <lb/>
            the emperor by the agency of his friends, should be kept <lb/>
            from his sight as long as possible, Remigius, a friend <lb/>
            and relation of Romanus, and who was at that time <lb/>
            master of the offices, availed himself of other more im- <lb/>
            portant affairs which claimed the emperor's attention to <lb/>
            declare that Firmus's papers were all unimportant and <lb/>
            superfluous, only to be read at a perfectly favourable <lb/>
            opportunity. <pb n="526"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. V"/> 3. But when Firmus perceived that these intrigues were <lb/>
            going on to keep his defence out of sight, trembling for <lb/>
            fear of the worst if all his excuses should be passed over, and <lb/>
            he himself be condemned as disaffected and mischievous. <lb/>
            and so be put to death, be revolted from the emperor's <lb/>
            authority, and aided ... in devastation.'</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, to prevent an implacable enemy from <lb/>
            gaining strength by such an increase of force, Theodosius, <lb/>
            the commander of the cavalry, was sent with a small body <lb/>
            of the emperor's guards to crush him at once. Theodosius <lb/>
            was an officer whose virtues and successes were at that <lb/>
            time conspicuous above those of all other men: he re- <lb/>
            sembled those ancient heroes, Domitius Corbulo, and <lb/>
            Lusius; the first of whom was distinguished by a great <lb/>
            number of gallant achievements in the time of Nero, and <lb/>
            the latter of equal reputation under Trajan.</p>
          <p>5. Theodosius marched from Aries with favourable <lb/>
            auspices, and having crossed the sea with the fleet under <lb/>
            his command so rapidly that no report of his approach <lb/>
            could arrive before himself, he reached the coast of Mauri- <lb/>
            tania Sitifensis; that portion of the coast being called, by <lb/>
            the natives, Igilgitanum. There, by accident, he met <lb/>
            Romanus, and addressing him kindly, sent him to arrange <lb/>
            the stations of the sentries and the outposts, without <lb/>
            reproaching him for any of the matters for which he was <lb/>
            liable to blame.</p>
          <p>6. And when he had gone to the other province, Mauri- <lb/>
            tania Cæsariensis, he sent Gildo, the brother of Firmus <lb/>
            and Maximus, to assist Vincentius, who, as the deputy of <lb/>
            Romanus, was the partner of his disloyal schemes and <lb/>
            thefts.</p>
          <p>7. Accordingly, as soon as his soldiers arrived, who had <lb/>
            been delayed by the length of the sea voyage, he hastened <lb/>
            to Sitifis; and gave orders to the body-guards to keep <lb/>
            Romanus and his attendants under surveillance. He <lb/>
            himself remained in the city, full of embarrassment and <lb/>
            anxiety, working many plans in his mind, while devising <lb/>
            by what means or contrivances he could conduct his <lb/>
            soldiers who were accustomed to a cold climate through a <lb/>
            country parched up with heat; or how he could catch an <note type="footnote">1 Manuscript imperfect. </note> <pb n="527"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="AD. 371.]"/> <lb/>
            enemy always on the alert and appearing when least ex- <lb/>
            pected, and who relied more on surprises and ambuscades <lb/>
            than a pitched battle.</p>
          <p>8. When news of these facts reached Firmus, first <lb/>
            through vague reports, and subsequently by precise in- <lb/>
            formation, he, terrified at the approach of a general of <lb/>
            tried valour, sent envoys and letters to him, confessing <lb/>
            all he had done, and imploring pardon; asserting that <lb/>
            it was not of his own accord that he had been driven on <lb/>
            to an action which he knew to be criminal, but that he had <lb/>
            been goaded on by unjust treatment of a flagitious cha- <lb/>
            racter, as he undertook to show.</p>
          <p>9. When his letters had been read, and when peace was <lb/>
            promised him, and hostages received from him, Theodosius <lb/>
            proceeded to the Pancharian station to review the legions <lb/>
            to which the protection of Africa was intrusted, and who <lb/>
            had been ordered to assemble to meet him at that place. <lb/>
            There he encouraged the hopes of them all by confident <lb/>
            yet prudent language ; and then returned to Sitifis, having <lb/>
            reinforced his troops with some native soldiers; and, not <lb/>
            being inclined to admit of any delay, he hastened to <lb/>
            regain his camp.</p>
          <p>10. Among many other admirable qualities which he <lb/>
            displayed, his popularity was immensely increased by an <lb/>
            order which he issued, forbidding the army to demand <lb/>
            supplies from the inhabitants of the province ; and assert- <lb/>
            in-, with a captivating confidence, that the harvests and <lb/>
            granaries of the enemy were the magazines of the valour <lb/>
            of our soldiers.</p>
          <p>11. Having arranged these matters in a way which <lb/>
            caused great joy to the landowners, he advanced to Tubu- <lb/>
            suptum. a town near Mons Ferratus, where he rejected a <lb/>
            second embassy of Firmus, because it had not brought <lb/>
            with it the hostages, as had been provided before. From <lb/>
            this place, having made as careful an examination of every- <lb/>
            thing as the time and place permitted, he proceeded by <lb/>
            rapid marches to the Tyndenses and Massisenses; tribes <lb/>
            equipped with light arms, under the command of Mascizel <lb/>
            and Dius, brothers of Firmus.</p>
          <p>12. When the enemy, being quick and active in all <lb/>
            their movements, came in sight, after a fierce skirmish <lb/>
            by a rapid interchange of missiles, both sides engaged <pb n="528"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. V"/> <lb/>
            in a furious contest; and amid the groans of the wounded <lb/>
            and dying were heard also the wailing and lamentations <lb/>
            of barbarian prisoners. When the battle was over, the <lb/>
            territory for a great distance was ravaged and wasted by <lb/>
            fire.</p>
          <p>13. Among the havoc thus caused, the destruction of <lb/>
            the farm of Petra, which was razed to the ground, and <lb/>
            which had been originally built by Salmaces, its owner, <lb/>
            a brother of Firmus, in such a manner as to resemble a <lb/>
            town, was especially remarkable. The conqueror was <lb/>
            elated at this success, and with incredible speed proceeded <lb/>
            to occupy the town of Lamforctense, which was situated <lb/>
            among the tribes already mentioned; here he caused <lb/>
            large stores of provisions to be accumulated, in order <lb/>
            that if, in his advance into the inland districts, he <lb/>
            should find a scarcity of supplies, he might order them to <lb/>
            be brought from this town, which would be at no great <lb/>
            distance.</p>
          <p>14. In the mean time Mascizel, having recruited his <lb/>
            forces by auxiliaries which he had procured from the <lb/>
            tribes on the borders, ventured on a pitched battle with <lb/>
            our army, in which his men were routed, and a great <lb/>
            portion of them slain, while he himself was with difficulty <lb/>
            saved from death by the speed of his horse.</p>
          <p>15. Firmus, being weakened by the losses he had <lb/>
            sustained in two battles, and in great perplexity, in <lb/>
            order to leave no expedient untried, sent some priests <lb/>
            of the Christian religion with the hostages, as ambas- <lb/>
            sadors to implore peace. They were received kindly, <lb/>
            and having promised supplies of food for our soldiers, <lb/>
            as they were commissioned to do, they brought back a <lb/>
            propitious answer. And then, sending before him a <lb/>
            present, Firmus himself went with confidence to meet <lb/>
            the Roman general, mounted on a horse fitted for any <lb/>
            emergency. When he came near Theodosius, he was <lb/>
            awe-struck at the brilliancy of the standards, and the <lb/>
            terrible countenance of the general himself; and leapt <lb/>
            from his horse, and with neck bowed down almost to <lb/>
            the ground, he, with tears, laid all the blame on his own <lb/>
            rashness, and entreated pardon and peace.</p>
          <p>16. He was received with a kiss, since such treatment <lb/>
            of him appeared advantageous to the republic; and being <pb n="529"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 373.]"/> <lb/>
            now full of joyful hope, he supplied the army with pro- <lb/>
            visions in abundance; and having left some of his own <lb/>
            relations as hostages, he departed in order, as he promised, <lb/>
            to restore those prisoners whom he had taken at the first <lb/>
            beginning of these disturbances. And two days after- <lb/>
            wards, without any delay, he restored the town of Icosium <lb/>
            (of the founders of which we have already spoken), also the <lb/>
            military standards, the crown belonging to the priest, and <lb/>
            all the other things which he had taken, as he had beet <lb/>
            commanded to do.</p>
          <p>17. Leaving this place, our general, advancing by long <lb/>
            marches, reached Tiposa, where, with great elation, he <lb/>
            gave answers to the envoys of the Mazices, who had <lb/>
            combined with Firmus, and now in a suppliant tone im- <lb/>
            plored pardon, replying to their entreaties that he would <lb/>
            at once march against them as perfidious enemies.</p>
          <p>18. When he had thus cowed them by the fear of <lb/>
            impending danger, and had commanded them to return to <lb/>
            their own country, he proceeded onwards to Cæsarea, a <lb/>
            city formerly of great wealth and importance, of the origin <lb/>
            of which we have given a full account in our description <lb/>
            of Africa. When he reached it, and saw that nearly the <lb/>
            whole of it had been destroyed by extensive conflagra <lb/>
            tions, and that the flint stones of the streets were covered <lb/>
            with ashes, he ordered the first and second legions to <lb/>
            be stationed there for a time, that they might clear away <lb/>
            the heaps of cinders and ashes, and keep guard there to <lb/>
            prevent a fresh attack of the barbarians from repeating this <lb/>
            devastation.</p>
          <p>19. When accurate intelligence of these events had <lb/>
            arrived, the governors of the province and the tribune <lb/>
            Vincentins issued forth from the places of concealment in <lb/>
            which they had been lying, and came with speed and <lb/>
            confidence to the general. He saw and received them <lb/>
            with joy, and, while still at Cæsarea, having accurately <lb/>
            inquired into every circumstance, he found that Firmus, <lb/>
            while assuming the disguise of an ally and a suppliant, <lb/>
            was secretly planning how, like a sudden tempest, to over- <lb/>
            whelm his army while unprepared for any such danger.</p>
          <p>20. On this he quitted Cæsarea, and went to the town of <lb/>
            Sugabarritanum, which is on the slope of Mount Transcel- <lb/>
            lensis. There he found the cavalry of the fourth cohort <note type="footnote">2 M </note> <pb n="530"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="(BK. XXIX. CH. V."/> <lb/>
            of archers, who had revolted to the rebels, and in order <lb/>
            to show himself content with lenient punishments, he <lb/>
            degraded them all to the lowest class of the service, and <lb/>
            ordered them, and a portion of the infantry of the Con- <lb/>
            stantian legion, to come to Tigaviæ with their tribunes, <lb/>
            one of whom was the man who, for want of a diadem, had <lb/>
            placed a neck-chain on the head of Firmus.</p>
          <p>21. While these events were proceeding, Gildo and <lb/>
            Maximus returned, and brought with them Bellenes, one <lb/>
            of the princes of the Mazices, and Fericius, prefect of <lb/>
            that nation, both of whom had espoused the faction of <lb/>
            the disturber of the public peace, leading them forth in <lb/>
            chains.</p>
          <p>22. When this order had been executed, Theodosius <lb/>
            himself came forth from his camp at daybreak, and <lb/>
            on seeing those men surrounded by his army, said, <lb/>
            " What, my trusty comrades, do you think ought to be <lb/>
            done to these nefarious traitors?" And then, in com- <lb/>
            pliance with the acclamations of the whole army, who <lb/>
            demanded that their treason should be expiated by their <lb/>
            blood, he, according to the ancient fashion, handed over <lb/>
            those of them who had served in the Constantian legion to <lb/>
            the soldiers to be put to death by them. The officers of <lb/>
            the archers he sentenced to lose their hands, and the rest <lb/>
            he condemned to death, in imitation of Curio, that most <lb/>
            vigorous and severe general, who by this kind of punish- <lb/>
            ment crushed the ferocity of the Dardanians, when it was <lb/>
            reviving like the Lernæan hydra.</p>
          <p>23. But malignant detractors, though they praise the <lb/>
            ancient deed, vituperate this one as terrible and inhuman, <lb/>
            affirming that the Dardanians1 were implacable enemies, <lb/>
            and therefore justly suffered the punishment inflicted <lb/>
            on them; but that those soldiers, who belonged to our <lb/>
            own standards, ought to have been corrected with more <lb/>
            lenity, for falling into one single error. But we will <lb/>
            remind these cavillers, of what perhaps they know already, <lb/>
            namely, that this cohort was not only an enemy by its own <lb/>
            conduct, but also by the example which it set to others.</p>
          <p>24. He also commanded Bellenes and Fericins, who <lb/>
            have been mentioned above, and whom Gildo brought <lb/>
            with him, to be put to death; and likewise Curandins, <note type="footnote">1 The Dardanians were a Thracian tribe. </note> <pb n="531"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 373.]"/> <lb/>
            a tribune of the archers, because he had always been back- <lb/>
            ward in engaging the enemy himself, and had never been <lb/>
            willing to encourage his men to fight. And he did this <lb/>
            in recollection of the principle laid down by Cicero, that <lb/>
            " salutary vigour is better than an empty appearance of <lb/>
            clemency."</p>
          <p>25. Leaving Sugabarri, he came to a town called <lb/>
            Gallonatis, surrounded by a strong wall, and a secure <lb/>
            place of refuge for the Moors, which, as such, he destroyed <lb/>
            with his battering-rams. And having slain all the in- <lb/>
            habitants, and levelled the walls, he advanced along the <lb/>
            foot of Mount Ancorarius to the fortress of Tingetanum, <lb/>
            where the Mazices were all collected in one solid body. <lb/>
            He at once attacked them, and they encountered him with <lb/>
            arrows and missiles of all kinds as thick as hail.</p>
          <p>26. The battle proceeded for some time vigorously on <lb/>
            both sides, till at last the Mazices, though a hardy and <lb/>
            warlike race, being unable to withstand the fury of our <lb/>
            men and the shock of their arms, after sustaining heavy <lb/>
            loss, fled in every direction in disgraceful panic; and <lb/>
            as they fled they were put to the sword in great numbers, <lb/>
            with the exception only of those who, contriving to make <lb/>
            their escape, afterwards, by their humble supplications, <lb/>
            obtained the pardon which the times permitted to be <lb/>
            granted to them.</p>
          <p>27. Their leader Suggena, who succeeded Romanus, was <lb/>
            sent into Mauritania Sitifensis to establish other garrisons <lb/>
            necessary to prevent that province from being overrun; <lb/>
            and he himself, elated by his recent achievements, marched <lb/>
            against the nation of the Musones, who, from a conscious- <lb/>
            ness of the ravages and murders of which they had been <lb/>
            guilty, had joined the party of Firmus, hoping that he <lb/>
            would soon obtain the chief authority.</p>
          <p>28. Having advanced some distance, he found, near the <lb/>
            town of Addense, that a number of tribes, who, though <lb/>
            differing from each other in manners and language, were <lb/>
            all animated with one feeling, in fomenting the outbreaks <lb/>
            of terrible wars, being urged on and encouraged by the <lb/>
            hope of great rewards from a sister of Firmus, named <lb/>
            Cyria; who being very rich, and full of feminine reso- <lb/>
            lution, was resolved to make a great effort to help hei <lb/>
            brother. <pb n="532"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="(BK. XXIX. CH.V."/> 29. Therefore Theodosius, fearing to become involved <lb/>
            in a war to which his forces were unequal, and that if lie <lb/>
            with his small force (for he had but three thousand five <lb/>
            hundred men) should engage with an immense multitude, <lb/>
            he should lose his whole army, at first hesitating between <lb/>
            the shame of retreating and his wish to fight, gradually <lb/>
            fell back a little; but presently was compelled by the <lb/>
            overpowering mass of the barbarians to retire altogether.</p>
          <p>30. The barbarians were exceedingly elated at this event, <lb/>
            and pursued him with great obstinacy.... Being <lb/>
            compelled by necessity to fight, he would have lost all his <lb/>
            army and his own life, had not these tumultuous tribes, <lb/>
            the moment they saw a troop of the Mazican auxiliaries, <lb/>
            with a few Roman soldiers in their front, fancied that a <lb/>
            numerous division was advancing to charge them, and <lb/>
            in consequence taking to flight, opened to our men a way <lb/>
            of escape which was previously shut against them.</p>
          <p>31. Theodosius now drew off his army in safety; and <lb/>
            when he had reached a town called Mazucanum, he found <lb/>
            there a number of deserters, some of whom he burnt alive, <lb/>
            and others he mutilated after the fashion of the archeis <lb/>
            whose hands had been cut off. He then proceeded towards <lb/>
            Tipata, which he reached in the course of February.</p>
          <p>32. There he stayed some time deliberating, like that <lb/>
            old delayer, Fabius, on the circumstances around him, <lb/>
            desiring to subdue the enemy, who was not only warlike, <lb/>
            but so active as usually to keep out of bowshot, rather <lb/>
            by manoeuvres and skill than by hazardous engagements.</p>
          <p>33. Still he from time to time sent out envoys, skilled <lb/>
            in the arts of persuasion, to the surrounding tribes, the <lb/>
            Basuræ, the Cautauriani, the Anastomates, the Cafaves, the <lb/>
            Davares, and other people in their neighbourhood, trying <lb/>
            to bring them over to our alliance, either by presents, <lb/>
            threats, or by promises of pardon for past violence. <lb/>
            ... seeking by delays and intrigues to crush an enemy <lb/>
            who offered so stout a resistance to his attacks, just as <lb/>
            Pompey in times past had subdued Mithridates.</p>
          <p>34. On this account Firmus, avoiding immediate destruc- <lb/>
            tion, although he was strengthened by a large body of <lb/>
            troops, abandoned the army which he . had collected by a <lb/>
            lavish expenditure of money, and as the darkness of night <lb/>
            afforded a chance of concealment, he fled to the Caprarian <pb n="533"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 373.]"/> <lb/>
            mountains, which were at a great distance, and from their <lb/>
            precipitous character inaccessible.</p>
          <p>35. On his clandestine departure, his army also dis- <lb/>
            persed, being broken up into small detachments without <lb/>
            any leader, and thus afforded our men an opportunity of <lb/>
            attacking their camp. That was soon plundered, and <lb/>
            all who resisted were put to the sword, or else taken <lb/>
            prisoners ; and then, having devastated the greater portion <lb/>
            of the country, our wise general appointed prefects of tried <lb/>
            loyalty as governors of the different tribes through which <lb/>
            he passed.</p>
          <p>. 36. The traitor was thrown into consternation by the <lb/>
            unexpected boldness of his pursuit, and with the escort <lb/>
            of only a few servants, hoping to secure his safety by the <lb/>
            rapidity of his movements, in order to have nothing to <lb/>
            impede his flight, threw away all the valuable baggage <lb/>
            which he had taken with him. His wife, exhausted with <lb/>
            continual toil</p>
          <p>37. Theodosius ... showing mercy to none of them, <lb/>
            having refreshed his soldiers by a supply of better food, <lb/>
            and gratified them by a distribution of pay, defeated <lb/>
            the Capracienses and Abanni, who were the next tribes <lb/>
            to them, in some unimportant skirmishes, and then <lb/>
            advanced with great speed to the town of ..... <lb/>
            and having received certain intelligence that the bar- <lb/>
            barians had already occupied the hills, and were spread <lb/>
            over the precipitous and broken ground to a great height, <lb/>
            so that they were quite inaccessible to any but natives <lb/>
            who were intimately acquainted with the whole country, <lb/>
            he retired, giving the enemy an opportunity by a truce, <lb/>
            short as it was, to receive an important reinforcement <lb/>
            from the Ethiopians in the neighbourhood.</p>
          <p>38. Then having assembled all their united forces, they <lb/>
            rushed on to battle with threatening shouts, and an utter <lb/>
            disregard of their individual safety, compelling him to <lb/>
            retreat, full of consternation at the apparently countless <lb/>
            numbers of their army. But soon the courage of his men <lb/>
            revived, and he returned, bringing with him vast supplies, <lb/>
            and with his troops in a dense column, and brandishing <lb/>
            their shields with formidable gestures, he again engaged <lb/>
            the enemy in close combat.</p>
          <p>39. The barbarians rattled their arms in a savage <pb n="534"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. T, "/>manner, and our battalions, with equal rage, pushed on, <lb/>
            they also rattling their shields against their knees. Still <lb/>
            the general, like a cautious and prudent warrior, aware of <lb/>
            the scantiness of his numbers, advanced boldly with his <lb/>
            army in battle array, till he came to a point, at which he <lb/>
            turned off, though still preserving an undaunted front, <lb/>
            towards the city of Contensis, where Firmus had placed <lb/>
            the prisoners whom he had taken from us, as in a remote <lb/>
            and safe fortress. He recovered them all, and inflicted <lb/>
            severe punishment, according to. his custom, on the traitors <lb/>
            among the prisoners, and also on the guards of Firmus.</p>
          <p>40. While he was thus successful, through the protec- <lb/>
            tion of the Supreme Deity, he received correct intelligence <lb/>
            from one of his scouts that Firmus had fled to the tribe of <lb/>
            the Isaflenses. He at once entered their territory to re- <lb/>
            quire that he should be given up, with his brother Ma- <lb/>
            zuca, and the rest of his relations: and on being refused, <lb/>
            he declared war against the nation.</p>
          <p>41. And after a fierce battle, in which the barbarians <lb/>
            displayed extraordinary courage and ferocity, be threw his <lb/>
            army into a solid circle; and then the Isaflenses were so com- <lb/>
            pletely overpowered by the weight of our battalions pressing <lb/>
            on them that numbers were slain ; and Firmus himself, <lb/>
            gallantly as he behaved, after exposing himself to im- <lb/>
            minent danger by the rashness of his courage, put spurs <lb/>
            to his horse, and fled; his horse being accustomed to make <lb/>
            his way with great speed over the most rocky and preci. <lb/>
            pitous paths. But his brother Mazuca was taken prisoner, <lb/>
            mortally wounded.</p>
          <p>42. It was intended to send him to Cæsarea, where he <lb/>
            had left behind him many records of his atrocious cruelties; <lb/>
            but his wounds reopened, and he died. So his head was <lb/>
            cut off, and (his body being left behind) was conveyed to that <lb/>
            city, where it was received with great joy by all who saw it.</p>
          <p>43. After this our noble general inflicted most severe <lb/>
            punishment, as justice required, on the whole nation of the <lb/>
            Isaflenses, which had resisted till it was thus subdued in <lb/>
            war. And he burnt alive one of the most influential of <lb/>
            the citizens, named Evasius, and his. son Florus, and several <lb/>
            others, who were convicted on undeniable evidence of <lb/>
            having aided the great disturber of tranquillity by their <lb/>
            secret counsels. <pb n="535"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.n 373.]"/> <lb/>
            44. From thence Theodosius proceeded into the interior, <lb/>
            and with great resolution attacked the tribe of the <lb/>
            Jubileni, to which he heard that Nubel, the father of <lb/>
            Firmus, belonged; but presently he halted, being checked <lb/>
            by the height of the mountains, and their winding defiles. <lb/>
            And though he had once attacked the enemy, and opened <lb/>
            himself a further road by slaying a great number of them, <lb/>
            still, fearing the high precipices as places pre-eminently <lb/>
            adapted for ambuscades, he withdrew, and led back his <lb/>
            army in safety to a fortress called Audiense, where the <lb/>
            Jesalenses, a warlike tribe, came over to him, voluntarily <lb/>
            promising to furnish him with reinforcements and pro- <lb/>
            visions.</p>
          <p>45. Our noble general, exulting in this and similarly <lb/>
            glorious achievements, now made the greatest efforts to <lb/>
            overtake the original disturber of tranquillity himself, and <lb/>
            therefore having halted for some time near a fortress <lb/>
            named Medianum, he planned various schemes through <lb/>
            which he hoped to procure that Firmus should be given up <lb/>
            to him.</p>
          <p>46. And while he was directing anxious thoughts and <lb/>
            deep sagacity to this object, he heard that he had again <lb/>
            gone back to the Isaflenses; on which, as before, without <lb/>
            any delay, he marched against them with all possible <lb/>
            speed. Their king, whose name was Tgmazen, a man of <lb/>
            great reputation in that country, and celebrated also <lb/>
            for his riches, advanced with boldness to meet him, and <lb/>
            addressed him thus, " To what country do you belong, and <lb/>
            with what object have you come hither? Answer me." <lb/>
            Theodosius, with finn mind and stern looks, replied, " I <lb/>
            am a lieutenant of Valentinian, the master of the whole <lb/>
            world, sent hither to destroy a murderous robber; and <lb/>
            unless you at once surrender him, as the invincible emperor <lb/>
            has commanded, you also, and the nation of which you <lb/>
            are king, will be entirely destroyed." Igmazen, on receiv- <lb/>
            in- this answer, heaped a number of insulting epithets on <lb/>
            our general, and then retired full of rage and indignation</p>
          <p>47. And the next morning at daybreak the two armies, <lb/>
            breathing terrible threats against each other, advanced to <lb/>
            engage in battle: nearly twenty thousand barbarians con- <lb/>
            stituted the front of their army, with very large reserves <lb/>
            posted behind, out of sight, with the intention that they <lb/>
            should steal forward gradually, and hem in our battalions <pb n="536"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK XXIX. CH.. V."/> <lb/>
            with their vast and unexpected numbers. These were <lb/>
            also supported by a great number of auxiliaries of tho <lb/>
            Jesalenian tribes, whom we have mentioned as having <lb/>
            promised reinforcements and supplies to ourselves.</p>
          <p>48. On the other side, the Roman army, though scanty <lb/>
            in numbers, nevertheless being full of natural courage, and <lb/>
            elated by their past victories, formed into dense columns, <lb/>
            and joining their shields firmly together, in the fashion of <lb/>
            a testudo, planted their feet firmly in steady resistance; <lb/>
            and from sunrise to the close of day the battle was pro- <lb/>
            tracted. A little before evening Firmus was seen mounted <lb/>
            on a tall horse, expanding his scarlet cloak in order to <lb/>
            attract the notice of his soldiers, whom he was excit- <lb/>
            ing with a loud voice at once to deliver up Theodosius, <lb/>
            calling him a ferocious and cruel man—an inventor of <lb/>
            merciless punishments-as the only means of delivering <lb/>
            themselves from the miseries which he was causing them.</p>
          <p>49. This unexpected address only provoked some of <lb/>
            our men to fight with more vigour than ever, but there <lb/>
            were others whom it seduced to desert our ranks. There- <lb/>
            fore when the stillness of night arrived, and the country <lb/>
            became enveloped in thick darkness, Theodosius returned to <lb/>
            the fortress of Duodiense, and, recognizing those soldiers <lb/>
            who had been persuaded by fear and Firmus's speech to <lb/>
            quit the fight, he put them all to death by different modes <lb/>
            of execution; of some he cut off the right hands, others he <lb/>
            burnt alive.</p>
          <p>50. And conducting himself with ceaseless care and <lb/>
            vigilance, he routed a division of the barbarians who, <lb/>
            though afraid to show themselves by day, ventured, after <lb/>
            the moon had set, to make an attempt upon his camp; some <lb/>
            of those who advanced further than their comrades he took <lb/>
            prisoners. Departing from this place, he made a forced <lb/>
            march through by-roads to attack the Jesalensians, who <lb/>
            had shown themselves disloyal and unfaithful. He could <lb/>
            not obtain any supplies from their country, but he ravaged <lb/>
            it, and reduced it to complete desolation. Then he passed <lb/>
            through the towns of Mauritania and Cæsarensis, and re- <lb/>
            turned to Sitifis, where he put to the torture Castor and <lb/>
            Martinianus, who had been the accomplices of Romanus <lb/>
            in his rapine and other crimes, and afterwards burnt <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>51. After this the war with the Isaflenses was renewed; <pb n="537"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 373.]"/> <lb/>
            and in the first conflict, after the barbarians had been <lb/>
            routed with heavy loss, their king Jgmazen, who had <lb/>
            hitherto been accustomed to be victorious, agitated by <lb/>
            fears of the present calamity, and thinking that all his <lb/>
            alliances would be destroyed, and that he should have no <lb/>
            hope left in life if he continued to resist, with all the <lb/>
            cunning and secrecy that he could, fled by himself from <lb/>
            the battle; and reaching Theodosius, besought him in a <lb/>
            suppliant manner to desire Masilla, the chief magistrate of <lb/>
            the Mazices, to come to him.</p>
          <p>52. When that noble had been sent to him as he re- <lb/>
            quested, he employed him as his agent to advise the general, <lb/>
            as a man by nature constant and resolute in his plans, that <lb/>
            the way to accomplish his purpose would be to press <lb/>
            his countrymen with great vigour, and, by incessant fight- <lb/>
            ing, strike terror into them; as, though they were keen <lb/>
            partisans of Firmus, they were nevertheless wearied out <lb/>
            by repeated disasters.</p>
          <p>53. Theodosius adopted this advice, and, by battle after <lb/>
            battle, so completely broke the spirits of the Isaflenses, <lb/>
            that they fell away like sheep, and Firmus again secretly <lb/>
            escaped, and hiding himself for a long time in out-of-the- <lb/>
            way places and retreats, till at last, while deliberating on a <lb/>
            further flight, he was seized by igmazen, and put in con- <lb/>
            finement.</p>
          <p>54. And since he had learnt from Masilla the plans <lb/>
            which had been agitated in secret, he at last came to <lb/>
            reflect that in so extreme a necessity there was but one <lb/>
            remedy remaining, and he determined to trample under <lb/>
            foot the love of life by a voluntary death; and having <lb/>
            designedly filled himself with wine till he became stupe- <lb/>
            Red, when, in the silence of the night, his keepers were <lb/>
            sunk in profound slumber, he, fully awake from dread <lb/>
            of the misfortune impending over him, left his bed with <lb/>
            noiseless steps, and crawling on his hands and feet, con- <lb/>
            veyed himself to a distance, and then, having found a <lb/>
            rope which chance provided for the end of his life, he <lb/>
            fastened it to a nail which was fixed in the wall, and <lb/>
            hanging himself, escaped the protracted sufferings of <lb/>
            torture.</p>
          <p>55. Igmazen was vexed at this, lamenting that he was <lb/>
            thus robbed of his glory, because it had not been granted <pb n="538"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX CH. VI."/> <lb/>
            to him to conduct this rebel alive to the Roman camp; and <lb/>
            so, having received a pledge of the state for his own safety, <lb/>
            through the intervention of Masilla, he placed the body of <lb/>
            the dead man on a camel, and when he arrived at the camp <lb/>
            of the Roman army, which was pitched near the fortress <lb/>
            of Subicarense, he transferred it to a pack-horse, and offered <lb/>
            it to Theodosius, who received it with exultation.</p>
          <p>56. And Theodosius having assembled a crowd of sol- <lb/>
            diers and citizens, and having asked them whether they <lb/>
            recognized the face of the corpse, learnt by their answers <lb/>
            that there was no question at all that it was the man; <lb/>
            after this he stayed there a short time, and then returned <lb/>
            to Sitifis in great triumph, where he was received with joy- <lb/>
            ful acclamations of the people of every age and rank.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE Theodosius was thus exerting himself, and toil- <lb/>
            ing in Mauritania and Africa, the nation of the Quad! was <lb/>
            roused to make a sudden movement. It was a nation <lb/>
            now not very formidable, but one which had formerly <lb/>
            enjoyed vast renown for its warlike genius and power, <lb/>
            as its achievements prove, some of which were distin- <lb/>
            guished for the rapidity, as well as for the greatness, of <lb/>
            their success ; instances are :—Aquileia, which was besieged <lb/>
            by them and the Marcomanni; Opitergium, which was <lb/>
            destroyed by them, and many other bloody successes which <lb/>
            were gained in that rapid campaign when the Julian <lb/>
            Alps were passed, and that illustrious emperor Marcus, of <lb/>
            whom we have already spoken, was hardly able to offer <lb/>
            them any resistance. And indeed they had, for barbarians, <lb/>
            just ground of complaint.</p>
          <p>2. For Valentinian, who from the beginning of his <lb/>
            reign had been full of a resolution to fortify his frontier, <lb/>
            which was a glorious decision, but one carried too far in <lb/>
            this case, ordered a fortress capable of containing a strong <lb/>
            garrison to be constructed on the south side of the river <lb/>
            Danube, in the very territories of the Quadi, as if they <lb/>
            were subject to the Roman authority. The natives, being <lb/>
            very indignant at this, and anxious for their own rights <lb/>
            and safety, at first contented themselves with trying, to. <lb/>
            avert the evil by an embassy and expostulations. <pb n="539"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="AJ). 373.]"/> 3. But Maximin, always eager for any wickedness, and <lb/>
            unable to bridle his natural arrogance, which was now <lb/>
            increased by the pride which he felt in his rank as <lb/>
            prefect, reproached Equitius, who at that time was the <lb/>
            commander of the forces in Illyricum, as careless and <lb/>
            inactive, because the work, which it was ordered should <lb/>
            be carried on with all speed, was not yet finished. And he <lb/>
            added, as a man guided only by zeal for the common <lb/>
            good, that if the rank of Duke of Valeria were only con- <lb/>
            ferred on his own little son, Marcellianus, the fortification <lb/>
            would be soon completed without any more pretexts for <lb/>
            delay. Both his wishes were presently granted.</p>
          <p>4. Marcellianus received the promotion thus suggested, <lb/>
            and set out to take possession of his government; and <lb/>
            when he reached it, being full of untimely arrogance, as <lb/>
            might be expected from the son of such a father, without <lb/>
            attempting to conciliate those whom false dreams of gain <lb/>
            had caused to quit their native land, he applied himself <lb/>
            to the work which had been recently begun, and had only <lb/>
            been suspended to afford an opportunity for the inhabitants <lb/>
            to present petitions against it.</p>
          <p>5. Lastly, when their king Gabinius requested, in a most <lb/>
            moderate tone, that no innovations might be made, he <lb/>
            as if intending to assent to his petition, with feigned <lb/>
            courtesy invited him and some other persons to a banquet: <lb/>
            and then as he was departing after the entertainment, <lb/>
            unsuspicious of treachery, he caused him, in infamous viola- <lb/>
            tion of the sacred rights of hospitality, to be murdered.</p>
          <p>6. The report of so atrocious an act was speedily <lb/>
            spread abroad, and roused the indignation of the Quadi <lb/>
            and other surrounding tribes, who, bewailing the death <lb/>
            of the king, collected together and sent forth predatory <lb/>
            bands, which crossed the Danube; and when no hostilities <lb/>
            were looked for, attacked the people who were occupied <lb/>
            in the fields about the harvest; and having slain the <lb/>
            greater portion of them, carried off all the survivors to <lb/>
            their own country with a great booty of different kinds of <lb/>
            cattle.</p>
          <p>7. And at that time an inexpiable atrocity was very near <lb/>
            being committed, which would have been reckoned among <lb/>
            the most disgraceful disasters which ever happened to <lb/>
            the Roman state, for the daughter of Constantius had a <pb n="540"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX Cn. VI."/> <lb/>
            narrow- escape of being taken prisoner as she was at <lb/>
            dinner in a hotel called the Pistrensian, when on her <lb/>
            way to be married to Gratian: and she was only saved <lb/>
            by the promptitude of Messala the governor of the province, <lb/>
            who, aided by the favour of the propitious Deity, placed <lb/>
            her in a carriage belonging to him as governor, and con- <lb/>
            ducted her back with all possible speed to Sirmium, a dis- <lb/>
            tance of about twenty-six miles.</p>
          <p>8. By this fortunate chance the royal virgin was deli- <lb/>
            vered from the peril of miserable slavery; and if she had <lb/>
            been taken and her captors had refused to ransom her, it <lb/>
            would have been the cause of terrible disasters to the <lb/>
            republic. After this the Quadi in conjunction with the <lb/>
            Sarmatians, extended their ravages further (since both <lb/>
            these tribes were addicted beyond measure to plunder and <lb/>
            robbery), carrying off, men, women, and cattle, and exult- <lb/>
            ing in the ashes of burnt villas, and in the misery of the <lb/>
            murdered inhabitants, whom they fell upon unexpectedly <lb/>
            and slaughtered without mercy.</p>
          <p>9. All the neighbouring districts were filled with appre- <lb/>
            hension of similar evils, and Probus, the prefect of the <lb/>
            prætorium, who was at that time at Sirmium, a man wholly <lb/>
            unexperienced in war, being panic-struck with the cala- <lb/>
            mitous appearance of these new occurrences, and scarcely <lb/>
            able to raise his eyes for fear, was for a long time waver- <lb/>
            ing in doubt what to do. At first he prepared some <lb/>
            swift horses and resolved to fly the next night; but <lb/>
            afterwards, taking advice from some one who gave him <lb/>
            safer counsel, he stayed where he was, but without doing <lb/>
            anything.</p>
          <p>10. For he had been assured that all those who were <lb/>
            within the walls of the city would immediately follow him, <lb/>
            with the intention of concealing themselves in suitable <lb/>
            hiding-places; and if that had been done, the city, left <lb/>
            without defenders, would have fallen into the hands of the <lb/>
            enemy.</p>
          <p>11. Presently, after his terror had been a little mode- <lb/>
            rated, he applied himself with some activity to do what was <lb/>
            most pressing; he cleared out the fosses which were choked <lb/>
            up with ruins; he repaired the greater portion of the walls <lb/>
            which, through the security engendered by a long peace, <lb/>
            had been neglected, and had fallen into decay, and raised <pb n="541"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 373.1"/> <lb/>
            them again to the height of lofty towers, devoting him- <lb/>
            self zealously to the work of building. In this way <lb/>
            the work was speedily completed, because he found that <lb/>
            the sums which some time before had been collected for <lb/>
            the erection of a theatre were sufficient for the purpose <lb/>
            he was now pressing forward. And to this prudent mea- <lb/>
            sure he added another of like precaution, in summoning <lb/>
            a cohort of archer cavalry from the nearest station, <lb/>
            that it might be at hand to resist a siege should any take <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>12. By these barriers, as they may be called, the bar- <lb/>
            barians were forced to abandon their design of besieging <lb/>
            the city, since they were not skilful in contests of this kind, <lb/>
            and were also hampered by the burden of their booty; <lb/>
            accordingly they turned aside to pursue Equitius. And <lb/>
            when, from the information given them by their prisoners, <lb/>
            they learnt that he had retired to the most remote part of <lb/>
            Valeria, they hastened thither by forced marches, gnashing <lb/>
            their teeth, and determined on his death, because they <lb/>
            believed that it was through his means their innocent king <lb/>
            had been circumvented.</p>
          <p>13. And as they were hastening onwards with impetuous <lb/>
            and vengeful speed, they were met by two legions, the <lb/>
            Pannonian and the Mœsian, both of approved valour, <lb/>
            who, if they had acted in harmony, must unquestionably <lb/>
            have come off victorious. But while they were hastening <lb/>
            onward to attack the barbarians separately, a quarrel arose <lb/>
            between them on the subject of their honour and dignity, <lb/>
            which impeded all their operations.</p>
          <p>14. And when intelligence of this dissension reached <lb/>
            the Sarmatians, who are a most sagacious people, they, <lb/>
            without waiting for any regular signal of battle, attacked <lb/>
            the Mœsians first; and while the soldiers, being surprised <lb/>
            and in disorder, were slowly making ready their arms, <lb/>
            many of them were killed; on which the barbarians <lb/>
            with increased confidence attacked the Pannonians, and <lb/>
            broke their line also ; and when the line of battle was once <lb/>
            disordered, theyredoubled their efforts, and would have <lb/>
            destroyed almost all of them, if some had not saved them- <lb/>
            selves from the danger of death by a precipitate flight.</p>
          <p>15. Amid these calamitous inflictions of adverse fortune, <lb/>
            Thcodosius the younger, Duke of Mœsia, then in the first <pb n="542"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXIX. CH. VI."/> <lb/>
            bloom of youth, but afterwards a prince of the highest <lb/>
            reputation, in many encounters defeated and vanquished <lb/>
            the Free Sarmatians (so called to distinguish them from <lb/>
            their rebellious slaves), who had invaded our frontier <lb/>
            on the other side, till he exhausted them by his repeated <lb/>
            victories; and with such vigour did he crush the assembled <lb/>
            crowds combined to resist his arms, that he glutted the <lb/>
            very birds and beasts with the blood of the vast numbers <lb/>
            justly slain.</p>
          <p>16. Those who remained having lost all their pride and <lb/>
            spirit, fearing lest a general of such evident promptitude <lb/>
            and courage should rout or destroy these invading bat- <lb/>
            talions on the very edge of his frontier, or lay ambus- <lb/>
            cades for them in the recesses of the woods, made <lb/>
            from time to time many vain attempts to escape, and <lb/>
            at last, discarding all confidence in battle, they begged <lb/>
            indulgence and pardon for their past hostility. And <lb/>
            being thoroughly subdued, they did nothing for some <lb/>
            time contrary to the treaty of peace, being more especially <lb/>
            terrified because a strong force of Gallic soldiers had eome <lb/>
            to the defence of Illyrieum.</p>
          <p>17. While these events were agitating the empire, and <lb/>
            while Claudius was prefect of the Eternal City, the Tiber, <lb/>
            which Intersects its walls, and which, after receiving the <lb/>
            waters of many drains and copious streams, falls into <lb/>
            the Tyrrhenian Sea, overflowed its banks, in consequence <lb/>
            of an abundance of rain, and extending to a size beyond <lb/>
            that of a river, overwhelmed almost everything with its <lb/>
            flood.</p>
          <p>18. All those parts of the city which lie in the plain <lb/>
            were under water, and nothing reared its head above but <lb/>
            the hills and other spots of rising ground, which seemed <lb/>
            like islands, out of the reach of present danger. And, as <lb/>
            the vastness of the inundation permitted of no departure <lb/>
            in any direction to save the multitude from dying of famine, <lb/>
            great quantities of provisions were brought in barges and <lb/>
            boats. But when the bad weather abated, and the river <lb/>
            which had burst its bounds returned to its accustomed <lb/>
            channel, the citizens discarded all fear, and apprehended no <lb/>
            inconvenience for the future.</p>
          <p>19. Claudius, as a prefect, conducted himself very quietly, <lb/>
            nor was any sedition in his time provoked by any real <pb n="543"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D 374.1"/> <lb/>
            grievance. He also repaired many ancient buildings: and <lb/>
            among his improvements he built a large colonnade con- <lb/>
            tiguous to the bath of Agrippa, and gave it the name of <lb/>
            The Colonnade of Success, because a temple bearing that <lb/>
            title is close to it.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHILE all these difficulties and disturbances had been <lb/>
            caused by the perfidy of the Duke Marcellianus, in trea- <lb/>
            cherously murdering the king of the Quadi, a terrible <lb/>
            crime was committed in the East, where Para, king of <lb/>
            Armenia was also murdered by secret treachery; the <pb n="544"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. I."/> <lb/>
            original cause of which wicked action we have ascertained <lb/>
            to be this:-</p>
          <p>2. Some men of perverse temperament, who delighted <lb/>
            in public misfortune, had concocted a number of accusa- <lb/>
            tions against this prince for acts which they imputed to <lb/>
            him even when scarcely grown up, and had exaggerated <lb/>
            them to Valens. Among these men was the Duke Terentius, <lb/>
            a man who always walked about with a downcast melan- <lb/>
            choly look, and throughout his life was an unwearied <lb/>
            sower of discord.</p>
          <p>3. He, having formed a combination with a few people <lb/>
            of Para's nation, whom a consciousness of their own <lb/>
            crimes had filled with fear, was continually harping in his <lb/>
            letters to the court on the deaths of Cylax and Arta- <lb/>
            bannes ; adding also that this same young king was full of <lb/>
            haughtiness in all his conduct, and that he behaved with <lb/>
            excessive cruelty to his subjects.</p>
          <p>4. In consequence of these letters, Para, as if it were <lb/>
            intended that he should become a partaker in a treaty of <lb/>
            which existing circumstances required ratification, was <lb/>
            invited to court with all the ceremony to which he was <lb/>
            entitled as a king, and then was detained at Tarsus in <lb/>
            Cilicia, with a show of honour, without being able to <lb/>
            procure permission to approach the emperor's camp, or to <lb/>
            learn why his arrival had been so eagerly pressed ; since <lb/>
            on this point all around him preserved a rigid silence. <lb/>
            At last, however, by means of private information, he <lb/>
            learnt that Terentius was endeavouring by letter to per- <lb/>
            suade the Roman sovereign to send without delay another <lb/>
            king to Armenia; lest, out of hatred to Para, and a know- <lb/>
            ledge of what they had to expect if he returned among <lb/>
            them, his nation, which at present was friendly to us, <lb/>
            should revolt to the Persians, who had long been eager to <lb/>
            reduce them under their power either by violence, fear, <lb/>
            or flattery.</p>
          <p>5. Para, reflecting on this warning, foreboded grievous <lb/>
            mischief for himself; and being a man of forethought <lb/>
            and contrivance, as he could not perceive any means of <lb/>
            safety, except by a speedy departure, by the advice of <lb/>
            his most trusty friends he collected a body of 300 persons <lb/>
            who had accompanied him from his own country, and <lb/>
            with horses selected for especial speed, acting as men <pb n="545"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            are wont to do under the pressure of great terror and per- <lb/>
            plexity, that is to say, with more boldness than prudence : <lb/>
            late one afternoon he started boldly forth at the head of <lb/>
            his escort, formed in one solid body.</p>
          <p>6. And when the governor of the province, having <lb/>
            received information from the officer who kept the gate, <lb/>
            came with prompt energy and found him in the suburb, <lb/>
            he earnestly entreated him to remain; but finding that he <lb/>
            could not prevail upon him, he quitted him, for fear of <lb/>
            his own life.</p>
          <p>7. And not long afterwards Para, with his escort, turned <lb/>
            back upon the legion which was pursuing him and on <lb/>
            the point of overtaking him, and pouring arrows upon <lb/>
            them as thick as sparks of fire, though designedly missing <lb/>
            them, he put. them to flight, filling them, tribune and all, <lb/>
            with complete consternation, so that they returned to the <lb/>
            city with greater speed than they left it.</p>
          <p>8. After this, Para being released from all fear, con- <lb/>
            tinued his laborious and rapid journey for two days <lb/>
            and two nights, till he reached the Euphrates ; where, for <lb/>
            want of boats, he was unable to pass the river, which at <lb/>
            that place is full of strong currents and too deep to be <lb/>
            forded. His men, not being skilful swimmers, were afraid <lb/>
            to trust themselves to the stream, and he himself showed <lb/>
            more hesitation than any of them; indeed be would have <lb/>
            halted there altogether, if while every one was sug- <lb/>
            gesting one plan or another, he had not at last hit upon <lb/>
            the following expedient, which seemed the safest in this <lb/>
            emergency.</p>
          <p>9. They took a number of little beds which they found in <lb/>
            the neighbouring houses, and supported them each on two <lb/>
            bladders, of which there were plenty at hand in the. vine- <lb/>
            yards. And then be and his nobles placed themselves <lb/>
            each on a bed, leading their horses after them, and so <lb/>
            floated down and across the stream; by which con- <lb/>
            trivance, after extreme danger, they at last reached the <lb/>
            opposite bank.</p>
          <p>10. All the rest swam their horses, and though they <lb/>
            were terribly tossed about and often almost sunk by the <lb/>
            eddying stream, still, though much exhausted by their <lb/>
            wetting, they also reached the opposite bank ; when having <lb/>
            rested for a short time and refreshed themselves, they <note type="footnote">2 N </note> <pb n="546"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. L"/> <lb/>
            proceeded on their way, travelling further than on the <lb/>
            previous days.</p>
          <p>11. When this transaction became known, the emperor <lb/>
            being greatly moved at the king's flight, fearing he would <lb/>
            break off his alliance, sent Daniel and Barzimeres to bring <lb/>
            him back; the one being a count, the other the tribune <lb/>
            of the Scutarii, and he placed under their command a <lb/>
            thousand archers prepared for a rapid march by the light- <lb/>
            ness of their equipment.</p>
          <p>12. These officers, trusting to their acquaintance with <lb/>
            the country, and feeling sure that Para, as a stranger who <lb/>
            was not accustomed to it, would take a roundabout way, <lb/>
            sought to cut him off by marking a short cut through <lb/>
            some valleys ; and having divided their forces, they block- <lb/>
            aded the two nearest roads, which were three miles from <lb/>
            one another, in order that whichever Para took he might <lb/>
            be caught before he expected it. But he escaped their <lb/>
            manoeuvre in this way:-</p>
          <p>13. A traveller who happened to be hastening towards the <lb/>
            western bank of the river, saw that the two roads were filled <lb/>
            with armed soldiers, and accordingly quitted this road in <lb/>
            order to avoid them, and made his way by an almost in- <lb/>
            visible path, which lay between them, overgrown with <lb/>
            bushes and brambles, and fell in with the Armenians, who <lb/>
            were by this time greatly fatigued. He was brought be- <lb/>
            fore the king, and, being admitted by him to a private <lb/>
            conference, related to him secretly what he had seen, <lb/>
            and was detained in safety.</p>
          <p>14. And presently, without anything being done to <lb/>
            give an idea that they were alarmed, a horseman was <lb/>
            sent secretly to the road on the right side to prepare a <lb/>
            resting-place and some food. And when he had been <lb/>
            gone a little time, another was sent to the left with <lb/>
            directions to move with great rapidity, and do the same <lb/>
            thing; neither horseman being aware that the other had <lb/>
            been sent in a different direction.</p>
          <p>15. And after this arrangement had been thus cleverly <lb/>
            made, the king himself, with his escort, retraced his steps <lb/>
            through the jungle by which the traveller had come, <lb/>
            taking him for his guide, and passing through this over- <lb/>
            grown path, which was almost too narrow for a loaded <lb/>
            horse, he left the Roman soldiers behind him and so <pb n="547"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            escaped. Meanwhile our troops, who had made prisoners <lb/>
            of the soldiers who had been thus sent out to impose <lb/>
            upon them, waited a long time, while watching for the <lb/>
            king, and stretching out their hands, as one may say, to <lb/>
            seize the game which they expected would rush into them. <lb/>
            And while they were thus waiting for the arrival of <lb/>
            Para, he reached his kingdom in safety, where he was <lb/>
            received with great joy by his countrymen, and still <lb/>
            remained unshaken in his fidelity to us, burying in silence <lb/>
            the injuries which he had received.</p>
          <p>16. After this, Daniel and Barzimeres, having been thus <lb/>
            balked of their prey, returned to Tarsus, and were loaded <lb/>
            with bitter reproaches as inactive and blundering officers. <lb/>
            But like venomous serpents whose first spring has failed, <lb/>
            they only whetted their deadly fangs, in order at the <lb/>
            first opportunity to inflict all the injury in their power on <lb/>
            the king who had thus escaped them.</p>
          <p>17. And, with a view to palliate the effect of their own <lb/>
            mistake, or rather of the defeat their hopes, which the <lb/>
            deeper sagacity of the king had contrived, they began <lb/>
            to fill the emperor's ears, which were at all times most <lb/>
            ready to receive all kinds of reports with false accusa- <lb/>
            tions against Para; pretending that he was skilled in <lb/>
            Circean incantations, so as to be able to transform people, <lb/>
            or to afflict them with sickness in a marvellous manner, <lb/>
            Adding, moreover, that it was by means of arts of this <lb/>
            kind that he had rendered himself invisible, and that if <lb/>
            allowed to continue changing his shape, he would cause <lb/>
            them great trouble, if permitted to live to boast of having <lb/>
            deceived them.</p>
          <p>18. In this manner the hatred which Valens had con- <lb/>
            ceived against him was increased to an incredible degree ; <lb/>
            and plan after plan was laid to take his life, either by <lb/>
            force or stratagem; and orders to that effect were <lb/>
            transmitted by secret letters to Trajan, who at that time <lb/>
            was in Armenia, in chief command of the forces in that <lb/>
            kingdom.</p>
          <p>19. Trajan, accordingly, began to surround Para with <lb/>
            treacherous blandishments-at one time showing him some <lb/>
            letters of Valens, which appeared to indicate that he was <lb/>
            favourably disposed towards the king-at another, par- <lb/>
            taking cheerfully of his entertainments, he at last, with <pb n="548"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX CH. I."/> <lb/>
            great apparent respect (but in pursuance of a deliberate <lb/>
            plot), invited him to supper. Para, fearing no hostility, <lb/>
            came, and was placed in the seat of honour at the feast.</p>
          <p>20. Exquisite delicacies were set before him, and the <lb/>
            splendid palace resounded with the music of lyres and <lb/>
            lutes. Presently, when the wine had circulated freely, <lb/>
            the master of the feast quitted it for a moment, under <lb/>
            pretence of some natural want, and immediately a ferocious <lb/>
            barbarian of the troop they call Supræ I was sent in, bran- <lb/>
            dishing a drawn sword, and with a terribly ferocious <lb/>
            countenance, to murder the youth, against whose escape <lb/>
            ample precautions had now been taken.</p>
          <p>21. As soon as he saw him, the king. who as it happened <lb/>
            was on the further side of the couch, jumped up and <lb/>
            drew his dagger to defend his life by every means in his <lb/>
            power, but was stabbed in the breast, and fell like a <lb/>
            miserable victim, being shamefully cut to pieces with <lb/>
            repeated blows.</p>
          <p>22. By this foul contrivance was his credulity shame- <lb/>
            fully deceived at a feast which is respected even on the <lb/>
            coast of the Euxine Sea, under the eye of the Deity of <lb/>
            Hospitality; and the blood of a stranger and a guest was <lb/>
            sprinkled on the splendid tablecloths, and, by its foaming <lb/>
            gore, filled the guests with loathing, who at once dispersed <lb/>
            in great horror. If the dead can feel sorrow or indignation, <lb/>
            then let that illustrious Fabricius Luscinus groan at the <lb/>
            evidence of this deed, knowing with what greatness of <lb/>
            mind he himself repelled Demochares (or, as some call <lb/>
            him, Nicias), the king's servant, who in a secret COIl- <lb/>
            ference offered to poison Pyrrhus, at that time desolating <lb/>
            Italy with cruel wars, and wrote to the king, bidding him <lb/>
            beware of his immediate attendants : such great reverence <lb/>
            in the first ages of antiquity was there for the rights of <lb/>
            hospitality even when claimed by an enemy.</p>
          <p>23. But this modern, strange, and shameful act was <lb/>
            excused by the precedent afforded by the death of Ser- <lb/>
            torius; though the emperor's flatterers were perhaps <note type="footnote">1 No one has succeeded in explaining this word. Some editors wish <lb/>

            ignorant that, as Demosthenes—the everlasting glory of <lb/>
            Grcece—affirms, an unlawful and wicked action cannot be <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. THESE are the transactions which especially attracted <lb/>
            notice in Armenia; but Sapor, after the last defeat which <lb/>
            his troops had experienced, having heard of the death of <lb/>
            Para, whom he had been earnestly labouring to win to his <lb/>
            own alliance, was terribly grieved ; and, as the activity <lb/>
            of our army increased his apprehensions, he began to <lb/>
            dread still greater disasters to himself.</p>
          <p>2. He therefore sent Arsaces as his ambassador to the <lb/>
            emperor, to advise him utterly to destroy Armenia as a <lb/>
            perpetual cause of trouble; or, if that plan should be <lb/>
            decided against, asking that an end might be put to the <lb/>
            division of Hiberia into two provinces, that the Roman <lb/>
            garrison might be withdrawn, and that Aspacuras, whom <lb/>
            he himself had made the sovereign of the nation, might be <lb/>
            permitted to reign with undivided authority.</p>
          <p>3. To this proposal, Valens replied, that he could not <lb/>
            change the resolutions which had been agreed to by both <lb/>
            of them; and, indeed, that he should maintain them with <lb/>
            zealous care. Towards the end of the winter, letters were <lb/>
            received from the king of a tenor very contrary to this <lb/>
            noble determination of Valens, full of vain and arrogant <lb/>
            boasting. For in them Sapor affirmed that it was im- <lb/>
            possible for the seeds of discord to be radically extirpated, <lb/>
            unless those who had been witnesses of the peace which <lb/>
            had been made with Julian were all collected, some of <lb/>
            whom he knew to be already dead.</p>
          <p>4. After this, the matter becoming a source of greater <lb/>
            anxiety, the emperor, who was more skilful in choosing <lb/>
            between different plans than in devising them himself, <lb/>
            thinking that it would be beneficial to the state in general, <lb/>
            ordered Victor, the commander of the cavalry, and Ur- <lb/>
            bicius, the Duke of Mesopotamia, to march with all speed <lb/>
            to Persia, bearing a positive and plain answer to the <lb/>
            proposals of Sapor: namely, that he, who boasted of <pb n="550"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="(BK. XXX. CH. n."/> <lb/>
            being a just man, and one contented with his own, was <lb/>
            acting wickedly in coveting Armenia, after a promise had <lb/>
            been made to its inhabitants, that they should be allowed <lb/>
            to live according to their own laws. And unless the <lb/>
            soldiers who had been left as auxiliaries to Sauromaces <lb/>
            returned without hindrance at the beginning of the <lb/>
            ensuing year, as had been agreed, he would compel Sapor <lb/>
            by force to perform what he might at present do with a <lb/>
            good grace.</p>
          <p>5. And this embassy would in all respects have been a <lb/>
            just and honourable one, if the ambassadors had not, <lb/>
            contrary to their instructions, accepted some small districts <lb/>
            in this same Armenia which were offered them. When <lb/>
            the ambassadors returned, the Surena (the magistrate who <lb/>
            enjoys an authority second only to that of the king) came <lb/>
            with them, offering the said districts to the emperor which <lb/>
            our ambassadors had ventured to take.</p>
          <p>6. He was received with liberality and magnificence; <lb/>
            but dismissed without obtaining what he requested. And <lb/>
            then great preparations were made for war, in order that, <lb/>
            as soon as the severity of the winter was over, the em- <lb/>
            peror might invade Persia with three armies; and with <lb/>
            this object he began with all speed to bargain for the <lb/>
            services of some Scythian auxiliaries.</p>
          <p>7. Sapor not having succeeded in obtaining what his <lb/>
            vain hopes had led him to reckon on, and being exasperated <lb/>
            in an extraordinary degree, because he had learnt that <lb/>
            our emperor was preparing for an expedition, nevertheless <lb/>
            stifled his wrath, and gave the Surena a commission to <lb/>
            endeavour to recover by force of arms (if any one should <lb/>
            resist him) the territories which Count Victor and Urbicius <lb/>
            had accepted, and to press hostilities with the utmost <lb/>
            rigour against those soldiers who had been destined to aid <lb/>
            Sauromaces.</p>
          <p>8. His orders were at once carried out. Nor was it <lb/>
            found possible to prevent or resist their execution, be- <lb/>
            cause a new cause of alarm suddenly came on the republic; <lb/>
            as the entire nation of the Goths suddenly burst into <lb/>
            Thrace. The calamities which we experienced from <lb/>
            that event shall be related succinctly in their proper <lb/>
            places.</p>
          <p>9. These were the occurrences which took place in the <pb n="551"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            East. And while they were proceeding, as has been <lb/>
            related, the unfailing arm of justice avenged the losses <lb/>
            we had sustained 'in Africa, and the slaughter of the <lb/>
            ambassadors of Tripoli, whose shades were still wandering <lb/>
            about unavenged. For Justice, though a late, is yet a <lb/>
            scrupulous and unerring discriminator between right and <lb/>
            wrong.</p>
          <p>10. Remigius, whom we have already spoken of as <lb/>
            favouring Count Romanus, who had laid waste these pro- <lb/>
            vinces after Leo had succeeded him as master of the <lb/>
            offices, retired from office and from public life, and de- <lb/>
            voted himself to rural pursuits in his own native district <lb/>
            near Mayence.</p>
          <p>11. And while he was living there in security, Maximin, <lb/>
            the prefect of the prætorium, despising him because of his <lb/>
            return to a tranquil life, as he was accustomed to attack <lb/>
            everything like a terrible pestilence, set to work to do him <lb/>
            injury by every means in his power. And, in order to <lb/>
            hunt out all his secrets, he seized Cæsarius who had <lb/>
            formerly been a servant of his, and afterwards had become <lb/>
            a secretary of the emperor, and put him to the question, <lb/>
            torturing him with great severity to learn from him what <lb/>
            Remigius had done, and how much he had received to <lb/>
            induce him to countenance the wicked actions of Romanus.</p>
          <p>12. But when Remigius heard this in his retreat, to <lb/>
            which, as has been said, he had retired; being oppressed <lb/>
            by the consciousness of his acts, or perhaps letting the <lb/>
            dread of false accusation overpower his reason, he hanged <lb/>
            himself.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THE next year Gratian took Equitius as his colleague <lb/>
            in the consulship; and Valentinian, after desolating some <lb/>
            cantons of the Allemanni, was building a fortress near <lb/>
            Basle, which the natives of the country call Robur, when a <lb/>
            report was brought to him from the prefect Probus with an <lb/>
            account of the disasters which had taken place in Illyricum.</p>
          <p>2. He read them with a very careful examination, as <lb/>
            became a prudent general; and then being filled with <lb/>
            anxious thoughts, he sent his secretary, Paternianus, to that <lb/>
            country, to inquire minutely into the whole details of the <pb n="552"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. III"/> <lb/>
            affair. And, as he soon received from him a true account <lb/>
            of all that had taken place, he prepared to repair thither <lb/>
            himself with all speed, in order to overwhelm with the <lb/>
            first crash of his arms (sueh was his idea) the barbarians <lb/>
            who had dared to pollute our frontier.</p>
          <p>3. But, because, as it was now the end of autumn, there <lb/>
            were many serious difficulties in the way, all the nobles in <lb/>
            the palace pressed him earnestly to allow the time between <lb/>
            that and the beginning of spring to be spent in embassies <lb/>
            and conferences. Reminding him, in the first place, that the <lb/>
            roads were all impassable through frost-that it was im- <lb/>
            possible to find herbage to feed the eattle, or anything else <lb/>
            that would be useful. In the next place, they dwelt on <lb/>
            the ferocity of the chieftains who lay nearest to Gaul, and <lb/>
            especially of Macrianus whom they greatly dreaded, as it <lb/>
            was quite certain that he was no friend to us, and was <lb/>
            inelined to attack even the fortified cities.</p>
          <p>4. By recapitulating these arguments, and adding others <lb/>
            of great weight, they brought the emperor to adopt a <lb/>
            wiser plan; and immediately (as was best for the com- <lb/>
            monwealth) King Macrianus was invited in courteous terms <lb/>
            to come to Mayenee; and the event proved that he also <lb/>
            was well inclined to make a treaty. When he arrived, <lb/>
            however, it was marvellous how proud and arrogant he <lb/>
            was, as if he were to be the supreme arbiter of the peace. <lb/>
            And on a day appointed for a Conference he came, carrying <lb/>
            himself very loftily, to the very brink of the Rhine, and <lb/>
            escorted by a number of his eountrymen, who made a <lb/>
            great elang with their shields.</p>
          <p>5. On the other hand, the emperor, having embarked in <lb/>
            a boat, such as is used on that river, and likewise es- <lb/>
            eorted by a strong force, eame with great confidence up <lb/>
            to the eastern bank, being conspicuous through the <lb/>
            brilliancy of his glittering standards; and when the <lb/>
            frantie gestures and murmurs of the barbarians had been <lb/>
            quieted, a long discussion took place on both sides, and <lb/>
            at last a firm friendship was agreed on, and ratified with <lb/>
            an oath.</p>
          <p>6. When this was over, the king, who had been the <lb/>
            cause of all these troubles, retired, quite pacified, and <lb/>
            destined to prove an ally to us for the future; indeed, he <lb/>
            afterwards, to the very end of his life, gave proof of <pb n="553"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            his constancy and resolution to preserve his agreement <lb/>
            with us, by many noble and gallant actions.</p>
          <p>7. But subsequently he died in the country of the <lb/>
            Franks, which he had invaded and ravaged in a most <lb/>
            destructive manner, till at last he was cut off by the <lb/>
            manoeuvres of Mellobaudes, the warlike king of that na- <lb/>
            tion, and slain. After the treaty had thus been solemnly <lb/>
            ratified, Valentinian retired into winter quarters, at <lb/>
            Treves.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THESE were the events which took place in Gaul and <lb/>
            the northern countries. But in the east, while all our <lb/>
            foreign affairs were quiet, great domestic evils were in- <lb/>
            creasing in consequence of the conduct of the friends and <lb/>
            relations of Yalens, who had more regard to expediency <lb/>
            than honesty; for they laboured with the utmost dili- <lb/>
            gence to bring about the recall from his post a judge <lb/>
            of rigid probity, who was fond of deciding lawsuits <lb/>
            equitably, out of a fear lest, as in the times of Julian, when <lb/>
            Innocence was allowed a fair opportunity of defending <lb/>
            itself, the pride of the powerful nobles, which was ac- <lb/>
            customed to roam at large with unrestrained licence, might <lb/>
            again be broken down.</p>
          <p>2. With these and similar objects a great number of <lb/>
            persons conspired together, being led by Modestus, the pre- <lb/>
            fect of the prætorium, who was a complete slave to the <lb/>
            wishes of the emperor's eunuchs, and who, under a spe- <lb/>
            cious countenance, concealed a rough disposition which <lb/>
            had never been polished by any study of ancient virtue or <lb/>
            literature, and who was continually asserting that to look <lb/>
            into the minute details of private actions was beneath the <lb/>
            dignity of the emperor. He thinking, as he said, that the <lb/>
            examination of such matters had been imposed on the <lb/>
            nobles to lower their dignity, abstained from all such <lb/>
            matters himself, and opened the doors to plunder; which <lb/>
            doors are now daily more and more opened by the de- <lb/>
            pravity of the judges and advocates, who are all of the <lb/>
            same mind, and who sell the interests of the poor to the <lb/>
            military commanders, or the persons of influence within <pb n="554"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="⌈BK. XXX. CH. IV."/> <lb/>
            the palace, by which conduct they themselves have gained <lb/>
            riches and high rank.</p>
          <p>3. This profession of forensic oratory the wisdom of <lb/>
            Plato defines to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτικη̃ς μορίου εἴδωλον</foreign>, “the shadow of <lb/>
            a fraction of the art of government," or a fourth part of <lb/>
            the art of flattery. But Epicurus calls it <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακοτεχνία</foreign> <lb/>
            reckoning it among the wicked arts. Tisias, who has <lb/>
            Gorgias of Leontinum on his side, calls the orator an artist <lb/>
            of persuasion.</p>
          <p>4. And while such has been the opinion formed of this <lb/>
            art by the ancients, the craft of some of the Eastern people <lb/>
            has put it forward so as to make it an object of hatred <lb/>
            to good men, on which account an orator it is sometimes <lb/>
            restricted to a limited time for speaking.1 Therefore, <lb/>
            after saying a few words about its unworthy character, <lb/>
            as I found by experience while in those countries, I will <lb/>
            return to my original subject.</p>
          <p>5. The tribunals, in former times, when good taste <lb/>
            prevailed, were greatly adorned by our advocates, when <lb/>
            orators of spirited eloquence-laborious and accomplished <lb/>
            scholars-shone pre-eminent in genius, honesty, fluency, <lb/>
            and every kind of embellishment of language. As De- <lb/>
            mosthenes, who, as we learn from the Athenian records, <lb/>
            whenever he was going to speak, drew together a vast <lb/>
            concourse of people from the whole of Greece, who assem- <lb/>
            bled for the sake of hearing him; and Callistratus, who, <lb/>
            when summing up his noble pleading on the subject of <lb/>
            Oropus in Euboea, produced such an impression that that <lb/>
            same Demosthenes quitted the academy, at the time when <lb/>
            Plato was at its head, to become his follower. And <lb/>
            Hyperides, and Æschines, and Andocides, and Dinarchus, <lb/>
            and Antiphon the Rhamnusian, who is the first man <lb/>
            spoken of in ancient history as having received a fee for <lb/>
            pleading a cause.</p>
          <p>6. And similarly among the Romans, the Rutilii, and <lb/>
            Galbæ, and Scauri, men of eminent reputation for purity <lb/>
            of life and manners, and for frugality; and in the suc- <lb/>
            ceeding generations, many men of censorian and consular <lb/>
            rank, and even many who had celebrated triumphs, such <note type="footnote">1 As at Athens, where the orators were only allowed to speak as <lb/>
            long as an hour-glass, filled with water, was running down. </note> <pb n="555"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            as the Crassi, the Antonii, the Philippi, the Scævolæ, <lb/>
            and numbers of others, after having commanded armies <lb/>
            with glory, gained victories, and raised trophies, became <lb/>
            eminent also for their civil services to the State, and won <lb/>
            fresh laurels by their noble contests at the bar, thus <lb/>
            reaping the highest honour and glory.</p>
          <p>7. And after them Cicero, the most excellent of them <lb/>
            all who repeatedly saved many who were in distress <lb/>
            from the scorching flames of judgment by the stream of <lb/>
            his imperious eloquence, used to affirm that if men <lb/>
            could not be defended without their advocate incurring <lb/>
            blame, they certainly could not be carelessly defended <lb/>
            without his being guilty of crime."</p>
          <p>8. But now throughout all the regions of the East one <lb/>
            may see the most violent and rapacious classes of men <lb/>
            hovering about the courts of law, and besieging the <lb/>
            houses of the rich like Spartan or Cretan hounds, cun- <lb/>
            ningly pursuing different traces, in order to create the <lb/>
            occasion of a lawsuit.</p>
          <p>9. Of these the chief is that tribe of men who, sowing <lb/>
            every variety of strife and contest in thousands of actions, <lb/>
            wear out the doorposts of widows and the thresholds <lb/>
            of orphans, and create bitter hatred among friends, rela- <lb/>
            tions, or connections, who have any disagreement, if they <lb/>
            can only find the least pretext for a quarrel. And in <lb/>
            these men, the progress of age does not cool their vices <lb/>
            as it does those of others, but only hardens and strengthens <lb/>
            them. And amid all their plunder they are insatiable <lb/>
            and yet poor, whetting the edge of their genius in order <lb/>
            by their crafty orations to catch the ear of the judges, <lb/>
            though the very title of those magistrates is derived from <lb/>
            the name of Justice.</p>
          <p>10. In the pertinacity of these men rashness assumes the <lb/>
            disguise of freedom-headlong audacity seeks to be taken <lb/>
            for constancy, and an empty fluency of language usurps <lb/>
            the name of eloquence-by which perverse arts, as Cicero <lb/>
            tells us, it is a shame for the holy gravity of a judge to <lb/>
            be deceived. For he says, " And as nothing in a republic <lb/>
            ought to be so incorruptible as a suffrage or a sentence, <lb/>
            I do not understand why the man who corrupts such <lb/>
            things with money is to be esteemed worthy of punish- <lb/>
            ment, while he who perverts them by eloquence receives <pb n="556"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. IV."/> <lb/>
            commendation. In fact, the latter appears to me to do <lb/>
            the most harm, it being worse to corrupt a judge by a <lb/>
            speech than by a bribe, inasmuch as no one can corrupt <lb/>
            a wise man with a bribe, though it is possible that he <lb/>
            may with eloquence.</p>
          <p>11. There is a second class of those men who, professing <lb/>
            the science of the law, especially the interpretation of <lb/>
            conflicting and obsolete statutes, as if they had a bridle <lb/>
            placed in their mouths, keep a resolute silence, in which <lb/>
            they rather resemble their shadows than themselves. <lb/>
            These, like those men who cast nativities or interpret the <lb/>
            oracles of the sibyl, compose their countenances to a sort <lb/>
            of gravity, and then make money of their supine drowsi- <lb/>
            ness.</p>
          <p>12. And that they may appear to have a more profound <lb/>
            knowledge of the laws, they speak of Trebatius,' and <lb/>
            Cascellius, and Alfenus, and of the laws of the Aurunci <lb/>
            and Sicani, which have long become obsolete, and have <lb/>
            been buried ages ago with the mother of Evander. And <lb/>
            if you should pretend to have deliberately murdered your <lb/>
            mother, they will promise you that there are many <lb/>
            cases recorded in abstruse works which will secure your <lb/>
            acquittal, if you are rich enough to pay for it.</p>
          <p>13. There is a third class of these men, who, to arrive <lb/>
            at distinction in a turbulent profession, sharpen their <lb/>
            mercenary mouths to mystify the truth, and by prostitut- <lb/>
            ing their countenances and their vile barking, work their <lb/>
            way with the public. These men, whenever the judge is <lb/>
            embarrassed and perplexed, entangle the matter before <lb/>
            him with further difficulties, and take pains to prevent <lb/>
            any arrangement, carefully involving every suit in knotty <lb/>
            subtleties. When these courts, however, go on rightly, <lb/>
            they are temples of equity ; but when they are perverted <lb/>
            they are hidden and treacherous pitfalls, and if any person <lb/>
            falls into them, he will not escape till after many years <lb/>
            have elapsed, and till he himself has been sucked dry to <lb/>
            his very marrow.</p>
          <p>14. There is a fourth and last class, impudent, saucy, <lb/>
            and ignorant, consisting of those men who, having left <note type="footnote">1 All these men are spoken of by Horace as distinguished lawyers <lb/>
            in his time. </note> <pb n="557"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A. D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            school too early, run about the comers of cities, giving <lb/>
            more time to farces than to the study of actions and <lb/>
            defences, wearing out the doors of the rich, and hunting <lb/>
            for the luxuries of banquets and rich food.</p>
          <p>15. And when they have given themselves up to <lb/>
            gains, and to the task of hunting for money by every <lb/>
            means, they incite men, on any small pretence what- <lb/>
            ever, to go to law; and if they are permitted to defend <lb/>
            a cause, which but seldom happens, it is not till they are <lb/>
            before the judge, while the pleadings are being recited, <lb/>
            that they begin to inquire into the cause of the client, <lb/>
            or even into his name; and then they so overflow with <lb/>
            a heap of unarranged phrases and circumlocutions, that <lb/>
            from the noise and jabber of the vile medley you would <lb/>
            fancy you were listening to Thersites.</p>
          <p>16. But when it happens that they have no single <lb/>
            allegation they can establish, they then resort to an <lb/>
            unbridled licence of abuse; for which conduct they are <lb/>
            continually brought to trial themselves, and convicted, <lb/>
            when they have poured ceaseless abuse upon people of <lb/>
            honour; and some of these men are so ignorant that they <lb/>
            do not appear ever to have read any books.</p>
          <p>17. And if in a company of learned men the name of <lb/>
            any ancient author is ever mentioned, they fancy it to be <lb/>
            some foreign name of a fish or other eatable. And if any <lb/>
            stranger asks (we will say) for Marcianus, as one with <lb/>
            whom he is as yet unacquainted, they all at once pretend <lb/>
            that their name is Marcianus.</p>
          <p>18. Nor do they pay the slightest attention to what is <lb/>
            right; but as if they had been sold to and become the <lb/>
            property of Avarice, they know nothing but a boundless <lb/>
            licence in asking. And if they catch any one in their toils, <lb/>
            they entangle him in a thousand meshes, pretending sick- <lb/>
            ness by way of protracting the consultations. And to pro- <lb/>
            duce an useless recital of some well-known law, they <lb/>
            prepare seven costly methods of introducing it, thus weav- <lb/>
            ing infinite complications and delays.</p>
          <p>19. And when at last days and months and years have <lb/>
            been passed in these proceedings, and the parties to the <lb/>
            suit are exhausted, and the whole matter in dispute is <lb/>
            worn out with age, then these men, as if they were the <lb/>
            very heads of their profession, often introduce sham <pb n="558"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH.IV."/> <lb/>
            advocates along with themselves. And when they have <lb/>
            arrived within the bar, and the fortune or safety of some <lb/>
            one is at stake, and they ought to labour to ward off the <lb/>
            sword of the executioner from some innocent man, or <lb/>
            calamity and ruin, then, with wrinkled brows, and arms <lb/>
            thrown about with actor-like gestures, so that they want <lb/>
            nothing but the flute of Gracchus at their back,' then <lb/>
            they keep silence for some time on both sides; and at <lb/>
            last, after a scene of premeditated collusion, some plau- <lb/>
            sible preamble is pronounced by that one of them who <lb/>
            is most confident in his power of speaking, and who <lb/>
            promises an oration which shall rival the beauties of the <lb/>
            oration for Cluentius2 or for Ctesiphon.3 And then, when <lb/>
            all are eager for him to make an end, he concludes his pre- <lb/>
            amble with a statement that the chief advocates have as <lb/>
            yet only had three years since the commencement of the <lb/>
            suit to prepare themselves to conduct it; and so obtains <lb/>
            an adjournment, as if they had to wrestle with the ancient <lb/>
            Antæus, while still they resolutely demand the pay due <lb/>
            for their arduous labours.</p>
          <p>20. And yet, in spite of all these things, advocates are <lb/>
            not without some inconveniences, which are hard to be <lb/>
            endured by one who would live uprightly. For being <lb/>
            allured by small gains, they quarrel bitterly among <lb/>
            themselves, and offend numbers by the insane ferocity of <lb/>
            their evil speaking, which they pour forth when they are <lb/>
            unable to maintain the weakness of the case intrusted <lb/>
            to them by any sound reasoning.</p>
          <p>21. And sometimes the judges prefer persons who have <lb/>
            been instructed in the quibbles of Philistion or iEsop, <lb/>
            to those who come from the school of Aristides the Just, <lb/>
            or of Cato—men who, having bought public offices for <lb/>
            large sums of money, proceed like troublesome creditors <lb/>
            to hunt out every one's fortune, and so shake booty for <lb/>
            themselves out of the laps of others.</p>
          <p>22. Finally, the profession of a lawyer, besides other <lb/>
            things, has in it this, which is most especially formidable <lb/>
            and serious (and this quality is almost innate in all liti- <note type="footnote">1 See Cicero, de Oratore iii. 60. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Speech of Cicero pro Ccelio Cluentio. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The celebrated speech of Demosthenes, more usually known as <lb/>

            gants), namely that when, through one or other out of a <lb/>
            thousand accidents, they have lost their action, they fancy <lb/>
            that everything which turned out wrong was owing to the <lb/>
            conduct of their counsel, and they usually attribute the <lb/>
            loss of every suit to him, and are angry, not with the weak- <lb/>
            ness of their case or (as they often might he) with the <lb/>
            partiality of the judge, but only with their advocate. Let <lb/>
            us now return to the affairs from which we have thus <lb/>
            digressed.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AT the beginning of the spring Valentinian quitted <lb/>
            Treves, and proceeded by rapid marches along the usual <lb/>
            high roads. And as he approached the districts to which <lb/>
            he was hastening, he was met by ambassadors from the <lb/>
            Sarmatians, who threw themselves at his feet, and, with <lb/>
            prayers, breathing no wish but for peace, entreated him <lb/>
            to be favourable and merciful to them, assuring him that <lb/>
            he would not find any of their countrymen implicated in <lb/>
            or privy to any evil action.</p>
          <p>2. And when they had frequently repeated this asser- <lb/>
            tion, he, after careful deliberation, made answer to them, <lb/>
            that these matters must be diligently inquired into by an <lb/>
            accurate investigation in the district where they were <lb/>
            said to have happened, and if they had happened, then <lb/>
            they must be punished. After this, when he had reached <lb/>
            Carnuntum, a city of the Illyrians, now indeed In a <lb/>
            desolate and ruinous state, but still very convenient for <lb/>
            the general of an army, he from thence sallied out when- <lb/>
            ever either chance or skill afforded him an opportunity; <lb/>
            and by the possession of this post in their neighbourhood, <lb/>
            he checked the inroads of the barbarians.</p>
          <p>3. And although he alarmed all people in that district, <lb/>
            since it was expected that, as a man of active and impetu- <lb/>
            ous feelings, he would speedily command the judges to be <lb/>
            condemned through whose perfidy or desertion the empire <lb/>
            had been left undefended on the side of the Pannonians, <lb/>
            yet when he did arrive he was so lukewarm in the busi- <lb/>
            ness that he neither inquired into the death of the king <lb/>
            Gabricius, nor did he make any accurate investigation into <pb n="560"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. V."/> <lb/>
            the calamities which the republic had sustained, with a <lb/>
            view to learning through whose misconduct or negli- <lb/>
            gence these events had taken place; so that in fact, <lb/>
            in proportion as he was severe in punishing his common <lb/>
            soldiers, he was remiss in correcting (even by harsh <lb/>
            words) those of higher rank.</p>
          <p>4. The only person whom he pursued with any especial <lb/>
            hatred was Probus; whom from the first moment that he <lb/>
            saw him he never ceased to threaten, and to whom he <lb/>
            never softened; and the causes of this animosity against <lb/>
            him were not obscure nor trivial. When Probus first <lb/>
            obtained the rank of prefect of the prætorium, the power <lb/>
            of which he was continually labouring to extend by all . <lb/>
            kinds of means (I wish I could say by all lawful means), <lb/>
            he forgot the lessons which he might have learnt from his <lb/>
            illustrious descent, and devoted himself more to flattery <lb/>
            than to modesty.</p>
          <p>5. For reflecting on the resolution of the emperor, who <lb/>
            considered nothing but how he might amass money from <lb/>
            all quarters, without any distinction between just and <lb/>
            unjust actions; he never attempted to lead back the mis- <lb/>
            guided prince into the path of equity, as mild and wise <lb/>
            rulers often have done; but rather followed his lead <lb/>
            through all his winding and tortuous paths.</p>
          <p>6. And to this conduct were owing the heavy dis- <lb/>
            tresses which afflicted the emperor's subjects; the ruin- <lb/>
            ous titles, privileges, and exemptions, which alike ate <lb/>
            up the fortunes of poor and rich; under different pretexts <lb/>
            which were produced, each more powerful than the other, <lb/>
            as the fruit of a long experience in injuring. Lastly, <lb/>
            the burdens of all tributes and taxes were augmented in a <lb/>
            manifold degree ; and drove some of the highest nobles from <lb/>
            fear of the worst to emigrate from their homes; some also <lb/>
            after being drained to the utmost by the cruelty of the <lb/>
            revenue officers, as they really had nothing more to give, <lb/>
            were thrown into prison, of which they became permanent <lb/>
            inmates. And some, becoming weary of life and light, <lb/>
            sought a release from their miseries by hanging them- <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>7. Unvarying report made known the treacherous and <lb/>
            inhuman character of these transactions; but Valentinian, <lb/>
            as if his ears bad been stopped with wax, was ignorant of <pb n="561"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            the report, being eager to acquire money indiscriminately, <lb/>
            even from the most trivial sources, and thinking only of <lb/>
            what was presented to him; though he would perhaps <lb/>
            have spared the Pannonian provinces, if he had earlier <lb/>
            known of these melancholy sources of gain with which he <lb/>
            became acquainted when it was too late, owing to the <lb/>
            following occurrence:-</p>
          <p>8. Following the example of the inhabitants of other <lb/>
            provinces, the people of Epirus were compelled by the <lb/>
            prefect to send envoys to thank him, and a certain philo- <lb/>
            sopher named Iphicles, a man of tried courage and mag- <lb/>
            nanimity (who was very unwilling to undertake the com- <lb/>
            mission), was elected to discharge that duty.</p>
          <p>9. And when he saw the emperor, having been recog- <lb/>
            nized by him and questioned as to the cause of his arrival, <lb/>
            he answered in Greek; and, like a philosopher who pro- <lb/>
            fessed himself a votary of truth, when the prince inquired <lb/>
            more precisely, if those who had sent him did really <lb/>
            think well of the prefect, he replied, that they had sent <lb/>
            him against their will, and with bitter groans.</p>
          <p>10. The emperor, stricken by this speech as by an <lb/>
            arrow, now investigated his actions like a sagacious beast, <lb/>
            inquiring of him, in his own language, about different <lb/>
            persons whom he knew : for instance, where was this man <lb/>
            or that man (mentioning some one of high reputation and <lb/>
            honour, or some very rich man, or some other person well <lb/>
            known as having filled some high office). And when he <lb/>
            learnt that this man had been hanged, that that one had <lb/>
            been banished beyond the seas, and that a third had killed <lb/>
            himself or had expired under torture, he became furiously <lb/>
            angry, while Leo, who was at that time master of the <lb/>
            offices, added fuel to his passion—O shameful villany ! <lb/>
            Leo, it should be borne in mind, was at this very time <lb/>
            secretly aiming at the prefecture; and had he obtained that <lb/>
            office and authority, he would undoubtedly have governed <lb/>
            with such audacity, that the administration of Probus <lb/>
            would in comparison have been extolled as a model of <lb/>
            justice and humanity.</p>
          <p>11. So the emperor remained at Carnuntum; and dur- <lb/>
            ing the three summer months he occupied himself uninter- <lb/>
            ruptedly in preparing arms and magazines, in the hope <note type="footnote"> 2o </note> <pb n="562"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. Cn. v "/>that chance might afford him a good opportunity of making <lb/>
            use of them; intending to take a favourable season for <lb/>
            attacking the Quadi, who had lately caused an atrocious <lb/>
            disturbance; since in their chief town, Faustinus, the <lb/>
            nephew of Juventius, the prefect of the prætorium, who <lb/>
            had attained the rank of military secretary, was tortured <lb/>
            and then put to death by the executioners, under the <lb/>
            very eyes of Probus; having been accused of slaying an <lb/>
            ass in some magical operation, as his enemies asserted; <lb/>
            but he himself said it was to use for strengthening his <lb/>
            hair, which was beginning to fall off.</p>
          <p>12. Another charge was also maliciously brought against <lb/>
            nim, namely, that when a person of the name of Nigrinns <lb/>
            had in jest asked him to make him a secretary, he replied <lb/>
            in ridicule of the man and his petition, " Make me emperor <lb/>
            if you wish to obtain that." And because some gave an <lb/>
            unfair interpretation to this jest, Faustinus himself, and <lb/>
            Nigrinus, and several other persons were put to death.</p>
          <p>13. Accordingly, having sent forward Merobaudes with <lb/>
            a strong force of infantry under his command, and Sebas- <lb/>
            tian for his collcague, to ravage the districts of the bar- <lb/>
            barians with fire and sword, Valentinian speedily moved <lb/>
            his camp to Buda; and having with great rapidity made <lb/>
            a bridge of boats in order to guard against any sudden <lb/>
            mishap, he crossed the river in another place and entered <lb/>
            the territories of the Quadi, who from their precipitous <lb/>
            mountains were watching for his approach; the main body <lb/>
            of their nation, in their perplexity and uncertainty of what <lb/>
            might happen, had taken refuge with their families in <lb/>
            those hills; but were overwhelmed with consternation <lb/>
            when they unexpectedly saw the imperial standards in <lb/>
            their country.</p>
          <p>14. Valentinian advanced with as much rapidity as he <lb/>
            could, slaughtering every one of whatever age whom his <lb/>
            sudden inroad surprised straggling about the country, and <lb/>
            after burning all their dwellings, he returned safe without <lb/>
            having experienced the slightest loss. And then, as autumn <lb/>
            was now on the wane, he stopped awhile at Buda, seeking <lb/>
            where best to fix his winter quarters in a region subject <lb/>
            to very rigorous frost. And he could not find any suitable <lb/>
            place except Sabaria, though that town was at the time in <pb n="563"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            a very bad state of defence, having been ruined by free <lb/>
            quent sieges.</p>
          <p>15. Accordingly when he reached this place, though it <lb/>
            was one of great consequence to him, he remained there <lb/>
            but a very short time; and having left it, he marched along <lb/>
            the bank of the river, which he strengthened with several <lb/>
            forts and castles, and manned them with adequate garrisons. <lb/>
            He then proceeded to Bregitio; and in that town, after <lb/>
            settling down there in quiet, his Destiny, by numerous pro- <lb/>
            digies, portended to him his approaching fate.</p>
          <p>16. For a very few days before some of those comets, <lb/>
            which ever give token of the ruins of lofty fortunes, and <lb/>
            of which we have already explained the origin, appeared <lb/>
            in the heavens. Also, a short time before, a thunderbolt <lb/>
            fell at Sirmium, accompanied with a terrific clap of <lb/>
            thunder, and set fire to a portion of the palace and senate- <lb/>
            house : and much about the same time an owl settled <lb/>
            on the top of the royal baths at Sabaria, and pouring forth <lb/>
            a funeral strain, withstood all the attempts to slay it with <lb/>
            arrows or stones, however truly aimed, and though numbers <lb/>
            of people shot at it in diligent rivalry.</p>
          <p>17. And again, when the emperor was quitting the city <lb/>
            to return to the camp, he set out to leave it by the same <lb/>
            gate by which he had entered it, with the object of obtain- <lb/>
            ing an augury that he should speedily return to Gaul. But <lb/>
            the spot through neglect had become choked up with ruins; <lb/>
            and when they were cleaning it out they found that the <lb/>
            door, which had originally closed the entrance, had fallen <lb/>
            down: and a great multitude of people, though labouring <lb/>
            with all their might, were unable to remove it; so that <lb/>
            after waiting the greater part of the day there, he was <lb/>
            obliged at last to go out by another gate.</p>
          <p>18. And on the night preceding the day on which he <lb/>
            died, he saw in a dream, such as often visits a man in his <lb/>
            sleep, his absent wife sitting by, with dishevelled hair, <lb/>
            and clad in a mourning robe ; which some people fancied <lb/>
            was Fortune, who was about in this sad apparel to take her <lb/>
            leave of him.</p>
          <p>19. After this, when he came forth in the morning, his <lb/>
            brow was contracted, and his countenance somewhat <lb/>
            melancholy; and when his horse was brought to him, it <lb/>
            would not let him mount, but reared up its forefeet over <pb n="564"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. VI."/> <lb/>
            the shoulders of the equerry who was holding it. Valenti- <lb/>
            nian, according to the usual bent of his savage temper, <lb/>
            grew immoderately furious, and ordered the equerry's hand <lb/>
            to be cut off, which had, he said, pushed him aside when <lb/>
            mounting a horse he was used to: and the innocent youth <lb/>
            would have perished under torture if Cerealis, the prin- <lb/>
            cipal master of the horse, had not delayed the barbarous <lb/>
            infliction at his own risk.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. AFTER this event ambassadors arrived from the Quadi, <lb/>
            with humble supplications, entreating peace, and oblivion <lb/>
            of the past: and that there might be no obstacle to their <lb/>
            obtaining this, they promised to furnish a body of recruits, <lb/>
            and some other things which would be of use to the <lb/>
            Roman state.</p>
          <p>2. And after they had been received, and had obtained <lb/>
            permission to return with the grant of an armistice which <lb/>
            they had solicited (but in truth, our want of supplies and <lb/>
            the unfavourable season of the year prevented us from <lb/>
            harassing them any longer), they were, by the influence <lb/>
            of Equitius, who became security for their good behaviour, <lb/>
            admitted into the council-chamber. When introduced <lb/>
            they seemed quite overcome by fear, bowing down to the <lb/>
            ground; and on being ordered to unfold their message, they <lb/>
            urged all the customary pretences and excuses, confirm- <lb/>
            ing them by an oath; assuring the council that whatever <lb/>
            offence had been committed against any of our people, <lb/>
            had not been done by the consent of the nobles of the <lb/>
            nation, but only by some foreign banditti who dwelt on <lb/>
            the borders of the river; they added further, as a fact <lb/>
            quite sufficient to establish the truth of their allegations, <lb/>
            that the fortress which had been begun to be built both <lb/>
            unjustly and unreasonably, had inflamed the savage temper <lb/>
            of those rude men to a great pitch of ferocity.</p>
          <p>3. By this speech the emperor was excited to most <lb/>
            vehement wrath; and as he began to reply to it he grew <lb/>
            more indignant, reproaching the whole nation in bitter <lb/>
            language, as unmindful of kindness, and ungrateful. But <lb/>
            after a time he became pacified, and inclined to a milder <pb n="565"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            view of tie case, when suddenly, as if he had been stricken <lb/>
            from heaven, his breathing and his voice ceased, and his <lb/>
            countenance appeared blood-shot, and in a moment the <lb/>
            blood burst forth, and a deadly sweat broke forth over <lb/>
            his whole body; and to save him from falling down in the <lb/>
            sight of a number of low-born persons, he was led by his <lb/>
            servants into one of the private chambers in the interior of <lb/>
            the palace.</p>
          <p>4. \\ hen he was placed on his bed, breathing with <lb/>
            difficulty, though the vigour of his intellect was not as yet <lb/>
            at all diminished, he recognized those who stood around, <lb/>
            having been collected by the chamberlains with great <lb/>
            promptitude, to prevent any of them being suspected of <lb/>
            having murdered him. And as on account of the fever <lb/>
            which was racking his bowels it was necessary to open a <lb/>
            vein, yet no surgeon could be found, because he had dis- <lb/>
            persed them all over different districts to cure the soldiers <lb/>
            among whom a dangerous pestilence was raging.</p>
          <p>5. At last, however, one was procured; but though he <lb/>
            punctured a vein over and over again, he could not pro- <lb/>
            duce a single drop of blood, while all the time his bowels <lb/>
            were burning with the intensity of his fever; or (as some <lb/>
            fancied) because his limbs were wholly dried up, in con- <lb/>
            sequence of some of the passages, which we now call <lb/>
            hæmorrhoidal, were closed up and crusted over through <lb/>
            the severity of the cold.</p>
          <p>6. The emperor, from the exceeding violence of-his <lb/>
            agony, felt that the moment of his death was at hand; <lb/>
            and attempted to say something, and to give some orders, <lb/>
            as was indicated by a sobbing, which shook his whole <lb/>
            frame, a gnashing of the teeth, and a series of violent <lb/>
            gestures with his arms, resembling those of boxers with <lb/>
            the caestus : at last he became exhausted, and covered all <lb/>
            over with livid spots, and after a severe struggle he <lb/>
            expired, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, having reigned <lb/>
            twelve years all but a hundred days.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THIS is a seasonable opportunity to do as we have <lb/>
            often done before, namely, to retrace from the original <pb n="566"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. VII."/> <lb/>
            appearance of the father of this emperor down to the time <lb/>
            of his own death, all his actions, just touching on them <lb/>
            cursorily with a brief mention, not omitting to distinguish <lb/>
            between his vices and his virtues, both of which his lofty <lb/>
            position held np to the world; being a condition which <lb/>
            naturally reveals the inward disposition of every man.</p>
          <p>2. The elder Gratian was born at Cibalæ, a town of <lb/>
            Pannonia, of a mean family; and from his childhood he <lb/>
            received the surname of Funarius, because, while still very <lb/>
            young, while he was carrying about a rope (funem) for <lb/>
            sale, he resisted the attempt of five soldiers who laboured <lb/>
            with all their might to take it from him: thus rivalling <lb/>
            Milo of Crotona, from whom no amount of strength could <lb/>
            ever wrest an apple, whether he held it in his right or his <lb/>
            left hand.</p>
          <p>3. Therefore, on account of his exceeding personal <lb/>
            strength, and his skill in wrestling after the military <lb/>
            fashion, he became well known to many persons, was pro- <lb/>
            moted to the rank of an officer of the guard, then to the <lb/>
            post of tribune : after this he was made count, and sent <lb/>
            to command the forces in Africa: but there he was suspected <lb/>
            of theft; and having quitted that province, he was some <lb/>
            time afterwards sent to command the army in Britain, with <lb/>
            the same authority which he had enjoyed in Africa. At <lb/>
            length he received an honourable discharge from military <lb/>
            service, and returned home; and while living there <lb/>
            in quiet, he suddenly had all his property confiscated by <lb/>
            Constantius, on the ground that, when the civil discord <lb/>
            was at its height, lie was said to have received Magnentius <lb/>
            as a guest when passing through his land to carry his <lb/>
            designs into execution.</p>
          <p>4. The merits of Gratian brought Valentinian into notice <lb/>
            from his early youth; and, indeed, he was further aided <lb/>
            by his own eminent qualities; so that he received the orna- <lb/>
            ments of the imperial majesty at Nicæa; when he also <lb/>
            made his brother Valens his colleague, as one bound to <lb/>
            him not only by his relationship as a brother, but also <lb/>
            by the most perfect agreement—Valens, as we shall show <lb/>
            at a suitable time, being made up almost equally of vices <lb/>
            and of virtues.</p>
          <p>5. Therefore Valentinian, after having experienced many <lb/>
            dangers and much distress as a private individual, as soon <pb n="567"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            as he began to reign went to visit the towns and cities <lb/>
            which were situated on the rivers; and repaired to Gaul, <lb/>
            which was exposed to the inroads of the Allemanni, who <lb/>
            had begun to recover their courage and to reassume an <lb/>
            imposing attitude since they had heard of the death of the <lb/>
            Emperor Julian—the only prince whom they had feared <lb/>
            since the time of Constans.</p>
          <p>6. And Valentinian was deservedly dreaded by them <lb/>
            because he took care to keep up the numbers of his army <lb/>
            by strong reinforcements, and because also he fortified <lb/>
            both banks of the Rhine with lofty fortresses and castles, <lb/>
            to prevent the enemy from ever passing over into our <lb/>
            territory without being perceived.</p>
          <p>7. We may pass over many circumstances, and many <lb/>
            acts which he performed with the authority of an emperor <lb/>
            whose power was fully established, and many of the <lb/>
            reforms which he either effected himself, or caused to be <lb/>
            carried out by his vigorous lieutenants. But we must <lb/>
            record how, after he had raised his son Gratian to a <lb/>
            partnership in the imperial authority, he contrived the <lb/>
            secret murder of Vithigabius, the king of the Allemanni, <lb/>
            and the son of Vadomarius, a young man in the flower of <lb/>
            youth, who was actively stirring up the surrounding <lb/>
            nations to tumults and wars; doing this because he found <lb/>
            it impossible to procure his death openly. How also he <lb/>
            fought a battle against the Allemanni near Solicinium, <lb/>
            where he was nearly circumvented and slain by the <lb/>
            manoeuvres of the enemy; but where at last he utterly <lb/>
            destroyed their whole army with the exception of a few <lb/>
            who saved themselves by the aid of the darkness which <lb/>
            assisted the rapidity of their flight.</p>
          <p>8. Amid all these prudent actions he also turned his <lb/>
            attention to the Saxons who had lately broken out with <lb/>
            extreme ferocity, making attacks in every direction where <lb/>
            they were least expected, and had now penetrated into <lb/>
            the inland districts, from which they were returning <lb/>
            enriched by a vast booty. He destroyed them utterly by <lb/>
            a device which was indeed treacherous, but most advan- <lb/>
            tageous ; and he recovered by force all the booty which <lb/>
            the defeated robbers were carrying off.</p>
          <p>9. Nor did he disregard the condition of the Britons, <lb/>
            who were unable to make head against the vast hosts of <pb n="568"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. VIII."/> <lb/>
            their enemies, who were overrunning their country; <lb/>
            he revived their hopes of better fortune, and re-esta- <lb/>
            blished liberty and steady tranquillity among them ; rout- <lb/>
            ing their invaders so completely that scarcely any of them <lb/>
            returned to their own country.</p>
          <p>10. With similar vigour he crushed Valentinus the <lb/>
            Pannonian exile (who was labouring to disturb the general <lb/>
            tranquillity in that province), before his enterprise could <lb/>
            become dangerous. He also delivered Africa from great <lb/>
            dangers at a time when it was thrown into confusion by <lb/>
            an unexpected disaster : when Firmus, unable to bear the <lb/>
            greediness and arrogance of the soldiers, was exciting the <lb/>
            people of Mauritania to every kind of discord and disturb- <lb/>
            ance. With similar resolution would he have avenged the <lb/>
            disasters sustained in Illyricum, had be not left that im- <lb/>
            portant duty uncompleted, in consequence of being thus <lb/>
            cut off by a premature death.</p>
          <p>11. And although these various achievements, which <lb/>
            we have here recorded, were consummated by the assist- <lb/>
            ance of his admirable generals, yet it is very notorious <lb/>
            that he himself also performed many considerable exploits; <lb/>
            being a man fertile in resources, and of long experience <lb/>
            and great skill in military affairs : and certainly it would <lb/>
            have been an admirable crown to his great actions if he had <lb/>
            been able to take King Macrianus alive, who at that time <lb/>
            was a very formidable sovereign; nevertheless he exerted <lb/>
            great energy in attempting to do so, after he heard that <lb/>
            he had escaped from the Burgundians, whom he himself <lb/>
            had led against the Allemanni; and the certainty of his <lb/>
            escape was to him a cause of great sorrow and indignation.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. THUS have I rapidly Tun over the different actions of <lb/>
            this prince. Now, relying on the certainty that posterity, <lb/>
            inasmuch as it is free both from fear and from base flattery, <lb/>
            is usually an honest judge of all past transactions, I will <lb/>
            rapidly run over his vices, intending afterwards to relate <lb/>
            his good qualities.</p>
          <p>2. Sometimes he put on an affectation of clemency, <lb/>
            though the bent of his natural disposition inclined him <lb/>
            more to cruelty: forgetful forsooth, that by a man who <pb n="569"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            governs a vast empire extremes of every kind are to be <lb/>
            avoided as rocks by a mariner.</p>
          <p>3. Nor indeed was he ever found to be contented with <lb/>
            moderate punishments, but was continually commanding <lb/>
            cruel tortures to be multiplied; so that many, after under- <lb/>
            going this murderous kind of examination, were brought <lb/>
            to death's door. And he was so eager to inflict injury, <lb/>
            that he never once saved any one who had been condemned <lb/>
            to death, by a milder sentence, though even the most in- <lb/>
            human of emperors have sometimes done so.</p>
          <p>4.-And yet he might have reflected on many examples <lb/>
            in former ages; and he might have imitated the many <lb/>
            models of humanity and of piety which he could have <lb/>
            found both among natives of the empire and among <lb/>
            those of foreign extraction (and humanity and piety are <lb/>
            defined by philosophers to be qualities nearly akin). Of <lb/>
            such instances it will suffice to enumerate these which <lb/>
            follow :—Artaxerxes, that very powerful king of Persia, to <lb/>
            whom the great length of one of his limbs caused the name <lb/>
            of Longhand to be given, wishing, through the natural lenity <lb/>
            of his disposition, to reprove the varieties of punishment <lb/>
            in which his nation, always cruel, had hitherto delighted, <lb/>
            punished some criminals by taking off their turbans instead <lb/>
            of their heads : and instead of the old royal fashion of <lb/>
            cutting off people's ears for their offences, he used to cut <lb/>
            the tassels which hang from their caps. And this modera- <lb/>
            tion and lenity made him so popular and respected that <lb/>
            all the Grecian writers vie with each other in celebrating <lb/>
            his many admirable actions.</p>
          <p>5. Again, when Prænestinus was prætor, and was brought <lb/>
            before the court of justice, because, in the Samnite war, <lb/>
            when ordered to march with all speed to reinforce the <lb/>
            army, he had been very dilatory in his movements, <lb/>
            Papirius Cursor, who at that time was dictator, ordered <lb/>
            the lictor to get ready his axe; and when the prætor, <lb/>
            having discarded all hope of being able to clear himself, <lb/>
            seemed utterly stupefied at the order, he commanded the <lb/>
            lictor to cut down a shrub close by; and having in this <lb/>
            jocular manner reproved him, he let him go: without <lb/>
            himself incurring any disrespect by so doing, since all <lb/>
            knew him for a man who, by his own unassisted vigour, <lb/>
            had brought long and dangerous wars to a happy termina- <pb n="570"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. VIII."/> <lb/>
            tion; and had been the only man reckoned able to resist <lb/>
            Alexander the Great if that prince had invaded Italy.</p>
          <p>6. Valentinian, perhaps, was ignorant of these models; <lb/>
            and as lie never considered that the mercy of the emperor <lb/>
            is always the best comfort of persons in distress, he in- <lb/>
            creased all punishments by his free use of both fire and <lb/>
            sword : punishments which the merciful disposition of our <lb/>
            ancestors looked upon as the very last resource in the <lb/>
            most imminent dangers-as we may learn from the beau- <lb/>
            tiful sentiment of lsocrates. who continually insists that <lb/>
            we ought rather to pardon a king who is sometimes de- <lb/>
            feated in war, than one who is ignorant of justice.</p>
          <p>7. And it was under the influence of this saying of his <lb/>
            that I imagine Cicero uttered that admirable sentence, in <lb/>
            his defence of Oppius: “That indeed to have greatly con- <lb/>
            tributed to the safety of one other person was an honour <lb/>
            to many ; but that to have had no share in injuring others <lb/>
            had never been thought discreditable to any one.,,</p>
          <p>8. A desire of increasing his riches without any regard <lb/>
            to right and wrong, and of hunting out every kind of source <lb/>
            of gain, even at the cost of other people's lives, raged in <lb/>
            this emperor to a most excessive degree, and never flagged. <lb/>
            Some, indeed, attempted to excuse it by pleading the <lb/>
            example of the Emperor Aurelian; affirming that as he, <lb/>
            after the death of Gallienus and the lamentable dis- <lb/>
            asters which the republic suffered at that time, finding <lb/>
            his treasury totally exhausted, fell upon the rich like a <lb/>
            torrent, so Valentinian also, after the losses which he <lb/>
            sustained in his Parthian campaign, being reduced to <lb/>
            want by the greatness of his expenses, in order to procure <lb/>
            reinforcements for his army and pay for his troops, mingled <lb/>
            with his severity a desire of collecting excessive wealth. <lb/>
            Pretending not to know that there are some things which, <lb/>
            although strictly speaking lawful, still ought not to be <lb/>
            done. In this he was very unlike the celebrated The- <lb/>
            mistocles of old times, who, when strolling carelessly about <lb/>
            after he had destroyed the Persian host in the battle of <lb/>
            Salamis, and seeing a number of golden armlets and chains <lb/>
            lying on the ground, said to one of his companions who <lb/>
            was by—“ You may take up these things because you are <lb/>
            not Themistocles," thinking it became a magnanimous <lb/>
            general to spurn any idea of personal gain. <pb n="571"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="E.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            9. Many examples of similar moderation abound in the <lb/>
            Roman generals; and without stopping to enumerate <lb/>
            them, since such acts are not indications of perfect virtue <lb/>
            (for indeed it is no great glory to abstain from carrying <lb/>
            off other persons' property), I will just mention one single <lb/>
            instance of the forbearance of people in general in this <lb/>
            respect in ancient times:- When Marius and Cinna had <lb/>
            given the Roman populace leave to plunder the wealthy <lb/>
            houses of certain persons whom they had proscribed, the <lb/>
            minds of the mob, who, however uncivilized they might <lb/>
            be, were accustomed to respect the rights of men, refused <lb/>
            to touch the produce of other men's labours; so that in <lb/>
            fact no one could be found so needy or so base as to be <lb/>
            willing to profit by the miseries of the state.</p>
          <p>10. Besides these things the aforesaid emperor was a <lb/>
            prey in his inmost heart to a devouring envy; and as he <lb/>
            knew that most vices put on a semblance of virtue, he used <lb/>
            to be fond of repeating, that severity is the inseparable <lb/>
            companion of lawful power. And as magistrates of the <lb/>
            highest rank are in the habit of thinking everything per- <lb/>
            mitted to them, and are always inclined to depress those <lb/>
            who oppose them, and to humiliate those who are above <lb/>
            them, so he hated all who were well dressed, or learned, <lb/>
            or opulent, or high born; and he was always disparaging <lb/>
            the brave, that he might appear to be the only person <lb/>
            eminent for virtue. And this is a vice which, as we read, <lb/>
            was very flagrant in the Emperor Hadrian.</p>
          <p>11. This same emperor used to be continually abusing <lb/>
            the timid, calling them sordid and base, and people who <lb/>
            deserved to be depressed below the very lowest of the low; <lb/>
            and yet he himself often grew pale, in the most abject <lb/>
            manner, with groundless fears, and often from the bottom <lb/>
            of his soul was terrified at things which had no existence <lb/>
            at all.</p>
          <p>12. Remigius, the master of the ceremonies, knowing <lb/>
            this, and also that Valentinian was used to get into furious <lb/>
            passions at every trifling incident, spread a report, among <lb/>
            other things, that some of the barbarians were in motion; <lb/>
            and the emperor, when he heard this, became at once so <lb/>
            broken-spirited through fear that he became as gentle and <lb/>
            merciful as Antoninus Pius.</p>
          <p>13. He never intentionally appointed unjust judges <pb n="572"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. IX."/> <lb/>
            but if he learned that those whom he had once promoted <lb/>
            were acting cruelly, he boasted that he had discovered <lb/>
            new Lycurguses and Cassiuses, those ancient pillars of <lb/>
            justice; and he used to be continually exhorting them by <lb/>
            his letters severely to chastise even the slightest errors.</p>
          <p>14. Nor had those who were under accusations, if any <lb/>
            misfortune fell upon them, any refuge in the kindness <lb/>
            of the prince; which ought to be, as it were, a desirable <lb/>
            haven to those tossed about in a stormy sea. For, as wise <lb/>
            men teach us, " The advantage and safety of the subject is <lb/>
            the true end of just government."</p>

          <p>§ 1. IT is natural for us, after discussing these topics, if we <lb/>
            would act fairly, now to come to his virtuous and laudable <lb/>
            actions; since if he had tempered his vices fairly with them <lb/>
            he would have been a second Trajan or Marcus Aurelius. <lb/>
            Towards the people of the provinces he was very conside- <lb/>
            rate, lightening the burden of their tributes throughout <lb/>
            the empire. He also exerted himself in a very beneficial <lb/>
            manner in building towns and strengthening the frontiers. <lb/>
            He was a strict observer of military discipline, erring only <lb/>
            in this respect, that while he punished even slight miscon- <lb/>
            duct on the part of the common soldiers, he allowed the <lb/>
            crimes of the officers of rank and of the generals to proceed <lb/>
            to greater and greater lengths, and shut his ears against <lb/>
            every complaint that was uttered against them. And this <lb/>
            partiality of his was the cause of the murmurs in Britain, <lb/>
            and the disasters in Africa, and the devastation of Illy- <lb/>
            ricum.</p>
          <p>2. He was, both at home and abroad, a strict observer of <lb/>
            modesty and chastity, keeping his conscience wholly free <lb/>
            from all taint of impurity or obscenity, and in consequence <lb/>
            he bridled the wantonness of the imperial court as with a <lb/>
            strong rein ; and he was the more easily able to do this be- <lb/>
            cause he had never shown any indulgence to his own rela- <lb/>
            tions, whom he either kept in obscurity, or (if he promoted <lb/>
            them at all) raised to a very moderate rank, with the excep- <lb/>
            tion of his brother, whom, in deference to the necessities of <lb/>
            the times, he made his partner in the imperial dignity.</p>
          <p>3. He was very scrupulous in giving high rank to any <lb/>
            one; nor, as long as he was emperor, did any one of the <pb n="573"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            moneyed interest become ruler of a province, nor was any <lb/>
            government sold, unless it was at the beginning of his <lb/>
            reign, when wicked actions were sometimes committed in <lb/>
            the hope that the new prince would be too much occupied <lb/>
            to punish them.</p>
          <p>4. In waging war, and in defending himself from <lb/>
            attacks, he was prudent and very skilful, like a veteran of <lb/>
            great experience in military affairs. He was a very wise <lb/>
            admirer of all that was good, and dissuader from all that <lb/>
            was bad; and a very accurate observer of all the details of <lb/>
            military service. He wrote with elegance, and described <lb/>
            everything with great neatness and skill in composition. <lb/>
            He was an inventor of new arms. He had an excellent <lb/>
            memory, and a fluent, easy style of speaking, which at <lb/>
            times bordered closely upon eloquence. He was a lover <lb/>
            of elegant simplicity, and was fond, not so much of profuse <lb/>
            banquets, as of entertainments directed by good taste.</p>
          <p>5. Lastly, he was especially remarkable during his <lb/>
            reign for his moderation in this particular, that he kept a <lb/>
            middle course between the different sects of religion; and <lb/>
            never troubled any one, nor issued any orders in favour of <lb/>
            one kind of worship or another; nor did he promulgate <lb/>
            any threatening edicts to bow down the necks of his <lb/>
            subjects to the form of worship to which he himself was <lb/>
            inclined; but he left these parties just as he found them, <lb/>
            without making any alterations.</p>
          <p>6. His body was muscular and strong: the brightness of <lb/>
            his hair-the brilliancy of his complexion, with his blue <lb/>
            eyes, which always looked askance with a stern aspect-the <lb/>
            beauty of his figure—his lofty stature, and the admirable <lb/>
            harmony of all his features—filled up the dignity and beauty <lb/>
            of an appearance which bespoke a monarch.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER the last honours had been paid to the emperor, <lb/>
            and his body had been prepared for burial, in order to be <lb/>
            sent to Constantinople to be there entombed among the <lb/>
            remains of former emperors, the campaign which was in <lb/>
            preparation was suspended, and people began to be anxious <lb/>
            as to what part would be taken by the Gallic cohorts, <lb/>
            who were not always steady in loyalty to the lawful <pb n="574"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXX. CH. X."/> <lb/>
            emperor, but looked upon themselves as the disposers of <lb/>
            power, and were regarded by others as very likely to ven- <lb/>
            ture on some new enterprise at so favourable a moment. <lb/>
            This circumstance also was likely to aid any attempt that <lb/>
            might be made at a revolution, that Gratian, who knew <lb/>
            nothing of what had taken place, was still at Treves, where <lb/>
            his father, when about to set out on his own expedition, <lb/>
            had desired him to wait.</p>
          <p>2. While affairs were in this state of uncertainty, and <lb/>
            when every one shared the same fears, looking on them- <lb/>
            selves as all in the same boat, and sure to be partners in <lb/>
            danger, if danger should arise, at last it was decided by <lb/>
            the advice of the principal nobles to take up the bridge <lb/>
            which had been necessarily made when they meditated <lb/>
            invading the territories of the enemy, in order that, in com- <lb/>
            pliance with the commands given by Valentinian while <lb/>
            alive, Merobaudes might be at once summoned to the <lb/>
            camp.</p>
          <p>3. He, being a man of great cunning and penetration, <lb/>
            divined what had happened (perhaps indeed he had been <lb/>
            informed of it by the messenger who brought him his <lb/>
            summons), and suspecting that the Gallic troops were <lb/>
            likely to break the existing concord, he pretended that a <lb/>
            token which had been agreed upon had been sent to him <lb/>
            that he was to return with the messenger to watch the <lb/>
            banks of the Rhine; since the fury of the barbarians was <lb/>
            again menacing hostilities, and (in compliance with a <lb/>
            secret injunction which he received at the same time) he <lb/>
            removed to a distance. Sebastian also as yet was ignorant <lb/>
            of the death of the emperor ; and he being an orderly and <lb/>
            quietly disposed man, but very popular among the soldiers, <lb/>
            required on that account to be strictly watched.</p>
          <p>4. Accordingly when Merobaudes had returned, the chief <lb/>
            men took careful counsel as to what was to be done; and <lb/>
            at last it was arranged that the child Valentinian, the son <lb/>
            of the deceased emperor, at that time a boy of four years <lb/>
            old, should be associated in the imperial power. He was <lb/>
            at present a hundred miles off, living with his mother, <lb/>
            Justina, in a small town called Murocincta.</p>
          <p>5. This decision was ratified by the unanimous consent <lb/>
            of all parties; and Cereal is, his uncle, was sent with speed <lb/>
            to Murocincta, where he placed the royal child on a litter. <pb n="575"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 374.]"/> <lb/>
            and so conducted him to the camp. On the sixth day after <lb/>
            his father's death, he was declared lawful emperor, and <lb/>
            saluted as Augustus with the usual solemnities.</p>
          <p>6. And although at the time many persons thought that <lb/>
            Gratian would be indignant that any one else had been <lb/>
            appointed emperor without his permission, yet afterwards, <lb/>
            when all fear and anxiety was removed, they lived in <lb/>
            greater security, because he, wise and kindhearted man as <lb/>
            he was, loved his young relative with exceeding affection, <lb/>
            and brought him up with great care.</p>

          <p>I. Omens announcing the death of the Emperor Valens, and a disaster <lb/>
            to be inflicted by the Gauls.—II. A description of the abodes and <lb/>
            customs of the Huns, the Alani, and other tribes, natives of Asiatic <lb/>
            Scythia.—III. The Huns, either by arms or by treaties, unite the <lb/>
            Alani on the Don to themselves ; invade the Goths, and drive <lb/>
            them from their country.—IV. The chief division of the Goths, <lb/>
            surnamed the Thuringians, having been expelled from their <lb/>
            homes, by permission of Valens are conducted by the Romans <lb/>
            into Thracc, on condition of promising obedience and a supply of <lb/>
            auxiliary troops. The Gruthungi also, who form the other divi- <lb/>
            sion of the Goths, secretly cross the Danube by a bridge of boats. <lb/>
            —V. The Thuringians being in great distress from hunger and <lb/>
            the want of supplies, under the command of their generals Ala- <lb/>
            vivus and Fritigern, revolt from Valens, and defeat Lupicinus and <lb/>
            his army.—VI. Why Sueridus and Colias. nobles of the Gothic <lb/>
            nation, after having been received in a friendly manner, revolted ; <lb/>
            and after slaying the people of Hadrianopolis, united themselves <lb/>
            to Fritigem, and then turned to ravage Thrace.—VII. Profuturus, <lb/>
            Trajan, and Richomeres fought a drawn battle against the Goths. <lb/>
            —VIII. The Goths being hemmed in among the defiles at the <lb/>
            bottom of the Balkan, after the Romans by returning had let them <lb/>
            escape, invaded Thrace, plundering, massacring, ravishing, and <lb/>
            burning, and slay Barzimeres, the tribune of the Scutarii.- <lb/>
            IX. Frigeridus, Gratian's general, routs Farnobius at the head <lb/>
            of a large body of Goths and Taifalæ; sparing the rest, and <lb/>
            giving them some lands around the Po.—X. The Lentiensian <pb n="576"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. L"/> <lb/>
            Alemanni are defeated in battle by the generals of the em- <lb/>
            peror Gratian, and their king Priamis is slain. Afterwards, having <lb/>
            yielded and furnished Gratian with a body of recruits, they are <lb/>
            allowed to return to their own country.—XI. Sebastian surprises <lb/>
            the Goths at Beræa as they are returning home loaded with plun- <lb/>
            der, and defeats them with great slaughter; a few saved them- <lb/>
            selves by flight. Gratian hastens to his uncle Valens, to carry <lb/>
            him aid against the Goths.—XII. Valens, before the arrival of <lb/>
            Gratian resolves to fight the Goths.—XIII. All the Goths unite <lb/>
            together, that is to say, the Thuringians, under their king Friti- <lb/>
            gern. The Gruthungi, under their dukes Alatheus and Salaces, <lb/>
            encounter the Romans in a pitched battle, rout their cavalry, and <lb/>
            then falling on the infantry when deprived of the support of their <lb/>
            horse, and huddled together in a dense body, they defeat them <lb/>
            with enormous loss, and put them to flight. Valens is slain, but <lb/>
            his body cannot be found.—XIV. The virtues and vices of Valens. <lb/>
            —XV. The victorious Goths besiege Hadrianopolis, where Valens <lb/>
            had left his treasures and his insignia of imperial rank, with the <lb/>
            prefect and the members of his council; but after trying every <lb/>
            means to take the city, without success, they at last retire.- <lb/>
            XVI. The Goths, having by bribes won over the forces of the <lb/>
            Huns and of the Alani to join them, make an attack upon Con- <lb/>
            stantinople without success. The device by which Julius, the <lb/>
            commander of the forces beyond Mount Taurus, delivered the <lb/>
            eastern provinces from the Goths.</p>

          <p>§1. IN the mean time the swift wheel of Fortune, which <lb/>
            continually alternates adversity with prosperity, was giving <lb/>
            Bellona the Furies for her allies, and arming her for war; <lb/>
            and now transferred our disasters to the East, as many <lb/>
            presages and portents foreshowed by undoubted signs.</p>
          <p>2. For after many true prophecies uttered by diviners and <lb/>
            augurs, dogs were seen to recoil from howling wolves, and the <lb/>
            birds of night constantly uttered querulous and mournful <lb/>
            cries; and lurid sunrises made the mornings dark. Also, <lb/>
            at Antioch, among the tumults and squabbles of the popu- <lb/>
            lace, it had come to be a custom for any one who fancied <lb/>
            himself ill treated to cry out in a licentious manner, " May <lb/>
            Valens be burnt alive!" And the voices of the criers were <lb/>
            constantly heard ordering wood to be carried to warm the <lb/>
            baths of Valens, which had been built under the super- <lb/>
            tendence of the emperor himself.</p>
          <p>3. All which circumstances all but pointed out in <lb/>
            express words that the end of the emperor’s life was at <pb n="577"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 375.]"/> <lb/>
            hand. Besides all these things, the ghost of the king of <lb/>
            Armenia, and the miserable shades of those who had lately <lb/>
            been put to death in the affair of Theodorus, agitated <lb/>
            numbers of people with terrible alarms, appearing to them <lb/>
            in their sleep, and shrieking out verses of horrible import.1</p>
          <p>4.... and its death indicated an extensive and general <lb/>
            calamity arising from public losses and deaths. Last of <lb/>
            all, when the ancient walls of Chalcedon were thrown <lb/>
            down in order to build a bath at Constantinople, and the <lb/>
            stones were torn asunder, on one squared stone which was <lb/>
            hidden in the very centre of the walls these Greek verses <lb/>
            were found engraved, which gave a full revelation of what <lb/>
            was to happen :— <figure type="illustration">

            And when these walls, with sad regrets, shall fall to raise a bath, <lb/>
            Then shall the Huns in multitude break forth with might and wrath. <lb/>
            By force of arms the barrier-stream of Ister they shall cross, <lb/>
            O'er Scythic ground and Mœsian lands spreading dismay and loss: <lb/>

          <p>§ 1. THE following circumstances were the original cause <lb/>
            of all the destruction and various calamities which the <lb/>
            fury of Mars roused up, throwing everything into confu- <lb/>
            sion by his usual ruinous violence: the people called <lb/>
            Huns, slightly mentioned in the ancient records, live be- <lb/>
            yond the Sea of Azov, on the border of the Frozen Ocean, <lb/>
            and are a race savage beyond all parallel.</p>
          <p>2. At the very moment of their birth the cheeks of their <lb/>
            infant children are deeply marked by an iron, in order <note type="footnote"> 1 The text is unusually mutilated here. It has been proposed to <lb/>
            insert, " A little goat with its throat cut was found dead in the street.” . </note> <note type="footnote"><unclear/> 2C </note> <pb n="578"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. E."/> <lb/>
            that the usual vigour of their hair, instead of growing at <lb/>
            the proper season, may be withered by the wrinkled scars; <lb/>
            and accordingly they grow up without beards, and conse- <lb/>
            quently without any beauty, like ennuchs, though they all <lb/>
            have closely-knit and strong limbs, and plump necks; <lb/>
            they are of great size, and low legged, so that you might <lb/>
            fancy them two-legged beasts, or the stout figures which <lb/>
            are hewn out in a rude manner with an axe on the posts at <lb/>
            the end of bridges.</p>
          <p>3. They are certainly in the shape of men, however <lb/>
            uncouth, but are so hardy that they neither require fire <lb/>
            nor well-flavoured food, but live on the roots of such <lb/>
            herbs as they get in the fields, or on the half-raw flesh <lb/>
            of any animal, which they merely warm rapidly by <lb/>
            placing it between their own thighs and the backs of <lb/>
            their horses.</p>
          <p>4. They never shelter themselves under roofed houses, <lb/>
            but avoid them as people ordinarily avoid sepulchres as <lb/>
            things not fitted for common use. Nor is there even to be <lb/>
            found among them a cabin thatched with reed; but they <lb/>
            wander about, roaming over the mountains and the woods, <lb/>
            and accustom themselves to bear frost and hunger and <lb/>
            thirst from their very cradles. And even when abroad <lb/>
            they never enter a house unless under the compulsion of <lb/>
            some extreme necessity; nor, indeed, do they think people <lb/>
            under roofs as safe as others.</p>
          <p>5. They wear linen clothes, or else garments made of the <lb/>
            skins of field-mice: nor do they wear a different dress out <lb/>
            of doors from that which they wear at home; but after a <lb/>
            tunic is once put round their necks, however it becomes <lb/>
            worn, it is never taken off or changed till, from long decay, <lb/>
            it becomes actually so ragged as to fall to pieces.</p>
          <p>6. They cover their heads with round caps, and their <lb/>
            shaggy legs with the skins of kids; their shoes are not <lb/>
            made on any lasts, but are so unshapely as to hinder them <lb/>
            from walking with a free gait. And for this reason they <lb/>
            are not well suited to infantry battles, but are nearly <lb/>
            always on horseback, their horses being ill-shaped, but <lb/>
            hardy; and sometimes they even sit upon them like <lb/>
            women if they want to do anything more conveniently. <lb/>
            There is not a person in the whole nation who cannot remain <lb/>
            on his horse day and night. On horseback they buy and <pb n="579"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 375.]"/> <lb/>
            sell, they take their meat and drink, and there they recline <lb/>
            on the narrow neck of their steed, and yield to sleep so <lb/>
            deep as to indulge in every variety of dream.</p>
          <p>7..And when any deliberation is to take place on any <lb/>
            weighty matter, they all hold their common council on <lb/>
            horseback. They are not under the authority of a king, <lb/>
            but are contented with the irregular government of their <lb/>
            nobles, and under their lead they force their way through <lb/>
            all obstacles.</p>
          <p>8. Sometimes when provoked, they fight; and when <lb/>
            they go into battle, they form in a solid body, and utter all <lb/>
            kinds of terrific yells. They are very quick in their <lb/>
            operations, of exceeding speed, and fond of surprising <lb/>
            their enemies. With a view to this, they suddenly dis- <lb/>
            perse, then reunite, and again, after having inflicted vast <lb/>
            loss upon the enemy, scatter themselves over the whole <lb/>
            plain in irregular formations: always avoiding a fort or an <lb/>
            entrenchment.</p>
          <p>9. And in one respect you may pronounce them the <lb/>
            most formidable of all warriors, for when at a distance <lb/>
            they use missiles of various kinds tipped with sharpened <lb/>
            bones instead of the usual points of javelins, and these <lb/>
            bones are admirably fastened into the shaft of the javelin <lb/>
            or arrow; but when they are at close quarters they fight <lb/>
            with the sword, without any regard for their own safety; <lb/>
            and often while their antagonists are warding off their <lb/>
            blows they entangle them with twisted cords, so that, their <lb/>
            hands being fettered, they lose all power of either riding <lb/>
            or walking.</p>
          <p>10. None of them plough, or even touch a plough-handle : <lb/>
            for they have no settled abode, but are homeless and law- <lb/>
            less, perpetually wandering with their waggons, which they <lb/>
            make their homes; in fact they seem to be people always • <lb/>
            in flight. Their wives live in these waggons, and there <lb/>
            weave their miserable garments; and here too they sleep <lb/>
            with their husbands, and bring up their children till they <lb/>
            reach the age of puberty; nor, if asked, can anyone of <lb/>
            them tell you where he was born, as he was conceived in <lb/>
            one place, born in another at a great distance, and brought <lb/>
            up in another still more remote.</p>
          <p>11. In truces they are treacherous and inconstant, being <lb/>
            liable to change their minds at every breeze of every fresh <pb n="580"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. II."/> <lb/>
            hope which presents itself, giving themselves up wholly <lb/>
            to the impulse and inclination of the moment; and, like <lb/>
            brute beasts, they are utterly ignorant of the distinction <lb/>
            between right and wrong. They express themselves with <lb/>
            great ambiguity and obscurity; have no respect for any <lb/>
            religion or superstition whatever; are immoderately covet- <lb/>
            ous of gold; and are so fickle and irascible, that they <lb/>
            very often on the same day that they quarrel with their <lb/>
            companions without any provocation, again become recon- <lb/>
            ciled to them without any mediator.</p>
          <p>12. This active and indomitable race, being excited by <lb/>
            an unrestrainable desire of plundering the possessions of <lb/>
            others, went on ravaging and slaughtering all the nations <lb/>
            in their neighbourhood till they reached the Alani, who <lb/>
            were formerly called the Massagetæ; and from what <lb/>
            country these Alani come, or what territories they inhabit <lb/>
            (since my subject has led me thus far), it is expedient now <lb/>
            to explain: after showing the confusion existing in the <lb/>
            accounts of the geographers, who .... at last have found <lb/>
            out .... of truth.</p>
          <p>13. The Danube, which is greatly increased by other <lb/>
            rivers falling into it, passes through the territory of the <lb/>
            Sauromatæ, which extends as far as the river Don, <lb/>
            the boundary between Asia and Europe. On the other <lb/>
            side of this river the Alani inhabit the enormous deserts <lb/>
            of Scythia, deriving their own name from the mountains <lb/>
            around : and they, like the Persians, having gradually svb- <lb/>
            dned all the bordering nations by repeated victories, have <lb/>
            united them to themselves, and comprehended them under <lb/>
            their own name. Of these other tribes the Neuri inhabit <lb/>
            the inland districts, being near the highest mountain <lb/>
            chains, which are both precipitous and covered with the <lb/>
            everlasting frost of the north. Next to them are the <lb/>
            Budini and the Gcloni, a race of exceeding ferocity, who <lb/>
            flay the enemies they have slain in battle, and make of their <lb/>
            skins clothes for themselves and trappings for their horses. <lb/>
            Next to the Geloni are the Agathyrsi, who dye both their <lb/>
            bodies and their hair of a blue colour, the lower classes <lb/>
            using spots few in number and small-the nobles broad <lb/>
            spots, close and thick, and of a deeper hue.</p>
          <p>15. Next to these are the Melanchlænæ and the Anthro- <lb/>
            pophagi, who roam about upon different tracts of land and <pb n="581"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D.375."/> <lb/>
            live on human flesh. And these men are so avoided on <lb/>
            account of their horrid food, that all the tribes which were <lb/>
            their neighbours have removed to a distance from them. <lb/>
            And in this way the whole of that region to the north-east, <lb/>
            till you come to the Chinese, is uninhabited.</p>
          <p>16. On the other side the Alani again extend to the east, <lb/>
            near the territories of the Amazons, and are scattered <lb/>
            among many populous and wealthy nations, stretching to <lb/>
            the parts of Asia which, as I am told, extend up to the <lb/>
            Ganges, a river which passes through the country of the <lb/>
            Indians, and falls into the Southern Ocean.</p>
          <p>17. Then the Alani, being thus divided among the two <lb/>
            quarters of the globe (the various tribes which make up <lb/>
            the whole nation it is not worth while to enumerate), <lb/>
            although widely separated, wander, like the Nomades, <lb/>
            over enormous districts. But in the progress of time all <lb/>
            these tribes came to be united under one generic appella- <lb/>
            tion, and are called Alani .....</p>
          <p>18. They have no cottages, and never use the plough, <lb/>
            but live solely on meat and plenty of milk, mounted <lb/>
            on their waggons, which they cover with a curved awning <lb/>
            made of the bark of trees, and then drive them through <lb/>
            their boundless deserts. And when they come to any <lb/>
            pasture-land, they pitch their waggons in a circle, and <lb/>
            live like a herd of beasts, eating up all the forage—carry- <lb/>
            ing, as it were, their cities with them in their waggons. <lb/>
            In them the husbands sleep with their wives—in them <lb/>
            their children are born and brought up ; these waggons, in <lb/>
            short, are their perpetual habitation, and wherever they <lb/>
            fix them, that place they look upon as their home.</p>
          <p>19. They drive before them their flocks and herds to <lb/>
            their pasturage ; and, above all other cattle, they are espe- <lb/>
            cially careful of their horses. The fields in that country <lb/>
            are always green, and are interspersed with patches of fruit <lb/>
            trees, so that, wherever they go, there is no dearth either <lb/>
            of food for themselves or fodder for their cattle. And this <lb/>
            is caused by the moisture of the soil, and the number of <lb/>
            the rivers which flow through these districts.</p>
          <p>20. All their old people, and especially all the weaker <lb/>
            sex, keep close to the waggons, and occupy themselves in <lb/>
            the lighter employments. But the young men, who from <lb/>
            their earliest childhood are trained to the use of horses, <pb n="582"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. n."/> <lb/>
            think it beneath them to walk. They are also all trained <lb/>
            by careful discipline of various sorts to become skilful <lb/>
            warriors. And this is the reason why the Persians, who <lb/>
            are originally of Scythian extraction, are very skilful in <lb/>
            war.</p>
          <p>21. Nearly all the Alani are men of great stature and <lb/>
            beauty; their hair is somewhat yellow, their eyes are <lb/>
            terribly fierce ; the lightness of their armour renders them <lb/>
            rapid in their movements; and they are in every respect <lb/>
            equal to the Huns, only more civilized in their food and <lb/>
            their manner of life. They plunder and hunt as far as the <lb/>
            Sea of Azov and the Cimmerian Bosphorus, ravaging also <lb/>
            Armenia and Media.</p>
          <p>22. And as ease is a delightful thing to men of a quiet <lb/>
            and placid disposition, so danger and war are a pleasure to <lb/>
            the Alani, and among them that man is called happy who <lb/>
            has lost his life in battle. For those who grow old, or <lb/>
            who go out of the world from accidental sicknesses, they <lb/>
            pursue with bitter reproaches as degenerate and cowardly. <lb/>
            Nor is there anything of which they boast with more pride <lb/>
            than of having killed a man : and the most glorious spoils <lb/>
            they esteem the scalps which they have torn from the <lb/>
            heads of those whom they have slain, which they put as <lb/>
            trappings and ornaments on their war-horses.</p>
          <p>23. Nor is there any temple or shrine seen in their <lb/>
            country, nor even any cabin thatched with straw, their <lb/>
            only idea of religion being to plunge a naked sword into <lb/>
            the ground with barbaric ceremonies, and then they wor- <lb/>
            ship that with great respect, as Mars, the presiding deity <lb/>
            of the regions over which they wander.</p>
          <p>24. They presage the future in a most remarkable man- <lb/>
            ner; for they collect a number of straight twigs of osier, <lb/>
            then with certain secret incantations they separate them <lb/>
            from one another on particular days; and from them they <lb/>
            learn clearly what is about to happen.</p>
          <p>25. They have no idea of slavery, inasmuch as they <lb/>
            themselves are all born of noble families; and those <lb/>
            whom even now they appoint to be judges are always men <lb/>
            of proved experience and skill in war. But now let us <lb/>
            return to the subject which we proposed to ourselves. <pb n="583"/>

          <p>§ 1. THEREFORE the Huns, after having traversed the terri- <lb/>
            tories of the Alani, and especially of that tribe of them <lb/>
            who border on the Gruthungi, and who are called Tanaitæ, <lb/>
            and having slain many of them and acquired much plun- <lb/>
            der, they made a treaty of friendship and alliance with <lb/>
            those who remained. And when they had united them <lb/>
            to themselves, with increased boldness they made a sudden <lb/>
            incursion into the extensive and fertile districts of Ermen- <lb/>
            richus, a very warlike prince, and one whom his numerous <lb/>
            gallant actions of every kind had rendered formidable to <lb/>
            all the neighbouring nations.</p>
          <p>2. He was astonished at the violence of this sudden <lb/>
            tempest, and although, like a prince whose power was well <lb/>
            established he long attempted to hold his ground, he <lb/>
            was at last overpowered by a dread of the evils impending <lb/>
            over his country, which were exaggerated by common <lb/>
            report, till he terminated his fear of great danger by a <lb/>
            voluntary death.</p>
          <p>3. After his death Vithimiris was made king. He for <lb/>
            some time maintained a resistance to the Alani, relying on <lb/>
            the aid of other tribes of the Huns, whom by large pro- <lb/>
            mises of pay he had won over to his party; but, after <lb/>
            having suffered many losses, he was defeated by superior <lb/>
            numbers and slain in battle. He left an infant son named <lb/>
            Viderichus, of whom Alatheus and Saphrax undertook the <lb/>
            guardianship, both generals of great experience and proved <lb/>
            courage. And when they, yielding to the difficulties of the <lb/>
            crisis, had given up all hope of being able to make an <lb/>
            effectual resistance, they retired with caution till they <lb/>
            came to the river Dniester, which lies between the Danube <lb/>
            and the Dnieper, and flows through a vast extent of <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>4. When Athanaric, the chief magistrate of the Thurin- <lb/>
            gians (against whom, as I have already mentioned, Valens <lb/>
            had begun to wage war, to punish him for having sent <lb/>
            assistance to Procopius), had become informed of these <lb/>
            unexpected occurrences, he prepared to maintain his <lb/>
            ground, with a resolution to rise up in strength should he <lb/>
            be assailed as the others had been. <pb n="584"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CII. III."/> 5. At last he pitched his camp at a distance in a very <lb/>
            favourable spot near the banks of the Dniester and the <lb/>
            valleys of the Gruthungi, and sent Muderic, who after- <lb/>
            wards became Duke of the Arabian frontier, with Lagari- <lb/>
            manus and others of the nobles, with orders to advance for <lb/>
            twenty miles, to reconnoitre the approach of the enemy; <lb/>
            while in the mean time he himself, without delay, mar- <lb/>
            shalled his troops in line of battle.</p>
          <p>6. However, things turned out in a manner very con- <lb/>
            traIT to his expectations. For the Huns (being very <lb/>
            sagacious in conjectures) suspecting that there must be a <lb/>
            considerable multitude further off, contrived to pass beyond <lb/>
            those they had seen, and arranged themselves to take their <lb/>
            rest where there was nothing at hand to disturb them ; and <lb/>
            then, when the moon dispelled the darkness of night, they <lb/>
            forded the river, which was the best plan that presented <lb/>
            itself, and fearing lest the piquets at the outposts might <lb/>
            give the alarm to the distant camp, they made all possible <lb/>
            speed and advanced with the hope of surprising Athanarie <lb/>
            himself.</p>
          <p>7. He was stupefied at the suddenness of their onset, and, <lb/>
            after losing many of his men, was compelled to flee fur <lb/>
            refuge to the precipitous mountains in the neighbourhood, <lb/>
            where, being wholly bewildered with the strangeness of <lb/>
            this occurrence, and the fear of greater evils to come, he <lb/>
            began to fortify with lofty walls all the territory between <lb/>
            the banks of the river Pruth and the Danube, where it <lb/>
            passes through the lands of the Taifali, and he completed <lb/>
            this line of fortification with great diligence, thinking that <lb/>
            by this step he should secure his own personal safety.</p>
          <p>8. While this important work was going on, the Huns <lb/>
            kept pressing on his traces with great speed, and they <lb/>
            would have overtaken and destroyed him if they had <lb/>
            not been forced to abandon the pursuit from being impeded <lb/>
            by the great quantity of their booty. In the mean time a <lb/>
            report spread extensively through the other nations of the <lb/>
            Goths, that a race of men, hitherto unknown, had sud- <lb/>
            denly descended like a whirlwind from the lofty moun- <lb/>
            tains, as if they had risen from some secret recess of the <lb/>
            earth, and were ravaging and destroying everything which <lb/>
            came in their way. And then the greater part of the <lb/>
            population which, because of their want of necessaries, <pb n="585"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="AOD. 376.]"/> <lb/>
            had deserted Athanaric, resolved to flee and to seek a home <lb/>
            remote from all knowledge of the barbarians ; and after a <lb/>
            long deliberation where to fix their abode, they resolved <lb/>
            that a retreat into Thrace was the most suitable for these <lb/>
            two reasons: first of all, because it is a district most fer- <lb/>
            tile in grass; and also because, by the great breadth of <lb/>
            the Danube, it is wholly separated from the barbarians, <lb/>
            who were already exposed to the thunderbolts of foreign <lb/>
            warfare. And the whole population of the tribe adopted <lb/>
            this resolution unanimously.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. ACCORDINGLY, under the command of their leader <lb/>
            Alavivus, they occupied the banks of the Danube; and <lb/>
            having sent ambassadors to Valens, they humbly entreated <lb/>
            to be received by him as his subjects, promising to live <lb/>
            quietly, and to furnish a body of auxiliary troops if any <lb/>
            necessity for such a force should arise.</p>
          <p>2. While these events were passing in foreign countries, <lb/>
            a terrible rumour arose that the tribes of the north were <lb/>
            planning new and unprecedented attacks upon us: and <lb/>
            that over the whole region which extends from the country <lb/>
            of the Marcomanni and Quadi to Pontus, a barbarian host <lb/>
            composed of different distant nations, which had suddenly <lb/>
            been driven by force from their own country, was now, with <lb/>
            all their families, wandering about in different directions <lb/>
            on the banks of the river Danube.</p>
          <p>3. At first this intelligence was lightly treated by our <lb/>
            people, because they were not in the habit of hearing of <lb/>
            any wars in those remote districts till they were terminated <lb/>
            either by victory or by treaty.</p>
          <p>4. But presently, as the belief in these occurrences grew <lb/>
            stronger, being confirmed, too, by the arrival of the foreign <lb/>
            ambassadors, who, with prayers and earnest entreaties, <lb/>
            begged that the people thus driven from their homes and <lb/>
            now encamped on the other side of the river, might be <lb/>
            kindly received by us, the affair seemed a cause of joy <lb/>
            rather than of fear, according to the skilful flatterers who <lb/>
            were always extolling and exaggerating the good fortune <pb n="586"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXL Cn IT."/> <lb/>
            of the emperor; congratulating him that an embassy had <lb/>
            come from the furthest corners of the earth unexpectedly, <lb/>
            offering him a large body of recruits; and that, by com- <lb/>
            bining the strength of his own nation with these foreign <lb/>
            forces, he would have an army absolutely invincible; <lb/>
            observing further that, by the yearly payment for military <lb/>
            reinforcements which came in every year from the pro- <lb/>
            vinces, a vast treasure of gold might be accumulated in his <lb/>
            coffers.</p>
          <p>5. Full of this hope he sent forth several officers to <lb/>
            bring this ferocious people and their waggons into our <lb/>
            territory. And such great pains were taken to gratify <lb/>
            this nation which was destined to overthrow the empire <lb/>
            of Rome, that not one was left behind, not even of those <lb/>
            who were stricken with mortal disease. Moreover, having <lb/>
            obtained permission of the emperor to cross the Danube <lb/>
            and to cultivate some districts in Thrace, they crossed <lb/>
            the stream day and night, without ceasing, embarking <lb/>
            in troops on board ships and rafts, and canoes made <lb/>
            of the hollow trunks of trees, in which enterprise, as the <lb/>
            Danube is the most difficult of 'all rivers to navigate, <lb/>
            and was at that time swollen with continual rains, a great <lb/>
            many were drowned, who, because they were too nume- <lb/>
            rous for the vessels, tried to swim across, and in spite of <lb/>
            all their exertions were swept away by the stream.</p>
          <p>6. In this way, through the turbulent zeal of violent <lb/>
            people, the ruin of the Roman empire was brought on. This, <lb/>
            at all events, is neither obscure nor uncertain, that the <lb/>
            unhappy officers who were intrusted with the charge of <lb/>
            conducting the multitude of the barbarians across the <lb/>
            river, though they repeatedly endeavoured to calculate their <lb/>
            numbers, at last abandoned the attempt as hopeless : and <lb/>
            the man who would wish to ascertain the number might <lb/>
            as well (as the most illustrious of poets1 says) attempt to <lb/>
            count the waves in the African sea, or the grains of sand <lb/>
            tossed about by the zephyr.</p>
          <p>7. Let, however, the ancient annals be accredited which <lb/>
            record that the Persian host which was led into Greece, <lb/>
            was, while encamped on the shores of the Hellespont. <lb/>
            and making a new and artificial sea,2 numbered in bat- <note type="footnote">' Virgo Georg., II. 106. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ammianus here alludes to the canal cut through Mount Athos. </note> <pb n="587"/>

            talions at Doriscus; a computation which has been unani- <lb/>
            mously regarded by all posterity as fabulous.</p>
          <p>8. But after the innumerable multitudes of different <lb/>
            nations, diffused over all our provinces, and spreading <lb/>
            themselves over the vast expanse of our plains, who filled <lb/>
            all the champaign country and all the mountain ranges, are <lb/>
            considered, the credibility of the ancient accounts is con- <lb/>
            firmed by this modern instance. And first of all Friti- <lb/>
            gemus was received with Alavivus; and the emperor <lb/>
            assigned them a temporary provision for their immediate <lb/>
            support, and ordered lands to be assigned them to cultivate.</p>
          <p>9. At that time the defences of our provinces were much <lb/>
            exposed, and the armies of barbarians spread over them <lb/>
            like the lava of Mount Etna. The imminence of our <lb/>
            danger manifestly called for generals already illustrious <lb/>
            for their past achievements in war: but nevertheless, as if <lb/>
            some unpropitious deity had made the selection, the men <lb/>
            who were sought out for the chief military appointments <lb/>
            were of tainted character. The chief among them were <lb/>
            Lupicinus and Maximus, the one being Count of Thrace, <lb/>
            the other a leader notoriously wicked-and both men of <lb/>
            great ignorance and rashness.</p>
          <p>10. And their treacherous covetousness was the cause of <lb/>
            all our disasters. For (to pass over other matters in <lb/>
            which the officers aforesaid, or others with their unblushing <lb/>
            connivance, displayed the greatest profligacy in their <lb/>
            injurious treatment of the foreigners dwelling in our <lb/>
            territory, against whom no crime could be alleged) this <lb/>
            one melancholy and unprecedented piece of conduct <lb/>
            (which, even if they were to choose their own judges, must <lb/>
            appear wholly unpardonable) must be mentioned.</p>
          <p>11. When the barbarians who had been conducted across <lb/>
            the river were in great distress from want of provisions, <lb/>
            those detested generals conceived the idea of a most dis- <lb/>
            graceful traffic: and having collected hounds from all <lb/>
            quarters with the most insatiable rapacity, they exchanged <lb/>
            them for an equal number of slaves, among whom were <lb/>
            several sons of men of noble birth.</p>
          <p>12. About this time also, Vitheric, the king of the <lb/>
            Gruthungi, with Alatheus and Saphrax, by whose influence <lb/>
            he was mainly guided, and also with Farnobius, approached <lb/>
            the bank of the Danube, and sent envoys to the emperor <pb n="588"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. T"/> <lb/>
            to entreat that he also might be received with the same <lb/>
            kindness that Alavivus and Fritigern had experienced.</p>
          <p>13. But when, as seemed best for the interests of the <lb/>
            state, these ambassadors had been rejected, and were in <lb/>
            great anxiety as to what they should do, Athanaric, fearing <lb/>
            similar treatment, departed; recollecting that long ago, <lb/>
            when he was discussing a treaty of alliance with Valens, <lb/>
            he had treated that emperor with contempt, in affirming that <lb/>
            he was bound by a religious obligation never to set his <lb/>
            foot on the Roman territory; and that by this excuse he <lb/>
            had compelled the emperor to conclude a peace in the <lb/>
            middle of the war. And he, fearing that the grudge which <lb/>
            Valens bore him for this conduct was still lasting, with- <lb/>
            drew with all his forces to Caucalandes, a place which, <lb/>
            from the height of its mountains and the thickness of its <lb/>
            woods, is completely inaccessible ; and from which he had <lb/>
            lately driven out the Sarmatians.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">V.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>§ 1. BUT the Thuringians, though they had some time since <lb/>
            received permission to cross the river, were still wandering <lb/>
            up and down the banks, being hindered by a twofold <lb/>
            obstacle ; first, that in consequence of the mischievous <lb/>
            dissimulation of the said generals they were not supplied <lb/>
            with the necessary provisions; and also because they were <lb/>
            designedly detained that they might the more easily be <lb/>
            plundered under the wicked semblance of traffic.</p>
          <p>2. And when they ascertained these facts, they began to <lb/>
            grumble, and proposed to resist the evils which they appre- <lb/>
            hended from the treachery of these men by open force; <lb/>
            and Lupicinus, who feared that they would resist, brought <lb/>
            up his troops close to them, in order to compel them to <lb/>
            be gone with all possible rapidity.</p>
          <p>3. The Gruthungi seized this as a favourable oppor- <lb/>
            tunity, and seeing that the Roman soldiers were occupied <lb/>
            in another quarter, and that the vessels which used to go <lb/>
            up and down, to prevent them from crossing, were now <lb/>
            stationary, crossed the river on roughly-made rafts, and <lb/>
            pitched their camp at a great distance from Fritigern.</p>
          <p>4. But he, by his innate foresight, provided against <pb n="589"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 376.]"/> <lb/>
            everything that could happen, and marching on slowly as <lb/>
            well in obedience to the commands he had received as to <lb/>
            allow time for other powerful kings to join him, came by <lb/>
            slow marches to Marcianopolis, arriving later than he was <lb/>
            expected. And here another atrocious occurrence took <lb/>
            place, which kindled the torches of the Furies for general <lb/>
            calamity.</p>
          <p>5. Alavivus and Fritigern were invited to a banquet; <lb/>
            while Lupicinus drew up his soldiers against the chief host <lb/>
            of the barbarians, and so kept them at a distance from the <lb/>
            walls of the town ; though they with humble perseverance <lb/>
            implored admission in order so to procure necessary pro- <lb/>
            visions, professing themselves loyal and obedient subjects. <lb/>
            At last a serious strife arose between the citizens and the <lb/>
            strangers who were thus refused admittance, which gra- <lb/>
            dually led to a regular battle. And the barbarians, being <lb/>
            excited to an unusual pitch of ferocity when they saw <lb/>
            their relations treated as enemies, began to plunder the <lb/>
            soldiers whom they had slain.</p>
          <p>6. But when Lupicinus, of whom we have already <lb/>
            spoken, learnt by secret. intelligence that this was taking <lb/>
            place, while he'was engaged in an extravagant entertain- <lb/>
            ment, surrounded by buffoons, and almost overcome by <lb/>
            wine and sleep, he, fearing the issue, put to death all the <lb/>
            guards who, partly as a compliment and partly as a guard <lb/>
            to the chiefs, were on duty before the general's tent.</p>
          <p>7. The people who were still around the walls heard of <lb/>
            this with great indignation, and rising up by degrees into <lb/>
            a resolution to avenge their kings, who, as they fancied, <lb/>
            were being detained as prisoners, broke out with furious <lb/>
            threats. And Fritigern, being a man of great readiness of <lb/>
            resource, and fearing that perhaps he might be detained <lb/>
            with the rest as a hostage, exclaimed that there would be <lb/>
            a terrible and destructive conflict if he were not allowed <lb/>
            to go forth with his companions in order to pacify the <lb/>
            multitude, who he said had broken out in this tumult <lb/>
            from believing that their leaders had been trepanned and <lb/>
            murdered under show of courtesy. Having obtained <lb/>
            permission, they all went forth, and were received with <lb/>
            cheers and great delight; they then mounted their horses <lb/>
            and fled, in order to kindle wars in many quarters.</p>
          <p>8. When Fame, ever the malignant nurse of bad news, <pb n="590"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. %"/> <lb/>
            bruited this abroad, the whole nation of the Thuringians <lb/>
            became suddenly inflamed with a desire for war; and <lb/>
            among many preparations which seemed to betoken <lb/>
            danger, the standards of war were raised according to <lb/>
            custom, and the trumpets poured forth sounds of evil <lb/>
            omen; while the predatory bands collected in troops, <lb/>
            plundering and burning villages, and throwing everything <lb/>
            that came in their way into alarm by their fearful devasta- <lb/>
            tions.</p>
          <p>9. Against these hosts, Lupicinus, having collected his <lb/>
            forces with the greatest possible rapidity, advanced with <lb/>
            more rashness than prudence, and halted in battle array <lb/>
            nine miles from the city. The barbarians, perceiving this, <lb/>
            charged our battalions before we expected them, and <lb/>
            dashing upon the shields with which they covered their <lb/>
            bodies, they cut down all who fell in their way with their <lb/>
            swords and spears; and urged on by their bloodthirsty <lb/>
            fury, they continued the slaughter, till they had taken our <lb/>
            standards, and the tribunes and the greater part of the <lb/>
            soldiers had fallen, with the exception of the unhappy <lb/>
            general, who could find nothing to do but, while all the <lb/>
            rest were fighting, to betake himself to flight, and return <lb/>
            full gallop to the city. And then the enemies, clothing <lb/>
            themselves in the arms of the Romans whom they had <lb/>
            slain, pushed on their devastating march without hin- <lb/>
            drance.</p>
          <p>10. And since, after recounting various other exploits, <lb/>
            we have now come to this portion of our subject, we call <lb/>
            upon our readers (if we shall ever have any) not to expect <lb/>
            a minute detail of everything that took place, or of the <lb/>
            number of the slain, which indeed it would be utterly <lb/>
            impossible to give. It will be sufficient to abstain from <lb/>
            concealing any part of the truth by a lie, and to give the <lb/>
            general outline of what took place: since a faithful honesty <lb/>
            of narration is always proper if one would hand events <lb/>
            down to the recollection of posterity.</p>
          <p>11. Those who are ignorant of antiquity declare that <lb/>
            the republic was never so overwhelmed with the darkness <lb/>
            of adverse fortune; but they are deceived in consequence <lb/>
            of the stupor into which they are thrown by these <lb/>
            calamities, which are still fresh in their memory. For if <lb/>
            the events of former ages, or even of those immediately <pb n="591"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 376.]"/> <lb/>
            preceding our own times are considered, it will be plain <lb/>
            that such melancholy events have often happened, of which <lb/>
            1 will bring to mind several instances.</p>
          <p>12. The Teutones and the Cimbri came suddenly from <lb/>
            the remote shores of the ocean, and overran Italy; but, <lb/>
            after having inflicted enormous disasters on the Roman <lb/>
            republic, they were at last overcome by our illustrious <lb/>
            generals, and being wholly vanquished, learnt by their <lb/>
            ultimate destruction what martial valour, combined with <lb/>
            skill, can effect.</p>
          <p>13. Again, in the reign of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, <lb/>
            the insane fury of a number of different nations combined <lb/>
            together, after fearful wars . . . . . . . would have left <lb/>
            but a small part of them.</p>
          <p>14. But, soon after these calamitous losses, the state was <lb/>
            re-established in all its former strength and prosperity; <lb/>
            because the soberness of our ancestry had not yet become <lb/>
            infected with the luxury and softness of a more effeminate <lb/>
            way of life, and had not learnt to indulge in splendid <lb/>
            banquets, or the criminal acquisition of riches. But both <lb/>
            the highest classes and the lowest living in harmony, and <lb/>
            imbued with one unanimous spirit, eagerly embraced a <lb/>
            glorious death in the cause of the republic as a tranquil <lb/>
            and quiet haven.</p>
          <p>15. The great multitudes of the Scythian nations, <lb/>
            having burst through the Bosphorus, and made their way <lb/>
            to the shores of the Sea of Azov with 2000 ships, inflicted <lb/>
            fearful losses on us by land and sea; but also lost a great <lb/>
            portion of their own men, and so at last returned to their <lb/>
            own country.</p>
          <p>16. Those great generals, the Decii, father and son, <lb/>
            fell fighting against the barbarians. The cities of Pam- <lb/>
            phylia were besieged, many islands were laid waste; <lb/>
            Macedon was ravaged with fire and sword. An enormous <lb/>
            host for a long time blockaded Thessalonica and Cyzicus. <lb/>
            Arabia also was taken: and so at the same time was <lb/>
            Nicopolis, which had been built by the Emperor Trajan <lb/>
            as a monument of his victory over the Dacians.</p>
          <p>17. After many fearful losses had been both sustained <lb/>
            and inflicted Philippopolis was destroyed, and, unless our <lb/>
            annals speak falsely, 100,000 men were slaughtered within <lb/>
            its walls. Foreign enemies roved unrestrained over <pb n="592"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. VI"/> <lb/>
            Epirus, and Thessaly, and the whole of Greece ; but after <lb/>
            that glorious general Claudius had been taken as a <lb/>
            colleague in the empire (though again lost to us by an <lb/>
            honourable death), the enemy was routed by Aurelian, an <lb/>
            untiring leader, and a severe avenger of injuries; and <lb/>
            after that they remained quiet for a long time without <lb/>
            attempting anything, except that some bands of robbers <lb/>
            now and then ranged the districts in their own neigh- <lb/>
            bourhood, always, however, to their own injury. And <lb/>
            now I will return to the main history from which I have <lb/>
            digressed.</p>

          <p>§ 1. WHEN this series of occurrences had been made gene- <lb/>
            rally known by frequent messengers, Sueridus and Colias, <lb/>
            two nobles of the Goths, who had some time before been <lb/>
            friendly received with their people, and had been sent to <lb/>
            Hadrianople to pass the winter in that city, thinking their <lb/>
            own safety the most important of all objects, looked on all <lb/>
            the events which were taking place with great indiffer- <lb/>
            ence.</p>
          <p>2. But, on a sudden, letters having arrived from the <lb/>
            emperor, in which they were ordered to cross over to the <lb/>
            province of the Hellespont, they asked, in a very modest <lb/>
            manner, to be provided with money to defray the expenses <lb/>
            of their march, as well as provisions, and to be allowed a <lb/>
            respite of two days. But the chief magistrate of the city <lb/>
            was indignant at this request, being also out of humour with <lb/>
            them on account of some injury which had been done to <lb/>
            property of his own in the suburbs, and collected a great <lb/>
            mob of the lowest of the people, with a body of armourers. <lb/>
            of whom there is a great number in that place, and led <lb/>
            them forth armed to hasten the departure of the Goths. <lb/>
            And ordering the trumpeters to sound an alarm, he menaced <lb/>
            them with destruction unless they at once departed with <lb/>
            all speed, as they had been ordered.</p>
          <p>3. The Goths, bewildered by this unexpected calamity, <lb/>
            and alarmed at this outbreak of the citizens, which looked <lb/>
            more as if caused by a sudden impulse than by any delibe- <lb/>
            rate purpose, stood without moving. And being assailed <pb n="593"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 376. J"/> <lb/>
            beyond all endurance by reproaches and manifestations of ill <lb/>
            will, and also by occasional missiles, they at last broke out <lb/>
            into open revolt; having slain several of those who had <lb/>
            at first attacked them with too much petulance, and having <lb/>
            put the rest to flight, and wounded many with all kinds of <lb/>
            weapons, they stripped their corpses and armed themselves <lb/>
            with the spoils in the Roman fashion; and then, seeing <lb/>
            Fritigern near them, they united themselves to him as <lb/>
            obedient allies, and blockaded the city. They remained <lb/>
            come time, maintaining this difficult position and making <lb/>
            promiscuous attacks, during which they lost some of their <lb/>
            number by their own audacity, without being able to <lb/>
            avenge them; while many were slain by arrows and large <lb/>
            stones hurled from slings.</p>
          <p>4. Then Fritigern, perceiving that his men, who were <lb/>
            unaccustomed to sieges, were struggling in vain, and sus- <lb/>
            taining heavy losses, advised his army to leave a force <lb/>
            sufficient to maintain the blockade, and to depart with the <lb/>
            rest, acknowledging their failure, and saying that " He <lb/>
            did not war with stone walls." Advising them also to lay <lb/>
            waste all the fertile regions around without any dis- <lb/>
            tinction, and to plunder those places which were not de- <lb/>
            fended by any garrisons.</p>
          <p>5. His counsel was approved, as his troops knew that he <lb/>
            was always a very able commander in bringing their plans <lb/>
            to success; and then they dispersed over the whole <lb/>
            district ?f Thrace, advancing cautiously; while those who <lb/>
            cams of their own accord to surrender, or those whom they <lb/>
            had taken prisoners, pointed out to them the richest towns, <lb/>
            and especially those where it was said that supplies of <lb/>
            pr visions could be found. And in addition to their <lb/>
            natural confidence they were greatly encouraged by this <lb/>
            circumstance, that a multitude of that nation came in <lb/>
            daily to join them who bad formerly been sold as slaves <lb/>
            by the merchants, with many others whom, when at their <lb/>
            first passage of the river they were suffering from severe <lb/>
            want, they had bartered for a little bad wine or morsels of <lb/>
            bread.</p>
          <p>6. To these were added no inconsiderable number of <lb/>
            men skilled in tracing out veins of gold, but who were <lb/>
            unable to endure the heavy burden of their taxes; and <lb/>
            who, having been received with the cheerful consent of <note type="footnote"> 2 Q </note> <pb n="594"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BX. XXXI. CH. VII."/> <lb/>
            all, they were of great use to them while traversing strange <lb/>
            districts-showing them the secret stores of grain, the <lb/>
            retreats of men, and other hiding-places of divers kinds.</p>
          <p>7. Nor while these men led them on as their guides did <lb/>
            anything remain untouched by them, except what was <lb/>
            inaccessible or wholly out of the way; for without any <lb/>
            distinction of age or sex they went forward destroying <lb/>
            everything in one vast slaughter and conflagration: <lb/>
            tearing infants even from their mother's breast and slaying <lb/>
            them; ravishing their mothers; slaughtering women's <lb/>
            husbands before the eyes of those whom they thus made <lb/>
            widows; while boys of tender and of adult age were <lb/>
            dragged over the corpses of their parents.</p>
          <p>8. Lastly, numbers of old men, crying out that they had <lb/>
            lived long enough, having lost all their wealth, together <lb/>
            with beautiful women, had their hands bound behind their <lb/>
            back, and were driven into banishment, bewailing the <lb/>
            ashes of their native homes.</p>

          <p>§ 1. THis news from Thrace was received with great <lb/>
            sorrow, and caused the Emperor Valens much anxiety.1 <lb/>
            He instantly sent Victor, the commander of the cavalry, <lb/>
            into Persia, to make such arrangements in Armenia as <unclear>wers</unclear> <lb/>
            required by the impending danger. While he himself pr- <lb/>
            pared at once to quit Antioch and go to Constantinople <lb/>
            sending before him Profuturus and Trajan, both officers of <lb/>
            rank and ambition, but of no great skill in war.</p>
          <p>2. When they arrived at the place where it seemed most <lb/>
            expedient to combat this hostile multitude in detail and <lb/>
            by ambuscades and surprises, they very injudiciously <lb/>
            adopted the ill-considered plan of opposing the legions <lb/>
            which had arrived from Armenia to barbarians who were <lb/>
            still raging like madmen. Though the legions had re- <lb/>
            peatedly proved equal to the dangers of a pitched battle <lb/>
            and regular warfare, they were not suited to encounter <lb/>
            an innumerable host which occupied all the chains of the <lb/>
            lofty hills, and also all the plains. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Gibbon, vol. ii., p. 215 (Bohn's edition). </note> <pb n="595"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 377.]"/> 3. Our men had never yet experienced what can be <lb/>
            effected by indomitable rage united with despair, and so <lb/>
            having driven back the enemy beyond the abrupt preci- <lb/>
            pices of the Balkan, they seized upon the rugged defiles in <lb/>
            order to hem in the barbarians on ground from which they <lb/>
            would be unable to find any exit, and where it seemed they <lb/>
            might be overcome by famine. They themselves intended <lb/>
            to await the arrival of Frigeridus,' the duke, who was <lb/>
            hastening towards them with the auxiliaries from Pannonia <lb/>
            and other countries, and whom, at the request of Valens. <lb/>
            Gratian had commanded to march to the camp to aid <lb/>
            those who were menaced with total destruction.</p>
          <p>4. After him, Richomeres, at that time count of the <lb/>
            domestics, who also, by the command of Gratian, had moved <lb/>
            forwards from Gaul, hastened towards Thrace,1 bring- <lb/>
            ing with him some cohorts, which were cohorts in name, <lb/>
            though the greater portion of them had already deserted <lb/>
            (if we would believe some people) by the persuasion of <lb/>
            Merobaudes, fearing lest Gaul, now divested of all the <lb/>
            troops, would be ravaged without check after the barba- <lb/>
            rians had forced the passage of the Rhine.</p>
          <p>5. But Frigeridus was prevented from moving by the <lb/>
            gout, or at all events (as some of his malicious detractors <lb/>
            represented it), he pleaded sickness as an excuse for no, <lb/>
            being present in the struggles which were expected, and so <lb/>
            Richomeres, being unanimously called to the chief command, <lb/>
            with Profuturus and Trajan for his colleagues, advances <lb/>
            towards the town of Salices—at no great distance from <lb/>
            which was a countless host of barbarians, arranged in &amp; <lb/>
            circle, with a great multitude of waggons for a <unclear>rampants</unclear> <lb/>
            around them, behind which, as if protected by a <unclear>spaciour</unclear> <lb/>
            wall, they enjoyed ease and an abundance of booty.</p>
          <p>6. Filled with hopes of success, the Roman generals— <lb/>
            resolved on some gallant enterprise should fortune afford <lb/>
            them an opportunity-were carefully watching the move- <lb/>
            ments of the Goths; having formed the design-if they <lb/>
            moved their camp in any other direction, which they <lb/>
            were very much in the habit of doing-to fall upon <lb/>
            their rear, making no doubt that they should slay many <lb/>
            of them, and recover a great portion of their spoil. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Gibbon, vol. iii., p. 229 (Bohn). </note> <pb n="596"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXL CH. to."/> <lb/>
            7. When the barbarians learnt this, probably through <lb/>
            the information of some deserter, from whom they obtained <lb/>
            a knowledge of our operations, they remained for some <lb/>
            time in the same place ; but at last, being influenced by <lb/>
            fear of the opposing army, and of the reinforcements which <lb/>
            might be expected to throng to them, they assembled, by a <lb/>
            preconcerted signal, the predatory bands dispersed in <lb/>
            different districts, and which, the moment they received <lb/>
            the orders of their leaders, returned like firebrands, with <lb/>
            the swiftness of birds, to their " encampment of chariots" <lb/>
            (as they call it), and thus gave their countrymen confi- <lb/>
            dence to attempt greater enterprises.</p>
          <p>8. After this there was no cessation of hostilities between <lb/>
            the two parties except what was afforded by a few short <lb/>
            truces ; for after those men had returned to the camp <lb/>
            whom necessity had forced to quit it, the whole body which <lb/>
            was crowded within the circuit of the encampment, being <lb/>
            full of fierce discontent, excitement, and a most ferocious <lb/>
            spirit, and now reduced to the greatest extremities, <lb/>
            were eager for bloodshed : nor did their chiefs, who were <lb/>
            present with them, resist their desire; and as the reso- <lb/>
            lution to give battle was taken when the sun was sink- <lb/>
            ing, and when the approach of night invited the sullen <lb/>
            and discontented troops to rest, they took some food quietly, <lb/>
            but remained all night sleepless.</p>
          <p>9. On the other hand the Romans, knowing what was <lb/>
            going on, kept themselves also awake, fearing the enemy <lb/>
            and their insane leaders as so many furious wild beasts: <lb/>
            nevertheless, with fearless minds they awaited the result, <lb/>
            which, though they acknowledged it to be doubtful in <lb/>
            respect of their inferiority in number, they still trusted <lb/>
            would be propitious because of the superior justice of their <lb/>
            cause.</p>
          <p>10. Therefore the next day, as soon as it was light, the <lb/>
            signal for taking arms having been given by the trumpets <lb/>
            on both sides, the barbarians, after having, in accordance <lb/>
            with their usual custom, taken an oath to remain faithful <lb/>
            to their standards, attempted to gain the higher ground, in <lb/>
            order that from it they might descend down the steep like <lb/>
            wheels, overwhelming their enemy by the vigour of their <lb/>
            attack. When this was seen, our soldiers all flocked to <lb/>
            their proper regiments, and then stood firm, neither turning <pb n="597"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 377.]"/> <lb/>
            aside nor in any instance even leaving their ranks to rush <lb/>
            forward.</p>
          <p>11. Therefore when the armies on both sides, advancing <lb/>
            more cautiously, at last halted and stood immovable, the <lb/>
            warriors, with mutual sternness, surveying each other <lb/>
            with fierce looks. The Romans in every part of their <lb/>
            line sang warlike songs, with a voice rising from a lower <lb/>
            to a higher key, which they call barritus,' and so encou- <lb/>
            raged themselves to gallant exertions. But the barbarians, <lb/>
            with dissonant clamour, shouted out the praises of their <lb/>
            ancestors, and amid their various discordant cries, tried <lb/>
            occasional light skirmishes.</p>
          <p>12. And now each army began to assail the other with <lb/>
            javelins and other similar missiles ; and then with threaten- <lb/>
            ing shouts rushed on to close combat, and packing their <lb/>
            shields together like a testudo, they came foot to foot with <lb/>
            their foes. The barbarians, active, and easily rallied, <lb/>
            hurled huge bludgeons, burnt at one end, against our men, <lb/>
            and vigorously thrust their swords against the opposing <lb/>
            breasts of the Romans, till they broke our left wing; but <lb/>
            as it recoiled, it fell back on a strong body of reserve which <lb/>
            was vigorously brought up on their flank, and supported <lb/>
            them just as they were on the very point of destruction.</p>
          <p>13. Therefore, while the battle raged with vast slaughter, <lb/>
            each individual soldier rushing fiercely on the dense ranks <lb/>
            of the enemy, the arrows and javelins flew like hail; the <lb/>
            blows of swords were equally rapid ; while the cavalry, too, <lb/>
            pressed on, cutting down all who fled with terrible •and <lb/>
            mighty wounds on their backs; as also on both sides did <lb/>
            the infantry, slaughtering and hamstringing those who had <lb/>
            fallen down, and through fear were unable to fly.</p>
          <p>14. And when the whole place was filled with corpses, <lb/>
            some also lay among them still half alive, vainly cherishing <lb/>
            a hope of life, some of them having been pierced with <lb/>
            bullets hurled from slings, others with arrows barbed with. <lb/>
            iron. Some again had their heads cloven in half with <lb/>
            blows of swords, so that one side of their heads hung down <lb/>
            on each shoulder in a most horrible manner.</p>
          <p>15. Meanwhile, stubborn as the conflict was, neither <lb/>
            party was wearied, but they still fought on with equal, <note type="footnote">1 Barritus is the word used for the trumpeting of an elephant. </note> <pb n="598"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. VIII."/> <lb/>
            valour and equal fortune, nor did any one relax in his stern- <lb/>
            ness as long as his courage could give him strength for <lb/>
            exertion. But at last the day yielded to the evening, and <lb/>
            put an end to the deadly contest: the barbarians all with- <lb/>
            drew, in no order, each taking his own path, and our men <lb/>
            returned sorrowfully to their tents.</p>
          <p>16. Then having paid the honours of burial to some <lb/>
            among the dead, as well as the time and place permitted, <lb/>
            the rest of the corpses were left as a banquet to the ill- <lb/>
            omened birds, which at that time were accustomed to feed <lb/>
            on carcases—as is even now shown by the places which are <lb/>
            still white with bones. It is quite certain that the Romans, <lb/>
            who were comparatively few, and contending with vastly <lb/>
            superior numbers, suffered serious losses, while at the same <lb/>
            time the barbarians did not escape without much lament- <lb/>
            able slaughter.</p>

          <p>§ 1. UPON the melancholy termination of this battle, our <lb/>
            men sought a retreat in the neighbouring city of Mar- <lb/>
            cianopolis. The Goths, of their own accord, fell back <lb/>
            behind the ramparts formed by their waggons, and for <lb/>
            seven days they never once ventured to come forth or <lb/>
            show themselves. So our soldiers, seizing the oppor- <lb/>
            tunity, raised a barrier, and shut in some other vast <lb/>
            multitudes of the barbarians among the defiles of the <lb/>
            Balkan, in hope, forsooth, that this destructive host being <lb/>
            thus hemmed in between the Danube and the desert, and <lb/>
            having no road by which to escape, must perish by famine, <lb/>
            since everything which could serve to sustain life had <lb/>
            been conveyed into the fortified cities, and these cities <lb/>
            were safe from any attempt of the barbarians to besiege <lb/>
            them, since they were wholly ignorant of the use of war- <lb/>
            like engines.</p>
          <p>2. After this Richomeres returned to Gaul, to convey <lb/>
            reinforcements to that country, where a fresh war of <lb/>
            greater importance than ever, was anticipated. These <lb/>
            events took place in the fourth consulship of Gratian, and <lb/>
            the first of Merobaudes, towards the autumn of the year.</p>
          <p>3. In the mean time Yalens, having heard of the miserable <lb/>
            result of these wars and .devastions, gave Saturninus the <pb n="599"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 377.]"/> <lb/>
            command of the cavalry, and sent him to carry aid to <lb/>
            Trajan and Profuturus.</p>
          <p>4. At that time, throughout the whole countries of Scythia <lb/>
            and Moesia, everything which could be eaten had been con- <lb/>
            sumed ; and so, urged equally by their natural ferocity and <lb/>
            by hunger, the barbarians made desperate efforts to force <lb/>
            their way out of the position in which they were enclosed <lb/>
            but though they made frequent attempts, they were con- <lb/>
            stantly overwhelmed by the vigour of our men, who made <lb/>
            an effectual resistance by the aid of the rugged ground <lb/>
            which they occupied; and at last, being reduced to the ex- <lb/>
            tremity of distress, they allured some of the Huns and <lb/>
            Alani to their alliance by the hope of extensive plunder.</p>
          <p>5. When this was known, Saturninus (for by this time <lb/>
            he had arrived and was busy in arranging the outposts and <lb/>
            military stations in the country) gradually collected his <lb/>
            men, and was preparing to retreat, in pursuance of a sum- <lb/>
            ciently well-devised plan, lest the multitude of barbarians <lb/>
            by some sudden movement (like a river which had burst <lb/>
            its barriers by the violence of a flood) should easily over- <lb/>
            throw his whole force, which had now been for some time <lb/>
            watching the place from which danger was suspected.</p>
          <p>6. The moment that, by the seasonable retreat of our <lb/>
            men, the passage of these defiles was opened, the bar- <lb/>
            barians, in no regular order, but wherever each individual <lb/>
            could find a passage, rushed forth without hindrance to <lb/>
            spread confusion among us; and raging with a desire for <lb/>
            devastation and plunder, spread themselves with impunity <lb/>
            over the whole region of Thrace, from the districts watered <lb/>
            by the Danube, to Mount Rhodope and the strait which <lb/>
            separates the Ægean from the Black Sea, spreading ravage, <lb/>
            slaughter, bloodshed, and conflagration, and throwing <lb/>
            everything into the foulest disorder by all sorts of acts of <lb/>
            violence committed even on the freeborn.</p>
          <p>7. Then one might see, with grief, actions equally <lb/>
            horrible to behold and to speak of: women panic-stricken, <lb/>
            beaten with cracking scourges; some even in pregnancy, <lb/>
            whose very offspring, before they were born, bad to en- <lb/>
            dure countless horrors: here were seen children twining <lb/>
            round their mothers; there one might hear the lamentations <lb/>
            of noble youths and maidens all seized and doomed to <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. IX,"/> 8. Again, grown-up virgins and chaste matrons were <lb/>
            dragged along with countenances disfigured by bitter <lb/>
            weeping, wishing to avoid the violation of their modesty <lb/>
            by any death however agonizing. Here some wealthy noble- <lb/>
            man was dragged along like a wild beast, complaining <lb/>
            of fortune as mereiless and blind, who in a brief moment <lb/>
            had stripped him of his riches, of his beloved relations, and <lb/>
            his home; had made him see his house redueed to ashes, <lb/>
            and had reduced him to expect either to be torn limb from <lb/>
            limb himself, or else to be exposed -to seourging and tor- <lb/>
            ture, as the slave of a feroeious conqueror.</p>
          <p>9. But the barbarians, like beasts who had broken loose <lb/>
            from their cages, pouring unrestrainedly over the vast <lb/>
            extent of country, marched upon a town called Dibal- <lb/>
            tum, where they found Barzimeres, a tribune of the <lb/>
            Scutarii, with his battalion, and some of the Cornuti <lb/>
            legion, and several other bodies of infantry pitching a camp, <lb/>
            like a veteran general of great experience as he was.</p>
          <p>11. Instantly (as the only means of avoiding imme- <lb/>
            diate destruction) he ordered the trumpet to give the <lb/>
            signal for battle; and strengthening his flanks, rushed <lb/>
            forward with his little army in perfect order. And he <lb/>
            made so gallant a struggle, that the barbarians would <lb/>
            have obtained no advantage over him, if a strong body <lb/>
            of cavalry had not come round upon him from behind, <lb/>
            while his men were panting and weary with their exer- <lb/>
            tions : so at last he fell, but not without having inflicted <lb/>
            great slaughter on the barbarians, though the vastness of <lb/>
            their numbers made their losses less observed.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER this affair had terminated, the Goths, being <lb/>
            uncertain what next to do, went in quest of Frigeridus, <lb/>
            with the resolution to destroy him wherever they could <lb/>
            find him, as a formidable obstacle to their success; and <lb/>
            having rested for a while to refresh themselves with <lb/>
            sleep and better food than usual, they then pursued him <lb/>
            like so many wild beasts, having learnt that by Gratian's. <lb/>
            order he had returned into Thrace, and had pitched his <lb/>
            camp near Beræa, intending to wait there to see how <lb/>
            affairs would turn out. <pb n="601"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 377."/> 2. They hastened accordingly, that by a rapid march <lb/>
            they might carry out their proposed plan ; but Frigeridus, <lb/>
            who knew as well how to command as to preserve <lb/>
            his troops, either suspected their plans, or else obtained <lb/>
            accurate information respecting them from the scouts <lb/>
            whom he had sent out; and therefore returned over the <lb/>
            mountains and through the thick forests into Illyricum ; <lb/>
            being full of joy at the success which an unexpected <lb/>
            chance threw in his way.</p>
          <p>3. For as he was retreating, and moving on steadily <lb/>
            with his force in a solid column, he came upon Farnobius, <lb/>
            one of the chieftains of the Goths, who was roaming about <lb/>
            at random with a large predatory band, and a body of the <lb/>
            Taifali, with whom he had lately made an alliance, and <lb/>
            who (if it is worth mentioning), when our soldiers were <lb/>
            all dispersed for fear of the strange nations which were <lb/>
            threatening them, had taken advantage of their dispersion <lb/>
            to cross the river, in order to plunder the country thus <lb/>
            left without defenders.</p>
          <p>4. When their troops thus suddenly came in sight, our <lb/>
            general with great prudence prepared to bring on a battle <lb/>
            at close quarters, and, in spite of their ferocious threats, <lb/>
            at once attacked the combined leaders of the two nations; <lb/>
            and would have slain them all, not leaving a single one <lb/>
            of them to convey news of their disaster, if, after Farno- <lb/>
            bius, hitherto the much-dreaded cause of all these troubles, <lb/>
            had been slain, with a great number of his men, he had <lb/>
            not voluntarily spared the rest on their own earnest sup- <lb/>
            plication ; and then he distributed those to whom he had <lb/>
            thus granted their lives in the districts around the Italian <lb/>
            towns of Modena, Reggio, and Parma, which he allotted to <lb/>
            them to cultivate.</p>
          <p>5. It is said that this nation of the Taifali was so pro- <lb/>
            fligate, and so immersed in the foulest obscenities of life, <lb/>
            that they indulged in all kinds of unnatural lusts, exhausting <lb/>
            the vigour both of youth and manhood in the most polluted <lb/>
            defilements of debauchery. But if any adult caught a boar <lb/>
            or slew a bear single-handed, he was then exempted from <lb/>
            all compulsion of submitting to such ignominious pollution. <pb n="602"/>

          <p>§ 1. IT was when autumn was passing into winter that <lb/>
            terrible whirlwinds swept over Thrace; and as if the <lb/>
            Furies were throwing everything into confusion, awful <lb/>
            storms extended even into distant regions.</p>
          <p>2. And now the people of the Allemanni, belonging to <lb/>
            the district of Lintz, who border on the Tyrol, having by <lb/>
            treacherous incursions violated the treaty which had been <lb/>
            made with them some time before, began to make attempts <lb/>
            upon our frontier; and this calamity had the following <lb/>
            lamentable beginning.</p>
          <p>3. One of this nation who was serving among the <lb/>
            guards of the emperor, returned home at the call of some <lb/>
            private business of his own; and being a very talkative <lb/>
            person, when he was continually asked what was doing in <lb/>
            the palace, he told them that Valens, his uncle, had sent <lb/>
            for Gratian to conduct the campaign in the East, in order <lb/>
            that by their combined forces they might drive back the <lb/>
            inhabitants of the countries on our eastern frontier, who <lb/>
            had all conspired for the overthrow of the Roman state.</p>
          <p>4. The people of Lintz greedily swallowed this intelli- <lb/>
            gence, looking on it as if it concerned themselves also as <lb/>
            neighbours, being so rapid and active in their movements; <lb/>
            and so they assembled, in predatory bands, and when the <lb/>
            Rhine was sufficiently frozen over to be passable, in the <lb/>
            month of February.... The Celtæ, with the Petulantes <lb/>
            legion, repulsed them, but not without considerable loss.</p>
          <p>5. These Germans, though thus compelled to retreat, <lb/>
            being aware that the greater part of our army had been <lb/>
            despatched into Illyricum, where the emperor was about to <lb/>
            follow to assume the command, became more bold than ever, <lb/>
            and conceived the idea of greater enterprises. Having col- <lb/>
            lected the inhabitants of all the adjacent countries into one <lb/>
            body, and with 40,000 armed men, or 70,000, as some, who <lb/>
            seek to enhance the renown of the emperor, have boasted, <lb/>
            they with great arrogance and confidence burst into our; <lb/>
            territories.</p>
          <p>6. Gratian, when he heard of this event, was greatly <lb/>
            alarmed, and recalling the cohorts which he had sent on <lb/>
            before into Pannonia, and collecting others whom he had <pb n="603"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 377.]"/> <lb/>
            prudently retained in Gaul, he committed the affair to the <lb/>
            conduct of Nannienus, a leader of great prudence and skill, <lb/>
            joining with him as his colleague with equal power, Mello- <lb/>
            baudes, the count-commander of the domestics and king of <lb/>
            the Franks, a man of great courage and renown in war.1</p>
          <p>7. Nannienus took into his consideration the variable <lb/>
            chances of fortune, and therefore voted for acting slowly and <lb/>
            with caution, while Mellobaudes, hurried away by a fierce <lb/>
            desire for fighting, according to his usual custom, was eager <lb/>
            at once to march against the enemy; and would not brook <lb/>
            delay.</p>
          <p>8. Presently a horrid shout was raised by the enemy, <lb/>
            and the trumpeters on our side also gave the signal for <lb/>
            battle, upon which a fierce engagement began near Colmar. <lb/>
            On both sides numbers fell beneath the blows of arrows <lb/>
            and hurled javelins.</p>
          <p>9. But while the battle was raging, the multitude of the <lb/>
            enemy appeared so countless, that our soldiers, avoiding a <lb/>
            conflict with them on the open field, dispersed as best they <lb/>
            could among the different narrow paths overgrown with <lb/>
            trees ; but they afterwards stood their ground firmly, and <lb/>
            by the boldness of their carriage and the dazzling splen- <lb/>
            dour of their arms, when seen from a distance, made the <lb/>
            barbarians fear that the emperor himself was at hand.</p>
          <p>10. And they suddenly turned their backs, still offering <lb/>
            occasional resistance, to leave no chance for safety untried; <lb/>
            but at last they were routed with such slaughter that of <lb/>
            their whole number not above 9,000, as was reckoned, <lb/>
            escaped, and these owed their safety to the thickness of the <lb/>
            woods. Among the many bold and gallant men who <lb/>
            perished was their king, Priarius, who had been the prin- <lb/>
            cipal cause of this ruinous war.</p>
          <p>11. Gratian was greatly delighted and encouraged by <lb/>
            this success; and intending now to proceed to the East, <lb/>
            he secretly crossed the Rhine, and turned his march to <lb/>
            the left, being full of sanguine hopes, and resolving, if <lb/>
            fortune should only favour his enterprise, to destroy the <lb/>
            whole of this treacherous and turbulent nation.</p>
          <p>12. And as intelligence of this design was conveyed <lb/>
            to the people of Lintz by repeated messengers, they, who <lb/>
            had already been reduced to great weakness by the almost <note type="footnote">1 See Gibbon, vol. iii., p. 181 (Bohn). </note> <pb n="604"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXL Of. X."/> <lb/>
            entire destruction of their forces, and were now greatly <lb/>
            alarmed at the expected approach of the emperor, hesitated <lb/>
            what to do, and as neither by resistance, nor by anything <lb/>
            which they could do or devise, did they perceive any <lb/>
            possibility of obtaining ever so brief a respite, they with- <lb/>
            drew with speed to their hills, which were almost in- <lb/>
            accessible from the steepness of their precipices, and <lb/>
            reaching the most inaccessible rocks by a winding path, <lb/>
            they conveyed thither their riches and their families, and <lb/>
            prepared to defend them with all their might.</p>
          <p>13. Having deliberated on this difficulty, our general <lb/>
            selected 500 men of proved experience in war out of each <lb/>
            legion, to station opposite to the entrances to this wall of <lb/>
            rock: And they, being further encouraged by the fact <lb/>
            that the emperor himself was continually seen actively <lb/>
            employed among the front rank, endeavoured to scale the <lb/>
            precipices, not doubting but that if they could once set foot <lb/>
            upon the rocks they should instantly catch the barbarians, <lb/>
            like so much game, without any conflict; and so an en- <lb/>
            gagement was commenced towards the approach of noon, <lb/>
            and lasted even to the darkness of night.</p>
          <p>14. Both sides experienced heavy losses. Our men <lb/>
            slew numbers, and fell in numbers ; and the armour of the <lb/>
            emperor's body-guard, glittering with gold and brilliant <lb/>
            colours, was crushed beneath the weight of the heavy mis- <lb/>
            siles hurled upon them.</p>
          <p>15. Gratian held a long deliberation with his chief <lb/>
            officers; and it seemed to them fruitless and mischievous <lb/>
            to contend with unreasonable obstinacy against these <lb/>
            rugged and overhanging rocks: at last (as is usual in such <lb/>
            affairs), after various opinions had been delivered, it was <lb/>
            determined, without making any more active efforts, to <lb/>
            blockade the barbarians and reduce them by famine; <lb/>
            since against all active enterprises the character of the <lb/>
            ground which they occupied was a sufficient defence.</p>
          <p>16. But the Germans still held out with unflinching <lb/>
            obstinacy, and being thoroughly acquainted with the <lb/>
            country, retreated to other mountains still more lofty than <lb/>
            those which they occupied at first. Thither also the <lb/>
            emperor turned with his army, with the same energy as <lb/>
            before, seeking for a patk which might lead him to. the <lb/>
            heights. <pb n="605"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 377.]"/> 17. And when the barbarians saw him thus with un- <lb/>
            wearied perseverance intent upon their destruction, they, <lb/>
            surrendered; and having by humble supplication obtained <lb/>
            mercy, they furnished a reinforcement of the flower of <lb/>
            their youth to be mingled with our recruits, and were <lb/>
            permitted to retire in safety to their native land.</p>
          <p>18. It is beyond all belief how much vigour and rapidity <lb/>
            of action Gratian, by the favour of the eternal Deity, <lb/>
            displayed in gaining this seasonable and beneficial victory, <lb/>
            which broke the power of the Western tribes at a time <lb/>
            when he was preparing to hasten in another direction. <lb/>
            He was indeed a young prince of admirable disposition, <lb/>
            eloquent, moderate, warlike, and merciful, rivalling the <lb/>
            most admirable of his predecessors, even while the down <lb/>
            of youth was still upon his cheeks; the only drawback to <lb/>
            his character being that he was sometimes drawn into <lb/>
            ridiculous actions, when, in consequence of temptations <lb/>
            held out by his minions and favourites, he imitated the <lb/>
            vain pursuits of Cæsar Commodus; but he was never blood- <lb/>
            thirsty.</p>
          <p>19. For as that prince, because he had been accustomed <lb/>
            to slay numbers of wild beasts with his javelins in the <lb/>
            sight of the people, and prided himself beyond measure <lb/>
            on the skill with which he slew a hundred lions let loose <lb/>
            at the same time in the amphitheatre with different <lb/>
            missiles, and without ever having to repeat his shot; so <lb/>
            Gratian, in the enclosures called preserves, slew wild <lb/>
            beasts with his arrows, neglecting much serious busi- <lb/>
            ness for this amusement, and this at a time when if <lb/>
            Marcus Antoninus had resumed the empire he would <lb/>
            have found it hard, without colleagues of equal genius to <lb/>
            his own, and without the most serious deliberation of <lb/>
            counsel, to remedy the grievous disasters of the republic.</p>
          <p>20. Therefore having made all the arrangements which <lb/>
            the time would permit for the affairs of Gaul, and having <lb/>
            punished the traitor of the Scutarii who had betrayed to the <lb/>
            barbarians the intelligence that the emperor was about to <lb/>
            depart with all speed for Illyricum, Gratianus quitted <lb/>
            the army, and passing through the fortress known as that <lb/>
            of Arbor Felix, he proceeded by forced marches to carry <lb/>
            his assistance to those who needed it.</p>
          <p>21. About this time, while Frigeridus was with great <pb n="606"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXL CH. XI."/> <lb/>
            wisdom devising many schemes likely to prove of advan- <lb/>
            tage to the general safety, and was preparing to fortify <lb/>
            the defiles of the Succi, to prevent the enemy (who, by <lb/>
            the rapidity of their movements and their fondness for <lb/>
            sallies, were always threatening the northern provinces <lb/>
            like a torrent) from extending their inroads any further, <lb/>
            he was superseded by a count named Maurus, a man cruel, <lb/>
            ferocious, fickle, and untrustworthy. This man, as we <lb/>
            have related in our account of preceding transactions, <lb/>
            being one of Julian's body-guard to whom the defence <lb/>
            of the palace was expressly committed, while that prince <lb/>
            was doubting about accepting the imperial authority, took <lb/>
            the chain from his own neck and offered it to him for a <lb/>
            diadem.</p>
          <p>22. Thus, in the most critical aspect of our difficulties, <lb/>
            a cautious and energetic general was removed, when, <lb/>
            even if he had previously retired into private life, he <lb/>
            ought, from the greatness of the affairs which required his <lb/>
            superintendence, to have been brought back again to the <lb/>
            camp.</p>

          <p>§ 1. ABOUT the same time Valens quitted Antioch, and, <lb/>
            after a long journey, came to Constantinople, where he <lb/>
            stayed a few days, being made anxious by a trifling sedition <lb/>
            among the citizens. He intrusted the command of the <lb/>
            infantry, which had previously been committed to Trajan, <lb/>
            to Sebastian, who at his request had been lately sent to <lb/>
            him from Italy, being a general of well-known vigilance; <lb/>
            and he himself went to Melanthias, a country palace be- <lb/>
            longing to the emperors, where he conciliated the soldiers <lb/>
            by giving them their pay, furnishing them with pro- <lb/>
            visions, and frequently addressing them in courteous <lb/>
            speeches.</p>
          <p>2. Having left this place, he proceeded according to the <lb/>
            stages he had marked out, and came to a station named <lb/>
            Nice, where he learnt from intelligence brought by his <lb/>
            scouts, that the barbarians, who had collected a rich booty, <lb/>
            were returning loaded with it from the districts about <lb/>
            Mount Rhodope, and were now near Hadrianople. They, <pb n="607"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 378.J"/> <lb/>
            hearing of the approach of the emperor with a numerous <lb/>
            force, were hastening to join their countrymen, who were <lb/>
            in strong positions around Beræa and Nicopolis; and im- <lb/>
            mediately (as the ripeness of the opportunity thus thrown <lb/>
            in his way required) the emperor ordered Sebastian to <lb/>
            hasten on with three hundred picked soldiers of each <lb/>
            legion, to do something (as he promised) of signal advan- <lb/>
            tage to the commonweal.</p>
          <p>3. Sebastian pushed on by forced marches, and came in <lb/>
            sight of the enemy near Hadrianople; but as the gates <lb/>
            were barred against him, he was unable to approach <lb/>
            nearer, since the garrison feared that he had been taken <lb/>
            prisoner by the enemy, and won over by them: so that <lb/>
            something to the injury of the city might happen, like <lb/>
            what had formerly taken place in the case of Count Actus, <lb/>
            who had been cunningly taken prisoner by the soldiers <lb/>
            of Magnentius, and who thus caused the opening of the <lb/>
            passes of the Julian Alps.</p>
          <p>4. At last, though late, they recognized Sebastian, and <lb/>
            allowed him to enter the city. He, then, as well as he <lb/>
            could, refreshed the troops under his command with food <lb/>
            and rest, and next morning secretly issued forth, and <lb/>
            towards evening, being partially concealed by the rising <lb/>
            ground and some trees, he suddenly caught sight of the <lb/>
            predatory bands of the Goths near the river Maritza, <lb/>
            where, favoured by the darkness of night, he charged <lb/>
            them while in disorder and unprepared, routing them <lb/>
            so completely that, with the exception of a few whom <lb/>
            swiftness of foot saved from death, the whole body were <lb/>
            slain, and he recovered such an enormous quantity of <lb/>
            booty, that neither the city, nor the extensive plains <lb/>
            around could contain it.</p>
          <p>5. Fritigern was greatly alarmed; and fearing lest this <lb/>
            general, who as we have often heard succeeded in all his <lb/>
            undertakings, should surprise and utterly destroy his <lb/>
            different detachments, which were scattered at random <lb/>
            over the country, intent only on plunder, he called in all <lb/>
            his men near the town of Cabyle, and at once made off, <lb/>
            in order to gain the open country, where he would not be <lb/>
            liable to be straitened for want of provisions, or harassed <lb/>
            by secret ambuscades.</p>
          <p>6. While these events were proceeding in Thrace, Gra. <pb n="608"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. On. XII."/> <lb/>
            tian having sent letters to inform his uncle of the energy <lb/>
            with which he had overcome the Allemanni, and for- <lb/>
            warded his baggage by land, himself, with a picked band <lb/>
            of his quickest troops, crossed the Danube, reached Bono- <lb/>
            nia, and afterwards Sirmium, where he halted four days. <lb/>
            He then descended the river to the Camp of Mars, <lb/>
            where he was laid up by an intermittent fever, and, being <lb/>
            suddenly assailed by the Alani, lost a few of his fol- <lb/>
            lowers.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AT this time Valens was disturbed by a twofold <lb/>
            anxiety, having learned that the people of Lintz had <lb/>
            been defeated, and also because Sebastian, in the letters <lb/>
            which he sent from time to time, exaggerated what had <lb/>
            taken place by his pompous language. Therefore he ad- <lb/>
            vanced from Melanthias, being eager by some glorious <lb/>
            exploit to equal his youthful nephew, by whose virtue he <lb/>
            was greatly excited. He was at the head of a nume- <lb/>
            rous force, neither unwarlike nor contemptible, and had <lb/>
            united with them many veteran bands, among whom were <lb/>
            several officers of high rank, especially Trajan, who a <lb/>
            little while before had been commander of the forces.</p>
          <p>2. And as by means of spies and observation it was <lb/>
            ascertained that the enemy were intending to block- <lb/>
            ade the different roads by which the necessary supplies <lb/>
            must come, with strong divisions, he sent a sufficient <lb/>
            force to prevent this, despatching a body of the archers <lb/>
            of the infantry and a squadron of cavalry, with all <lb/>
            speed, to occupy the narrow passes in the neighbour- <lb/>
            hood.</p>
          <p>3. Three days afterwards, when the barbarians, who <lb/>
            were advancing slowly, because they feared an attack in <lb/>
            the unfavourable ground which they were traversing, <lb/>
            arrived within fifteen miles from the station of Nice, <lb/>
            which was the aim of their march, the emperor, with <lb/>
            wanton impetuosity, resolved on attacking them in- <lb/>
            stantly, because those who had been sent forward to <lb/>
            reconnoitre (what led to such a mistake is unknown) <lb/>
            affirmed that their entire body did not exceed ten thou- <lb/>
            sand men. <pb n="609"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="... 378.]"/> 4. Marching on with his army in battle array, he came <lb/>
            near the suburb of Hadrianople, where he pitched his <lb/>
            camp, strengthening it with a rampart of palisades, and <lb/>
            then impatiently waited for Gratian. While here, Richo- <lb/>
            meres, Count of the Domestic!, arrived, who had been <lb/>
            sent on by that emperor with letters announcing his im- <lb/>
            mediate approach.</p>
          <p>5. And imploring Valens to wait a little while for him <lb/>
            that he might share his danger, and not rashly face the <lb/>
            danger before him single handed, he took counsel with <lb/>
            his officers as to what was best to be done.</p>
          <p>6. Some, following the advice of Sebastian, recommended <lb/>
            with urgency that he should at once go forth to battle; <lb/>
            while Victor, master-general of the cavalry, a Sarmatian by <lb/>
            birth, but a man of slow and cautious temper, recom- <lb/>
            mended him to wait for his imperial colleague, and this <lb/>
            advice was supported by several other officers, who sug- <lb/>
            gested that the reinforcement of the Gallic army would be <lb/>
            likely to awe the fiery arrogance of the barbarians.</p>
          <p>7. However, the fatal obstinacy of the emperor pre- <lb/>
            vailed, fortified by the flattery of some of the princes, <lb/>
            who advised him to hasten with all speed, so that Gratian <lb/>
            might have no share in a victory which, as they fancied, <lb/>
            was already almost gained.</p>
          <p>8. And while all necessary preparations were being <lb/>
            made for the battle, a presbyter of the Christian religion <lb/>
            (as he called himself), having been sent by Fritigern as <lb/>
            his ambassador, came, with some colleagues of low rank, <lb/>
            to the emperor's camp; and having been received with <lb/>
            courtesy, he presented a letter from that chieftain, openly <lb/>
            requesting that the emperor would grant to him and to <lb/>
            his followers, who were now exiles from their native <lb/>
            homes, from which they had been driven by the rapid <lb/>
            invasions of savage nations, Thrace, with all its flocks <lb/>
            and all its crops, for a habitation. And if Valens would <lb/>
            consent to this, Fritigern would agree to a perpetual <lb/>
            peace.</p>
          <p>9. In addition to this message, the same Christian, as <lb/>
            one acquainted with his commander's secrets, and well <lb/>
            trusted, produced other secret letters from his chieftain‘ <lb/>
            who, being full of craft and every resource of deceit, <lb/>
            informed Valens, as one who was hereafter to be his friend <note type="footnote">2 R </note> <pb n="610"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK.XXXI.CH. XII."/> <lb/>
            and ally, that he had no other means to appease the <lb/>
            ferocity of his countrymen, or to induce them to accept <lb/>
            conditions advantageous to the Roman state, unless from <lb/>
            time to time he showed them an army under arms close at <lb/>
            hand, and by frightening them with the name of the em- <lb/>
            peror, recalled them from their mischievous eagerness for <lb/>
            fighting. The ambassadors retired unsuccessful, having <lb/>
            been looked on as suspicious characters by the emperor.</p>
          <p>10. When the day broke which the annals mark as the <lb/>
            fifth of the Ides of August, the Roman standards were ad- <lb/>
            vanced with haste, the baggage having been placed close <lb/>
            to the walls of Hadrianople, under a sufficient guard of <lb/>
            soldiers of the legions ; the treasures and the chief insignia <lb/>
            of the emperor's rank were within the walls, with the <lb/>
            prefect and the principal members of the council.</p>
          <p>11. Then, having traversed the broken ground which <lb/>
            divided the two armies, as the burning day was progressing <lb/>
            towards noon, at last, after marching eight miles, our men <lb/>
            came in sight of the waggons of the enemy, which had <lb/>
            been stated by the scouts to be all arranged in a circle. <lb/>
            According to their custom, the barbarian host raised <lb/>
            a fierce and hideous yell, while the Roman generals <lb/>
            marshalled their line of battle. The right wing of the <lb/>
            cavalry was placed in front; the chief portion of the <lb/>
            infantry was kept in reserve.</p>
          <p>12. But the left wing of the cavalry, of which a consider- <lb/>
            able number were still straggling on the road, were ad- <lb/>
            vancing with speed, though with great difficulty; and while <lb/>
            this wing was deploying, not as yet meeting with any <lb/>
            obstacle, the barbarians being alarmed at the terrible <lb/>
            clang of their arms and the threatening crash of their <lb/>
            shields (since a large portion of their own army was still <lb/>
            at a distance, under Alatheus and Saphrax, and, though <lb/>
            sent for, had not yet arrived), again sent ambassadors to <lb/>
            ask for peace.</p>
          <p>13. The emperor was offended at the lowness of their <lb/>
            rank, and replied, that if they wished to make a lasting <lb/>
            treaty, they must send him nobles of sufficient dignity. <lb/>
            They designedly delayed, in order by the fallacious truce <lb/>
            which subsisted during the negotiation to give time foi <lb/>
            their cavalry to return, whom they looked upon ao close at <lb/>
            hand; and for our soldiers, already suffering from the sum <pb n="611"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 378.]"/> <lb/>
            mer heat, to be come parched and exhausted by the confla- <lb/>
            gration of the vast plain; as the enemy had, with this <lb/>
            object, set fire to the crops by means of burning faggots <lb/>
            and fuel. To this evil another was added, that both men <lb/>
            and cattle were suffering from extreme hunger.</p>
          <p>14. In the meantime Fritigern, being skilful in divining <lb/>
            the future, and fearing a doubtful struggle, of his own head <lb/>
            sent one of his men as a herald, requesting that some <lb/>
            nobles and picked men should at once be sent to him as <lb/>
            hostages for his safety, when he himself would fearlessly <lb/>
            bring us both military aid and supplies.</p>
          <p>15. The proposition of this formidable chief was received <lb/>
            with praise and approbation, and the tribune Equitius, a <lb/>
            relation of Valens, who was at that time high steward of <lb/>
            the palace, was appointed, with general consent, to go with <lb/>
            all speed to the barbarians as a hostage. But he refused, <lb/>
            because he had once been taken prisoner by the enemy, <lb/>
            and had escaped from Dibaltum, so that he feared their <lb/>
            vengeful anger; upon this Richomeres voluntarily offered <lb/>
            himself, and willingly undertook to go, thinking it a bold <lb/>
            action, and one becoming a brave man; and so he set out, <lb/>
            bearing vouchers of his rank and high birth.</p>
          <p>16. And as he was on his way towards the enemy's <lb/>
            camp, the accompanying archers and Scutarii, who on that <lb/>
            occasion were under the command of Bacurius, a native of <lb/>
            Iberia, and of Cassio, yielded, while on their march, to an <lb/>
            indiscreet impetuosity, and on approaching the enemy, <lb/>
            first attacked them rashly, and then by a cowardly flight <lb/>
            disgraced the beginning of the campaign.</p>
          <p>17. This ill-timed attack frustrated the willing services <lb/>
            of Richomeres, as he was not permitted to proceed; in the <lb/>
            mean time the cavalry of the Goths had returned with <lb/>
            Alatheus and Saphrax, and with them a battalion of Alani; <lb/>
            these descending from the mountains like a thunderbolt, <lb/>
            spread confusion and slaughter among all whom in their <lb/>
            rapid charge they came across. <pb n="612"/>

          <p>§ 1. AND while arms and missiles of all kinds were meet- <lb/>
            ing in fierce conflict, and Bellona, blowing her mournful <lb/>
            trumpet, was raging more fiercely than usual, to inflict <lb/>
            disaster on the Romans, our men began to retreat; but <lb/>
            presently, roused by the reproaches of their officers, they <lb/>
            made a fresh stand, and the battle increased like a confla- <lb/>
            gration, terrifying our soldiers, numbers of whom were <lb/>
            pierced by strokes from the javelins hurled at them, and <lb/>
            from arrows.</p>
          <p>2. Then the two lines of battle dashed against each <lb/>
            other, like the beaks (or rams) of ships, and thrusting with <lb/>
            all their might, were tossed to and frq, like the waves of <lb/>
            the sea. Our left wing had advanced actually up to the <lb/>
            waggons, with the intent to push on still further if they <lb/>
            were properly supported; but they were deserted by the <lb/>
            rest of the cavalry, and so pressed upon by the superior <lb/>
            numbers of the enemy, that they were overwhelmed and <lb/>
            beaten down, like the ruin of a vast rampart. Presently <lb/>
            our infantry also was left unsupported, while the different <lb/>
            companies became so huddled together that a soldier could <lb/>
            hardly draw his sword, or withdraw his hand after he had <lb/>
            once stretched it out. And by this time such clouds of <lb/>
            dust arose that it was scarcely possible to see the sky, <lb/>
            which resounded with horrible cries; and in consequence, <lb/>
            the darts, which were bearing death on every side, reached <lb/>
            their mark, and fell with deadly effect, because no one <lb/>
            could see them beforehand so as to guard against them.</p>
          <p>3. But when the barbarians, rushing on with their enor- <lb/>
            mous host, beat down our horses and men, and left no spot <lb/>
            to which our ranks could fall back to deploy, while they <lb/>
            were so closely packed that it was impossible to escape <lb/>
            by forcing a way through them, our men at last began to <lb/>
            despise death, and again took to their swords and slew all <lb/>
            they encountered, while with mutual blows of battle-axes, <lb/>
            helmets and breastplates were dashed in pieces.</p>
          <p>4. Then you might see the barbarian towering in bis <lb/>
            fierceness, hissing or shouting, fall with his legs pierced <lb/>
            through, or his right hand cut off, sword and all, or his side <lb/>
            transfixed, and still, in the last gasp of life, casting round <pb n="613"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 378.]"/> <lb/>
            him defiant glances. The plain was covered with car- <lb/>
            cases, strewing the mutual ruin of the combatants; while <lb/>
            the groans of the dying, or of men fearfully wounded, were <lb/>
            intense, and caused great dismay all around.</p>
          <p>5. Amidst all this great tumult and confusion our <lb/>
            infantry were exhausted by toil and danger, till at last <lb/>
            they had neither strength left to fight, nor spirits to plan <lb/>
            anything; their spears were broken by the frequent cul- <lb/>
            lisions, so that they were forced to content themselves <lb/>
            with their drawn swords, which they thrust into the dense <lb/>
            battalions of the enemy, disregarding their own safety, and <lb/>
            seeing that every possibility of escape was cut off from <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>6. The ground, covered with streams of blood, made <lb/>
            their feet slip, so that all that they endeavoured to do was <lb/>
            to sell their lives as dearly as possible; and with such <lb/>
            vehemence did they resist their enemies who pressed on <lb/>
            them, that some were even killed by their own weapons. <lb/>
            At last one black pool of blood disfigured everything, and <lb/>
            wherever the eye turned, it could see nothing but piled-up <lb/>
            heaps of dead, and lifeless corpses trampled on without <lb/>
            mercy.</p>
          <p>7. The sun being now high in the heavens, having <lb/>
            traversed the sign of Leo, and reached the abode of the. <lb/>
            heavenly Virgo, scorched the Romans, who were emaci- <lb/>
            ated by hunger, worn out with toil, and scarcely able to <lb/>
            support even the weight of their armour. At last our <lb/>
            columns were entirely beaten back by the overpowering <lb/>
            weight of the barbarians, and so they took to disorderly <lb/>
            flight, which is the only resource in extremity, each man <lb/>
            trying to save himself as well as he could.</p>
          <p>8. While they were all flying and scattering themselves <lb/>
            over roads with which they were unacquainted, the em- <lb/>
            peror, bewildered with terrible fear, made his way over <lb/>
            heaps of dead, and fled to the battalions of the Lancearii <lb/>
            and the Mattiarii, who, till the superior numbers of the. <lb/>
            enemy became wholly irresistible, stood firm and im- <lb/>
            movable. As soon as he saw him, Trajan exclaimed that <lb/>
            all hope was lost, unless the emperor, thus deserted by his <lb/>
            guards, could be protected by the aid of his foreign allies.</p>
          <p>9. When this exclamation was heard, a count named <lb/>
            Victor hastened to bring up with all speed the Batavians, <pb n="614"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. On. XIIJ."/> <lb/>
            who were placed in the reserve, and who ought to have <lb/>
            been near at hand, to the emperor's assistance ; but as none <lb/>
            of them could be found, he too retreated, and in a similar <lb/>
            manner Richomeres and Saturninus saved themselves from <lb/>
            danger.</p>
          <p>10. So now, with rage flashing in their eyes, the bar- <lb/>
            barians pursued our men, who were in a state of torpor, <lb/>
            the warmth of their veins having deserted them. Many <lb/>
            were slain without knowing who smote them; some were <lb/>
            overwhelmed by the mere weight of the crowd which <lb/>
            pressed upon them; and some were slain by wounds in- <lb/>
            flicted by their own comrades. The barbarians spared <lb/>
            neither those who yielded nor those who resisted.</p>
          <p>11. Besides these, many half slain lay blocking up the <lb/>
            roads, unable to endure the torture of their wounds ; and <lb/>
            heaps of dead horses were piled up and filled the plain <lb/>
            with their carcases. At last a dark moonless night put an <lb/>
            end to the irremediable disaster which cost the Roman <lb/>
            state so dear.</p>
          <p>12. Just when it first became dark, the emperor being <lb/>
            among a crowd of common soldiers, as it was believed- <lb/>
            for no one said either that he had seen him, or been near <lb/>
            him—was mortally wounded with an arrow, and, very <lb/>
            shortly after, died, though his body was never found. For <lb/>
            as some of the enemy loitered for a long time about the <lb/>
            field in order to plunder the dead, none of the defeated <lb/>
            army or of the inhabitants ventured to go to them.</p>
          <p>13. A similar fate befell the Cæsar Decius, when fight- <lb/>
            ing vigorously against the barbarians; for he was thrown <lb/>
            by his horse falling, which he had been unable to hold, and <lb/>
            was plunged into a swamp, out of which he could never <lb/>
            emerge, nor could his body be found.</p>
          <p>14. Others report that Valens did not die immediately, <lb/>
            but that he was borne by a small body of picked soldiers <lb/>
            and eunuchs to a cabin in the neighbourhood, which was <lb/>
            strongly built, with two stories; and that while these <lb/>
            unskilful hands were tending his wounds, the cottage was <lb/>
            surrounded by the enemy, though they did not know who <lb/>
            was in it; still, however, he was saved from the disgrace <lb/>
            of being made a prisoner.</p>
          <p>15. For when his pursuers, while vainly attempting to <lb/>
            force the barred doors, were assailed with arrows from <pb n="615"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 378.]"/> <lb/>
            the roof, they, not to lose by so inconvenient a delay the <lb/>
            opportunity of collecting plunder, gathered some faggots <lb/>
            and stubble, and setting fire to them, burnt down the build- <lb/>
            ing, with those who were in it.</p>
          <p>16. But one of the soldiers dropped from the windows, <lb/>
            and, being taken prisoner by the barbarians, revealed to <lb/>
            them what had taken place, which caused them great con- <lb/>
            cern, because they looked upon themselves as defrauded of <lb/>
            great glory in not having taken the ruler of the Roman <lb/>
            state alive. This same young man afterwards secretly <lb/>
            returned to our people, and gave this account of the affair.</p>
          <p>17. When Spain had been recovered after a similar dis- <lb/>
            aster, we are told that one of the Scipios was lost in a fire, <lb/>
            the tower in which he had taken refuge having been burnt. <lb/>
            At all events it is certain that neither Scipio nor Valens <lb/>
            enjoyed that last honour of the dead-a regular funeral.</p>
          <p>18. Many illustrious men fell in this disastrous defeat, <lb/>
            and among them one of the most remarkable was Trajan, <lb/>
            and another was Sebastian ; there perished also thirty-five <lb/>
            tribunes who had no particular command, many captains <lb/>
            of battalions, and Valerianus and Equitius, one of whom <lb/>
            was master of the horse and the other high steward. <lb/>
            Potentius, too, tribune of the promoted officers, fell in <lb/>
            the flower of his age, a man respected by all persons of <lb/>
            virtue, and recommended by the merits of his father. <lb/>
            Ursicinus, who had formerly been commander of the forces, <lb/>
            as well as by his own. Scarcely one-third of the whole <lb/>
            army escaped.</p>
          <p>19. Nor, except the battle of Cannæ, is so destructive a <lb/>
            slaughter recorded in our annals; though, even in the times <lb/>
            of their prosperity, the Romans have more than once had <lb/>
            to deplore the uncertainty of war, and have for a time suc- <lb/>
            cumbed to evil Fortune; while the well-known dirges of <lb/>
            the Greeks have bewailed many disastrous battles. <pb n="616"/>

          <p>§ 1. SUCH was the death of Valens, when he was about <lb/>
            fifty years old, and had reigned rather less than fourteen <lb/>
            years. We will now describe his virtues, which were <lb/>
            known to many, and his vices.</p>
          <p>2. He was a faithful and steady friend-a severe chastise? <lb/>
            of ambition-a rigid upholder of both military and civil <lb/>
            discipline—always careful that no one should assume im- <lb/>
            portance on account of any relationship to himself; slow <lb/>
            both in conferring, office, and in taking it away; a very <lb/>
            just ruler of the provinces, all of which he protected from <lb/>
            injury, as if each had been his own house; devoting sin- <lb/>
            gular care to the lessening the burdens of the state, and <lb/>
            never permitting any increase of taxation. He was very <lb/>
            moderate in the exaction of debts due to the state, but <lb/>
            a vehement and implacable foe to all thieves, and to every <lb/>
            one convicted of peculations; nor in affairs of this kind <lb/>
            was the East, by its own confession, ever better treated <lb/>
            under any other emperor.</p>
          <p>3. Besides all this, he was liberal with due regard to <lb/>
            moderation, of which quality there are many examples, <lb/>
            one of which it will be sufficient to mention here :-As in <lb/>
            palaces there are always some persons covetous of the <lb/>
            possessions of others, if any one petitioned for lapsed pro- <lb/>
            perty, or anything else which it was usual to apply for, he <lb/>
            made a proper distinction between just and unjust claims, <lb/>
            and when he gave it to the petitioner, while reserving full <lb/>
            . liberty to any one to raise objections, he often associated <lb/>
            the successful candidate with three or four partners, in <lb/>
            order that those covetous suitors might conduct themselves <lb/>
            with more moderation, when they saw the profits for <lb/>
            which they were so eager diminished by this device.</p>
          <p>4. Of the edifices, which in the different cities and <lb/>
            towns he either repaired or built from their foundations, I <lb/>
            will say nothing (to avoid prolixity), allowing those things <lb/>
            to speak for themselves. These qualities, in my opinion, <lb/>
            deserve the imitation of all good men. Now let us enume- <lb/>
            rate his vices.</p>
          <p>5. He was an immoderate coveter of great wealth; im- <lb/>
            patient of labour, he affected an extreme severity, and was <pb n="617"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D.378.]"/> <lb/>
            too much inclined to cruelty; his behaviour was rude and <lb/>
            rough; and he was little imbued with skill either in war <lb/>
            or in the liberal arts. He willingly sought profit and <lb/>
            advantage in the miseries of others, and was more than <lb/>
            ever intolerable in straining ordinary offences into sedition <lb/>
            or treason; he cruelly encompassed the death or ruin of <lb/>
            wealthy nobles.</p>
          <p>6. This also was unendurable, that while he wished to <lb/>
            have it appear that all actions and suits were decided ac- <lb/>
            cording to the law, and while the investigation of such <lb/>
            affairs was delegated to judges especially selected as the <lb/>
            most proper to decide them, he still would not allow any <lb/>
            decision to be given which was contrary to his own pleasure.. <lb/>
            He was also insulting, passionate, and always willing to <lb/>
            listen to all informers, without the least distinction as to <lb/>
            whether the charges which they advanced were true or <lb/>
            false. And this vice is one very much to be dreaded, even <lb/>
            in private affairs of every-day occurrence.</p>
          <p>7. He was dilatory and sluggish; of a swarthy com- <lb/>
            plexion; had a cast in one eye, a blemish, however, which <lb/>
            was not visible at a distance ; his limbs were well set; his <lb/>
            figure was neither tall nor short; he was knock-kneed, and <lb/>
            rather pot-bellied.</p>
          <p>8. This is enough to say about Valens: and the recol- <lb/>
            lection of his contemporaries will fully testify that this <lb/>
            account is a true one. But we must not omit to mention, <lb/>
            that when he had learnt that the oracle of the tripod, which <lb/>
            we have related to have been moved by Patricius and <lb/>
            Hilanus, contained those three prophetic lines, the last of <lb/>
            which is,- <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_02_fig9.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              " Repelling murd'rous war in Mimas’ plain <lb/>
              -he, being void of accomplishments and illiterate, despised <lb/>
              them at first; but as his calamities increased, he became <lb/>
              filled with abject fear, and, from a recollection of this samo <lb/>
              prophecy, began to dread the very name of Asia, where he <lb/>
              had been informed by learned men that both Homer and <lb/>
              Cicero had spoken of the Mountain of Mimas over the town <lb/>
              of Erythræ.</p>
          <p>9. Lastly,-after his death, and the departure of the <lb/>
            enemy, it is said that a monument was found near the spot <lb/>
            where he is believed to have died, with a stone fixed into <pb n="618"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. XV"/> <lb/>
            it inscribed with Greek characters, indicating that some <lb/>
            ancient noble of the name of Mimas was buried there.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER this disastrous battle, when night had veiled <lb/>
            the earth in darkness, those who survived fled, some to the <lb/>
            right, some to the left, or wherever fear guided them, each <lb/>
            man seeking refuge among his relations, as no one could <lb/>
            thi k of anything but himself, while all fancied the lances <lb/>
            of the enemy sticking in their backs. And far off were heard <lb/>
            the miserable wailings of those who were left behind-the <lb/>
            sobs of the dying, and the agonizing groans of the wounded.</p>
          <p>2. But when daylight returned, the conquerors, like <lb/>
            wild beasts rendered still more savage by the blood they <lb/>
            had tasted, and allured by the temptations of groundless <lb/>
            hope, marched in a dense column upon Hadrianople, <lb/>
            resolved to run any risk in order to take it, having been <lb/>
            informed by traitors and deserters that the principal officers <lb/>
            of State, the insignia of the imperial authority, and the <lb/>
            treasures of Valens had all been placed there for safety, <lb/>
            as in an impregnable fortress.</p>
          <p>3. And to prevent the ardour of the soldiers from being <lb/>
            cooled by delay, the whole city was blockaded by the <lb/>
            fourth hour; and the siege from that time was carried on <lb/>
            with great vigour, the besiegers, from their innate ferocity, <lb/>
            pressing in to complete its destruction, while, on the other <lb/>
            hand, the garrison was stimulated to great exertions by <lb/>
            their natural courage.</p>
          <p>4. And while the vast number of soldiers and grooms, <lb/>
            who were prohibited from entering the city with their <lb/>
            beasts, kept close to the walls and to the houses which <lb/>
            joined them, and fought gallantly, considering the disad- <lb/>
            vantages under which they laboured from the lowness of <lb/>
            the ground which they occupied, and baffled the rage of <lb/>
            their assailants till the ninth hour of the day, on a sudden <lb/>
            three hundred of our infantry, of those who were nearest <lb/>
            the battlements, formed themselves into a solid body, and <lb/>
            deserted to the barbarians, who seized upon them with <lb/>
            avidity, and (it is not known on what account) at once <lb/>
            slaughtered them all. And from that time forth it was <pb n="619"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 378.]"/> <lb/>
            remarked that no one, even in the extremity of despair, <lb/>
            adopted any similar conduct.</p>
          <p>5. Now while all these misfortunes were at their height, <lb/>
            suddenly there came a violent thunderstorm, and rain <lb/>
            pouring down from the black clouds dispersed the bands <lb/>
            of soldiers who were raging around ; and they returned <lb/>
            to their camp, which was measured out in a circle by their <lb/>
            waggons ; and being more elated and haughty than ever, <lb/>
            they sent threatening letters to our men and an <lb/>
            ambassador . . . . . on condition of safety to him.</p>
          <p>6. But as the messenger did not dare to enter the city, <lb/>
            the letters were at last brought in by a certain Christian; <lb/>
            and when they had been read and considered with all <lb/>
            proper attention, the rest of the day and the whole of the <lb/>
            night was devoted to preparing for defence. For inside <lb/>
            the city the gates were blocked up with huge stones; the <lb/>
            weak parts of the walls were strengthened, and engines to <lb/>
            hurl javelins or stones were fixed on all convenient places, <lb/>
            and a sufficient supply of water was also provided; for the <lb/>
            day before some of the combatants had been distressed <lb/>
            almost to death by thirst.</p>
          <p>7. On the other hand the Goths, considering the diffi- <lb/>
            culty and uncertainty of all warlike transactions, and be- <lb/>
            coming anxious at seeing their bravest warriors wounded <lb/>
            and slain, and their strength gradually diminished, devised <lb/>
            and adopted a crafty counsel, which, however, was revealed <lb/>
            to us by Justice herself.</p>
          <p>8. They seduced some picked soldiers of our army, who <lb/>
            had revolted to them the day before, to pretend to escape <lb/>
            back to their former comrades, and thus gain admittance <lb/>
            within the walls ; and after they had effected their entrance, <lb/>
            they were secretly to set fire to some part of the city, so <lb/>
            that the conflagration might serve as a secret signal, and <lb/>
            while the garrison and citizens were occupied in extin- <lb/>
            guishing it, the walls might be left undefended, and so be <lb/>
            easily stormed.</p>
          <p>9. The traitors did as they were commanded ; and when <lb/>
            they came near the ditch they stretched out their hands, <lb/>
            and with entreaties requested to be admitted into the city <lb/>
            as Romans. When they were admitted, however (since nc <lb/>
            suspicion existed to hinder their admission), and were <lb/>
            questioned as to the plans of the enemy, they varied in <pb n="620"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK XXXL CH. XV.'"/> <lb/>
            their tale: and in consequence they were put to the tor- <lb/>
            ture, and having formally confessed what they had under- <lb/>
            taken to do, they were all beheaded.</p>
          <p>10. Accordingly, every resource of war having been <lb/>
            prepared, the barbarians, at the third watch discarding all <lb/>
            fear from past failures, rushed in enormous numbers <lb/>
            against the blocked up entrances of the city, their officers <lb/>
            urging them with great obstinacy. But the provincials <lb/>
            and imperial guards, with the rest of the garrison, rose <lb/>
            with fearless courage to repel them, and their missiles of <lb/>
            every kind, even when shot at random among so vast a <lb/>
            crowd, could not fall harmless. Our men perceived that <lb/>
            the barbarians were using the same weapons which we our- <lb/>
            selves had shot at them: and accordingly an order was <lb/>
            given that the strings which fastened the iron points to the <lb/>
            javelins and arrows should be cut before they were hurled <lb/>
            or shot; so that while flying they should preserve their <lb/>
            efficacy, but when they pierced a body or fell on the ground <lb/>
            they should come asunder.</p>
          <p>12. While affairs were in this critical state an unex- <lb/>
            pected accident had a considerable influence on the result. <lb/>
            A scorpion, a military engine which in ordinary language <lb/>
            is also known as the wild-ass, being stationed opposite <lb/>
            the dense array of the enemy, hurled forth a huge stone, <lb/>
            which, although it fell harmless on the ground, yet by the <lb/>
            mere sight of it terrified them so greatly, that in alarm <lb/>
            at the strange spectacle they all fell back and endeavoured <lb/>
            to retreat.</p>
          <p>13. But their officers ordering the trumpets to sound <lb/>
            a charge, the battle was renewed; and the Romans, as <lb/>
            before, got the advantage, not a single javelin or bullet <lb/>
            hurled by a slinger failing of its effect. For the troops of <lb/>
            the generals who led the vanguard, and who were inflamed <lb/>
            by the desire of possessing themselves of the treasures <lb/>
            which Valens had so wickedly acquired, were followed <lb/>
            closely by others who were vain of exposing themselves to <lb/>
            as much danger as those of greater renown. And some <lb/>
            were wounded almost to death: others were struck down, <lb/>
            crushed by huge weights, or pierced through their breasts <lb/>
            with javelins; some who carried ladders and attempted <lb/>
            to scale the walls on different sides were buried under <lb/>
            their own burthens, being beaten down by stones which <pb n="621"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 378.]"/> <lb/>
            were hurled upon them, and by fragments of pillars and <lb/>
            cylinders.</p>
          <p>14. And yet, horrible as the sight of this bloodshed was, <lb/>
            so great was their ardour that no one relaxed in his gallant <lb/>
            exertions till the evening, being encouraged by seeing <lb/>
            many of the garrison also fall by various wounds. So, <lb/>
            without rest or relaxation, both the besiegers and the <lb/>
            besieged fought with unwearied courage.</p>
          <p>15. And now no kind of order was observed by the <lb/>
            enemy, but they fought in detached bands and in skir- <lb/>
            mishes (which is the sign of the extremity of despair); <lb/>
            and at last, when evening came on, they all returned to <lb/>
            their tents, sorrowfully, each man accusing his neighbour <lb/>
            of inconsiderate rashness, because they had not taken the <lb/>
            advice of Fritigern, and avoided the labours and dangers <lb/>
            of a siege.</p>

          <p>§ 1. AFTER the battle, the soldiers devoted the whole night <lb/>
            (which, as it was summer, was not long) to tending the <lb/>
            wounded with all the remedies known to their nations, <lb/>
            and when daylight returned they began to discuss various <lb/>
            plans, doubting what to do. And after many plans had <lb/>
            been proposed and objected to, they at last decided to <lb/>
            occupy Perinthus, and then, every place where they could <lb/>
            hear that any treasures were stored up, the deserters and <lb/>
            fugitives having given them all the information they re- <lb/>
            quired, so that they learnt what was in every house, to say <lb/>
            nothing of what was in every city. Adopting this reso- <lb/>
            lution unanimously, which they thought the best, they <lb/>
            advanced by slow marches, ravaging and burning every- <lb/>
            thing as they passed.</p>
          <p>2. But those who had been besieged in Hadrianople, <lb/>
            after the barbarians had departed, as soon as scouts of <lb/>
            approved fidelity had reported that the whole place was <lb/>
            free from enemies, issued forth at midnight, and avoiding <lb/>
            the public causeways, took out-of-way roads through the <lb/>
            woods, and withdrew, some to Philippopolis, and from <lb/>
            thence to Serdica, others to Macedonia; with all the wealth <lb/>
            which they had saved undiminished, and pressing on with <lb/>
            the greatest exertion and celerity, as if they were likely to <pb n="622"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BK. XXXI. CH. XVI"/> <lb/>
            find Valens in those regions, since they were wholly igno- <lb/>
            rant that he had perished in battle, or else certainly (as <lb/>
            is rather believed) burnt to death in the cottage.</p>
          <p>3. Meanwhile the Goths, combining with the Huns and <lb/>
            Alani, both brave* and warlike tribes, and inured to toil <lb/>
            and hardship, whom Fritigern had with great ability won <lb/>
            over to his side by the temptation of great rewards—fixed <lb/>
            their camp near Perinthus ; but recollecting their previous <lb/>
            losses, they did not venture to come close to the city, or <lb/>
            make any attempt to take it; they, however, devastated <lb/>
            and entirely stripped the fertile territory surrounding it <lb/>
            slaying or making prisoners of the inhabitants.</p>
          <p>4. From hence they marched with speed to Constan- <lb/>
            tinople in battle array, from fear of ambuscadcs; being <lb/>
            eager to make themselves masters of its ample riches, and <lb/>
            resolved to try every means to take that illustrious city. <lb/>
            But while giving way to extravagant pride, and beating <lb/>
            almost against the barriers of the gates, they were repulsed <lb/>
            in this instance by the Deity.</p>
          <p>5. A body of Saracens (a nation of whose origin and <lb/>
            manners we have already given a full account in several <lb/>
            places), being more suited for sallies and skirmishes than <lb/>
            for pitched battles, had been lately introduced into the <lb/>
            city; and, as soon as they saw the barbarian host, they <lb/>
            sallied out boldly from the city to attack it. There was <lb/>
            a stubborn fight for some time; and at last both armies <lb/>
            parted on equal terms.</p>
          <p>6. But a strange and unprecedented incident gave the <lb/>
            final advantage to the eastern warriors; for one of them <lb/>
            with long hair, naked-with the exception of a covering <lb/>
            round his waist-shouting a hoarse and melancholy cry, <lb/>
            drew his dagger and plunged into the middle of the Gothic <lb/>
            host, and after he had slain an enemy, put his lips to hia <lb/>
            throat, and sucked his blood. The barbarians were ter- <lb/>
            rified at this marvellous prodigy, and from that time forth, <lb/>
            when they proceeded on any enterprise, displayed none of <lb/>
            their former and usual ferocity, but advanced with hesi- <lb/>
            tating steps.</p>
          <p>7. As time went on their ardour damped, and they began <lb/>
            to take into consideration the vast circuit of the walls <lb/>
            (which was the greater on account of the large space <lb/>
            occupied by mansions with gardens within it), the in <pb n="623"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="A.D. 378.]"/> <lb/>
            accessible beauties of the city, and the immensity of its <lb/>
            population; also the vicinity of the strait which divides <lb/>
            the Blaek Sea from the Ægean. Then after destroying <lb/>
            the works which they had constructed, having sustained <lb/>
            greater losses than they had inflicted, they raised the siege, <lb/>
            and roamed at random over the northern provinces, which <lb/>
            they traversed without restraint as far as the Julian Alps, <lb/>
            which the aneients used to call the Venetian Alps.</p>
          <p>8. At this time the energy and promptitude of Julius, <lb/>
            the commander of the forces on the other side of Mount <lb/>
            Taurus, was particularly distinguished ; for when he learnt <lb/>
            what had happened in Thrace, he sent secret letters to <lb/>
            all the governors of the different cities and forts, who were <lb/>
            all Romans (which at this time is not very common), request- <lb/>
            ing them, on one and the same day, as at a concerted signal, <lb/>
            to put to death all the Goths who had previously been <lb/>
            admitted into the places under their charge; first luring <lb/>
            them into the suburbs, in expectation of receiving the pay <lb/>
            which had been promised to them. This wise plan was <lb/>
            carried out without any disturbance or any delay; and <lb/>
            thus the Eastern provinces were delivered from great <lb/>
            dangers.</p>
          <p>9. Thus have I, a Greek by birth, and formerly a soldier, <lb/>
            related all the events from the accession of Nerva to the <lb/>
            death of Valens, to the best of my abilities; professing <lb/>
            above all things to tell the truth, which, as I believe, 1 <lb/>
            have never knowingly perverted, either by silenee or by <lb/>
            falsehood. Let better men in the flower of their age, and <lb/>
            of eminent accomplishments, relate the subsequent events. <lb/>
            But if it should please them to undertake the task, I warn <lb/>
            them to sharpen their tongues to a loftier style. <pb n="624"/>
