          <p>THE comedy of the Frogs was produced during the Lenaean festival, <lb/>
            at the commencement of the year B.C. 405, when Callias was Archon, <lb/>
            that Callias who, to distinguish him from other archons bearing the <lb/>
            same name, was commonly designated “the Callias who succeeded <lb/>
            Antigenes1.” It at once took its position, which has never since been <lb/>
            challenged, amongst the masterpieces of the Athenian drama. It carried <lb/>
            off the prize at the Lenaean 2 contest, from the " Muses " of Phrynichus, <lb/>
            which was placed second, and the “Cleophon" of Plato, which was <lb/>
            placed last; and the victorious poet was crowned in the full theatre with <lb/>
            the usual wreath of Bacchic ivy. But it achieved a far higher success <lb/>
            than this. It enjoyed the, apparently, unique distinction of being <lb/>
            acted a second time, as we should say, by request; and at this second <lb/>
            representation the poet was again crowned, not now with mere leaves <lb/>
            of ivy, but with a wreath made from Athene's sacred olive 3, an honour <lb/>
            reserved for citizens who were deemed to have rendered important <lb/>
            services to Athene's city.</p>
          <p>It was not for its wit and humour that these exceptional honours were <lb/>
            accorded to the play; nor yet for what to modern readers constitutes <lb/>
            its pre-eminent attraction, the literary contest between Aeschylus and <note type="footnote"> 1 ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ο μετὰ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αντιγένη</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It is interesting to observe that, of the extant comedies of Aristophanes, all <lb/>
            those which we know to have been exhibited at the City Dionysia, failed ; and all <lb/>
            which we know to have been exhibited at the Lenaean festival, gained the prize. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              Euripides. It was for the lofty strain of patriotism which breathed <lb/>
              through all its political allusions, and was especially felt in the advice <lb/>
              tendered, obviously with some misgiving as to the spirit in which the <lb/>
              audience would receive it, in the epirrhema of the parabasis. There <lb/>
              the poet appeals to the Athenian people to forego all party animosities, <lb/>
              to forget and forgive all political offences, to place the state on a broader <lb/>
              basis, to leave no Athenian disfranchised. More particularly, he pleads <lb/>
              for those who having been implicated in the establishment of the Council <lb/>
              of Four Hundred had1 ever since been deprived of all civic rights. They <lb/>
              could vote for no candidate, hold no office, and take no part in the <lb/>
              popular assemblies. Other citizens, however illiterate, enfranchised <lb/>
              slaves, half-breeds, and the like, would be hurrying on to support the <lb/>
              most ill-judged proposals of Cleophon; but they—men of the purest <lb/>
              Athenian blood, and the highest and most liberal Athenian culture- <lb/>
              must needs stand aside, as though they had neither part nor lot in the <lb/>
              Republic of Athens. Aristophanes calls upon the people to put an end <lb/>
              to this anomalous state of things, and to re-enfranchise all dis- <lb/>
              franchised Athenians; <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς ἀτίμους ἐπιτίμους ποιῆσαι</foreign>. His doubt as to <lb/>
              the reception of his appeal is manifested in every part of the epirrhema. <lb/>
              It is the Mystic Chorus, he insists, the Company of the Blessed Dead <lb/>
              who are taking upon themselves to advise the Athenian people; the <lb/>
              errors of the excluded citizens are described as slips and slidings, not <lb/>
              deliberate, but occasioned by the wily machinations of Phrynichus ; the <lb/>
              people whom he is addressing are mollified by the appellation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ σοφώτατοι <lb/>
              φύσει</foreign>, although in the antepirrhema, where he feels himself on safer <lb/>
              ground, he resorts to his more customary address <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠνόητοι</foreign>; while, both <lb/>
              before and afterwards, he indulges in a wild vein of harmless jocularity, <lb/>
              calculated to mitigate any ire which his boldness may have aroused.</p>
          <p>It tells much for the generosity of the Athenian people, that instead <lb/>
            of resenting the poet's appeal, they rewarded it with the highest and <lb/>
            most exceptional honours. For we are told on the authority of Dicaearchus, <note type="footnote"> 1 About five years. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            a writer of. the very greatest weight on such matters, that it was this <lb/>
            very appeal which won the admiration of the public, and obtained for the <lb/>
            play the honour of a second representation 1. And this is fully borne <lb/>
            out by the well-known fact that on the next political crisis, imme- <lb/>
            diately after the disaster of Aegospotami, the Athenians followed to the <lb/>
            letter the advice of Aristophanes, and their very first step was Tous <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτίμους ἐπιτίμους ποιῆσαι</foreign>, to enfranchise the disfranchised citizens. <lb/>
            " When your fleet was destroyed, and the siege commenced,” says Ando- <lb/>
            cides 2, “ye took counsel together to create harmony in the state, and <lb/>
            ye determined to enfranchise the disfranchised, and Patrocleides it was <lb/>
            who introduced the decree." He then sets out the decree, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήφισμα</foreign> <lb/>
            To <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πατροκλείδον</foreign>, and adds, " So then in pursuance of this decree, ye <lb/>
            enfranchised the disfranchised3.” So Xenophon speaking of the <lb/>
            commencement of the siege says 4, “The Athenians, having enfranchised <lb/>
            the disfranchised, held out." So Lysias, though with his usual vague- <lb/>
            ness and inaccuracy, says 5, " Your disposition was such that ye recalled <lb/>
            the exiles, and enfranchised the disfranchised." I say " with his usual <lb/>
            inaccuracy," because it is certain that the exiles did not return until <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὔτω</foreign> 8e <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθαυμάσθη διὰ τὴν ἐν αὐτῷ Παράβασιν καθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥν διαλλάττει τοὺς ἐντίμος</foreign> TOȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς <lb/>

              wishes of Aristophanes was the man whose unfortunate accident in the theatre is <lb/>
              recorded in the Birds (790-792), and who is by the Scholiast there described as <lb/>
              a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτικὸς</foreign>, a man who took part in public affairs. He had, indeed, little cause to <lb/>
              be grateful to Aristophanes, since it was doubtless from the poet's suggestion of <lb/>
              the advantages he would obtain from becoming a winged and feathered biped that <lb/>
              he acquired the nickname of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χεσᾶς</foreign> (Scholiast ubi supr. Pollux v, segm. 91), which <lb/>
              is merely the participle <foreign xml:lang="grc">χέσας</foreign>, accentuated into a bird's name, after the analogy <lb/>

              after the city had been surrendered to Lysander, and could not help <lb/>
              itself. It was one of the conditions of peace imposed by the Spartans. <lb/>
              Indeed, the passage already cited from Andocides goes on, "In pur- <lb/>
              suance of this decree ye enfranchised the disfranchised. But Patrocleides <lb/>
              did not propose, nor did ye decree, the return of the exiles. But when <lb/>
              the treaty with the Lacedaemonians was concluded, and ye dismantled <lb/>
              your walls and received back the exiles,” &amp;c.</p>
          <p>It seems certain that the comedy has come to our hands in the <lb/>
            revised form which it assumed on its second representation. The <lb/>
            strange duplication of certain passages towards the end of the play <lb/>
            must force itself upon the attention of the most unobservant reader: <lb/>
            a duplication which in my opinion arises in almost every case from the <lb/>
            fact that the reading of the original play has crept from the margin <lb/>
            into the text of the revised edition 1. There is a very similar duplication, <lb/>
            arising from the same circumstance, in some of Biron's speeches in Activ. <lb/>
            scene 3, and Act v. scene 2, of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost.</p>
          <p>But to my mind the most convincing passage is that contained in <lb/>
            lines 1109-1114. The Chorus have been exhorting the rival poets not <lb/>
            to rest content with a mere general criticism of their respective aims and <lb/>
            merits, but to come to close quarters, and to attack each other's dramas <lb/>
            in every possible way, with a minute dissection of individual lines, <lb/>
            phrases, and metres. This would obviously require an audience not <lb/>
            only thoroughly intelligent, as an Athenian audience would naturally <lb/>
            be, but also thoroughly primed in the details about to be discussed ; and <lb/>
            it is impossible to doubt that on the first representation of the Frogs <lb/>
            many of the most delicate hits would pass altogether unnoticed. But <lb/>
            this would not be so on the second representation. The play would <lb/>
            then have become public property; it would be in the hands of the <lb/>
            spectators, and they would not fail to appreciate and applaud every <lb/>
            point as it arose. And it is on this very ground that the Chorus <lb/>
            encourage the rivals to proceed. But if this ye fear, lest there be in the <note type="footnote"> 1 See the notes on lines 1251, 1431, and 1437. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            spectators any lack of knowledge, so that they will not recognize your <lb/>
            subtleties when ye speak them, be not afraid of this, since the matter is no <lb/>
            longer so. For they are old campaigners now; and each of them holding <lb/>
            a book of the words is conning your clever hits. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ</foreign> 'EO' <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕτω <lb/>
            ταῦτ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχει</foreign> seem to imply that on the first representation of the play the <lb/>
            audience were not always able <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ λεπτὰ γνῶναι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The play was acted about six months after the great naval victory <lb/>
            of Arginusae; about four months after the death of Euripides; and <lb/>
            about two months after the death of Sophocles.</p>
          <p>The victory of Arginusae was the result of an almost unexampled <lb/>
            effort on the part of the Athenian people. Conon, their most brilliant <lb/>
            officer, had been defeated at Mitylene, and was closely blockaded there. <lb/>
            One trireme managed to run the blockade, and bring news of his peril <lb/>
            to Athens. The Athenians received the intelligence in a spirit worthy <lb/>
            of their best traditions. All classes at once responded to the call with <lb/>
            hearty and contagious enthusiasm. In thirty days a fleet of 110 triremes, <lb/>
            fully equipped and manned, was able to put to sea. The knights had <lb/>
            emulated the devotion of their forefathers (as recorded in the parabasis <lb/>
            of the comedy which bears their name), and volunteered for service on <lb/>
            the unaccustomed element. The very slaves had been induced to join <lb/>
            by the promise of freedom and, what was even more than freedom, the <lb/>
            privileges of Athenian citizenship. Further triremes, as the fleet went <lb/>
            on, were obtained from the islands, till it finally reached a total of more <lb/>
            than 150 vessels. These exertions were rewarded by a victory which, <lb/>
            if it was the last, was also the most considerable of all that were gained <lb/>
            by the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War. And the slaves who <lb/>
            fought in the great battle were admitted to be free Athenian citizens1 <figure type="illustration">

              in this gloss, and again in the scholium on Frogs 720, was the famous old historian <lb/>
              of that name, who was himself a native of Mitylene. But he would have been <lb/>

              on the same liberal terms as had been granted to the Plataeans who had <lb/>
              escaped from their beleaguered city some one and twenty years before. <lb/>
              They were enrolled in Athenian tribes and domes and enjoyed all the <lb/>
              privileges of Athenian citizens, they and their sons after them for ever; <lb/>
              save only that the individuals first enfranchised were not eligible for <lb/>
              certain hereditary priesthoods (such as those of the Eumolpidae, the <lb/>
              Eteobutadae, and the Ceryces), nor yet for the office of Archon. This <lb/>
              exception was right and proper. It would have been very unpalatable <lb/>
              for an Athenian to see a man who had been brought up altogether <lb/>
              outside the Athenian traditions, and still more so for a master to see <lb/>
              his former slave, occupying the supreme position of Archon. Yet even <lb/>
              these excepted offices were not withheld from the children of the <lb/>
              Plataean, or of the slave, even though they were born before their father <lb/>
              acquired the Athenian citizenship.</p>
          <p>The wholesale conversion of loyal slaves into free Athenian citizens, <lb/>
            which met with the warmest approval of Aristophanes, readily lent <note type="footnote"> a younger chronicler, perhaps his son. As regards the enlistment of the slaves, <lb/>
            see Xenophon, Hell. i. 6. 24. The decree regulating the rights of the Pla- <lb/>
            taeans is preserved in the Oration against Neaera, § 136. ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιπποκράτης εἶπε Πλα</foreign>- </note> <figure type="illustration">

              Niebuhr's speculations on early Roman History, makes (in a note on Thuc. iii. 55) <lb/>
              the singularly unfortunate suggestion that the status of the Plataeans at Athens <lb/>
              was identical with what he describes as " the imperfect citizenship called at Rome <lb/>
              the Jus Caeritum." No analogy could be more misleading. The Plataeans had <lb/>
              the full rights of citizens, and could hold any public office, except (and that only <lb/>
              in the case of the first comers) the archonship and the hereditary priesthoods. <lb/>
              Those who were enrolled on the register of the Caerites had no public rights and <lb/>
              could hold no public office. In the passage cited from Aulus Genius, xvi. 13, <lb/>

              apparently supposing that Gellius " believed them to have been rewarded by an <lb/>
              exemption from all burdens and laborious duties." But for oneribus we should, <lb/>
              I think, read operibus, and translate but should devote themselves to commerce and <lb/>

              itself to comic humour; and throughout the play, whenever he alludes <lb/>
              to the battle of Arginusae, this incident is sure to crop up. In the <lb/>

              withhold it from freeborn Athenians, who, and whose fathers before them, <lb/>
              have fought so many battles for Athens ?” " 0 why was I not at the <lb/>
              sea-fight ? " cries Xanthias to his master1, " I would have bidden you go <lb/>
              and be hanged; I would hare snapped my fingers at your commands.” <lb/>
              “I take no slave on my ferry,” says Charon 2, “unless he fought in the <lb/>
              sea-fight,” in which case, be it observed, he would not be a slave at all. <lb/>
              And this consideration will, I think, lead us to the true signification of <lb/>
              a much misunderstood phrase in the last-mentioned passage, where the <lb/>
              battle of Arginusae is described as the sea-fight <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν κρεῶν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>" I take no slave," says Charon, A <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ νεναυμάχηκε τὴν περὶ τῶν κρεῶν</foreign>. <lb/>
            The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρέας</foreign>, as Aristarchus 3 is quoted by the Scholiast as saying, is <lb/>
            frequently used for <foreign xml:lang="grc">σῶμα</foreign>; and such is doubtless its meaning here. Now <lb/>
            a slave's body belonged not to himself but to his master. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig6.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              For a slave's body, such is fate, belongs <lb/>
              Not to himself, but to the man who bought him. <lb/>
              But a free man's body is his own; and he therefore who, in the courts <lb/>
              of law or elsewhere, was contending for his freedom (as opposed to <lb/>
              slavery), was said <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">σώματος ἀγωνίζεσθαι</foreign> to be contending for his <lb/>
              body, that is to say, for the ownership of his body. A remarkably <lb/>
              apposite illustration of this usage is supplied by the brief, but inter- <lb/>
              esting, oration of Lysias, Against Pancleon. The plaintiff had taken <lb/>
              proceedings before the Polemarch against Pancleon, believing him to be <lb/>
              a resident alien. To these proceedings Pancleon pleaded that he was <note type="footnote"> 1 Frogs 33, 34. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ibid. 190, 191. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Aristarchus quotes from the Chryses of Sophocles, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιοῦτος</foreign> <unclear>ὼν</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρξειε τοῦδε</foreign> TOO <lb/>

              a " Plataean " enrolled in the tribe Hippothoontis, and the deme of the <lb/>
              Deceleians, and was therefore a full Athenian citizen, over whom the <lb/>
              Polemarch had no jurisdiction. And the action was accordingly set <lb/>
              down to be heard, not on its merits, but on this preliminary plea to <lb/>
              the jurisdiction. The oration of Lysias was intended for the plaintiff's <lb/>
              speech on the trial of this preliminary issue. It attempts to show that <lb/>
              Pancleon, so far from being a “Plataean,” was not even a free man <lb/>
              (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ὅτι Πλαταιέα εἶναι, ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλεύθερον</foreign>), but the runaway slave of <lb/>
              a " Plataean” master; and that on a previous occasion he feared to <lb/>
              bring his claim to the proof; <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖ εἰδὼς ἑαυτὸν ὄντα δοῦλον, ἔδεισεν ἐγγυητὰς <lb/>
              καταστήσας περὶ τοῦ σώματος ἀγωνίσασθαι</foreign>, metuisse, as Reiske translates <lb/>
              it, periculum judicii de ingenuitate adire. Here we have the expression <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τοῦ σώματος ἀγωνίσασθαι</foreign> applied to a slave contending for the <lb/>
              rights of a “Plataean,” the identical position of the slaves who fought <lb/>
              at the battle of Arginusae. So far, therefore, as these slaves are con- <lb/>
              cerned—and it is only to them that the observation of Charon is <lb/>
              addressed—the battle of Arginusae was in truth a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάχη περὶ τῶν <lb/>
              σωμάτων</foreign>, or in a comedians language, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάχη περὶ τῶν κρεῶν</foreign>. And <lb/>
              this, I am persuaded, is the sense in which the words are here employed. <lb/>
              The opinions which have hitherto prevailed are given in the note <lb/>
              below1. <note type="footnote"> 1 There are three lines of interpretation, for we need not trouble ourselves <lb/>
              about Paulmier's suspicion, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεῶν</foreign> is somehow connected with a Mount Creon <lb/>
              in Lesbos, mentioned by Pliny : a suspicion which carried no conviction to <lb/>
              Paulmier's own mind, and has not commended itself to anybody else. But the <lb/>
              following interpretations have all received considerable support. <lb/>
              (1) That <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν κρεῶν</foreign> means <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν σωμάτων</foreign>, on the ground that his <foreign xml:lang="grc">σῶμα</foreign> <lb/>
              was a slave's only possession. <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν στρατευομένων δούλων, οἵτινες περὶ τοῦ <lb/>
              σώματος μόνου μάχοντοι</foreign>.—Proverb 107 amongst those published with Plutarch's <lb/>

              σῶμα</foreign>.—Scholiast. "Ego puto," says Duker (whose notes are collected at the end <lb/>
              of Bergler's edition), "hoc a Schol. ideo dici, quia existimat servos qui patriam <lb/>
              vel pecuniam non haberent, non pro his, sed tantum pro propria vita quam solam <lb/>
              habebant, et amittere poterant, pugnasse ; " and he cites the proverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ λαγὼς τὸν <lb/>
              περὶ τῶν κρεῶν τρέχε</foreign>t. Kuster also relies on this proverb; " quod dicitur," he <lb/>
              thinks, " in eos qui de corpore suo tantum periclitantur, nec quicquam aliud quod </note> <pb n="xiii"/>
              </p>
          <p>To the subsequent tragedy, which made the victory of Arginusae <lb/>
            a word of shame, instead of a word of glory, in the annals of Athens- <lb/>
            I mean the condemnation of the victorious generals, and the execution of <lb/>
            the six who ventured within the reach of the democracy—Aristophanes <lb/>
            makes but one, and that a very faint and obscure, allusion. Aeschylus <lb/>
            is considering whether it is right to predicate of Oedipus that he was <lb/>
            ever deserving of the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺδαίμων</foreign> ; and running through the various <lb/>
            calamities of his life, he comes at last to the statement, he blinded <lb/>
            himself, whereupon Dionysus at once cuts in with the remark- <note type="footnote"> amittere possint, habent, veluti servi in pugna navali ad Arginusas." Gataker <lb/>
            had triumphantly argued that <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν κρεῶν</foreign> could not mean <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν σωμάτων</foreign>, <lb/>
            since Xanthias had only one body; not observing, apparently, that Charon's <lb/>
            words are, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεναυμάχηκε</foreign> 7r<foreign xml:lang="grc">ερὶ ῶτν κρεῶν</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεναυμάχηκε</foreign> THN <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν κρεῶν</foreign>, <lb/>
            a battle in which not one slave only, but many slaves were fighting <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν <lb/>
            σωμάτων</foreign>. However, as is shown in the text, a slave's body was emphatically not <lb/>
            his own possession. <lb/>
            (2) That <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν κρεῶν</foreign>, is equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν νεκρῶν</foreign>. This explanation also <lb/>
            is mentioned by the Scholiast, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεκρῶν</foreign> is actually read for <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεῶν</foreign> in some <lb/>
            inferior MSS. It is to some extent countenanced by the great authority of <lb/>
            Bentley, who says “<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ νεκρῶν</foreign> optime personae Charontis aptatur," and is strongly <lb/>
            supported by Brunck. Yet it seems devoid of all sense, since there never was <lb/>
            a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάχη περὶ τῶν νεκρῶν</foreign>. No question as to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεκρῶν</foreign> arose until the battle was <lb/>
            over and done ; and even then, the question related as much to the living as to. <lb/>
            the dead. <lb/>
            (3) That <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ τῶν κρεῶν</foreign> refers to the fleshpots which the slaves hoped to gain as <lb/>
            their reward. This was Gataker's opinion, who considered that the words pointed <lb/>
            to the “indolem servorum, qui bus cibus et carnes ipsa vita est." And this was <lb/>
            adopted by Spanheim, whose notes are given at the end of Kuster's edition, and <lb/>
            who held that the phrase was employed plane ad solitam servorum ingluviem <lb/>
            denotandam, et pro qua, velut pro aris et focis, navali praelio dimicassent." <lb/>
            Dr. Verrall alone, with his usual penetration, saw that the words must " describe <lb/>
            the object for which the slaves fought, that is, the freedom and the citizenship " <lb/>
            (Classical Review, iii. 258). And he raises this third interpretation to a higher <lb/>
            level, by taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεῶν</foreign> to refer to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ κρέα ἐξ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απατουρίων</foreign> (Thesm. 558), comparing <lb/>
            Acharnians 146. This gives a very satisfactory meaning to the words, and I should <lb/>
            certainly have adopted it, had I not long previously come to the conclusion that <lb/>
            the true interpretation is that given above. And, indeed, I doubt if the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρεῶν</foreign>, used simpliciter, would have conveyed to the audience any idea of the <lb/>
            Apaturian festival. </note> <pb n="xiv"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig7.jpg"/></figure> meaning, I suppose, that had Oedipus been a colleague of Erasinides in <lb/>
              the <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατηγία</foreign>, his blindness would have been a piece of good fortune. <lb/>
              For then he would not have gone to the great battle, and so would not <lb/>
              have fallen a victim to the machinations of Theramenes and the madness <lb/>
              of the people. This is the only direct allusion to the fate of the generals. <lb/>
              But doubtless it was to the attack of "the blear-eyed Archedemus " upon <lb/>
              Erasinides, the precursor of the graver charge, that the scorn and contempt <lb/>
              with which he is twice2 mentioned in this play are mainly due; and <lb/>
              Theramenes owes the ironical censure twice3 passed upon his career <lb/>
              rather to the fatal ingenuity with which he shifted the blame from <lb/>
              his own shoulders to those of. the generals, than to his former double- <lb/>
              dealing in the affair of the Four Hundred.</p>
          <p>At the commencement of the play we find Dionysus journeying to the <lb/>
            world below, for the express and only purpose of bringing back Euripides <lb/>
            to the Athenian stage. And one reason which he gives for the selection <lb/>
            of Euripides is that he is a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανοῦργος</foreign>, a man up to anything, a master of <lb/>
            shifts and evasions, who would readily assist in carrying out any plan <lb/>
            that might be devised for his rescue. We should therefore naturally <lb/>
            suppose that we were intended presently to witness a series of scenes <lb/>
            analogous to those in the Thesmophoriazusae ; we should expect to see <lb/>
            Euripides utilizing for the purpose of effectuating his own escape some of <lb/>
            the ingenious schemes and devices contained in his own plays, just as he <lb/>
            had utilized them in the earlier comedy for the purpose of effectuating <lb/>
            the escape of Mnesilochus. But nothing of the kind occurs ; there is no <lb/>
            idea of an escape; no artful contrivance is required; the plot takes an <lb/>
            entirely different trend; nor is Euripides brought back. We shall <lb/>
            return to this subject shortly.</p>
          <p>The Chorus of the play are the Blessed Mystics, those who had on <lb/>
            earth been initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries, and had led a holy <note type="footnote"> 1 Frogs 1195, 1196. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ibid. 417, 588. A </note><note type="footnote">3 Ibid. 541, 968. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xv"/>
            and virtuous life in accordance with the doctrines therein inculcated. <lb/>
            But before they make their entrance in that character their voices have <lb/>
            been heard from behind the scenes chanting the melodious songs of the <lb/>
            dead frogs, from whom the comedy derives its name. They do not enter <lb/>
            until some scenes later, and then they come in singing a series of hymns <lb/>
            and songs, which are not, as commonly supposed, mere unconnected <lb/>
            lyrics, but are a continuous presentation of the earlier stages of their <lb/>
            annual procession to Eleusis, from the moment when they call Iacchus <lb/>
            forth from his sumptuous temple at Athens down to the time when, <lb/>
            having passed over the bridge of Cephisus, they are streaming away to <lb/>
            weave their mystic sports and dances on the Thriasian plain.</p>
          <p>Brimful as the comedy is of genial humour and exuberant vivacity, it <lb/>
            nevertheless, to my mind at least, is everywhere invested with a certain <lb/>
            solemnity. This is doubtless due, in part, to the fact just mentioned, <lb/>
            that the Chorus consists not, as in other comedies, of Athenian citizens, <lb/>
            or of comic creations, but of dead mystae, performing in the world below <lb/>
            the religious ceremonies which they had, in life, performed in the world <lb/>
            above ; and partly again to the circumstance that the action lies chiefly <lb/>
            among the dead, and that the great poetical contest which it describes is <lb/>
            a contest between two dead poets; but most of all, perhaps, to our <lb/>
            knowledge of the terrible time at which the play was produced, when <lb/>
            the long anguish of the Deceleian War was visibly drawing to a close, <lb/>
            and when the Athenian Empire certainly, and possibly the very existence <lb/>
            of Athens, seemed in risk of immediate extinction.</p>
          <p>After passing through various adventures Dionysus arrives safely at <lb/>
            the halls of Pluto, and we are at once confronted with an entirely <lb/>
            unexpected situation. For it so happens that, at the moment of his <lb/>
            arrival, a dramatic contest is about to commence between Aeschylus and <lb/>
            Euripides; and Dionysus, clean forgetting the errand on which he came, <lb/>
            readily undertakes to act as judge. The actual contest, without reckoning <lb/>
            either the preliminary discussions or the political catechism by which it is <lb/>
            succeeded, occupies 551 lines (from 875 to 1413, according to Brunck's <lb/>
            numbering, which is adopted by all editors, whatever the number of their <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            own lines may be), more than a third of the entire play. Its object is to <lb/>
            determine which is the better tragedian of the two; and the rivals <lb/>
            discuss not only their general merits and demerits, but also various <lb/>
            subordinate questions, their prologues, their choral metres, and the <lb/>
            weight of their iambic verses. And all their dramatic stores, both old <lb/>
            and new, TO. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τε παλαιὰ καὶ τὰ καινὰ</foreign>, are ransacked for passages to support <lb/>
            their respective contentions.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to believe that all this detailed and elaborate criticism, <lb/>
            together with the remainder of the play in which it is found, can have <lb/>
            been entirely worked out during the very brief period which had elapsed <lb/>
            since the death of Euripides; especially since from that period itself we <lb/>
            must deduct, at its commencement, the time that would pass before the <lb/>
            news of the poet's death, which occurred in Macedonia, would have been <lb/>
            received at Athens; and at its'close, the time required for the submission <lb/>
            of the play to, and its acceptance by, the Archon; the granting of <lb/>
            a Chorus; the training of the Chorus; the rehearsals; and all the <lb/>
            arduous preparation required for placing the comedy on the stage. It <lb/>
            seems far more probable that the contrast between Aeschylus and <lb/>
            Euripides, which had been present 1 to the mind of Aristophanes from <lb/>
            the very commencement of his career, had taken this form before the <lb/>
            younger tragedian's death; and that Aristophanes, finding the time too <lb/>
            short for the completion of the play on the lines originally intended, fell <lb/>
            back upon this great scene which was ready to his hand, and inserted it <lb/>
            in a comedy with the plot of which it was quite unconnected. And, <lb/>
            indeed, it can hardly be said to be woven into the texture of the play at <lb/>
            all; it is but loosely tacked on, and the stitches by. which it is attached <lb/>
            to the main fabric are quite visible to a careful observer.</p>
          <p>Nothing can be more abrupt than the manner in which the first <lb/>
            mention of the contest is dragged in, some 120 lines before the contest <lb/>
            itself begins. It does not spring out of anything which has gone before. <lb/>
            Two slaves are talking, and in the very midst of a speech one of them <note type="footnote"> 1 See Clouds 1365-1372, which is a sort of foreshadowing of the contest in the <lb/>
            present play. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            breaks off, and asks the other, 1 Why, what is the meaning of all that <lb/>
            hubbub ? And the other explains that a contest is impending between <lb/>
            the two great tragedians. And when we come to the contest itself there <lb/>
            is not, throughout its whole progress (from line 875 to line 1413), <lb/>
            a single syllable tending to show that it is taking place in the world <lb/>
            below; nor is Euripides ever spoken of as if he were dead. On the <lb/>
            contrary, there is one passage from which, if this scene were detached <lb/>
            from the rest of the play, we should certainly assume that he was still <lb/>
            alive. To the question what Euripides deserves if the charges brought <lb/>
            against him by Aeschylus are sustained, Dionysus promptly replies, " He <lb/>
            deserves to DIE 2." In itself the language seems to imply that he was <lb/>
            still alive: although, as the play stands, it is of course a mere joke, the <lb/>
            joke of dooming to death a person who is already dead. And in truth <lb/>
            the poetical contest is so foreign to the general purpose of the play, that <lb/>
            we cannot be surprised to find that it ends in a complete fiasco. Dionysus, <lb/>
            the chosen judge, having heard the entire competition, declares himself <lb/>
            unable or unwilling to give any judgement at all.</p>
          <p>And now a singular thing occurs. Pluto, who has been present during <lb/>
            the last 600 lines, or thereabouts, without once opening his mouth, <lb/>
            suddenly breaks silence, and announces that the successful poet-whose <lb/>
            promised reward has hitherto been the right to occupy the Chair of <lb/>
            Tragedy in the Prytaneum of Hades-shaH return with Dionysus to the <lb/>
            world above. We therefore, at the close of the poetical contest, return <lb/>
            to the old purpose of the play as abruptly as we left it when that contest <lb/>
            commenced. And Dionysus marks the change more distinctly by declaring <lb/>
            that he will choose, not necessarily the better tragedian (which was the <lb/>
            sole object of the poetical competition), but the man who can give to <lb/>
            the State the wiser political counsel. The counsel of Aeschylus—that <lb/>
            Alcibiades shall be recalled, and the entire resources of the State devoted <lb/>
            to the aggrandizement of the fleet-commends itself to Dionysus, who <lb/>
            on that ground, and that only, awards the victory to Aeschylus. And <note type="footnote"> 1 Frogs 757. </note><note type="footnote">2 Ibid. 1012. </note> <note type="footnote"> FROGS </note> <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>

            Aeschylus therefore it is who .reascends to earth, to do what he can for <lb/>
            the city in her hour of need. Yet the decision, though made without <lb/>
            the slightest reference to the dramatic merits of the two contending <lb/>
            tragedians, carries with it, strangely enough 1, the right to occupy the <lb/>
            Tragic Chair. All this curious jumble is occasioned by the clashing of <lb/>
            the two motives, the motive of the poetical contest, and the motive <lb/>
            of the general plot of the comedy.</p>
          <p>Whatever may be the secret history of this poetical contest, it has <lb/>
            always formed a most important, and to modern readers probably the <lb/>
            most interesting, section of the Comedy of the Frogs. It consists of four <lb/>
            distinct trials of strength, divided from each other by choral songs; <lb/>
            the rivals discussing (1) their general merits and demerits, (2) their <lb/>
            prologues, (3) their choral metres, and (4) the weight of their iambic <lb/>
            verses. It may, perhaps, be permissible to make a few observations on <lb/>
            this great contest here, at somewhat greater length than would be con- <lb/>
            venient in a footnote.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">I. THEIR GENERAL MERITS AND DEMERITS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This, though by far the most important, one might almost say the <lb/>
            only important and serious, part of the criticism, need not delay us long. <lb/>
            To enter at large into the perennial controversy as to the relative merits <lb/>
            of Aeschylus and Euripides is no part of the duty of an editor of Aris- <lb/>
            tophanes. But a few brief remarks may not be considered out of place.</p>
          <p>It must be remembered that this is not the case of two poets <lb/>
            striving after the same ideal, and one approaching it more closely than <lb/>
            the other. Their ideals, their aims, their views of the tragic art are in <lb/>
            almost every respect diametrically opposed; so that what to the one <lb/>
            might seem the chief merit of a play, to the other might appear its <lb/>
            greatest defect. The object of Aeschylus was to elevate the drama : to <lb/>
            give to his audience an impressive and worthy representation of the <lb/>
            demigods and heroes of their noble traditions. To this end he intro- <note type="footnote"> 1 Frogs 1515-1523. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xix"/>
            duced the stately robe, the lofty buskin : and, far more important than <lb/>
            robe or buskin, the lofty sentiment and the stately language. To <lb/>
            Euripides all this appeared mere idle pomposity: his aim was to bring <lb/>
            down the drama to the level of ordinary humanity and every-day life. <lb/>
            And this contrast is the main topic in the first encounter of the poetical <lb/>
            contest. In it each poet is made to give his own view of the aims and <lb/>
            objects which tragic poets should set before them: Aeschylus considering <lb/>
            it their duty to describe heroic deeds, and clothe noble thoughts in noble <lb/>
            language; whilst Euripides insists that they ought to portray the world <lb/>
            as they find it, describing the deeds, unveiling the motives, and employ- <lb/>
            ing the language, of daily life. The idea of Aeschylus is to elevate and <lb/>
            exalt the minds of the audience: the idea of Euripides is to paint the <lb/>
            world, its passions and infirmities, as they really are 1. Each may be <lb/>
            considered to have summed up his own theory in a single half-verse. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πάνυ δὴ ΔΕ</foreign>l <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηστὰ λέλειν ἡμᾶς</foreign> (1056), It is our bounden duty to speak <lb/>
            what is noble and good, is the language, and might be taken as the motto, <lb/>
            of Aeschylus; <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρὴ φράζειν ἀνθρωπείως</foreign> (1058), We ought to speak all other <lb/>
            men speak, is the language and motto of Euripides. Each theory will <lb/>
            always have its advocates ; it is my good fortune, as a translator of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, to be in entire accord with the views of my author.</p>
          <p>From the foregoing considerations it naturally follows that neither <lb/>
            poet altogether denies the charges advanced by the other. He merely <lb/>
            denies that the characteristic attacked is a blemish, and claims it as <lb/>
            a merit. If Euripides reproaches Aeschylus with his gigantic com- <lb/>
            pounds and grandiloquent language, Aeschylus does not deny the <lb/>
            grandiloquence, but maintains that his is the only diction befitting <lb/>
            the divine and heroic personages which both poets brought upon the <lb/>
            stage. If Aeschylus censures his opponent for infusing a talkative and <lb/>
            argumentative spirit into the Athenian people, Euripides is so far from <lb/>
            denying the charge, that he glories in it as one of his brightest achieve- <note type="footnote"> 1 " Aeschylus is the prophet of Greek Tragedy, as Sophocles is the artist, and <lb/>

            ments. They agree as to the facts : they differ only in their estimate of <lb/>
            the facts.</p>
          <p>Perhaps one other point should be mentioned. It is frequently said <lb/>
            that the antagonism of Aristophanes to the dramatic influence of <lb/>
            Euripides was based on considerations of morality. And this is per- <lb/>
            fectly true; only it must not be understood as suggesting that Euripides <lb/>
            was, in any sense whatever, the holder or propagator of immoral prin- <lb/>
            ciples. But1 the great civic and social virtues, honour and justice <lb/>
            and valour, patriotism and self-devotion, respect to parents and reverence <lb/>
            to the gods, and the like-virtues which to Aeschylus, and generally <lb/>
            to the Athenians of the old heroic days, were matters of conscience, <lb/>
            about which no discussion could be tolerated-were by Euripides brought <lb/>
            to the test of " that universal solvent, the wild living intellect of man." <lb/>
            There were few, if any, virtues, and few, if any, vices, for and against <lb/>
            which a store of arguments might not be found somewhere in the plays <lb/>
            of Euripides. And though he himself might conclude in favour of the <lb/>
            right, yet he left it open for a more powerful or more plausible reasoner <lb/>
            to turn the scale in favour of the wrong. Euripides might hold, as <lb/>
            Hippolytus in the tragedy named after him did certainly hold, that an <lb/>
            oath must be kept inviolate, even though taken in ignorance of what it <note type="footnote"> 1 Professor Butcher, in his "Aristotle's Theory of Poetry," chap. v, speaking of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, observes :— <lb/>
            " The censure he passes on Euripides is primarily a moral censure. Even where <lb/>
            the judgement may seem to be of an aesthetic kind, a moral motive underlies it. <lb/>
            In him are embodied all the tendencies of the time which Aristophanes most <lb/>
            abhors. He is the spirit of the age personified ; with its restlessness, its scepticism, <lb/>
            its sentimentalism, its unsparing questioning of old traditions, of religious usages, <lb/>
            and civic loyalty; its frivolous disputations, which unfit men for the practical <lb/>
            work of life; its lowered idea of courage and patriotism. Every phase of the <lb/>
            sophistic spirit he discovers in Euripides. There is a bewildering dialectic which <lb/>
            perplexes the moral sense. Duties, whose appeal to the conscience is immediate, <lb/>
            and which are recognized as having a binding force, are in Euripides subjected to <lb/>
            analysis. Again, Euripides is censured for exciting feeling by any means that <lb/>
            come to hand.... Genuine misery does not consist in a beggar's rags or in <lb/>
            a hobbling gait. Euripides substitutes the troubling of the senses for genuine <lb/>
            tragic emotion." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxi"/>
            involved; but the theory that in some circumstances an oath might not <lb/>
            be binding on the conscience, had been disseminated amongst a quick <lb/>
            and ingenious audience, and might bring forth fruit which the poet <lb/>
            little meant.</p>
          <p>I do not propose to enter more largely into this part of the con- <lb/>
            troversy between the two poets; but some very admirable and instructive <lb/>
            remarks on the subject, which I have been permitted by the kindness <lb/>
            of Sir R. C. Jebb to extract from his lectures on " The Growth and <lb/>

            <title type="sub">II. THEIR PROLOGUES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>In the second encounter the combatants no longer deal with the <lb/>
            general theory of tragic poetry, but commence their criticism of special <lb/>
            portions of a tragic play. "We will first begin with the prologue," <lb/>
            Euripides is made to observe, since the prologue is the first beginning <lb/>
            of a play." But in truth there is no method in these attacks. Aristo- <lb/>
            phanes merely selects one point here and another there, just as they <lb/>
            seem to afford the readiest handle to his wit and satire.</p>
          <p>Euripides was accustomed to make his prologue an exposition of the <lb/>
            facts upon which his play was founded ; a vehicle for conveying to the <lb/>
            audience the information which was necessary to bring them to the <lb/>
            point at which the action of the drama commenced. His prologues, as <lb/>
            a rule, consisted of a lucid and neatly-worded historical narrative; and <lb/>
            the charge which he first brings against his rivals prologues is founded <lb/>
            on the obscurity and ambiguity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσάφεια</foreign>) of their language. It must <lb/>
            be admitted that he could not have selected a prologue more suitable <lb/>
            for his purpose than the stately and impressive lines with which the <lb/>
            Choephoroe opens; lines, it is to be observed, which do not exist in <lb/>
            the imperfect MS. of the Choephoroe, and which would have been <lb/>
            altogether lost if they had not been cited in the Frogs. The lines are <lb/>
            spoken by Orestes over the grave of his murdered father :— <pb n="xxii"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig8.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The first line consists of five words only ; but each of its '.last three <lb/>
              words is susceptible of two very different interpretations, neither 'of <lb/>
              which can be called in any way repugnant to the context. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πατρῷα</foreign> may <lb/>
              signify either " belonging to my father, Agamemnon," or " belonging to <lb/>
              thy father Zeus"; <foreign xml:lang="grc">κράτη</foreign> may refer either to an earthly rule, or to a <lb/>
              divine attribute; whilst <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐποπτεύων</foreign> may be employed either in the <lb/>
              ordinary sense of " surveying, overlooking" or in the special1 Eleu- <lb/>
              sinian sense of "participating in." Euripides takes the first (or human) <lb/>
              interpretation of each word : Aeschylus explains that he meant them all <lb/>
              to bear the second. Euripides understands them to mean " overlooking <lb/>
              my father's realm" and inquires whether the god of craft was supposed <lb/>
              to be looking on when Agamemnon met his death by a woman's craft. <lb/>
              Aeschylus replies that the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρῷα κράτη</foreign> refers to the benignant <lb/>
              power of the supreme divinity, Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὺς σωτὴρ</foreign>, the saviour Zeus• and that <lb/>
              Orestes is beseeching Hermes to take up that great power, and so become <lb/>
              a saviour to him, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωτὴρ γενοῦ μοι</foreign>2 Widely different as these inter- <note type="footnote"> 1 The words are the words of Aeschylus, himself an Eleusinian by birth, himself <lb/>
              initiated (and, indeed, accused of divulging in his plays the incommunicable <lb/>
              secrets of the Mysteries), who, before the contest begins, commends himself to <lb/>
              Demeter as the guardian and nourisher of his spirit, and prays that he may be <lb/>
              found worthy of her sacred Mysteries. The mystic chorus, whatever may have <lb/>
              been the original reason for their selection, contribute largely to the Aeschylean <lb/>
              character of the play they take an active and interested part in the contest for <lb/>
              he poetic supremacy ; they greet with songs of joy the victory of their own <lb/>
              special poet; and finally escort him up to earth with the blaze of their mystic <lb/>
              torches, and echoes of his own heroic melodies. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " At the very commencement of the Choephoroe, Orestes prays at his father's <lb/>
              tomb that Hermes may have such a share in the power of his father, the saviour <lb/>

              tions on the Eumenides," paragraph 94. He considers, indeed, that this interpre- <lb/>
              tation " is at variance with that which Aristophanes makes Aeschylus himself give <lb/>
              in the Frogs," and says, very finely, "We appeal from the Aristophanic manes of </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="xxiii"/>
              pretations are from each other, they are both legitimate explanations of <lb/>
              the Greek, nor can either be said to be unsuitable to the circumstances <lb/>
              under which the words were uttered. Herein lies the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσάφεια</foreign> of which <lb/>
              Euripides complains. And he charges the lines cited with yet another <lb/>
              defect, namely, the defect of tautology. Of this he gives two instances. <lb/>
              The first is in the third line <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκω ... καὶ κατέρχομαι. ἥκω</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέρ- <lb/>
              χομαι</foreign> mean exactly the same thing, he says. Aeschylus has no difficulty <lb/>
              in showing that this is not the case. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκειν</foreign>, he points out, may be <lb/>
              predicated of anybody arriving anywhere; it connotes nothing beyond <lb/>
              the mere fact of arrival; whilst <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέρχεσθαι</foreign> involves the further idea of <lb/>
              the exile returning to his home. This is true, and yet perhaps the answer <lb/>
              is not quite satisfactory. It shows that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέρχομαι</foreign> introduces a new <lb/>
              idea, beyond what <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκω</foreign>, by itself, would convey; but it does not show <lb/>
              that the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέρχομαι</foreign> is in any way extended by the addition <lb/>
              of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκω</foreign>. And so with the next objection, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλύειν, ἀκοῦσαι</foreign>, which is only <lb/>
              met by a joke of Dionysus. It is possible that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκοῦσαι</foreign> may signify more <lb/>
              than <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλύειν</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κλύοντες</foreign> OVK <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤκουον</foreign> Prom. 456), but <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλύειν</foreign>, apparently, does <lb/>
              not imply anything not comprehended in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκοῦσαι</foreign>. In neither case is <lb/>
              the meaning of the two words identical, but in each the second appears <lb/>
              to comprehend the first.</p>
          <p>The true answer to objections of this character is that this is the <lb/>
            prayer of Orestes over the grave, now beheld for the first time, of his <lb/>
            mighty and cruelly murdered father, whose death he has returned to <lb/>
            avenge; and that in moments of strong emotion and exaltation of feeling <lb/>
            the soul can only satisfy itself by repeated iteration of the selfsame <lb/>
            thought. Take the appeal of a lover to his mistress; take, as in the <lb/>
            passage before us, the uplifting of the soul in prayer; take the litanies <lb/>
            of the Church in all ages. Our own Liturgy1 teems with such instances. <note type="footnote"> Aeschylus to the spirit of the ancient hero still breathing in his tragedies." But <lb/>
            in my judgement the interpretation of Müller is in entire accord with that of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 I see that Dr. Merry, in his note on line 1174, refers to the expression "We <lb/>
            have erred and strayed " in the General Confession. I was not aware of it when <lb/>
            I wrote this Introduction. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxiv"/>
            I may perhaps, without offence, quote some passages from the General <lb/>
            Exhortation ; " to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wicked- <lb/>
            ness" "with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient heart," " by His <lb/>
            infinite goodness and mercy," " when we assemble and meet together," <lb/>
            " wherefore I pray and beseech you." Doubtless in all these passages <lb/>
            (as in the lines of Aeschylus) an acute grammarian might detect some <lb/>
            distinction between the synonyms, but such a distinction would not be <lb/>
            perceptible to ordinary worshippers.</p>
          <p>It is now the turn of Aeschylus to dissect his opponents prologues, <lb/>
            and, after a short criticism of the first two lines of the Antigone of <lb/>
            Euripides (which is perhaps sufficiently discussed in the Commentary), he <lb/>
            propounds his famous <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον</foreign> test. Euripides was fond of commencing <lb/>
            his plays, as we have already observed, with an historical narrative, <lb/>
            which was occasionally prefaced by some philosophical apophthegms; <lb/>
            and Aeschylus proposes to show that as a rule, within the first three <lb/>
            lines, the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">άριονἀπώλεσεν</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυλάκιον <lb/>
            ἀπώλεσεν</foreign> can be so tacked on as to complete the metre and complete the <lb/>
            sense. Euripides recites six prologues, and in each of them, before three <lb/>
            lines are over, the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign> fit in exactly as Aeschylus <lb/>
            had predicted. We may well believe that the tacking of this formula <lb/>
            to the well-known prologues of Euripides produced an irresistibly comic <lb/>
            effect; an effect so lasting that the 1 trochaic dimeter catalectic—the <lb/>
            section of the line displaced by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign>—was <lb/>
            thenceforth named by metrical writers the 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐριπίδειον</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ληκύθιον</foreign>. <note type="footnote">1 A trochaic dimeter is — ∪ | — ∪ || — ∪ | — ∪ ||. A trochaic dimeter catalectic <lb/>
            is — ∪ I - ∪ || — ∪ | — ||. The latter is the section displaced by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον <lb/>
            ἀπώλεσεν</foreign>. Thus, in line 1213, the words displaced are <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρθένοις σὺνΔελφίσιν</foreign> : in <lb/>

          <p>Commentators have disquieted themselves in vain to determine the <lb/>
            real defect at which Aristophanes is aiming; for there is no real defect; <lb/>
            the criticism is merely comic. Some indeed have supposed him to be <lb/>
            ridiculing the constant break in the line after the first 2½ feet: but <lb/>
            this is out of the question. No break is more common or more <lb/>
            harmonious than this, and it would be difficult to cite any set of <lb/>
            iambic trimeters in which it does not occur. In the first twenty lines <lb/>
            of the humenides it is found no less than eighteen times. And indeed <lb/>
            the prologue of that tragedy affords a very happy example for the <lb/>
            application of this tag. It begins- <figure type="illustration">

          <p>With this the prologue competition concludes, and we now proceed to <lb/>
            the third question.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">III. THEIR CHORAL METRES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Euripides, as usual, is on the alert, and eager to commence the fray. <lb/>
            He puts in two ways the case he is going to make. He will display the <lb/>
            sameness of his rival's metres (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸνἀποδείξω κακὸ Μελοποιὸν ὄνταΚ</foreign>at <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιοῦντα ταὔτ' ἀεί</foreign>). And again, he will cut down all his metres to one <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς ἓν γὰρ αὐτοῦ πάντα τὰ μέλη ξυντεμῶ</foreign>).</p>
          <p>What then is this particular metre which is so continually cropping up <lb/>
            in the Choral Odes of Aeschylus ?</p>
          <p>Now we know that Aeschylus was, to adopt Mr. Keble's 1 felicitous <note type="footnote"> second explanation is mere nonsense ; the first is undoubtedly correct. I can but <lb/>
            marvel at C. 0. Müller's notion that the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθν</foreign> denoted the metre before <lb/>
            the date of the Frogs ; and that the formula <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign> involved an allusion <lb/>
            to the clipping off by Aeschylus, from a verse of Euripides, a. dimeter trochaic <lb/>
            catalectic.—"Dissertations on the Eumenides," paragraph 23. It is plain that both <lb/>
            the names, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὐριπίδειον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ληκύθιον</foreign>, are derived from this scene. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Ne dubitemus Aeschylum dicere Tragoedorum Atticorum '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ομηρικώτατο</foreign>.—Keble, <lb/>
            " Praelectiones Academicae," xvii. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ καλαῦ καὶ λαμπροῦ Αἰσχύλου, ὂ</foreign>s <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς αὑτοῦ τραγῳ</foreign>- </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvi"/>
            phrase, " Tragoedorum Atticorum '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ομηρικώταος</foreign>." And he himself <lb/>
            described his tragedies as " slices cut from Homer's mighty feast." <lb/>
            And we cannot wonder therefore if the roll of the Homeric hexameter <lb/>
            was always sounding in his mind, and constantly reproducing itself in <lb/>
            his choral measures. And this is, in truth, the charge which Euripides <lb/>
            is bringing against him. In whatever metre the lyrics of Aeschylus <lb/>
            may commence, says his rival, yon are sure to find them, sooner or later, <lb/>
            assuming the form of the Homeric hexameter.</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig11.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>The one standard to which the lyrics of Aeschylus are to be cut <lb/>
            down is -<foreign xml:lang="grc">ενος προσέφη πόδας ὠκὺς 'Αχιλλεὺς</foreign>, or, to use the line which <lb/>
            Aristophanes either invented himself, or, more probably, was fortunate <lb/>
            enough to find ready-made to his hand in the Myrmidons of Aeschylus, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig12.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>Euripides therefore selects five lines from the choral odes of Aeschylus— <lb/>
            one from each of the following tragedies, the Myrmidons, the Psychagogi, <lb/>
            the Telephus, the Priestesses, and the Agamemnon-and shows that the <lb/>
            last twelve syllables of each are in the exact metre of the standard, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰὴ <lb/>
            κοπον, οὺ πελάθεις ἐπ'ἀρωγάν</foreign>. To make this perfectly clear, he repeats <lb/>
            the standard after each selected line.</p>
          <p>The standard is really an Homeric hexameter which has dropped its <lb/>
            first foot, and all but the last syllable of the second. It so happens that <lb/>
            its own first syllable is short, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῐη̄</foreign>, so that it represents an hexameter in <lb/>
            which the second foot is a dactyl. And consequently, in each of the five <lb/>
            selected lines the corresponding syllable is short. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig13.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>This first batch of lines, <foreign xml:lang="grc">στάσις μελῶν</foreign>, therefore bear out, so far as <lb/>
            they go, the allegation of Euripides. However they commence, they all <note type="footnote"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δίας τεμάχη εἶναι ἔλεγε τῶν 'Ομήρου μεγάλων δείπνωι</foreign>'.—Athenaeus, vii. chap. xxxix. <lb/>
            And compare Frogs 1040. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxvii"/>
            conclude with the exact twelve syllables of the standard. But he will <lb/>
            not rest content with this; he will give another batch, <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτἑραν στάσιν <lb/>
            μελῶν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The plan of repeating the standard after every selected line might <lb/>
            easily grow <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι' ὄχλου</foreign> rots <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωμένοις</foreign>. Euripides therefore discards it; he <lb/>
            calls his second series of lines <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιθαρῳδικὰ</foreign>, not because, in the tragedies of <lb/>
            Aeschylus, they differed in this respect from the former series; but <lb/>
            because, whilst lie had recited the former to the music of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλὸς</foreign>, <lb/>
            he is about to recite these to the music of the lyre, which is represented <lb/>
            by the refrain <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ φλαττοθραττοφλαττόθρατ</foreign>. And as he does not now <lb/>
            introduce the standard <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰὴ κόπον</foreign> ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">πελάθεις ἐπ' ἀρωγὰν</foreign>, so lie no longer <lb/>
            keeps to the rule of having the first syllable short. It may now <lb/>
            represent an hexameter which has a spondee, as well as one which has <lb/>
            a dactyl, in the second place. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig14.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>This batch contains four lines (for line 1294 may be disregarded), <lb/>
            viz. two from the Agamemnon, one from the Sphinx, and one from an <lb/>
            unnamed tragedy. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig15.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>Here then are nine instances in which the metrical system <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig16.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              occurs in the choruses of Aeschylus. Euripides might easily have <lb/>
              increased the number. Three of the nine instances are taken from the <lb/>
              first chorus of the Agamemnon; and, at the risk of being tedious, I will <lb/>
              here set down a list of the instances which I have noticed in that immortal <lb/>
              song.</p>
          <p>Line <figure type="illustration">

          <p>Line <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig18.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>We find therefore in this one chorus, of course a very exceptional <lb/>
            case, and indeed within 120 lines of the chorus, the standard measure <lb/>
            occurring twenty-six times, if not oftener. And I have omitted every <lb/>
            instance (unless indeed the first example be an offender in this respect) <lb/>
            in which the close of the measure does not coincide with the close of <lb/>
            a word.</p>
          <p>Euripides having finished his criticism, Dionysus demands of Aeschylus <note type="footnote"> 1 The last word of this line, whatever it may be, is unquestionably a spondee. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Some have thought that Aristophanes has selected the lines of Aeschylus for <lb/>
            the express purpose of contrasting his heroical splendour with the petty domesti- <lb/>
            cities of Euripides. And doubtless he was fully alive to the fact that they brought <lb/>
            out that contrast in a very effective manner. But a glance at the list given above <lb/>
            will show that no selection was needed for this purpose. The Homeric spirit, <lb/>
            always strong in Aeschylus, was never stronger than when it drove him into <lb/>
            Homeric measures. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            whence he derived the incriminated metre, for of course, on the lips of <lb/>
            Dionysus, the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ φλαττόθρατ</foreign> signifies not the music of the <lb/>
            lyre, but the verses to which that music had formed the accompaniment. <lb/>
            And Aeschylus replies that he had transplanted it from one fair soil to <lb/>
            another, in TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλοῦ ἐς τὸ καλὸν</foreign>, meaning, from the Homeric epos to the <lb/>
            Athenian drama. There was doubtless nothing Homeric in the lays of <lb/>
            Phrynichus. In drawing his inspiration, therefore, from the wells of <lb/>
            Homer, Aeschylus was striking out a new and independent line, not <lb/>
            following in the steps of his predecessor; not <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρέπων</foreign>, to use his own <lb/>
            language, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν αὐτὸν Φρυνίχῳ Λειμῶνα Μουσῶν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>In truth the recurrence of these Homeric echoes imparts an unequalled <lb/>
            grandeur and dignity to the Choral Odes of Aeschylus; but if it were <lb/>
            otherwise, if it is to be treated as a defect, it is certainly shown to exist; <lb/>
            and possibly no other peculiarity of these odes is more prominent, or <lb/>
            more easily assailable by Aristophanic humour.</p>
          <p>It is therefore really wonderful that every commentator, without <lb/>
            a single exception, should have contrived to ignore the real point of the <lb/>
            criticism which Aristophanes takes such pains to elucidate, and have <lb/>
            supposed that Euripides was concocting an ode, or rather two odes, in <lb/>
            the manner of Aeschylus; each ode being a cento of lines taken at <lb/>
            random, without any special metrical purpose, from the latter's Choral <lb/>
            Odes. Of the first supposed cento (that is, the first batch of selected <lb/>
            lines) they can make nothing; it is admittedly nonsensical; ridiculus <lb/>
            ille cento, it is called by Brunck and Dindorf. But in the second <lb/>
            supposed cento they fancy themselves able dimly to descry a sort of <lb/>
            ponderous and unmeaning sentence, which they imagine to be a carica- <lb/>
            ture of the complex stanzas with which we occasionally meet in the <lb/>
            choruses of Aeschylus. Several have essayed to translate it. Quomodo <lb/>

            says Mr. Mitchell, " with a long sentence, in which the nominative case <lb/>
            is thrown to a most awkward distance, the accusative presenting itself <lb/>
            in the front of the sentence, and the interval offering all the peculiarities <lb/>
            of Aeschylean style-bold and dithyrambic diction, harsh appositions <lb/>
            and metonyms, and even appositions doubly apposited." Fritzsche <lb/>
            indeed does not agree with Aristophanes that Euripides is endeavouring <lb/>
            " to show that all Aeschylean metres are identical,” and “ to cut them <lb/>
            down to one," His opinion is quite different. “ Ostensurus est Euripides <lb/>
            Aeschylo obscuritatem rectissime objici solere." Without citing other <lb/>
            commentators it is sufficient to say that every one of them, from the <lb/>
            scholiast downwards, takes the same view of Euripides' objection.</p>
          <p>All this criticism is based upon an entire delusion. There is no “ long <lb/>
            sentence" here ; there is no " cento." The lines are brought forward as <lb/>
            individual specimens, each complete in itself, to be tried by the test of <lb/>
            the standard measure ; and have no more connexion with each other than <lb/>
            had the various prologues of Euripides brought forward in the preceding <lb/>
            encounter.</p>
          <p>Exactly the same hallucination has prevailed with regard to the <lb/>
            counter-criticism which Aeschylus proceeds to apply to the metres of <lb/>
            Euripides. Here too, several isolated passages, seven in number, are <lb/>
            selected for the purpose of showing, in each of them, some metrical <lb/>
            irregularity or variation. Here too, the commentators, with one accord, <lb/>
            persist in huddling all these seven isolated passages into a “ cento " (in <lb/>
            supposed imitation of an ode of Euripides) which they vainly endeavour <lb/>
            to construe. Here too, there is no " center and no construction. Each <lb/>
            of the seven selected passages is intended to be judged, by itself, on its <lb/>
            own merits.</p>
          <p>But this misconception is far more excusable than the former. <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxi"/>
            Aristophanes does not point out here, as he did there, the particular <lb/>
            irregularities intended to be assailed. Nor are we sufficiently familiar <lb/>
            with the metres themselves to determine with certainty in what these <lb/>
            irregularities consist, especially as the later writers on metre form their <lb/>
            canons on the practice of all the great poets, and consequently look upon <lb/>
            the variations introduced by Euripides as regular metrical forms. And <lb/>
            certainly I have no confidence whatever in my own ability to point out, <lb/>
            in each or any case, the defect, or supposed defect, at which Aeschylus is <lb/>
            aiming his criticism. Doubtless, on the stage, the impeached metre was <lb/>
            made perfectly plain by the voice and manner of the actor. However, <lb/>
            I will set down my ideas on the subject in the hope that they may be <lb/>
            corrected by competent scholars.</p>
          <p>It seems to me, then, that the criticism is directed against the variations <lb/>
            introduced into three metres, the Choriambic, the Glyconic, and the <lb/>
            Paeonic ; variations, it should be remembered, which would be considered <lb/>
            defects by those only who would restrict the tragic choruses to austere <lb/>
            and simple metrical forms. Variations of this kind are freely admitted <lb/>
            in the lyric metres of comedy.</p>
          <p>The seven passages which Aristophanes selects are as follows. The <lb/>
            letters C, G, and P placed against some of the lines are intended to assist <lb/>
            the reader in ascertaining the character and locality of the supposed defect. <figure type="illustration">

               </p>
          <p>Let us consider the variations which Euripides has in these passages <lb/>
            introduced into</p>

          <p>The pure cboriambic dimeter of course consists of two choriambs, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig20.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              As a specimen of this metre, Gaisford, in his notes to Hephaestion, cites <lb/>
              the following passage from the Bacchae :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig21.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              But the metre is rarely found in this pure form I. As a rule, an iambic <lb/>
              dipody is substituted for one of the two choriambs; thus <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig22.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              This is the ordinary and regular metre. Let us see how Euripides varies <lb/>
              it. Four instances are given, in each of which the choriamb concludes <lb/>
              the line, as in form (a) supra.</p>

          <p>The metre is very common in both Greek and 1 Roman poetry; and in <lb/>
            the passages we are now considering there are three unimpeachable <lb/>
            glyconic lines, viz. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig25.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              But there are two other lines in which the incriminated irregularities <lb/>
              may be discovered.</p>
          <p>In passage (4), line 1, the base is changed into a tribach, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἳ</foreign>v' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸφἵλ</foreign>-.</p>
          <p>In passage (7) it becomes an anapaest <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίβαλλ̕</foreign> </p>

            <title type="sub">(C) The Paeonic Metre.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This metre, I may observe in passing, is the favourite metre of Aris- <lb/>
            tophanes in his earlier comedies.</p>
          <p>A paeonic line, as a rule, ends with a cretic foot, — –v v v | — ^—|</p>
          <p>In passage (1), line 1, Euripides makes it end with an iambic dipodý, <lb/>
            -<foreign xml:lang="grc">νάοιςθαλάσ</foreign>- |.</p>
          <p>For take away, he says, the base and the iamb, which he considers mere <lb/>
            excrescences, and then <lb/>
            Solum Pierides manet, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Here there are two paeons. Passage (2), line 3, is exactly the same, <lb/>
            except that it has only one paeon.</p>
          <p>We thus see that in every one of the seven selected passages there is <lb/>
            at least one deviation from the regular metre.</p>
          <p>This then is the sum of the metrical contest. The charge which <lb/>
            Euripides brings against Aeschylus is that he habitually introduced into <lb/>
            his odes the greater part of an Homeric hexameter. The charge which <lb/>
            Aeschylus brings against Euripides is that he habitually introduced <lb/>
            variations into the solemn and carefully regulated metres of ancient <lb/>
            tragedy. In each case the charge is fully proven; but in each case, <lb/>
            whether the peculiarity charged was really a defect or a merit, is a ques- <lb/>
            tion on which opinions might naturally be expected to differ.</p>
          <p>But though the metrical contest is now concluded, Aeschylus will not <lb/>
            part with the general question of tragic odes, without giving a caricature <lb/>
            of the Monody, or Lyrical Monologue, which was a special feature of the <lb/>
            plays of Euripides. Here we find all the splendour of mythical imagery <lb/>
            thrown around, not some great and heroic event, but a simple and <lb/>
            homely incident of everyday life. A poor spinning-girl has lost her <lb/>
            domestic cock, and wishes to search the cottage of her neighbour Glyce, <lb/>
            whom she suspects of stealing it. That is all. But it is sung in strains <lb/>
            which might befit a falling dynasty or some tremendous catastrophe of <lb/>
            nations. The girl has seen an awful vision of the night, a terrible <lb/>
            portent, which " shakes her breast with vague alarms."" She describes <lb/>
            it in really blood-curdling terms. What can it mean, this vision from <lb/>
            the unseen world ? What soul-thrilling calamity can it portend ? It is <lb/>
            like the vision of Clytaemnestra in the Choephoroe, or the vision of <lb/>
            Atossa in the Persae. And, like a tragedy queen, the girl bids her <lb/>
            maidens draw from the running water, to wash away the evil omens <lb/>
            of her dream. Suddenly the true interpretation of the dream flashes <lb/>
            upon her. GLYCE HAS STOLEN HER COCK. This, nothing less than <lb/>
            this, is the catastrophe which the terrible dream portends. Alas for the <lb/>
            overwhelming calamity which has fallen upon her unawares ! But soon <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxv"/>
            her sorrow changes into wrath. She will go forth and search the <lb/>
            cottage of Glyce. And she calls upon Artemis the huntress to come <lb/>
            with her supernatural hounds to trace the missing cockerel, and upon <lb/>
            Hecate of the moon to pour her brightest rays into the darksome recesses <lb/>
            of her neighbours house.</p>
          <p>And in good truth, however broad the caricature, the Monody does <lb/>
            really touch the one striking and inevitable blot of the Euripidean <lb/>
            drama. The poet's aim was to paint men and women as they really <lb/>
            were, as he saw them around him in everyday life; whilst the inflexible <lb/>
            rules of the Attic stage compelled him to select his characters from <lb/>
            amongst the 1 mighty personages of legendary and heroic times. This <lb/>
            was no hardship to Aeschylus, whose mind was cast in the Homeric <lb/>
            mould, and whose Agamemnon, for instance, was not an Athenian of <lb/>
            the Peloponnesian War, but the very king of men, whom Homer sang. <lb/>
            But the more completely Euripides succeeded in portraying the smart- <lb/>
            ness and loquacity of contemporary life, the less were his characters fit <lb/>
            to wear the armour, and speak the language, of demigods and heroes.</p>
          <p>So strangely arc the commentators fascinated -with the idea of a <lb/>
            "cento," that there are some who even in this Monody would fain <lb/>
            descry a "cento" of Euripidean passages. No suggestion can be further <lb/>
            from the truth. It is as original as anything in Aristophanes : though <lb/>
            in composing a parody of a Euripidean monologue he would of course <note type="footnote"> 1 " The drama of Euripides, if we look at the essential parts of it and neglect <lb/>
            the accidental, is concerned wholly with the life which he actually saw about him : <lb/>
            and it ought, in the nature of things, to have dealt nominally, as well as actually, <lb/>
            with common personages and ordinary incidents. Half the criticisms of Aris- <lb/>
            tophanes and of many since would cease to apply, if the plays were furnished with <lb/>
            a new set of dramatis personae, fictitious names without any traditional associa- <lb/>
            tions. And it is amazing with what facility this could be done, how slight is the <lb/>
            connexion between a play of Euripides and the old-world legend which serves for <lb/>
            the scaffolding.... There is not a single play of Sophocles which could be <lb/>
            subjected to such a process without utter dissolution: and, as to Aeschylus, the- <lb/>
            very thought seems a profanity. The legends of mythology are the very warp and <lb/>
            substance of their compositions : they are, for the most part, the mere frame of <lb/>
            that of Euripides, and a frame too often imperfectly suited to the texture."— <lb/>

            <title type="sub">IV. THE WEIGHT OF THEIR VERSES,</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Which of the competitors wrote the weightiest verses? This is the <lb/>
            last subject for discussion : and to determine it by weighing their verses <lb/>
            in a pair of scales is of course to present in a merely laughable form <lb/>
            a topic rather minute in itself, but perhaps not altogether unworthy of <lb/>
            more serious consideration.</p>
          <p>With this the literary competition concludes: and all at once, by <lb/>
            a transformation scene as sudden and complete as that which brought <lb/>
            the literary competition on the stage, we find ourselves retransferred to <lb/>
            the earlier aspect of the play. The question now becomes, not which <lb/>
            of the two is the better tragedian and shall occupy the Chair of Tragedy <lb/>
            in the world below, but which -of them can give the wiser political <lb/>
            counsel to the state, and shall reascend with Dionysus to the world <lb/>
            above. We have already, in the earlier part of this Introduction, touched <lb/>
            upon the counsel which Aristophanes, through the lips of Aeschylus and <lb/>
            the favourable verdict of Dionysus, now tenders to the assembled <lb/>
            Athenians, viz. that Alcibiades shall be recalled, and the whole wealth <lb/>
            of the state expended upon the fleet. And although we know, on the <lb/>
            great authority of Dicaearchus, that it was to the advice given in the <lb/>
            Parabasis that the play owed its exceptional favour, yet it is impossible <lb/>
            to doubt that such advice was regarded not as a mere isolated event, but <lb/>
            as the crown and culmination of that noble and exalted1 patriotism <note type="footnote"> 1 "The genius of Aristophanes," says Bp. Thirlwall, " wonderful as it is, is less , <lb/>
            admirable than the use which he made of it. He never ceased to exert his <lb/>
            matchless powers in endeavours ,to counteract, to remedy, or to abate, the evils <lb/>
            which he observed. He seems to have neglected no opportunity of giving whole- <lb/>
            some advice in that which he judged the most efficacious form; and only took </note> <lb/>

             <lb/>
            which breathed through the entire comedy, and indeed had sustained <lb/>
            the poet throughout the whole of his career. This was probably the <lb/>
            last counsel which he ever had an opportunity of offering to Imperial <lb/>
            Athens.</p>
          <p>The plays which contended with the Frogs for the prize were the <lb/>
            " Muses " of Phrynichus, which was placed second, and the " Cleophon " <lb/>
            of Plato, which was placed last.</p>
          <p>The poets of the Old Comedy mostly dealt with subjects which were, <lb/>
            at the moment, attracting the attention of the public : and it is therefore <lb/>
            natural that occasionally the same topics should be introduced, and the <lb/>
            same persons assailed, in more than one of the comedies exhibited at <lb/>
            the same Dionysia. We know that when the Peace was exhibited the <lb/>
            tragedian Melanthius was held up to ridicule in each of the three com- <lb/>
            peting comedies. The Birds, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μονόροπος</foreign> of Phrynichus, were <lb/>
            produced at the same festival, and in each of them allusions were made <lb/>
            to Execestides, Syracosius, and the military contrivances of Nicias. And <lb/>
            it seems that each comedy which competed with the Frogs concurred <lb/>
            in some part of its criticism. It is probable that the "Muses" of <lb/>
            Pbrynichus was concerned with the poet Euripides; it is certain that <lb/>
            the " Cleophon " of Plato was a satire on that pernicious demagogue who <lb/>
            is more than once attacked in the comedy before us.</p>
          <p>I have already 1 intimated my dissent from Meineke's theory that the <lb/>
            " Muses " contained a poetical contest between Euripides and Sophocles, <lb/>
            similar to that contained in the Frogs between Euripides and Aeschylus; <lb/>
            and my belief that if the play dealt with Euripides at. all, it treated him <lb/>
            as a culprit on his trial, for his offences against the art of tragedy. <lb/>
            Apart from the shortness of the time which had elapsed since the death <note type="footnote"> advantage of his theatrical privilege to attack prevailing abuses, and to rouse <lb/>

            of Sophocles, and the intrinsic improbability that the two poets should <lb/>
            have framed their plays on such precisely similar lines, it seems to me <lb/>
            that the very fragment which Meineke adduces in support of his theory <lb/>
            is really decisive against it. <figure type="illustration">

              Lo, here the vote, and there the verdict-urns, <lb/>
              This the condemning, that the absolving one. <lb/>
              Is it not clear that this is the case of a prisoner on his trial, and not of <lb/>
              two rival poets contending for victory ? The Muses were probably the <lb/>
              Chorus of the play, and were accusing Euripides before Dionysus, or some <lb/>
              other judge, of having lowered the standard of tragedy. In the “ Muses," <lb/>
              as in the Frogs, there is an allusion to the very recent death of <lb/>
              Sophocles ;- <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig28.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The speaker would seem to be contrasting the peaceful passing away <lb/>
              of Sophocles from old age with the cruel death of Euripides who, we <lb/>
              are told, was torn to pieces in Macedonia by a pack of savage dogs.</p>
          <p>Cleophon doubtless owes to his outrageous folly, a few months before, <lb/>
            the distinction of being immortalized at this festival by both Aris- <lb/>
            tophanes and Plato. After the battle of Arginusae, Athens had her last <lb/>
            chance of emerging in safety from the Peloponnesian War. The Lace- <lb/>
            daemonians offered to evacuate Deceleia and conclude a general peace, <lb/>
            on the terms that each side should retain what it then held. The wiser <lb/>
            citizens were naturally anxious to embrace the offer, but the 1 populace, <note type="footnote"> 1 </note><figure type="illustration">

              inflamed by the frenzy of Cleophon, rejected it altogether. On that <lb/>
              occasion, according to. Aristotle, he appeared in the assembly tipsy and <lb/>
              wearing a military breastplate. And Aeschines adds that he threatened <lb/>
              to chop off the head of any one who dared even to speak of peace. To <lb/>
              such a depth of degradation had the " leadership of the Demus," held <lb/>
              by Pericles at the commencement of the war, descended before its con- <lb/>
              clusion. It is in reference to this disastrous policy that Aristophanes <lb/>
              bids Cleophon, if he wants fighting, go back to his 1 native country and <lb/>
              fight there. By his native country" he means Thrace, from which <lb/>
              barbarian land he was said, on his mothers side, to derive his origin. <lb/>
              And Plato 2 also, in his comedy, described him as a Thracian, and intro- <lb/>
              duced his mother, speaking a barbarian dialect. It is said by the <lb/>
              Scholiast on Euripides that the poet intended the following lines of the <lb/>
              Orestes to be a description of Cleophon :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig30.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The Orestes was exhibited three years before the Frogs, but we know <lb/>
              that this ignoble demagogue had retained for many years 4 the control <lb/>

          <p>" In reading the Frogs of Aristophanes, written fifty years after the death <lb/>
            of Aeschylus, we see his place in Athenian memory. That comedy is an <lb/>
            inestimable document, of which the historical value is not impaired by the <lb/>
            free play of humour and of fancy ; it is nearer, both in time and in spirit, <lb/>
            to the age of Aeschylus, and is far more instructive, than any other <lb/>
            document that we possess. There we catch an echo of the sweet lyrics <lb/>
            of Phrynichus—of those ' native wood-notes wild ' which he had warbled <lb/>
            as if the birds had taught him—a music dying away in the distance <lb/>
            of that century's earliest years-the lyrics of which elderly men had heard <lb/>
            their fathers speak with delight. And there, too, rises before us a living <lb/>
            image of the majestic poet who had come after Phrynichus, the poet who. <lb/>
            first of the Hellenes, had built up a stately diction for Tragedy, and also <lb/>
            invested it with external grandeur; the poet who had described the battle <lb/>
             <pb n="xli"/>
            of Salamis as he had seen it; whose lofty verse had been inspired by the <lb/>
            wish to nourish the minds of his fellow-citizens with ennobling ideals, <lb/>
            to make them good men and true, worthy of their fathers and their city; <lb/>
            the poet to whom many an Athenian, sick at heart with the decay of <lb/>
            patriotism and with the presage of worse to come, looked back, amidst <lb/>
            regret for the recent loss of Sophocles and Euripides, as to one who had <lb/>
            been not only the creator of the Attic drama, but also in his own person <lb/>
            an embodiment of that manly and victorious Athens which was for ever <lb/>
            passing away." Pp. 184, 185.</p>
          <p>" The wit of Aristophanes often packs a great deal of sound criticism into <lb/>
            a few words. His Euripides says that, when he received Tragedy from <lb/>
            Aeschylus, it was* plethoric, swollen, and heavy. He treated it for this <lb/>
            malady, giving it decoctions which reduced it to a leaner but more healthy <lb/>
            state. Then he proceeded to feed it up again, with such a stimulating <lb/>
            diet as monodies. There is a biting truth in this mockery.. Euripides <lb/>
            had to apply the principle of compensation. The heroic had to be replaced <lb/>
            by the sensational.</p>
          <p>In attempting to estimate the work of Euripides, we must indeed guard <lb/>
            against allowing too much weight to the verdict of Attic Comedy; but <lb/>
            neither can we ignore it. It is necessary to apprehend the point of view <lb/>
            from which this contemporary satire assailed him, and the grounds on <lb/>
            which it based its unfavourable judgement. If we then proceed to modify <lb/>
            that judgement in the light of a larger survey, we shall do so with less fear <lb/>
            of erring through modern misconception.</p>
          <p>Thp hostility of Aristophanes to Euripides was certainly bitter; nor can <lb/>
            it surprise us, if he believed Euripides to have done all the mischief with <lb/>
            which he charges him. But Aristophanes was not the only comic poet <lb/>
            who attacked Euripides. There was a deeper reason for this than any <lb/>
            individual or personal sentiment. Attic Comedy had a natural quarrel <lb/>
            with the innovator in Tragedy, and the ground of this lay in its own <lb/>
            history.</p>
          <p>Sicily is one of two regions in which the origin of Comedy is to be <lb/>
            sought; the other is Athens. The Dorians, both in Sicily and in Greece <lb/>
            Proper, early showed a bent towards farcical humour; an the case of the <lb/>
            Siceliots, there may have been some Italic influences at work, since it has <lb/>
            always been an Italic gift to seize those traits of life and character which <lb/>
            suit farce and burlesque. At the courts of the Sicilian princes such <lb/>
             <pb n="xlii"/>
            entertainments were welcome. The Dorian Epicharmus, from the Sicilian <lb/>
            Megara, was the first who developed the ruder farce into a species of <lb/>
            dramatic poetry. This was done at Syracuse, where the tragic poets <lb/>
            Phrynichus and Aeschylus had been the guests of Hieron ; and Attic <lb/>
            Tragedy may have suggested the general idea of the form which Epi- <lb/>
            charmus adopted, though he does not seem to have used a Chorus. <lb/>
            Athens, during the same period-the first half of the fifth century B.C.— <lb/>
            developed a comic drama from a different source. At the Dionysia, when <lb/>
            the people were assembled to worship the god and to see tragedy, the <lb/>
            merry procession called a comus had become a recognized feature of the <lb/>
            festival. It was at first a voluntary and unofficial affair. One or more <lb/>
            troops of men dressed themselves up in mummers' costume, and marched <lb/>
            into the sacred precinct to the music of the flute. They then sang a song <lb/>
            in honour of Dionysus ; and one of their number addressed the audience <lb/>
            in a humorous speech, turning on civic interests and on the topics of the <lb/>
            day. The festal procession then withdrew again. The name Comedy, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωμωδία</foreign>, originally denoted this Song of the Comus,' and was doubtless <lb/>
            coined at Athens, on the analogy of tragoedia. About B. c. 465 the comus <lb/>
            was adopted into the official programme of the festival: instead of being <lb/>
            the voluntary work of private persons, it was now organized with aid from <lb/>
            the State. The steps by which a dramatic performance was built up <lb/>
            around the comus-song and speech can no longer be traced. But some <lb/>
            five-and-thirty years later, at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, <lb/>
            Attic Comedy, as we know it, was mature. Tragedy naturally furnished <lb/>
            the general model on which the new kind of drama was constructed. <lb/>
            This is apparent in the limit placed on the number of actors; no extant <lb/>
            play of Aristophanes requires more than three regular actors, allowance <lb/>
            being made for small parts being taken by supernumeraries who were not <lb/>
            required to be absolutely mute. But Comedy was connected with Tragedy <lb/>
            by much more than this kinship of form. Comedy expressed the frolic- <lb/>
            some side of that Dionysiac worship from which Tragedy took its birth. <lb/>
            Religion, the religion of Dionysus, was the breath of life to Comedy, <lb/>
            not less-perhaps even more-than to her grave sister. It was religion <lb/>
            that authorized the riot of fancy which turns the world topsy-turvy, the <lb/>
            jest upon all things Olympian or human, the unsparing personal satire. <lb/>
            Let that popular religion once lose its hold, and then, though Tragedy <lb/>
            might survive, Comedy, such as Aristophanes wrote, must lose its sacred <lb/>
             <pb n="xliii"/>
            privileges, and, with them, its reason for existing. By the first law of its <lb/>
            being, the Old Comedy was the sworn foe of all things which could <lb/>
            undermine the sway of Dionysus, the god who not only inspires the poet, <lb/>
            but protects his liberties. And the nearer Tragedy stood to the original <lb/>
            form which the Dionysiac cult had given to it, the closer was the kinship <lb/>
            which Comedy felt with it. For this reason Aeschylus represents, even <lb/>
            better than Sophocles, the form of Tragedy with which the muse of <lb/>
            Aristophanes was in spiritual accord ; and Euripides represents everything <lb/>
            which that muse abhors. Euripides, who dwarfs the heroic stature, and <lb/>
            profanes heroic lips with the rhetoric of the ecclesia or the law-court; <lb/>
            Euripides, with his rationalism, his sophistry, his proclivity to new-fangled <lb/>
            notions of every kind-here Comedy, with sure instinct, saw a dramatist <lb/>
            who was using the Dionysia against the very faith to which that festival <lb/>
            was devoted, and whose poetry was the subtle solvent by which Comedy <lb/>
            and Tragedy alike were destined to perish.</p>
          <p>It was a happy fortune that, before its short life came to an end, the <lb/>
            essence of Attic Comedy was so perfectly expressed by the great satirist <lb/>
            who was also a great poet. The genius of Aristophanes indeed transcends <lb/>
            the form in which he worked ; but it exhibits all the varied capabilities <lb/>
            of that form. He can denounce a corrupt demagogue or an unworthy <lb/>
            policy with a stinging scorn and a force of righteous indignation which <lb/>
            make the poet almost forgotten in the patriot. He can use mockery with <lb/>
            the lightest touch. But it is not in denunciation or in banter that his <lb/>
            most exquisite faculty is revealed. It is rather in those lyric passages <lb/>
            where he soars above everything that can move laughter or tears, and <lb/>
            pours forth a strain of such free, sweet music and such ethereal fancy <lb/>
            as it would be hard to match save in Shakespeare. A poet who united <lb/>
            such gifts brought keen insight and fine taste to the task of the critic.</p>
          <p>In reading the Frogs, we do not forget that it is a comedy, not a critical <lb/>
            essay. And we allow for the bias against Euripides. But no careful <lb/>
            student of the play can fail to admire how Aristophanes seizes the essential <lb/>
            points in the controversy between the two schools of Tragedy. When <lb/>
            Aeschylus has said that a poet ought to edify, Euripides rejoins (in effect), <lb/>
            ' Are you edifying when you indulge in dark grandiloquence, instead of <lb/>
            explaining yourself in the language of ordinary humanity ?' Now <lb/>
            observe the rejoinder of Aeschylus. He replies, ' Great sentiments and <lb/>
            great thoughts are suitably clothed in stately words. Besides, it is natural <lb/>
             <pb n="xliv"/>
            that the demigods (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς ἡμιθέους</foreign>) should have grandeur of words ; for their <lb/>
            clothes are much grander than ours. I exhibited all this properly-and <lb/>
            you have utterly spoiled it.' Here Aristophanes has put the true issue <lb/>
            in a simple form. Aeschylus is right in vindicating his own style, and <lb/>
            condemning his rival's, by an appeal to the nature of his subject-matter. <lb/>
            Heroes and demigods ought not to speak like ordinary men. He is right, <lb/>
            too, when he enforces his point by referring to the stately costume which <lb/>
            he had devised for Tragedy. This was a visible symbol of the limit <lb/>
            set to realism.</p>
          <p>When Aristophanes passes from the ground of art to that of ethics, <lb/>
            the justice of his criticism may be less evident to moderns, but here <lb/>
            also he is substantially right from the Athenian point of view. His <lb/>
            Aeschylus complains that Euripides had sapped the springs of civic <lb/>
            manliness, of patriotism, and even of morality. It is true that Euripides, <lb/>
            . as a dramatic poet, had contributed to tendencies setting in that direction. <lb/>
            Homer had been regarded by the Greeks as their greatest teacher, because <lb/>
            the heroes were the noblest ideals of human life which they possessed. <lb/>
            Aeschylus and Sophocles, in their different ways, had preserved the <lb/>
            Homeric spirit. If the heroes once ceased to be ideals of human life, <lb/>
            the ordinary Greek of the fifth century had no others. To depose the <lb/>
            heroes from their elevation above commonplace humanity was also to <lb/>
            destroy an indispensable link between god and man in the popular <lb/>
            religion. But that religion was at the root of the Greek citizen's loyalty <lb/>
            to the city.</p>
          <p>In the smaller details of his polemic against Euripides, the comic poet <lb/>
            is sometimes acute and just, sometimes excessively unfair. We are not <lb/>
            here concerned with such details. The broad facts which claim our <lb/>
            attention are simply these. Attic Comedy, as such, was the natural <lb/>
            foe of a tragic poet like Euripides. Aristophanes clearly understood <lb/>
            the artistic limits proper to Attic Tragedy. He clearly saw where and <lb/>
            how Euripides had transgressed them ; he also saw that this error of <lb/>
            Euripides in art was, for the Athens of his day, inseparable from a bad <lb/>
            moral influence. And Aristophanes can sum up his judgement by <lb/>
            saying that Euripides, in pursuing new refinements, had abandoned the <lb/>
            greatest things (ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγιστα</foreign>) of the Tragic Art-as Athens had known it." <lb/>

            curtain represents no special locality. <lb/>
            It might with propriety be entitled On <lb/>

            ground is the residence of Heracles. <lb/>
            Two travellers are seen entering on the <lb/>
            stage, one riding on a donkey, the other <lb/>
            walking by his side. The pedestrian is <lb/>
            Dionysus, the patron deity of theatrical <lb/>
            performances, who, in addition to the <lb/>
            yellow robe and buskins which formed <lb/>
            part of his ordinary attire, has assumed <lb/>
            for the nonce the formidable club and <lb/>
            lion's skin of Heracles. The rider is <lb/>
            his slave Xanthias, who is carrying on <lb/>
            a pole over his shoulder the <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρώματα</foreign>, <lb/>
            rugs, wrappers and the like, a traveller's <lb/>
            ordinary luggage. As they enter, Xan- <lb/>
            thias is inquiring whether he may em- <lb/>
            ploy the well-worn buffooneries whereby <lb/>
            theatrical slaves and other burden- <lb/>
            bearers were accustomed to excite the <lb/>
            laughter of the audience. Dionysus <lb/>
            prohibits four expressions only, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιέζοαι, <lb/>
            θλίβομα, ητιαω</foreign>,and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποπαδησοαι</foreign>. <lb/>
            Xanthias complains that this exhausts <lb/>

            which other comic poets (rivals of <lb/>
            Aristophanes) were wont to endow their <lb/>

            that because Aristophanes satirizes his <lb/>
            rivals for using these popular buffoon- <lb/>
            eries, he did not use them himself when <lb/>
            occasion arose. The Scholiast quotes <lb/>

            jokes with which theatrical slaves were <lb/>
            accustomed to divert an Athenian audi- <lb/>
            ence, Dionysus, like the true Euripidean <lb/>
            enthusiast which he presently avows <lb/>
            himself to be, endeavours to engage his <lb/>
            slave in no little sophistical controversy. <lb/>
            It is the donkey, he argues, which is <lb/>
            carrying both Xanthias and the luggage ; <lb/>
            and if it be the donkey which is carrying <lb/>
            the luggage, it cannot be Xanthias who <lb/>
            is carrying it. Xanthias, though unable <lb/>
            to refute the argument, is nevertheless <lb/>
            perfectly satisfied by the evidence of his <lb/>
            senses, or in other words by the aching <lb/>
            of his shoulder, that he himself is some- <lb/>
            how or other carrying the luggage ; and <lb/>
            when Dionysus repeats the question, <lb/>
            " How are you carrying it ?" <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίνα τρόπον</foreign> <lb/>
            [<foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρεις ο̃ς γ</foreign>';], he evades the ques- <lb/>

            pression which of course, like the Latin <lb/>
            graviter fero, merely expresses his mental <lb/>
            attitude towards the business (infra 803, <lb/>
            Wasps 158, and passim) and has nothing <lb/>
            whatever to do with the physical problem <lb/>
            with which Dionysus is perplexing him. <lb/>
            In endeavouring to emphasize this play <lb/>
            of words in the translation, I have been <lb/>
            unable to preserve that which follows in <lb/>
            the next line, where Dionysus from the <lb/>
            adverb <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαρέως</foreign> (in the sense of mental <lb/>
            heaviness) deduces the substantive <foreign xml:lang="grc">βαρος</foreign> <lb/>
            in the sense of physical heaviness. Com- <lb/>
            pare Xenophon's Memorabilia,ii.7,where <lb/>
            Socrates, seeing that Aristarchus is out <lb/>
            of spirits, says <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̃οικας, 'Αρίσταρχε, βαρέως <lb/>

            reminds him of his old antagonists the <lb/>
            Centaurs, is heard talking to himself <lb/>
            within. When at last he opens the <lb/>
            door, and sees no redoubtable athlete, <lb/>
            but only the comical little figure of <lb/>
            Dionysus, he pauses for a moment in <lb/>
            dumb amazement (which the other <lb/>
            mistakes for alarm), and finally breaks <lb/>
            out into uncontrollable fits of Homeric <lb/>
            laughter.</p>

            μ'ἔδεισε</foreign> are employed by Dionysus in <lb/>
            their ordinary sense, How terribly afraid <lb/>
            of me he was! But in the sentence as <lb/>
            completed by Xanthias, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφόδρα σ' ἔδεισε <lb/>
            μὴ μαίνοιο</foreign> the accusative has, lost its <lb/>

            the New Testament phrase "I know thee <lb/>

            been the name of a ship, which is of <lb/>
            course impossible. All Athenian ships <lb/>
            bore feminine names ; Schömann collects <lb/>
            about 150, De nominibus navium Opus- <lb/>
            cula, i. 301; though indeed a comic poet <lb/>
            might suggest that Cleisthenes would <lb/>

            But in disposing of this notion, Schö- <lb/>

            sion in the two words conjoined : but <lb/>
            in truth that allusion, though renewed <lb/>
            in the following verse, is for the moment <lb/>
            destroyed by the unexpected addition of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλεισθένει</foreign>. Of Cleisthenes, whose vile <lb/>

            it, the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυμαχεῖν</foreign> being by itself <lb/>
            sufficient, here as supra 33, to indicate <lb/>
            the great <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυμαχία</foreign> which was at this <lb/>
            moment in all minds. The query of <lb/>
            Heracles diverts Dionysus from the tale <lb/>
            he was intending to tell, into a romance <lb/>
            about his own heroic achievements on <lb/>
            that eventful day ; though indeed, as <lb/>
            more than seventy " of the enemy's <lb/>
            ships" were destroyed at Arginusae, <lb/>
            Dionysus is rather to be commended <lb/>
            for his moderation in claiming only <lb/>
            twelve or thirteen as his own share.</p><pb n="10"/>

            a very pleasant and interesting incident, <lb/>
            especially if we are at liberty to infer <lb/>
            from it that Athenian soldiers, even on <lb/>
            ship-board, did not forget their literary <lb/>
            pursuits. It reminds us of those Athe- <lb/>
            nian soldiers in Sicily who, a few years <lb/>
            previously, had won the favour of their <lb/>
            captors by singing songs and reciting <lb/>
            passages from the tragedies of Euripides. <lb/>
            (Plutarch, Nicias, chap. 29.) The Andro- <lb/>
            meda was accounted in old times one of <lb/>
            the most pathetic and beautiful of all <lb/>
            his tragedies. Aristophanes draws largely <lb/>
            upon it in the Thesmophoriazusae, to <lb/>
            which the reader is referred. There <lb/>
            Mnesilochus, tied to the plank, takes <lb/>
            the part of the Princess exposed to the <lb/>
            fury of the sea-monster, whilst Euripides <lb/>
            first, as Echo, responds to his lamenta- <lb/>
            tions, and then, as Perseus, endeavours <lb/>
            to deliver him out of the hand of his <lb/>

            of pleasure or desire. See infra 649 and <lb/>
            the note there. Either way, it denotes <lb/>
            here that Heracles has touched the sore, <lb/>

          <p>83. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγάθων</foreign>] Agathon, the well-known <lb/>
            tragic poet, is one of the dramatis per- <lb/>
            sonae in the Thesmophoriazusae, where <lb/>
            his delicate beauty, his affectations and <lb/>
            effeminacy, his graceful language and <lb/>
            dainty conceits, and the social amiability <lb/>
            which endeared him to his friends, are <lb/>
            all sufficiently depicted. He was at this <lb/>
            time living at the court of Archelaus of <lb/>
            Macedon, where, following the example <lb/>
            of Euripides, he spent the evening of <lb/>
            his life, and where he died some years <lb/>
            after the production of the Frogs. This <lb/>
            permanent settlement of Agathon in <lb/>
            Macedonia was (for the Dionysus of the <lb/>
            Attic theatre) almost equivalent to his <lb/>
            death, and is described in language <lb/>
            which (except perhaps for the last word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐωχίαν</foreign>) would not be inappropriate to <lb/>
            the latter event. And therefore some <lb/>
            early grammarians, and indeed no less <lb/>
            a critic than Fritzsche in modern times, <lb/>
            have imagined that Agathon was really <lb/>
            now dead. But this is an obvious mis- <lb/>
            take. All the inquiries of Heracles after <lb/>
            tragic poets are directed to the pro- <lb/>
            position <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ ὄντες, κακοὶ</foreign>, supra 72. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί</foreign> 8'; <lb/>

            Be ; (87). And in truth Heracles, him- <lb/>
            self a denizen of the invisible world, <lb/>
            needs no information about the dead. <lb/>
            He knows of the deaths of Euripides (67) <lb/>
            and Sophocles (76), and would have <lb/>
            known of the death of Agathon, had <lb/>
            it occurred. The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποθεινὸς <lb/>
            φίλοις</foreign> is possibly borrowed from Eur. <lb/>
            Phoen. 320 (to which Bergler refers), <lb/>
            where it is applied to an absent, not to <lb/>
            a dead, man ; whilst the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς μακά- <lb/>
            ρων εύωχίαν</foreign>, in the sense of " to the <lb/>
            banquets of the wealthy," suits well <lb/>

          <p>84. <foreign xml:lang="grc">άγαθὸς ποιητής</foreign>] A good-hearted <lb/>
            poet. It would be as misleading to <lb/>
            give the literal translation "a good <lb/>
            poet" here, as it would be to translate <lb/>
            magno amico in Jnvenal iii. 57 " your <lb/>
            great friend" ; since, according to our <lb/>
            English idiom, the epithet "good" <lb/>
            would apply to the quality of the <lb/>
            poetry, and the epithet " great" to the <lb/>
            warmth of the friendship, which is not <lb/>
            the case in the original Greek and <lb/>
            Latin. As '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγάθων</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</foreign> com- <lb/>
            mence consecutive lines, there is prob- <lb/>
            ably, as Spanheim suggests, a sort of <lb/>
            play on the similarity of sound.</p>
          <p>86. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ξενοκλέης</foreign>] This little tragedian, <lb/>
            the smallest of the dwarfish sons of <lb/>
            Carcinus, has already been ridiculed in <lb/>
            the Wasps and the Thesmophoriazusae. <lb/>
            See Wasps 1509 and the notes on Wasps <lb/>
            1501, 1510; Thesm. 169, 441. Here <lb/>
            his name is saluted merely with an <lb/>
            execration. Pythangelus, who is men- <lb/>
            tioned in the following line and no- <lb/>
            where else, is not deemed worthy of <lb/>
            even that salutation, but is dismissed <lb/>
            with a scornful gesture.</p>

            his play did not ultimately win the <lb/>
            prize. See Peace 801 and the note <lb/>

            Who'll dare some novel venturesome conceit, <lb/>
            Air, Zeus's chamber, or Time'sfoot, or this, <lb/>
            ''was not my mind that more: my tongue committed <lb/>
            A little perjury on its owu account.</p>
          <p>, HER. You like that style ? Dio. Like it ? I dote. upon it.</p>
          <p>(Melanippe Sapiens, Fragm. 9, Waguer), which Aristophanes has already borrowed <lb/>
            in the Thesmophoriazusae (272), <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig60.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>(2) The foot of Time is ascribed by the <lb/>
            Scholiast to the Alexander (Fragm. 23, <lb/>
            Wagner), <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ Χρόνου προὔβαινεποὺς</foreign>, and <lb/>
            it subsequently reappeared in a Chorus <lb/>
            of the Bacchae (889). It may have <lb/>
            seemed a daring metaphor at first, but <lb/>
            now, Time being personified, it has <lb/>
            become a part of our everyday language. <lb/>
            Shakespeare speaks of " the lazy foot of <lb/>
            time," " the swift foot of time," ‟the <lb/>
            noiseless and inaudible foot of time,” <lb/>
            and again of "hasty-footed time." (3) <lb/>
            The third is an expansion of the famous <lb/>
            line of the Hippolytus, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig61.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              which is more precisely quoted, in part, <lb/>
              infra 1471, and is considered in the note <lb/>
              there. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀμόσαι καθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερω̑ν</foreign>, to be sworn <lb/>
              upon the sacrifices, is a very common <lb/>
              phrase : the first complete words in the <lb/>
              MS. of Aristotle's Polity of Athens are <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερω̑ν ὀμόσαντες</foreign>. The compound <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιορκέωι</foreign>s sometimes employed in an <lb/>
              innocent sense, without any idea of <lb/>
              perjury, and Brunck thinks it is so <lb/>
              employed here ; but, when so employed, <lb/>
              it means not simply "to swear" but <lb/>
              "to adjure,” and is followed by the <lb/>
              name of the god to whom the appeal <lb/>
              is made ; and, anyhow, Aristophanes, <lb/>
              treating the line as an apology for <lb/>
              perjury, would hardly have used the <lb/>
              word here in any other than its ordinary <lb/>

            quotation from Euripides. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> TOVTO, <lb/>

          <p>There is no such line in the Andro- <lb/>
            mache; and, if the Scholiast wrote <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀνδρομάχη̩</foreign>, he was probably misled by <lb/>
            thinking of lines 581, 2 of that play. <lb/>
            But it is generally supposed that he <lb/>
            wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀνδρομέδα̩</foreign>, and Wagner gives it <lb/>
            as the 31st fragment of the Andromeda, <lb/>
            making it the reply of Cepheus to the <lb/>
            complaint of Perseus (fragm. 30), who is <lb/>
            claiming Andromeda in marriage, but <lb/>
            can obtain no satisfactory reply from <lb/>
            her father. <figure type="illustration">

            to deliver my sentiments. But Dionysus, <lb/>
            playing on the double meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴκει</foreign> <lb/>
            (manage or inhabit), points to the house <lb/>

            diversoria, places of resort, to reach <lb/>

          <p>HER. Which shall I tell you first ? which shall it be ? <lb/>
            There's one by rope and bench : you launch away <lb/>
            And-bang yourself. Dio. No thank you : that's too stifling.</p>

            By pestle and mortar. Dio. Hemlock, do you mean ?</p>

          <p>HER. Well, would you like a steep and swift descent ?</p>
          <p>Dio. Aye, that's the style : my walking powers are small.</p>

            the poison <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν κύλικι,τετριμμένον</foreign>, and <lb/>
            Socrates drinks it. In obedience to the <lb/>

            he lies down on his back and covers his <lb/>
            face. The man pinches his foot, and <lb/>
            asks if he feels anything. He replies <lb/>
            in the negative. Then the man tries <lb/>
            his <foreign xml:lang="grc">κνήμας</foreign>, with the same result; <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ <lb/>

            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθέρπυσον</foreign>, Get you down to <lb/>
            the Cerameicus, Heracles appears to <lb/>
            forget for the moment that he ought <lb/>
            not to talk as if he were really on the <lb/>
            Athenian stage.</p>
          <p>130. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν πύργον τὸν ὑψηλόν</foreign>] This is <lb/>
            doubtless, as Fritzsche has already sug- <lb/>
            gested, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πύργος Τίμωνος</foreign>, which Pau- <lb/>
            sanias (Attica, xxx. 4) places in the im- <lb/>
            mediate neighbourhood of the Academy, <lb/>
            whence the runners in the torch-race <lb/>
            started. See the notes infra 1087, 1093. <lb/>
            It was believed to be the place in which <lb/>
            the misanthrope shut himself up to avoid <lb/>
            all intercourse with his fellow men. The <lb/>
            idea that a fall from a lofty tower is the <lb/>
            quickest way to arrive <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς Ἅιδου κάτω</foreign>, is <lb/>
            reproduced by Apuleius in the tale of <lb/>
            Cupid and Psyche, Metamorphoses, bk.vi- <lb/>
            Psyche, bidden by Venus to proceed ad <lb/>

            However the tower itself, in fairy style, <lb/>
            advises her to take two coins in her <lb/>
            mouth, and go there in the regular <lb/>
            manner through the rift of TaeDarum, <lb/>
            and by the ferry-boat of Charon. HIde <lb/>
            squalido seni, says the tower, dab'is, nauli <lb/>
            nomine, de stipibus quas feres alteram ; <lb/>
            the other coin (stips) being reserved for <lb/>
            the return journey. And Psyche, follow- <lb/>
            ing these instructions, arrives at her <lb/>
            journey's end much as Dionysus does in <lb/>
            the present play. The tale has often <lb/>
            been told in our language, but nowhere <lb/>
            more gracefully than in The Earthly <lb/>
            Paradise. <figure type="illustration">

            Scholiast (Gloss. Victor), supposing <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν- <lb/>
            τεῦθν</foreign> to belong to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀΦιεμένην</foreign>, and not, as <lb/>
            it really does, to <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεῶ</foreign>, infers that a torch <lb/>
            was dropped from the tower as a signal <lb/>
            to start the runners in the torch-race, <lb/>
            though indeed, on his construction, the <lb/>
            torch-race would not be mentioned at all. <lb/>
            This blunder has misled many, but the <lb/>
            Oxford lexicographers, and Mr. Green, <lb/>
            Dr. Merry, and Dr. Blaydes, all take the <lb/>
            right view.</p>

            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαλπιγκὴς</foreign>, whose duty it was to start <lb/>
            the runners by a trumpet blast. That <lb/>
            the trumpet was used in historic times <lb/>
            for this purpose is admitted even in the <lb/>
            Gloss. Victor, which merely suggests the <lb/>

            " Visits to Monasteries in the Levant," <lb/>
            gives the following recipe for “Dolma <lb/>

            in boiling water for a moment; put a <lb/>
            small quantity of mincemeat and rice <lb/>
            into each, and wrap it up in the leaf; <lb/>
            stew them in broth." The expression <lb/>
            in the text is, of course, due to the fact <lb/>
            that brains were a common ingredient <lb/>
            of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρ</foreign>ī<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον</foreign> ; but Dionysus is applying the <lb/>
            term <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρίω</foreign> to the two lobes of his own <lb/>
            brain, o <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκέφαλος ἔστι διλόος τὸ δὲ <lb/>

            recognizes a third lobe, and a third <lb/>

            to swim ; nay, even the ghosts of dead <lb/>

            the Dionysian theatre. I see no reason <lb/>
            for restricting the allusion, as Boeckh <lb/>
            seems to do in his admirable discussion <lb/>
            of Athenian doles (Public Economy, <lb/>
            bk. ii, chaps. 13 and 15), to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διωβελία</foreign> <lb/>
            or dole of two obols, which, under the <lb/>
            name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρικὸν</foreign>, the State supplied <lb/>
            for the entrance money of the poorer <lb/>
            citizens, and which we now know from <lb/>
            Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 28, <lb/>
            was first introduced by Cleophon, and <lb/>
            therefore not long before the production <lb/>
            of this play. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀβολὼ</foreign> "had equal <lb/>
            power, whether they came out of the <lb/>
            Public Treasury or out of the proper <lb/>
            purse of the spectator. The Scholiast <lb/>
            and others dream about the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστικὸν</foreign>, <lb/>
            which was three obols, or the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλη- <lb/>
            σιαστικὸν</foreign>, which was not yet in exist- <lb/>
            ence, though, even had these been <lb/>
            existing doles of two obols each, they <lb/>
            would in the present connexion have <lb/>
            been <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν πρὸς Διόνυσον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>142. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θησεὺς ἢγαγεν</foreign>] How comes this <lb/>
            Attic coinage to be current in the world <lb/>
            below ? As his friend Theseus was the <lb/>
            only Athenian who had ever been down <lb/>
            there alive, Heracles can only suppose <lb/>
            that he took some obols with him, and <lb/>
            introduced them there.</p>
          <p>145. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βόρβορον πολύν</foreign>] This notion, <lb/>
            apparently derived from Orphic sources, <lb/>
            was widely prevalent in the ancient <lb/>
            world. Spanheim refers to Plato's <lb/>
            Phaedo, chap. 13, where Socrates says <lb/>
            that oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάς τελετὰς ἡμ</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν καταστήσαντες</foreign> <lb/>
            (cf. infra 1032) have taught <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄτι ὂς</foreign> <unclear>ἂν</unclear> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμύητος καὶ ἀτέλεστος εἰς "Αιδου ἀΦίκηται, <lb/>
            ἐν βορβόρω̝ κείσεται</foreign>. This dooms all the <lb/>
            uninitiated, whether bad or good, to the <lb/>
            same punishment; but as Diogenes the <lb/>
            Cynic said (Diog. Laert. bk. vi, segm. 39, <lb/>
            to which Fritzsche refers), <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέλοιον εὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγησίλαος μέν καὶ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επαμεινώδας ἐν τω̨ <lb/>

            Aristophanes, it will be observed, avoids <lb/>
            this absurdity by confining this punish- <lb/>
            ment to criminals. And others did the <lb/>
            same: " Esse inferos Zenon Stoicus <lb/>
            docuit,'' says Lactantius, Divine Insti- <lb/>
            tutes, vii. 7, " et sedes piorum ab impiis <lb/>

          <p>149. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μητέῤ ἠλοίησεν</foreign>] That is to say, <lb/>
            was a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μητραλοίας</foreign>, a mother-beater, not, as <lb/>
            often translated, a matricide. So a son <lb/>
            who <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρὸς γνάθον ἐπάταξεν</foreign> is termed a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρλοίας</foreign>, infra 274. And see the case <lb/>
            of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πατραλοίας</foreign> in the Birds. So in <lb/>
            the first speech of Lysias against Theo- <lb/>
            mnestus, § 8, to be a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατραλοίαν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μη- <lb/>
            τραλοίαν</foreign> is described as the equivalent <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν τεκου̂σαν ἦ τὸν φύσαντα τύπτειν</foreign>. <lb/>
            Here the Scholiast explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠλοίησεν</foreign> by <lb/>

          <p>151. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μορσίμου</foreign>] The situation is per- <lb/>
            haps becoming too strained, and is <lb/>
            therefore relieved by a little comic <lb/>
            satire about this contemptible trage- <lb/>
            dian, who has already been ridiculed <lb/>
            in the Knights and the Peace. The <lb/>
            man who copies out, with intent to <lb/>
            perpetuate, a speech from one of his <lb/>
            tragedies, is to share, in the world <lb/>
            below, the doom of the vilest criminals. <lb/>
            Few, apparently, would have been <lb/>
            affected by this sentence, since not one <lb/>
            line from any tragedy of Morsimus has, <lb/>
            so far as I know, been preserved.</p>
          <p>153. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρρίχην Κινσίον</foreign>] It may be <lb/>
            that Dionysus does not altogether ap- <lb/>
            prove of this renewed incursion of <lb/>
            Heracles into the domain of literary <lb/>
            criticism ; at all events he immediately <lb/>
            caps his denunciation by another. The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρρίχη</foreign> was a dance in which youths, <lb/>
            clad in complete armour, and moving to <lb/>
            the strains of martial music, mimicked <lb/>
            the operations of regular warfare, ad- <lb/>
            vancing and retreating, stooping down <lb/>
            and springing up, and making as though <lb/>
            they were discharging or avoiding darts, <lb/>
            arrows, or other missiles. Plato, Laws, <lb/>
            vii. 815 a ; Hesychius s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρρίχας</foreign>. A <lb/>
            musical accompaniment to this dance <lb/>
            had been composed by Cinesias, the</p><pb n="27"/>
            
          <p>And ever-rippling dung: and plunged therein, <lb/>
            Whoso has wronged the stranger here on earth, <lb/>
            Or robbed his boylove of the promised pay, <lb/>
            Or swinged his mother, or profanely smitten <lb/>
            His father's cheek, or sworn an oath forsworn, <lb/>
            Or copied out a speech of Morsimus.</p>
          <p>Dio. There too, perdie, should he be plunged, whoe'er <lb/>
            Has danced the sword-dance of Cinesias.</p>
          <p>HER. And next the breath of flutes will float around you, <lb/>
            And glorious sunshine, such as ours, you'll see, <lb/>
            And myrtle groves, and happy bands who clap <lb/>
            Their hands in triumph, men and women too.</p>
          <p>Dio. And who are they ? HER. The happy mystic bands,</p>
          <p>worthless <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυκλιοδιδάσκαλος</foreign>, who is one <lb/>
            of the dramatis personae in the Birds. <lb/>

              present play, 366 and 1437.</p>
          <p>155. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φω̂ς κάλλιστος</foreign>] "The commen- <lb/>
            tatorsand translators," says Mr. Mitchell, <lb/>
            "usually quote in illustration Pindar, <lb/>

            The light in which the souls of the <lb/>
            righteous will live is comparable even <lb/>
            to the brilliancy of the Athenian atmo- <lb/>
            sphere ; for that is the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὢσπερ <lb/>
            ἐνθάδε</foreign>. The Athenians are described by <lb/>
            Euripides as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ ειὰ λομπρατάτον Βαίνοντες <lb/>
            ἁβμω̂ς αἰθέρος</foreign>, always delicately moving <lb/>

            chap. ix.</p>
          <p>157. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρω̂ν γυναικω̂ν</foreign>] These two words <lb/>
            are often placed in juxtaposition with- <lb/>
            out any copula. Kuster refers to Soph. <lb/>
            Antig. 1079, where Teiresias says to Creon <lb/>
            that there will speedily arise <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρω̂ν γυ- <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγων μυστήρια</foreign> we understand, with the <lb/>
            older commentators, carrying the mystic <lb/>

            Fritzsche and subsequent editors, cele- <lb/>

            in the sense, since the only way in which <lb/>
            the donkey " celebrated the mysteries ” <lb/>
            was by " carrying the mystic properties." <lb/>
            The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνος ἄγων μυστήρια</foreign> either then <lb/>

            thinks that there is a little latent irony <lb/>
            in the use of the two salutations here : <lb/>
            Heracles wishing Dionysus joy in face <lb/>
            of the perils he is about to encounter ; <lb/>
            and Dionysus wishing his gigantic <lb/>
            brother more health and strength of <lb/>
            mind as well as of body. Heracles now <lb/>
            re-enters his house, and Dionysus pre- <lb/>
            pares to continue his journey.</p>
          <p>168. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ του̂το</foreign>] For the purpose. For <lb/>
            what purpose is not quite clear, but <lb/>
            probably the Scholiast's explanation is <lb/>
            right, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπελθείν εἰς</foreign> TOP <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἃιδην</foreign>. With <lb/>

            word.</p>
          <p>170. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκφἐρουσι</foreign>] At this moment a corpse, <lb/>
            wrapped in its grave-clothes, and lying <lb/>
            on a bier, is being carried across the <lb/>
            stage. Dionysus approaches the bier <lb/>
            and holds a short colloquy with its <lb/>
            occupant. He wants the corpse to carry <lb/>
            down to Hades their few bits of <lb/>
            luggage, using the diminutive, <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκευάρια</foreign>, <lb/>
            with the view, as Mr. Mitchell observes, <lb/>
            of cheapening the service and driving <lb/>
            a better bargain. The corpse demands <lb/>
            two drachmas (12 obols) for the job: <lb/>
            Dionysus offers a drachma and a half; <lb/>
            but the corpse will have no chaffering, <lb/>
            and goes on its way unheeding. The <lb/>
            colloquy is not of much importance, <lb/>
            but those who witnessed the performance <lb/>
            of this play at Oxford (February, 1892) <lb/>
            will remember how extremely effective <lb/>

            ing <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπάγετε</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναχωρει̑τε</foreign>, and subse- <lb/>
            quently saying TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ ὑπάγετε ὑμει̑ς τη̑ς <lb/>
            ὁδου̑ ὁ νεκρός φηϭι πρὸς τοὺς νεκροφόρους</foreign>. <lb/>
            Opinions have differed widely on this <lb/>
            point, but on the whole it seems to me <lb/>
            more probable that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπάγειν</foreign>, with the <lb/>
            genitive <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̑ς ὁδου̑</foreign>, means to withdraw, <lb/>
            retire, from the way, like <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποχωρει̑ν</foreign> and <lb/>
            other compounds of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπό</foreign> ; and that the <lb/>
            command therefore is directed to the <lb/>
            travellers, and not to the bearers of <lb/>
            the bier.</p>
          <p>177. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναβιῴην</foreign>] As a living man would <lb/>
            clinch an asseveration by such words as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηκέτι ζῴην, μή νυν ζῴην</foreign> (Knights 833, <lb/>
            Clouds 1255, Lysistrata 531), "May I DIE <lb/>
            if I do ! " so, conversely, the dead man <lb/>
            emphasizes his strong determination by <lb/>
            the ejaculation, "May I LIVE AGAIN if <lb/>
            I do !" The corpse is now carried on <lb/>
            the stage, and as it is presumably bound <lb/>
            for Charon's ferry some have distributed <lb/>
            the triple greeting to Charon, seven <lb/>
            lines below, between three speakers, <lb/>
            giving the first <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαι̑ρ' Χάρων</foreign> to Dionysus, <lb/>
            the second to Xanthias, and the third <lb/>
            to the corpse. But this is not the way <lb/>
            of the ancient comedy. The corpse <lb/>
            comes in for a purpose, and when that <lb/>
            purpose is fulfilled, goes out again, and <lb/>
            nobody is concerned with it further. <lb/>
            And indeed the actor who represented <lb/>
            the corpse here, is representing Charon <lb/>
            there.</p>

            yet see the ferry-boat, but they know, <lb/>
            for Heracles has told them, that the <lb/>
            ferry is close at hand. And now Charon <lb/>
            is heard behind the scenes, singing out, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠὸπ, παραβαλου̑</foreign>, Yoho ! Push her to ! that <lb/>
            is to say, Lay her alongside the landing- <lb/>
            place, for the passengers to embark (or <lb/>
            disembark, 269 infra). And in another <lb/>
            moment the scene is changed ; a land- <lb/>
            scape, representing the Acherusian Lake, <lb/>
            being unrolled from the revolving pillar, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίακτος</foreign>, on one side of the stage till <lb/>
            it reaches the revolving pillar on the <lb/>
            other, so as to cover the entire back- <lb/>
            ground : whilst Charon with his ferry- <lb/>
            boat is visible in front. It is this <lb/>
            sudden change which makes Dionysus <lb/>
            exclaim <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτὶ τί ἔϭτι</foreign>; Charon is, of <lb/>
            course, alone. In calling out <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραβαλου̑</foreign> <lb/>
            he is merely employing the ordinary <lb/>
            language of a ferryman, such as the <lb/>
            Athenians were hearing in their har- <lb/>
            bours the whole day long.</p>

            as we learn from the Scholiast, is taken <lb/>
            bodily from the Aethon, a satyric play <lb/>
            of the tragedian Achaeus, who was, <lb/>
            indeed, famous for his satyric dramas <lb/>
            (Diog. Laert. bk. ii, segm. 133, Vita <lb/>
            Menedemi). He put these words into <lb/>
            the mouths of his riotous Satyrs as they <lb/>
            came tumbling into the ferry-boat, much <lb/>
            to Charon's indignation. The Satyrs <lb/>
            were, of course, playing with the simi- <lb/>
            larity of sound between <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαι̑ρε</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χάρων</foreign>.</p>

            the Scholiast remarks, is formed from <lb/>
            Cerberus in imitation of the "Cimme- <lb/>
            rians," who, according to Homer (Od. xi. <lb/>
            14), dwelt near one entrance to Hades. <lb/>
            Another entrance was at (5) Taenarum, <lb/>

            the sense in which it is used infra 607, <lb/>

            they. give other interpretations, this is <lb/>
            no doubt the true one. Aristophanes <lb/>
            is transferring the language of the law- <lb/>
            courts to the circumstances of the naval <lb/>
            engagement. A litigant, contending <lb/>
            for the rights of a freeborn citizen, was <lb/>
            said <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ του̑ ϭώματος ἀγωνίϭασθαι</foreign> (Lysias <lb/>
            against Pancleon 16) ; and Aristophanes, <lb/>

              imitation of the "stone of Silenus " and <lb/>
              the like. Another suggestion of the <lb/>
              Scholiast, viz. that <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὑαίνου</foreign> is to be con- <lb/>

              Havaenus and also as the imperative <lb/>

          <p>the entirety of this great play. We <lb/>
            shall hear the ghosts of the dead frogs <lb/>
            singing in the Acherusian Lake the <lb/>
            tunes which, when alive, they had sung <lb/>
            in the Marshland of Athens. And <lb/>
            although nothing can be more unlike <lb/>
            the croaking of our English frogs than <lb/>
            their refrain <foreign xml:lang="grc">βρεκεκεκὲξ, κοὰξ, κοὰξ</foreign>, yet <lb/>
            all observers agree that it is an exact <lb/>
            imitation of the voices of their brethren <lb/>
            in Greece and the countries of the <lb/>
            Levant. " The common frogs of Greece <lb/>
            have a note totally different from that <lb/>
            of the frogs of the northern climates, <lb/>
            and there cannot be a more perfect <lb/>
            imitation of it than the 'Brekekekex, <lb/>
            koax, koax' of Aristophanes."-Dod- <lb/>
            well, ii. 45. Speaking of his visit to <lb/>
            Thasos, Mr. Tozer observes, "In the <lb/>
            stagnant water the frogs were singing <lb/>
            ' Brekekekex, koax, koax ' as clearly as <lb/>
            in the days of Aristophanes, the two <lb/>
            notes being quite distinct from one <lb/>
            another. "-Islands of the Aegean, p. <lb/>
            309. Mr. Macgregor, in "The Rob Roy <lb/>
            on the Jordan," chap. ix, remarks that <lb/>
            " the croak of a frog has been one of <lb/>
            the best means of informing the modern <lb/>
            world of the manner in which the ancient <lb/>
            Greeks pronounced their beautiful lan- <lb/>
            guage.... The frogs of the nineteenth <lb/>
            century have probably been faithful to <lb/>
            the pronunciation of their race in former <lb/>
            times; and, as we listen in the still <lb/>
            night to their curious music, it is exactly <lb/>
            as if one set of them, perhaps the tenors, <lb/>
            the gentlemen of the choir, kept sing- <lb/>
            ing ' Brekekekex,' whilst the softer woo- <lb/>
            ing of the ladies is uttered always as <lb/>
            ' Koax, koax, koax.' The din made by <lb/>
            millions of these songsters, in a marsh <lb/>
            many miles extended, is astounding.... <lb/>
            Sometimes they all stop as if by com- <lb/>
            mand, and after a few moments of <lb/>
            silence the catch-note of some flippant <lb/>
            flirt just whispers once, and immediately <lb/>
            the whole Babel resumes its universal <lb/>
            roar." Their songs in Aristophanes have <lb/>
            something of the grace and airiness, the <lb/>
            detachment from human interest, which <lb/>
            are so conspicuous in the choruses of <lb/>
            the Birds. But we cannot wonder that <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note></p><pb n="36"/>

            their notes, is well-nigh done to death <lb/>

            Dr. Merry observes, " to localize Nysa, <lb/>
            for wherever the worship of Dionysus <lb/>
            was in vogue, a Mount Nysa was sure <lb/>
            to be found, whether in Greece, Asia <lb/>
            Minor, Aethiopia, or India." The name <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νύϭα</foreign> really arose from the latter half <lb/>
            of the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διόνυϭος</foreign>, and in the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νυϭήιον Διὸς Διόνυϭον</foreign> we have, in im- <lb/>
            mediate juxtaposition, the name of the <lb/>
            God and the fancied derivation of each <lb/>
            part of that name. Neither here, nor <lb/>
            in the reiterated invocations of Iacchus <lb/>
            with which the Mystics enter, nor in <lb/>
            the quotation from Euripides, infra <lb/>
            1211, does the stage Dionysus recog- <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λίμναι</foreign>, Marsh-land, was adjacent to the <lb/>
            Acropolis (Thuc. ii. 15), and close to. <lb/>
            the Theatre (Pausanias, Attics, xx. 2). <lb/>

            s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χόες</foreign>. This was the origin of the <lb/>
            drinking-competition, of which we hear <lb/>
            so much in the later scenes of the <lb/>
            Acharnians, and the procession -with <lb/>
            the wine-pitchers and the garlands is <lb/>
            the revel of which the Frogs are here <lb/>

            Day, whereas the Frogs talk of its <lb/>
            occurring on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χύτροι</foreign> or Pot-Day. <lb/>
            But in truth these Anthesterian Dio- <lb/>
            nysia seem to have been originally a <lb/>
            one-day festival only (Thuc. ubi supra), <lb/>
            called from its principal event, the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χόες</foreign> ; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πιθοιγία</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χόες</foreign>, and the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χύτροι</foreign>, being merely three functions <lb/>
            taking place on the same day, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲν μια̑ <lb/>

            three days; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πιθοιγία</foreign> or Broaching <lb/>

          <p>228. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ πολλὰ πράττων</foreign>] Dionysus, with <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυπραγμοσύνη</foreign> of an Athenian (and <lb/>
            in Aristophanes almost everybody has <lb/>
            the characteristics of an Athenian) must <lb/>
            needs be criticizing what he does not <lb/>
            understand. It is quite natural that <lb/>
            the Frogs should keep up a constant <lb/>
            chorus of music, for, on the strength of <lb/>
            the reeds amongst which they dwell, <lb/>
            they claim the special favour and friend- <lb/>
            ship of the gods who require the reed <lb/>
            for their musical instruments, the Muses <lb/>
            and Apollo and Pan. Pan's syrinx was <lb/>
            merely a row of reeds, fastened together <lb/>
            with thread and beeswax; <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύριγξ έστὶ <lb/>

            ful in the lyre, the favourite instrument <lb/>
            of Apollo and the Muses. For though <lb/>
            Aristophanes avails himself of the variety <lb/>
            of names to call the Muses <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὔλυροι</foreign> and <lb/>
            Apollo <foreign xml:lang="grc">όφορμικτὰς</foreign>, yet undoubtedly the <lb/>
            lyre and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φόρμιγξ</foreign>, and for the matter <lb/>
            of that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιθαρις</foreign> also, were originally <lb/>
            the same instrument (Gevaert, La Mu- <lb/>
            sique do l'Antiquité, ii. 249), and the <lb/>
            reed was used for what the French call <lb/>
            the chevalet, and we the bridge, the part <lb/>
            which keeps the strings from coming <lb/>
            into contact, with the body of the <lb/>
            instrument. See the note on <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπολύριον</foreign>, <lb/>
            infra 233. The invention of the lyre is <lb/>
            described in the Homeric Hymn to <lb/>
            Hermes 41-51. Hermes chanced to find <lb/>
            a tortoise-shell, and having scooped out <lb/>
            its occupant, he cut some reeds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόνα</foreign>- <lb/>

            drilled them through the shell. Then <lb/>
            he wrapped the shell in a piece of bull's <lb/>
            hide and inserted two side-pieces, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πήχεις</foreign>, <lb/>
            with a cross-piece, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζυγὸν</foreign>, at the top <lb/>
            from one side-piece to the other. Finally <lb/>
            he stretched seven strings of sheep-gut <lb/>
            from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζυγὸν</foreign> to the shell. In this <lb/>

          <p>FR. That is right, Mr. Busybody, right! <lb/>

            And hornfoot Pan who plays on the pipe his jocund lays ; <lb/>
            And Apollo, Harper bright, in our Chorus takes delight; <lb/>
            For the strong reed's sake which I grow within my lake <lb/>
            To be girdled in his lyre's deep shell. <lb/>

            applicable only to Apollo and the Muses, <lb/>
            refers, in truth, to all the divinities <lb/>
            mentioned. From the manifold use of <lb/>
            the reed in musical instruments, it is <lb/>
            called by Apuleius, in the tale of Cupid <lb/>
            and Psyche, Musicae suavis nutricula. <lb/>

            (3) haunting the mountain peaks. All <lb/>
            three characteristics are recognized at <lb/>

          <p>In these dramatic contests, which were <lb/>
            part of the religious festival of the <lb/>
            Dionysia, the priest of Dionysus was, <lb/>
            so to say, the Chairman who presided <lb/>
            over the proceedings. He sat in a con- <lb/>
            spicuous seat or throne in the centre of <lb/>
            the front row (the semicircle which <lb/>
            half surrounded the orchestra), with <lb/>
            thirty-three honoured guests on each <lb/>
            side. The very throne on which, in <lb/>
            later days, he sat has been unearthed <lb/>
            during the excavations recently made <lb/>
            in the Athenian Theatre, and still bears <lb/>
            the legible inscription, '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιερεὺς Διονύσου <lb/>
            'Ελευθερέως</foreign>. The Temple of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διόνυσος <lb/>

            the circumference of the Theatre (Pau- <lb/>
            sanias, Attica xx. 2), and derived its <lb/>
            name from the fact that the wooden <lb/>
            statue it contained had been brought <lb/>
            from the border town of Eleutherae <lb/>
            under Mount Cithaeron (Id. xxxviii. 8). <lb/>
            Its foundations are believed to have <lb/>
            been recently discovered, apparently at <lb/>
            the back of the stage. See Mr. Haigh's <lb/>
            Attic Theatre, iii. 4 and vii. 3. In the <lb/>
            latter chapter is given an admirable <lb/>
            illustration of. the priest's marble throne. <lb/>
            It is to this exalted personage that <lb/>
            Dionysus appeals from the stage, trust- <lb/>
            ing that he will not permit the God, <lb/>
            whom he serves, to perish in this <lb/>
            ignominious manner. The Chorus have <lb/>
            not yet entered the orchestra, so that <lb/>
            nothing intervenes between the actor <lb/>
            and the priest. If Dionysus survives, <lb/>
            he will come and join his priest in the <lb/>
            potations to which they are both ad-</p><pb n="46"/>

          <p>304. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαλη̃ν άρω̃</foreign>] In the still-extant <lb/>
            Orestes of Euripides, the hero recovering <lb/>
            from a paroxysm of frenzy, says <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκκυμά- <lb/>
            των γἀρ αὖθις αὖγαλήν</foreign>' opS (279), After <lb/>
            the storm I see afresh fine weather. Hege- <lb/>
            lochus, who acted the part, when reciting <lb/>
            the line made a slight involuntary pause <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίψαντοςτου̃ πνεύματος</foreign>, spiritu de- <lb/>
            ficiente), after <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαλήν</foreign>', so rounding it off <lb/>
            into a complete word, as if the poet had <lb/>
            written <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαλη̃ν άρω̃</foreign>, I see a cat. A similar <lb/>
            pause after the first syllable of a-fresh <lb/>
            in the English line would change it <lb/>
            into After the storm I see a fresh fine <lb/>
            wether. That the mishap of Hegelochus <lb/>
            became a favourite jest amongst the <lb/>
            Athenian wits, we learn from the <lb/>
            Scholiasts here and on the Orestes. Thus, <lb/>
            in an unnamed Comedy of Strattis, one <lb/>
            of the speakers seems to have declaimed <lb/>
            the line after the fashion of Hegelochus, <lb/>
            whereupon the other calls out excitedly <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποί πο</foreign>ȋ <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαλη̑ν ; ὦ πρὸς θεω̑ν, πο</foreign>ȋ not <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαλη̑ν</foreign>; <lb/>
            on which the first explains that the <lb/>
            word he used was <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαληνὰ</foreign>, and the second <lb/>
            replies <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαλήν'; έγὼ δ' ῷμην σε λέγειν, <lb/>
            γαλη̑ν ἁρω̑</foreign>, for so I think we should read <lb/>
            the passage. Thus again, Sannyrion, in <lb/>
            his Danae, representing Zeus as anxious <lb/>
            to get into the tower through a little <lb/>
            chink, makes him say, " Into what shall <lb/>
            I change myself, to creep through the <lb/>
            chink unobserved ? Shall I change <lb/>
            myself into a. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαλη̑</foreign> ? But then Hege- <lb/>
            lochus would betray me, calling out <lb/>
            with all his might <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκ κυμάτων</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὒθις <lb/>

            would have been the last person to admit <lb/>
            his own cowardice. The following line</p><pb n="47"/>

          <p>Dio. 0, what's up now? XAN. Take courage; alPs serene. <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">όδἱ</foreign> would naturally refer to the speaker's <lb/>
            companion on the stage rather than to <lb/>
            one of the spectators; see Wasps 78 and <lb/>
            the note there ; (2) that a blush is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρυθρὸν</foreign>, a totally different colour to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρρὸν</foreign> ; (3) that it is mere nonsense to <lb/>
            say that a man, out of fear, blushed for <lb/>
            another (see Lucian's Anacharsis 33) ; <lb/>
            and (4) that if we look to the manner <lb/>
            in which Aristophanes elsewhere con- <lb/>
            nects the colour <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρρὰν</foreign> with the effect <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέος</foreign>, we cannot doubt that the real <lb/>
            meaning is At ille (Dionysus) prae <lb/>
            timore in me cacavit. Of. Eccl. 1061 <lb/>

            some absurdly translate <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρρὸς</foreign>, blushing. <lb/>
            It is, in my opinion, to the state of his <lb/>
            garments, which Xanthias has only just <lb/>
            discovered, that the ejaculation <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἲμοε <lb/>
            τάλας</foreign>, at the commencement of the <lb/>
            speech, is intended to apply. I see <lb/>
            that Van Leeuwen, in his edition pub- <lb/>
            lished many years after this note was <lb/>
            written, takes the true view of the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπερεπυρρίασε</foreign>, and quotes Bakhuyzen as <lb/>
            doing the same : but as they both leave <lb/>
            307 to Dionysus, read <foreign xml:lang="grc">σου</foreign> at the end <lb/>
            of 308 and explain <foreign xml:lang="grc">άδὶ</foreign>, Bakhuyzen by <lb/>

            his mind being full of Euripidean <lb/>
            phraseology, and remembering that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αὶθὴρ</foreign> was one of the poet's new-fangled <lb/>

            the passage means, and not, as the <lb/>
            Scholiasts suggest, that Dionysus is <lb/>
            speaking of Euripides himself as being, <lb/>
            indirectly, the author of his troubles. <figure type="illustration">

            heard the Chorus, chanting the songs of <lb/>
            the Frogs, but we did not see them. <lb/>
            Nor indeed are they yet visible, but <lb/>
            they are approaching in their proper <lb/>
            character, as the Mystic Chorus of the <lb/>
            play. The wayfarers hear a shout, and <lb/>
            recognize <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν μυστικὸν ῎Ιακχον</foreign> ; just as <lb/>
            Demaratus of Sparta and Dicaeus the <lb/>
            Athenian heard and recognized it during <lb/>
            the Persian invasion, and knew that the <lb/>
            invisible powers of Eleusis were moving <lb/>
            forth to do battle at Salamis against the <lb/>
            enemies of Hellas, Hdt. viii. 65. Though <lb/>
            Iacchus, the associate of Demeter and <lb/>
            Persephone, was originally quite distinct <lb/>
            from the Theban Dionysus, yet their <lb/>
            attributes were in some respects so <lb/>
            similar, that the process of identifica- <lb/>
            tion had commenced long before the <lb/>
            exhibition of the Frogs. See the Choral</p><pb n="49"/>

            Sophocles, which preceded the present <lb/>
            play by more than thirty years. But <lb/>
            in this play there is no identification : <lb/>
            and probably it would have seemed <lb/>
            irreverent even to suggest that the <lb/>
            Dionysus, here put upon the stage, bore <lb/>
            any resemblance to the sacred and <lb/>
            mystical Iacchus.</p>
          <p>320. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διαγόρας</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μελῶν ποιητὴς ἄθεος</foreign>, says <lb/>
            the Scholiast, identifying the lyric poet, <lb/>
            of whose poems only four lines remain <lb/>
            (Bergk's Poetae Lyrici Graeci), with the <lb/>
            notorious Diagoras of Melos ; but this <lb/>
            identification is not universally accepted. <lb/>
            The lyric poet seems to have composed <lb/>
            a processional melody for the use of the <lb/>
            initiated. Apollodorus, the Scholiast <lb/>
            tells us, preferred to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">δι᾽ ἀγορᾶς</foreign>, <lb/>
            which was also the original reading of <lb/>
            the Venetian MS., though afterwards cor- <lb/>
            rected. This would make the line mean <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόν ῎Ιακχον, ὃν ᾄδουσιν ἐξ ἄστεως ὰιδ τῆς <lb/>
            ἀγαρᾶς ἐξιόντες εἰς ᾽Ελευσῖνα</foreign>.—Scholiast. <lb/>
            But even if the procession passed through <lb/>
            the agora, which seems more than doubt- <lb/>
            ful, and had a special hymn for that <lb/>
            section of their journey, which is not <lb/>
            very probable, it is clear that it is not <lb/>
            passing through the agora now. The <lb/>
            initiated are now gathering and singing <lb/>
            before the Temple of Demeter, calling <lb/>
            upon Iacchus to come forth and lead <lb/>
            them out, and until he appears the <lb/>
            procession will not start. See the next <lb/>
            note.</p>
          <p>323. <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ιακχ᾽, ὦ παλυτίμοις κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] The <lb/>

            carrying lighted torches, real or pre- <lb/>
            tended, in their hands. The strophe <lb/>
            which forms their Parodos or entrance <lb/>
            song is a little Ionic a minore system, <lb/>
            not <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαρὸν</foreign>, in the language of metrical <lb/>
            writers, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίμικτον</foreign>, admitting amongst <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ιακχ᾽, ὦ ῎Ιακχε</foreign>, may be regarded as an <lb/>
              ejaculation extra metrum. For the next <lb/>
              137 lines the Chorus are represented as <lb/>
              rehearsing in the world below the early <lb/>
              stages, as much, no doubt, as the general <lb/>
              populace of Athens would see, of that <lb/>
              great annual procession from the Cera- <lb/>
              meicus to Eleusis (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τοῦ Κεραμεικοῦ εἰς <lb/>

              which they themselves, when alive, had <lb/>
              been accustomed to participate. It took <lb/>

              —Plutarch, Phocion 28. The Chorus <lb/>

              the great building provided for the <lb/>
              marshalling of these and similar pro- <lb/>
              cessions, and they are now calling <lb/>
              Iacchus to come from the adjoining <lb/>
              Temple of the Eleusinian deities, and <lb/>
              be their divine companion on the long <lb/>
              twelve miles journey. That building <lb/>
              and that temple were just within the <lb/>
              Peiraeic gate, and in, or close to the <lb/>
              boundary of, the Inner Cerameicus. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰ</foreign>- <figure type="illustration">

            the open sward in front of the Athenian <lb/>

            were, throughout the journey, a promi- <lb/>
            nent feature of the religious proceed- <lb/>

            the fortification of Deceleia by the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians, the procession had <lb/>
            been compelled to travel by sea, ex- <lb/>
            cepting indeed on that one memorable <lb/>
            occasion when Alcibiades, restored to <lb/>
            Athens and appointed Dictator, <foreign xml:lang="grc">άπάντων <lb/>
            ἡγεμὼν αὐτοκράτωρ</foreign>, led out his army to <lb/>

            iv. 20, 21), so guarding the Mysteries <lb/>
            which himself was accused of profan- <lb/>
            ing, and neutralizing the garrison at <lb/>
            Deceleia which he had himself recom- <lb/>
            mended to Sparta. And whilst the <lb/>
            procession had to travel by sea, says <lb/>
            Plutarch, it was shorn of its accustomed <lb/>

            appear to his worshippers. The Anti- <lb/>
            strophe is the Song of Joy and Welcome <lb/>
            with which they greet his appearance. <lb/>
            The short pause which enabled the <lb/>
            actors to hold their little dialogue has, <lb/>

            out the statue of the god. And now all <lb/>
            is song, and dance, and ecstacy. The <lb/>
            torch in his hand is magnified into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φλογέας λαμπάδας</foreign>. The night is turned <lb/>
            into day by the brightness of their <lb/>
            Morning Star. Even age forgets its <lb/>
            infirmities and joins, almost involun- <lb/>
            tarily, in the dance ; and all are longing <lb/>
            for the procession to start. Arise, 0 <lb/>
            Iacchus.! waving in thine hands theflaming <lb/>
            torches, thou Morning Star of our nightly <lb/>
            mystic rites. The meadow is ablaze with <lb/>
            fire. (All the mystics are waving their <lb/>
            lighted torches.) Now the knee of old <lb/>
            men is leaping for joy; under the influ- <lb/>
            ence of the sacred rite they shake off the <lb/>
            chronic infirmities of age; they shake <lb/>
            off their long and weary years (cf. Eur, <lb/>
            Bacchae 184-190). But do thou, 0 blessed <lb/>
            one, shedding light with thy torch, lead <lb/>
            on with forward step the chorus-forming <lb/>

            Lo, the mead is blazing brightly, <lb/>

            lacchus is addressed as a living present <lb/>
            person, waving an actual torch, and not <lb/>
            as a mere sculptured statue. At the <lb/>
            commencement of the Antistrophe there <lb/>
            was apparently an ancient gloss ac- <lb/>
            counting for this outburst of tumultuous <lb/>
            joy, by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ῎Ιακχος</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκει</foreign>, the <lb/>
            last two words of which crept from the <lb/>
            margin into the text (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν χερσὶ γὰρ ἥκει <lb/>
            τινάσσων</foreign>), confounding both sense and <lb/>
            metre, and giving an infinity of trouble <lb/>
            before they were finally expelled.</p>
          <p>351. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθηρὸν ἕλειον δάπεδον</foreign>] Though <lb/>
            their first dance takes place before the <lb/>
            Athenian Temple from which they start, <lb/>
            they are ever looking forward to still <lb/>
            more joyous and festive dances in an <lb/>
            expanse which they call here the <lb/>
            “ flowery marshy plain''; in 373 infra the <lb/>
            “fair-flowering bosoms of the meadows ”; <lb/>
            and in 448 infra the “flower-like rose- <lb/>
            abounding meadows." These are the <lb/>
            Thriasian and Eleusinian plains, still <lb/>
            brilliant'with many-coloured blossoms, <lb/>
            and both commonly included under the <lb/>
            one name of the Thriasian plain. Mr. <lb/>
            Dodwell (Tour through Greece, i. chap. <lb/>
            ix) describes the surface of the Thriasian <lb/>
            plain as “ variegated with the many- <lb/>
            coloured anemone forming an expanded <lb/>
            tissue of the richest hues." He remarked <lb/>
            there "at least twenty different tints of <lb/>
            the red, the purple, and the blue,” and <lb/>
            compares the " meadow enamelled with <lb/>
            all the variegated hues of a field of <lb/>
            anemones " to "a crowd of Greeks and <lb/>
            Turks seen at a distance with their <lb/>
            coloured turbans, with the predominant <lb/>
            tints of red, blue, yellow, and white." <lb/>
            The Eleusinian plain is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕλειον</foreign>, <lb/>
            because it was frequently inundated by</p><pb n="54"/>
            <figure type="illustration">

          <p>the Eleusinian (to be distinguished from <lb/>
            the Athenian) Cephisus, Demosthenes <lb/>
            against Callicles 1279. And certain <lb/>
            mounds still visible there are supposed <lb/>
            to represent the embankments which <lb/>
            the Emperor Hadrian raised for the pur- <lb/>
            pose of keeping its water within bounds, <lb/>
            Leake, Topography of Athens, ii. 155.</p>
          <p>354. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐφημεῖν χρή</foreign>] Now Iacchus is <lb/>
            amongst his worshippers, and the pro- <lb/>
            cession is eager to start : but it cannot <lb/>
            do so, until it has been purged of all <lb/>
            profane and unworthy elements, <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκὰς <lb/>
            έκὰς ἐστὲ, βέβηλοι</foreign>. This solemn and im- <lb/>
            posing ceremony took place, we may well <lb/>
            believe, at the starting of the procession, <lb/>
            as it certainly did at the actual initia- <lb/>
            tion. Nero, says Suetonius (Nero 34), <lb/>
            " Eleusiniis sacris, quorum initiatione <lb/>
            impii et scelerati voce praeconis submo- <lb/>
            ventur, interesse non ausus est." Here <lb/>
            the duties of the præco are of course <lb/>
            discharged by the Coryphaeus. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξίστασθαι</foreign> <lb/>
            seems to have been the word regularly <lb/>
            employed on these occasions, infra 370 ; <lb/>
            Iph. in Tauris 1226-9. Aristophanes, <lb/>
            however, except at the commencement <lb/>
            and the close of the proclamation, drops <lb/>
            its connexion with the Mysteries, and <lb/>
            makes it the vehicle of his own <lb/>
            comic satire. Doubtless each of the <lb/>
            prohibitions which follow, even when <lb/>
            couched in the most general terms, has <lb/>
            its particular application, but we can <lb/>
            recognize it only in a very few instances.</p>
          <p>357. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρατίνου τοῦ ταυροφάγου</foreign>] Just as, <lb/>
            in the preceding line, the Muses took <lb/>
            the place of Demeter and Persephone ; <lb/>
            so here, instead of warning off all who <lb/>
            had not been initiated into their holy <lb/>
            mysteries, the speaker warns off all who <lb/>
            had not been initiated into the rites of <lb/>
            Dionysus, the god of dramatic per- <lb/>
            formances. But whether because the <lb/>
            deity in that particular character was <lb/>
            already on the stage, or because the <lb/>
            poet wished to pay a final compliment <lb/>
            to an old rival long since deceased, he <lb/>
            does not mention Dionysus by name, <lb/>
            but makes Cratinus (than whom no <lb/>
            more ardent votary of Dionysus, both as <lb/>
            the god of the drama and as the god of</p><pb n="55"/>
            
          <p>(The warning-off of the profa.ne.) <lb/>
            All evil thoughts and profane be still: far hence, far hence from our choirs depart, <lb/>
            Who knows not well what the Mystics tell, or is not holy and pure of heart; <lb/>
            Who ne'er has the noble revelry learned, or danced the dance of the Muses high; <lb/>
            Or shared in the Bacchic rites which old bull-eating Cratinus's words supply; <lb/>
            Who vulgar coarse buffoonery loves, though all untimely the jests they make; <lb/>
            Or lives not easy and kind with all, or kindling faction forbears to slake, <lb/>
            But fans the fire, from a base desire some pitiful gain for himself to reap ; <lb/>
            Or takes, in office, his gifts and bribes, while the city is tossed on the stormy deep; <lb/>
            Who fort or fleet to the foe betrays; or, a vile Thorycion, ships away <lb/>

            sentative, and dignifies him with the <lb/>
            epithets, of the god. For Sophocles, in <lb/>
            the Tyro, as the Scholiast and others <lb/>
            inform us, had spoken of Dionysus as <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig102.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αριστοφάνης</foreign>. It is only as an epithet of <lb/>
              the God that it is applied to Cratinus. <lb/>
              The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλώττης βακχεῖα</foreign> must be taken <lb/>
              together, bacchic tongue-rites.</p>
          <p>358. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βωμολόχοις</foreign>] Possibly this refers <lb/>
            to the tipsy buffoonery which Cleophon <lb/>
            had exhibited in the Assembly a short <lb/>
            time before the performance of this <lb/>
            play, when after their defeat at Argi- <lb/>
            nusae the Lacedaemonians had come <lb/>
            to treat for peace, Aristotle's Polity of <lb/>
            Athens, 34; buffoonery which might <lb/>
            not misbecome the comic stage, but <lb/>
            which was altogether out of place (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ</foreign> <lb/>
            'v <foreign xml:lang="grc">καιρῷ</foreign>) on the Athenian bema. The <lb/>
            persons who "fan the flames of hateful <lb/>
            faction" are the mischievous agitators <lb/>
            who stir up strife and party hatreds, <lb/>
            and are the chief obstacles to that <lb/>
            universal amnesty and reconciliation <lb/>
            which Aristophanes had so deeply at <lb/>
            heart, and which he will presently ad- <lb/>
            vocate in the Epirrhema.</p>
          <p>361. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων</foreign>] Holding some office of <lb/>
            state: a position which afforded abundant <lb/>
            opportunities for peculation. Cf. Wasp <lb/>
            557 ; Birds 1111. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλεως <lb/>
            χειαζομένης</foreign> are genitives absolute.</p>
          <p>363. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θωρκίων</foreign>] Of this unpatriotic <lb/>
            toll-gatherer we know nothing beyond <lb/>
            what is mentioned here, namely that <lb/>
            he plotted the destruction of the city <lb/>
            (cf. infra 381), and to that end supplied <lb/>
            the enemy's fleet with oar-pads and <lb/>
            pitch and sail-cloth, smuggling these pro- <lb/>
            hibited articles, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόρρητα</foreign>, from Aegina <lb/>
            to Epidaurus on the other side of the <lb/>
            Saronic Gulf. During the siege of Syra- <lb/>
            cuse the Athenians had imposed upon <lb/>
            their subject allies, in lieu of the ac- <lb/>
            customed tribute, a five per cent. duty <lb/>
            on all exports and imports by sea.—</p><pb n="56"/>

          <p>Thuc. vii. 28. And no doubt, as Boeckh <lb/>
            remarks (Public Economy, iii. 6), this <lb/>
            was the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰκοστὴ</foreign> which Thorycion collected <lb/>
            or farmed. Meier (as quoted in Dr. <lb/>
            Holden's Onomasticon Aristophaneum) <lb/>
            conjectures that the treasonable act was <lb/>
            committed during the rule of the Four <lb/>
            Hundred, when the Peloponnesian fleet <lb/>
            was stationed at Epidaurus, harrying <lb/>
            Aegina, and apparently expecting an <lb/>
            invitation to Athens from the more un- <lb/>
            scrupulous partisans of Sparta there.- <lb/>
            Thuc. viii. 92. But if so, it must have <lb/>
            been only now detected, for Aristophanes, <lb/>
            as the language in 381 infra more <lb/>
            distinctly shows, is alluding to some- <lb/>
            thing quite fresh in the minds of the <lb/>
            audience; there is nothing in the text <lb/>
            to imply the presence of an hostile fleet <lb/>
            in Epidaurus ; and probably the event <lb/>
            occurred when the Peloponnesians were <lb/>
            refitting their fleet after the battle of <lb/>
            Arginusae. The Scholiast defines <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄσκωμα</foreign> <lb/>
            as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δερμάτιόν τι, ᾧ ἐν ταῖς τριήρεσι χρῶναι, <lb/>

          <p>365. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινὰ πείθει</foreign>] We do not know to <lb/>
            whom this refers. The Scholiast says, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κῦρος</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λυσάνδρῳ ἔπεμψε χρήματα τότε <lb/>
            εἰς πόλεμον</foreign>, which is perfectly true, Xen. <lb/>
            Hell. II. i. 14, but no Athenian was <lb/>
            concerned in the transaction.</p>

            a well-known name ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κινησίας τοῦτο <lb/>
            πεποίηκε</foreign>, says the Scholiast; and Aristo- <lb/>
            phanes again alludes to the outrage in <lb/>
            Eccl. 330, see supra 153. And as to the <lb/>

            He adds <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμμισθοι δὲ πέντε ἦσον</foreign>, but this <lb/>
            refers to a later period when five <lb/>

            competed for the prize. Argument to <lb/>
            the Plutus, Aristotle's Polity of Athens, <lb/>
            56. One only of the competitors gained <lb/>
            the prize, but all were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμμισθοι</foreign>. Probably <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισθὸς</foreign> was given when the play was <pb n="57"/>

            same for all the competitors. Its amount <lb/>

            the moderation and wisdom, with which <lb/>

            Chorus to change the measure, and sing <lb/>
            the hymn to Demeter. And the second <lb/>
            hymn 'at once follows, consisting of a <lb/>
            dimeter iambic strophe and antistrophe <lb/>
            each composed of five verses, four of <lb/>
            which are acatalectic, and the fifth <lb/>
            catalectic. They have hitherto spoken <lb/>
            of the all-night revelry, which is now <lb/>

            was often a strange mixture of jest and <lb/>
            earnest; but the last words of the hymn, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νικήσαντα ταινιου̂σθαι</foreign>, show that Aristo- <lb/>
            phanes is really thinking of his comic <lb/>
            chorus, and of his success in the dramatic <lb/>
            competition. The Greeks combined the <lb/>
            two ideas, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γέλοια</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπουδαῖα</foreign>, into one <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡραῖον</foreign>, young with the bloom of ever- <lb/>
            lasting youth. Spanheim refers to <lb/>

            Thetis 252) " At parte ex alia florens <lb/>
            volitabat Iacchus " ; and Ovid (Met. iv. <lb/>
            17) where the poet, addressing the god <lb/>
            of many names, Bacchus, Bromius, <lb/>
            Lyaeus, lacchus, &amp;c., says- <lb/>
            "Tibi inconsumta juventas, <lb/>

          <p>398. ”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιακχε πολυτίμητε</foreign>] The hymn to <lb/>
            lacchus consists of three stanzas, each <lb/>
            containing six iambic lines, the final <lb/>
            line in each stanza being the refrain, <lb/>
            "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιακχε Φιλοχορευτὰ, συμπρόπεμπέ με</foreign>. The <lb/>
            first stanza exhorts the god to be the <lb/>

            θεὸν</foreign>, that is, to Demeter in Eleusis, <lb/>
            telling him by way of inducement, that <lb/>

            O Lord of the frolic and dance, <lb/>
            Iacchus, beside me advance! <lb/>
            For fun, and for cheapness, our dress thou hast rent,</p>
          <p>over twelve miles " says Mr. Louis Dyer <lb/>
            (Gods of Greece, chap. 5). It took <lb/>
            Mr. Dodwell four hours and five minutes <lb/>
            to traverse it on horseback (Tour, ii. 5). <lb/>
            And this procession was composed of <lb/>
            a mixed multitude of both sexes and <lb/>
            of various ages, mostly on foot, though <lb/>
            some, especially ladies, went in their <lb/>
            carriages. The sacrifices, dances, and <lb/>
            other observances would greatly prolong <lb/>
            the journey and augment the fatigue ; <lb/>
            and the journey may well have taken <lb/>
            them, as they intimate supra 387, the <lb/>
            whole autumnal day. But Iacchus him- <lb/>
            self was never tired ; a statue carried <lb/>
            in loving arms he could <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνευ πόνου</foreign> (the <lb/>
            phrase used by Dionysus of his own <lb/>
            self-deliverance in Eur. Bacchae 614, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς ἐξέσωσ' ἐμαυτὸν ῥᾳδίως ἄνευ πόνου</foreign>) <lb/>
            have accomplished the longest distance. <lb/>
            The priest in whose arms he was borne <lb/>
            was a stately and dignified official, and <lb/>
            had a special seat assigned him in the <lb/>
            front row of the Theatre, amongst those <lb/>
            who sat on the right of the Priest of <lb/>
            Dionysus (see the note on 297 supra) <lb/>
            and immediately after the nine Archons : <lb/>
            Haigh's Attic Theatre, vii. 3. In this <lb/>
            procession Iacchus was the only divine <lb/>
            traveller. He left Demeter and Per- <lb/>
            sephone in the Athenian Temple: he is <lb/>
            journeying to Demeter and Persephone <lb/>
            in the Eleusinian Temple.</p>
          <p>403. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὺ</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατεσχίσω</foreign>] The second <lb/>
            and third stanzas indulge in the license <lb/>
            which was a marked feature of these <lb/>
            processions, and which of itself accounts <lb/>
            for the split sandal, and the torn gar- <lb/>
            ment, " Thou art he who split for mirth <lb/>
            (and for economy) our sandal and our <lb/>
            tattered gaberdine" (cf. Plutus 845), <lb/>
            “and discovered a way for us to sport</p><pb n="62"/>

          <p>and to dance with perfect impunity." <lb/>
            Of the two expressions, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ γέλωτι</foreign> and <lb/>
            in <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐτελείᾳ</foreign>, the former applies to the <lb/>
            Mystic procession, the latter (which is <lb/>
            a sort of aside) to the comic chorus and <lb/>
            the expense saved to the Choregus. <lb/>
            Not of course that there is any allusion <lb/>
            to the manner in which the actual <lb/>
            Choregus of the Frogs had equipped <lb/>
            his chorus ; for though some lines may <lb/>
            have been added to a Comedy after its <lb/>
            acceptance by the Archon, see Eccl. <lb/>
            1158-1162, yet it is incredible that any <lb/>
            could have been introduced reflecting <lb/>
            on the Choregus, who was already <lb/>
            superintending its production. The <lb/>
            Scholiast tells its that according to <lb/>
            Aristotle it was decreed in the archon- <lb/>
            ship of Callias (the Callias who succeeded <lb/>
            Antigenes), that the expenses of the <lb/>
            choregia should be borne, not by a <lb/>
            single citizen as theretofore, but by two <lb/>
            conjointly : a change which shows that <lb/>
            in the altered condition of the city, the <lb/>
            burden was felt more heavily than <lb/>
            before, and that any saving in the repre- <lb/>
            sentation would therefore be welcomed.</p>
          <p>406. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀζημίους</foreign>] The license enjoyed on <lb/>
            these occasions might at other times <lb/>
            bring retaliation and punishment, but <lb/>
            now it is privileged : now they who em- <lb/>

            pied by the three processional hymns <lb/>
            has brought them (in imagination) to <lb/>
            the bridge over the Athenian Cephisus, <lb/>
            which is little more than a brook, and <lb/>

            Iacchus, beside me advance ! <lb/>
            A sweet pretty girl I observed in the show, <lb/>
            Her robe had been torn in the scuffle, and lo, <lb/>

            the procession made a pause, and the <lb/>

            each other, " from whence," says Bentley <lb/>
            (Phalaris, Age of Tragedy), "to abuse <lb/>
            and jeer was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεφυρίζειν</foreign>." Strabo <lb/>

            longed rehearsal of their old religious <lb/>
            solemnities, it is only when some satiric <lb/>
            work is to be done that the Mystics <lb/>
            awake to the fact that they are, for this <lb/>
            once, the Chorus of a comic play. They <lb/>
            now attack three unworthy Athenians, <lb/>
            Archedemus, Cleisthenes, and Callias. <lb/>
            Archedemus, who seems to have been <lb/>
            distinguished from others of the same <lb/>
            name by the epithet of 6 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλάμων</foreign>, the <lb/>
            bleareyed (infra 588 ; Lysias, adv. Alci- <lb/>
            biadem, i. 25) is described by Lysias as <lb/>
            a notorious debauchee and embezzler <lb/>
            of the public money : indeed he makes <lb/>
            it a charge against his opponent (the <lb/>
            son of the great Alcibiades) that he was <lb/>
            intimate with a man of so depraved <lb/>
            a character. Here he is ridiculed as <lb/>
            an alien, and the Scholiast says that <lb/>
            Eupolis in the Baptae assailed him on <lb/>
            the same ground. But no doubt the <lb/>
            present attack is really due to the fact <lb/>
            that Archedemus was the first to com- <lb/>
            mence hostilities against the victorious <lb/>

          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιμελούμενος</foreign>, if correct, probably mean <lb/>
            that he was entrusted with the duty of <lb/>
            watching the movements of the hostile <lb/>
            garrison in Deceleia.</p>
          <p>418. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺκ ἒφυσε φράτορας</foreign>] He had been <lb/>
            unable to prove his right to Athenian <lb/>
            citizenship, and consequently had not <lb/>
            been enrolled in any of the Athenian <lb/>

            Birds 765. But this meaning is con- <lb/>
            veyed in language which refers to a <lb/>
            child not cutting his second teeth in <lb/>
            due time, that is at the age of seven: <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φράτορας</foreign> being substituted <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ προσδο- <lb/>
            λίαν</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φραστη̂ρας</foreign>, age-teeth, teeth which, <lb/>
            as in the case of horses, serve to indicate <lb/>
            the age of their owner, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντὶ του̂ εἰπεῖν <lb/>
            ὀδόντας Φραστη̂ρας</foreign>, says the 'Scholiast, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φράτορας εἶπεν</foreign>. Pliny (N. H. vii. 15) says <lb/>
            “primores septimo mense gigni dentes, <lb/>
            baud dubium est; septimo eosdem deci- <lb/>
            dere anno, aliosque suffici." So Macro- <lb/>
            bius, In Somn. Scip. i. 6, " Post annos <lb/>

            aliis aptioribus ad cibum solidum nas. <lb/>
            centibus cedunt." In the last scene of <lb/>
            the Menaechmi, Menaechmus of Epi- <lb/>
            damnus being asked his age when he <lb/>
            was lost replied "Septuennis, nam tum <lb/>
            dentes mihi cadebant primulum." Cf. <lb/>
            also Juvenal, xiv. 10.</p>
          <p>420. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τοῖς ἄνω νεκροῖσι</foreign>] The Mystics, <lb/>
            adopting apparently the suggestion of <lb/>
            Euripides which is ridiculed infra 1082, <lb/>
            1477, consider that the dead are alive, <lb/>
            and the living dead. With them, accor- <lb/>
            dingly, it is " Up among the dead men," <lb/>
            not, as with the living, "Down among <lb/>
            the dead men."</p>
          <p>421. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ πρῶτα</foreign>] This use of the neuter <lb/>
            plural for the masculine or feminine, <lb/>
            whether singular or plural, is of course <lb/>
            very common. Cf. Hdt. vi. 100, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰσχίνης <lb/>

            And contrives the topmost place of the rascaldom to hold ? <lb/>
            And Cleisthenes, they say, <lb/>
            Is among the tombs all day, <lb/>
            Bewailing for his lover with a lamentable whine. <lb/>
            And Callias, I'm told, <lb/>
            Has become a sailor bold, <lb/>

            to multiply examples.</p>
          <p>422. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν Κλεισθένη</foreign>] Aristophanes never <lb/>
            loses an opportunity of lashing the <lb/>
            effeminate vices of Cleisthenes. We <lb/>
            have already heard of him and them, <lb/>
            supra 48 and 57. In the Thesmophoria- <lb/>
            zusae he is introduced on the stage, <lb/>
            siding with the women, whose habits <lb/>
            he declares are akin to his own. Here <lb/>
            he is represented as lamenting among <lb/>
            the tombs, in more than womanly <lb/>
            fashion, his lost male lover. To this <lb/>
            lover Aristophanes gives the name of <lb/>
            " Sebinus of the Anaphlystian deme," <lb/>
            both real names, though here employed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὰς</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">λακέμΦατον</foreign>. They are employed <lb/>
            in the same, way in Eccl. 979, 980, where <lb/>
            see the note.</p>
          <p>428. Ka<foreign xml:lang="grc">λλίαν</foreign>] Callias, the son of <lb/>
            Hipponicus, the notorious spendthrift <lb/>
            who squandered a princely fortune in <lb/>
            the grossest debauchery, was another <lb/>
            favourite object of Aristophanic satire. <lb/>
            He is here called the son, not of Hip- <lb/>
            ponicus but of Hippobinus, to signify <lb/>
            the dissipation which caused his ruin: <figure type="illustration">

              the Birds he is represented as a hoopoe <lb/>
              whose feathers are falling off, and the <lb/>
              poet explains his pitiable condition by <lb/>
              saying that he is plucked by sycophants <lb/>
              and women.-Birds 285, 286.</p>
          <p>430. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεαντη̂ν</foreign> The Aethio- <lb/>

          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ λεοντέας ἐναμμένοι</foreign>. And in Birds <lb/>
            1250 Peisthetaerus describes the por- <lb/>
            phyrions he is about to launch against <lb/>
            Zeus as <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρδαλα̂ς ἐνημμένους</foreign>, whilst here <lb/>
            the Chorus describe Callias as <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεοντη̂ν <lb/>
            ἐνημμένον</foreign>. But the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεοντη̂</foreign> which Callias <lb/>
            is wearing is taken not from a lion but <lb/>
            from a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύσθος</foreign>. The translation pro- <lb/>
            ceeds on the reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύσθῳ</foreign> as signifying <lb/>
            the part to be protected by the lion's <lb/>
            skin. But this would suit Cleisthenes <lb/>
            rather than Callias. It seems probable <lb/>
            that Callias took part in the battle of <lb/>
            Arginusae, and that some lover of <lb/>
            Cleisthenes was slain there.</p>
          <p>431. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχοιτ' ἄν</foreign>] Dionysus and Xanthias <lb/>
            now emerge from their lurking-place <lb/>
            and address the Chorus, who, Heracles <lb/>
            had previously assured them (161 supra), <lb/>
            would give them any information they <lb/>
            might require. Joining suddenly in <lb/>
            the dialogue, they adopt the metre in <lb/>
            which the Chorus are singing.</p>
          <p>436. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ' ἴσθ' κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] The Scholiast <lb/>
            says TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοῖον λαὶ ἐν Γηρυτάδῃ</foreign>, meaning, <lb/>
            apparently, that there was a similar <lb/>
            line in the lost comedy Gerytades, as <lb/>
            there still is in Plutus 962.</p>
          <p>439. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διὸς Κόρινθος</foreign>] What else is this <lb/>
            but <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δτὸς Κόρινθος</foreign> in respect of the wraps? <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διὸς Κόρινθος</foreign>, which is found again in <lb/>
            the Ecclesiazusae, in Pindar's seventh <lb/>
            Nemean, ad fin., and in the Euthydemus <lb/>
            of Plato, chap. six, is a proverbial ex- <lb/>
            pression, applicable either to tedious <lb/>
            iteration, as in the present passage, or <lb/>
            to high-flown language with no corre- <lb/>
            sponding results, as in Eccl. 828. Its <lb/>
            origin is explained by the Scholiasts <lb/>
            here and on Pindar. '0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόρινθος</foreign>, son of <lb/>
            Zeus, was the eponymous Founder <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̂ς <lb/>
            Κορίνθου</foreign>, of the city of Corinth. Megara, <lb/>
            originally a dependency of Corinth, <lb/>
            revolted from her at an early period, <lb/>
            and ambassadors were sent to bring her <lb/>
            to reason. The Corinthian spokesman <lb/>
            talked in the grand style, Ye do not <lb/>
            honour <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν Διὸς Κόρινθον</foreign>, verily <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ Διὸς <lb/>
            Κόρινθος</foreign> is grieved at your conduct, and <lb/>
            so on, with a perpetual introduction <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̂ Διὸς Κορίνθου</foreign>, till the Megarians <lb/>
            lost all patience and set upon the</p><pb n="67"/>
            
          <p>Dio. Can any of you tell <lb/>
            Where Pluto here may dwell, <lb/>
            For we, sirs, are two strangers who were never here before?</p>
          <p>CHOR. 0, then no further stray, <lb/>
            Nor again enquire the way, <lb/>
            For know that ye have journeyed to his very entrance-door.</p>
          <p>Dio. Take up the wraps, my ]ad.</p>
          <p>XAN. Now is not this too bad? <lb/>
            Like " Zeus's Corinth," he " the wraps " keeps saying o'er and o'er.</p>
          <p>CHOR. Now wheel your sacred dances through the glade with flowers bedight,</p>
          <p>speaker, crying Trate <foreign xml:lang="grc">παῖε τὸν Διὸς Κόρινθον</foreign>, <lb/>
            and finally secured their independence <lb/>
            by defeating the Corinthian troops. <lb/>
            But doubtless there is here, as Bergler <lb/>
            in his translation suggested, a play upon <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόρινθος</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόρεις</foreign>, similar to <lb/>
            that in Clouds 710. "Fortasse etiam," <lb/>
            says Bothe, "ridiculi causa simulat, dum <lb/>
            stragula tollit, se pungi a cimice in iis <lb/>
            latitante." Without this allusion it is <lb/>
            difficult to explain the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τοῖς στρώ- <lb/>
            μασιν</foreign>. For few will accept Fritzsche's <lb/>
            suggestion that the Corinthians may <lb/>
            have stamped Corinthi conditoris ima- <lb/>
            ginem in stragulis vere Corinthiacis, <lb/>
            so that Xanthias really means An <lb/>
            forte Jovis filius Corinthus stragulis <lb/>
            meis inscriptus est ?" This seems to <lb/>
            make the line quite pointless.</p>
          <p>440. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωρεῑτε ... έορτῆς</foreign>] The Cory- <lb/>
            phaeus again issues his instructions to <lb/>
            the Chorus, who respond, 448 infra, <lb/>
            with the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωρῶμεν κ.τ.λ</foreign>. On the <lb/>
            metre, see the note on 394 supra. I have <lb/>
            followed the common interpretation, <lb/>
            Ducite nunc sacram choream Divae, <lb/>

            Brunei. Saltate in orbem choream du- <lb/>

            Thesm. 953, where <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς κύκλον</foreign> is a call <lb/>
            to the dance ; of. id. 968 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐκύκλου χορείος</foreign>. <lb/>

            sacrum septum deae,perfloriferum lucum, <lb/>
            which certainly has the advantage of <lb/>
            giving the same meaning to the preposi- <lb/>
            tion <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὰ</foreign> in each clause of the sentence. <lb/>
            He refers to Pollux i, segm. 10, who <lb/>
            says <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνειμένοι θεοῖς τόποι, ἄλση τε</foreign> <lb/>
            Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεμένη καὶ ἕρκη. καὶ ό περὶ αὐτὰ κύκλος, <lb/>
            περίβολος</foreign>. It is to be observed, how- <lb/>
            ever, that Pollux does not say that the <lb/>
            environment of a temple was called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύκλος</foreign> ; on the contrary he says, and <lb/>
            truly, that it was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίβαλος</foreign>; nor <lb/>
            am I aware of any passage in which <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύκλος</foreign> is so employed. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλσος</foreign> is not <lb/>
            used here, as in Pollux, to signify "a <lb/>
            consecrated grove." See the following <lb/>
            note. Above all it is incredible that if <lb/>
            the Coryphaeus were really directing the <lb/>
            Chorus to go to a temple, they should in <lb/>
            their response declare that they would <lb/>

            possible (though I doubt it) that in the <lb/>

            But these are functions of a totally <lb/>
            different character. Nor, perhaps, is <lb/>
            it, more to the point to observe that <lb/>
            they shared with the Graces the duty <lb/>
            of escorting Persephone every year from <lb/>
            the unseen world to the sunshine and <lb/>
            gladness of spring. See the Orphic <lb/>

            character as mystics who have passed <lb/>
            through the gate of death and found <lb/>
            life and immortality beyond. To living <lb/>

            The blessed sunshine o'er us <lb/>

          <p>464. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΑΙΑΚΟΣ</foreign>] Aeacus, the grandsire <lb/>
            of both Achilles and Aias. was a man <lb/>
            of such singular integrity of life, that <lb/>
            after death he was promoted to some <lb/>
            position of trust in the kingdom of <lb/>
            Hades. He was generally regarded as <lb/>
            a member of the august tribunal for <lb/>
            judging the dead, with Minos and <lb/>
            Rhadamanthus for his colleagues. But <lb/>
            Aristophanes assigns him the humbler <lb/>
            post of doorkeeper in the hall of Pluto. <lb/>
            Bergler refers to Lucian's Twentieth <lb/>
            Dialogue of the Dead,, where Menippus, <lb/>
            on entering Hades, being shown by <lb/>
            Aeacus some familiar objects, observes <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶδα ταῦτα, καὶ σὲ, ὅτι πυλωρεῖς</foreign>. So in <lb/>
            the same writer's De Luctu 4, Aeacus <lb/>
            is said to guard the entrance to Hades, <lb/>
            with Cerberus by his side. But Lucian <lb/>
            was, probably, merely following in the <lb/>
            steps of Aristophanes.</p>
          <p>465. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ βδελυρέ</foreign>] The announcement <lb/>
            that he is "Heracles the strong ” pro- <lb/>
            cures for Dionysus a reception which <lb/>
            he little expected. The volley of abuse <lb/>
            which the doorkeeper of Hades dis- <lb/>
            charges at his head can only be com- <lb/>
            pared with that which in the Peace <lb/>
            is launched at Trygaeus by the caretaker <lb/>
            of Zeus's celestial palace. But there is <lb/>
            more excuse for the present outburst, <lb/>
            since Aeacus has been told and believes <lb/>
            that the ravisher of Cerberus is standing <lb/>
            before him. The exclamation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ μιαρὲ <lb/>
            καὶ παμμίαρε</foreign> is of frequent occurrence <lb/>
            in St. Chrysostom, Horn. in Matth. xxxi. <lb/>
            358 A, lxxxi. 775 B ; Horn. in Rom. xxii. <lb/>
            678 B (according to MS. Vat.), xxiv. <lb/>
            691 C ; Horn. in 2 Cor. xxviii. 637 B <lb/>
            and C, &amp;c. In this vituperative language <lb/>
            the Scholiasts find a resemblance to <lb/>
            that which, in the Euripidean tragedy <lb/>
            bearing the name of Theseus, that hero <lb/>
            addresses to Minos. Thus on 467 they <pb n="72"/>

              that the lines quoted do not bear the <lb/>
              remotest resemblance to the language <lb/>
              of Aeacus; and it is very improbable <lb/>
              that Aristophanes should be drawing <lb/>
              upon a play which, being parodied in <lb/>
              the Wasps, must have been produced <lb/>
              at least eighteen years before. Here <lb/>
              Aeacus first threatens the intruder with <lb/>
              the three rivers of Hades, the Styx, the <lb/>
              Acheron, and the Cocytus ; and then <lb/>
              invokes three grisly spectres, the Echidna, <lb/>
              the Muraena, and the Gorgons. But <lb/>
              everywhere, as we shall see, there is <lb/>
              a vein of burlesque underlying his most <lb/>
              terrible menaces.</p>

            (Iliad, ii. 755 ; Od. x. 513), is the Styx ; <lb/>
            though later writers agree in making <lb/>
            the Styx a cataract falling from the <lb/>
            Aroanian mountains in the north of <lb/>
            Arcady, and flowing into the river <lb/>
            Crathis, which after traversing Achaia <lb/>

            as Mr. Paley thinks. Aeacus is not <lb/>

            instead of the stream, we hear of the <lb/>

            (see the illustrations in Wordsworth's <lb/>
            Greece, pp. 253-259), it seems probable <lb/>
            that Aeacus is speaking of the Acheron <lb/>
            as if it were itself a peak, and not <lb/>
            a river. As to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίδρορμαι κύνες</foreign> of <lb/>

            Scholiast says <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μύραινα, δαίμων φοβερὰ</foreign>, <lb/>
            but she is not otherwise known in <lb/>
            mythology. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">δνα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύραινα</foreign>, <lb/>
            however, were always closely connected. <lb/>
            Spanheim refers to Aesch. Choeph. 981, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύραιά γ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴτ</foreign>’ : and Bergler to <lb/>

          <p>475. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταρτησία Μύραινα</foreign>] The humour <lb/>
            of these words, which was first pointed <lb/>
            out by Bergler, is well expressed by <lb/>
            Dr. Merry, "The epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταρτησία</foreign> has <lb/>
            a terrible sound, from its resemblance <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τάρταρας</foreign>. But it veils a jest : for <lb/>
            the Tartesian lamprey was esteemed <lb/>
            a great delicacy." Bergler refers to <lb/>
            Pollux, VI, chap. x, where <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> napo <lb/>

              its dried figs (Athenaeus, xiv. 67) and <lb/>
              apparently of ill repute for its scolding <lb/>
              women, who are here made to pass off <lb/>
              for the Gorgons. The burlesque run- <lb/>
              ning through these denunciations in no <lb/>

            which is followed in the text, has been <lb/>
            generally adopted by recent editors. It <lb/>

            we must understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔδεισα</foreign>. No by Zeus, <lb/>
            I feared them not, nor even gave them a <lb/>

            No by Zeus, nor did he even give it u <lb/>

            amet,” "Flocci non feci, ita me Jupiter <lb/>

            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ</foreign>, as in 1043 infra. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ</foreign> <lb/>
            introduces a new branch of the sentence <lb/>

            Scholiast.</p>
          <p>501. OVK <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μελίτης μαστιγίας</foreign>] Melite was <lb/>
            a deme adjoining Collytus and the Cera- <lb/>
            meicus, and containing, the Scholiast <lb/>
            tells us, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιφανέστατον ἱερὸν Ἡρακλέους <lb/>
            ἀλεξικάκου</foreign>. He is probably speaking of <lb/>
            the Theseium described by Pausanias <lb/>
            in the seventeenth chapter of the Attica, <lb/>
            which is generally identified (Leake's <lb/>
            Topography of Athens, i. 166, and <lb/>
            Appendix ix, though there are no <lb/>
            doubt considerable difficulties in the <lb/>
            way of that identification; see Dyer's <lb/>
            Ancient Athens, chap. viii) with the <lb/>
            beautiful temple still existing in that <lb/>
            quarter in almost perfect preservation. <lb/>
            For in Athens a temple of Theseus was <lb/>
            also, as a rule, a temple of Heracles. <lb/>
            Theseus himself is said to have dedica- <lb/>
            ted all his shrines but four to the <lb/>
            worship of Heracles (Plutarch, Theseus, <lb/>
            35 ; cf. Eurip. Here. Fur. 1325-35). The <lb/>
            Athenians loved to draw more closely <lb/>
            the ties which bound their local hero to <lb/>
            his still more illustrious comrade, and <lb/>
            Heracles was always a welcome guest <lb/>
            in the Athenian homes of Theseus. <lb/>
            Speaking of the existing temple, Bp. <lb/>
            Wordsworth of Lincoln observes: “ The- <lb/>
            seus did not enjoy alone the undivided <lb/>
            honours of his own temple. He ad- <lb/>
            mitted Heracles, the friend and com-</p><pb n="77"/>
            
          <p>And shoutings ? XAN. Frightened ? Not a bit. I cared not.</p>
          <p>Dio. Come then, if you're so very brave a man, <lb/>
            Will you be I, and take the heroes club <lb/>
            And lion's skin, since you're so monstrous plucky ? <lb/>
            And I'll be now the slave, and bear the luggage.</p>
          <p>XAN. Hand them across. I cannot choose but take them. <lb/>
            And now observe the Xanthio-heracles <lb/>
            If I'm a coward and a sneak like you.</p>
          <p>Dio. Nay, you're the rogue from Melite's own self. <lb/>
            And I'll pick up and carry on the traps.</p>
          <p>MAID. 0 welcome, Heracles ! come in, sweetheart. <lb/>
            My Lady, when they told her, set to work,</p>
          <p>panion of his earthly toils, to a share <lb/>
            in his posthumous glory. He even <lb/>
            ceded to him, with the best spirit of <lb/>
            Athenian delicacy, the most honourable <lb/>
            place in that fabric. On the eastern <lb/>
            facade of this temple all the ten metopes <lb/>
            are occupied with the labours of Heracles, <lb/>
            while only four, and those on the sides, <lb/>
            refer to the deeds of Theseus. The <lb/>
            same disinterestedness is shown in the <lb/>
            selection of the subjects of the two <lb/>
            friezes of the pronaos and posticum of <lb/>
            the cella. Here, as before, Theseus has <lb/>
            yielded to Heracles the most conspicuous <lb/>
            spot at the very entrance of his own <lb/>
            temple " (Athens and Attica, chap. xviii). <lb/>
            Xanthias is doubtless throwing him- <lb/>
            self into the attitude of some well- <lb/>
            known representation, whether statue, <lb/>
            frieze, or painting, of Heracles in the <lb/>
            Theseium. The Scholiast mentions, or <lb/>
            makes, the curious suggestion, that an <lb/>
            allusion is intended to Callias, the son <lb/>
            of Hipponicus, who is credited with the <lb/>
            possession of a lion-skin, supra 430, and <lb/>
            who, he says, had a residence in Melite ; <lb/>
            but this is extremely improbable: and <lb/>
            anyhow, any such allusion must be <lb/>
            quite subordinate to the reference to <lb/>
            Heracles as the scapegrace of Melite.</p>
          <p>503. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ φίλταθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκεις</foreign>] Dionysus has <lb/>
            divested himself of the attire of Heracles <lb/>
            at a most inopportune moment. Whilst <lb/>
            he carried the club and the lion-skin, <lb/>
            they attracted nothing but threats and <lb/>
            revilings, but no sooner has he doffed <lb/>
            them than they receive the warmest <lb/>
            welcome. The maid-servant of Per- <lb/>
            sephone runs out to invite the wearer <lb/>
            to a splendid banquet prepared on <lb/>
            a scale proportionate to the hero's <lb/>
            traditional voracity. A whole ox is to <lb/>
            be broiled on the embers; there are to <lb/>
            be several bowls of that thick soup, <lb/>
            after which his soul had so often lusted <lb/>
            (supra 63, 64), whilst bread and rolls <lb/>
            and honey-cakes, fillets of fish, game, <lb/>
            sweetmeats and wine are to be provided <lb/>
            in profusion.</p><pb n="78"/>

            horror that although he has no longer <lb/>
            the honour of representing Heracles <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυνοκλόπος</foreign>, he is nevertheless let in <lb/>
            for the punishment of his misdeeds. <lb/>
            He had left out of his reckoning that <lb/>
            strange but well-known custom whereby <lb/>
            an accused person might prove his own <lb/>
            innocence by tendering his slaves for <lb/>
            the torture. This custom, of proof by <lb/>
            slave-torture, is constantly mentioned <lb/>
            by the Attic orators : a speaker always <lb/>
            brags of his own readiness to submit <lb/>
            his slaves to the torture, and always <lb/>
            denounces the refusal of his opponent <lb/>
            as evidence of the weakness of his case. <lb/>

            methods of torture. In the Trapeziticus <lb/>

            the banker Pasion is described as having <lb/>
            resorted to various subterfuges to prevent <lb/>
            a slave (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Κίττον τὸν πα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">δα</foreign>) who was privy <lb/>
            to the deposit which his master denied, <lb/>
            being submitted to the torture. At <lb/>
            length, however, he professed himself <lb/>

            the heaping a heavy pile of bricks on <lb/>
            a man's chest is, as Dr. Merry observes, <lb/>
            an obsolete penalty of our English pro- <lb/>
            cedure. It was employed to compel <lb/>
            a man to speak who was obstinately <lb/>

          <p>621. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλὴν πράσῳ</foreign>] Most masters, in <lb/>
            giving up a slave to be tortured, would, <lb/>
            if they were not entirely destitute of <lb/>

            be exposed to the most terrible tortures <lb/>
            which might maim or injure him for <lb/>
            life. Here the slave, giving up his <lb/>
            master to be tortured, does the very <lb/>
            reverse, stipulating that he should not <lb/>
            be exposed to a mere nominal torture <lb/>
            which he would not feel.</p>

            vigour of his arm to be restrained by <lb/>
            any fear of liability even if Dionysus <lb/>
            sinks under the torture. Apparently <lb/>
            this liability only arose when the <lb/>

            Xanthias, who as a slave has long been <lb/>

            has a greater power of endurance, than <lb/>
            his delicate and voluptuous master ; and <lb/>
            he is therefore quite' willing to submit <lb/>

            is compelled to submit to an unaccus- <lb/>
            tomed, flagellation. By this means he <lb/>
            escapes detection for the moment, and <lb/>
            at the same time has the real satisfac- <lb/>

            All the more reason you should flog him well. <lb/>

          <p>Dio. Well, but you say that you're a god yourself. <lb/>

          <p>seventh, whilst Xanthias has only three, <lb/>
            the first, third, and fifth. Both profess <lb/>
            not even to feel their first blow ; at the <lb/>
            second Xanthias utters a whimper, which <lb/>
            he passes off as due to his anticipation <lb/>
            of some religious festival, whilst Dionysus <lb/>
            cries out and his eyes .fill with tears, <lb/>
            for both of which symptoms he makes <lb/>
            a very lame excuse; when the third <lb/>
            falls, Xanthias can no longer dissemble <lb/>
            his pain, but attributes it, not to the <lb/>
            blow, but to a thorn in his foot; and <lb/>
            both in his third and fourth Dionysus <lb/>
            in agony shrieks out the name of a <lb/>
            god, in each case endeavouring to treat <lb/>
            it as the commencement of a poetic <lb/>
            quotation.</p>
          <p>644. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίδού</foreign>] This signifies " Ready! ! " as <lb/>
            infra 1378, 1390, and frequently else- <lb/>
            where. Then the blow descends, and it <lb/>
            is not until after its fall that Xanthias <lb/>
            proceeds, "See if I shall flinch when <lb/>
            you strike me," as if the blow were yet <lb/>
            to come. Aeacus treats the incredulous <lb/>
            exclamation <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺ μἀ Δίο</foreign>, as if it meant <lb/>
            "I did not feel it," and rejoins "So <lb/>
            indeed it seems to me."</p>
          <p>646. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πηνίκα</foreign>] Beck says Anxietatem <lb/>

          <p>the blow has already fallen, and <lb/>
            Dionysus is in his turn pretending that <lb/>
            he did not observe it.</p>
          <p>647. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκἔπταραν</foreign>] How came it then <lb/>
            that I did not sneeze ? It is difficult to <lb/>
            give any satisfactory explanation of <lb/>
            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπταραν</foreign>. According to the <lb/>
            Scholiast, Dionysus means that a blow <lb/>
            from the scourge would affect him as <lb/>
            little as the tickling of his nose with <lb/>
            a straw, which would merely make him <lb/>
            sneeze ; and as he has not sneezed, how <lb/>
            can he have received the blow ? This <lb/>
            is exceedingly far-fetched, and nothing <lb/>
            can be more irrelevant than Conz's <lb/>
            remark "sternutatio in ominibus bonis <lb/>
            malisve habebatur." I venture to suggest <lb/>
            that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπταραν</foreign> we ought to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπτα</foreign>- <lb/>
            KOV, the second aorist of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτήσσω</foreign>, a form <lb/>
            sufficiently authenticated by the com- <lb/>
            pound <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταπτακὼν</foreign> in Aesch. Eum. 243, <lb/>
            How came it then that I did not flinch ?</p>
          <p>649. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰατταταῖ</foreign>] Such ejaculations as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰατταταῖῖ, ἀτταταῖ, ἀππαπαῖ, παπαῖ</foreign>, and the <lb/>
            like had no determinate signification, <lb/>
            and might with equal aptness express <lb/>
            pleasure, pain, desire, surprise or any <lb/>
            other emotion. See Ach. 1190, 1198, <lb/>
            Wasps 309, Lys. 924, Thesm. 223 and <lb/>
            above 57, 63. Here of course it is <lb/>
            really a cry of pain, but Xanthias passes <lb/>
            it off as a cry of longing for the merry- <lb/>
            making of the Heracleian festival. <lb/>
            Fritzsche indeed takes an entirely dif- <lb/>
            ferent view, contending that Xanthias <lb/>
            admits his exclamation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰατταταῖ</foreign> to be <lb/>
            a, cry of grief, but pretends, in his <lb/>
            character of Heracles, to be grieving <lb/>
            at the suspension of his own Diomeian <lb/>
            festival. He suggests (1) that " in tanto <lb/>
            tamque aperto dolore, risus atque hi- <lb/>
            laritas ne fingi quidem commode po- <lb/>
            terat." (2) That possibly " Athenienses <lb/>
            inter tot belli curas magnum Herculis <lb/>
            festum in Diomeensium page celebrari <lb/>
            solitum intermiserant," and thirdly that <lb/>
            " Xanthias-Hercules minime plagis se <lb/>
            doluisse ait, sed sollicitum fuisse sa- <lb/>
            crorum suorum intermissione." The <lb/>
            first suggestion is against the spirit of <lb/>
            the whole scene, and Fritzsche himself <lb/>
            altogether ignores it four lines below, <lb/>
            where he says that " Dionysus fingit se <lb/>
            equitibus subito in conspectum datis <lb/>
            laetatum, quia <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσὐ</foreign> non solum dolorem <lb/>
            exprimit, sed etiam effuse gaudentis <lb/>
            est." The second suggestion is without <lb/>
            a particle of authority or (considering <lb/>
            the deme's position) of probability; <lb/>

            truth, throughout this whipping scene, <lb/>
            Dionysus does not keep up his character <lb/>
            of, Dionysus, nor Xanthias his assumed <lb/>
            character of Heracles.</p>
          <p>651. ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηράκλεια τἀνΔιομείοις</foreign>] The <lb/>
            festival in honour of Heracles within <lb/>
            the precincts <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ</foreign> ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηρακληῑου τοῦ ἐνΚυτο- <lb/>
            σάργεἲ</foreign> (as Hdt. calls it v. 63, vi. 116) <lb/>
            seems to have been celebrated with an <lb/>
            abundance of buffoonery which would <lb/>
            be dear to the soul of Xanthias ; and <lb/>
            doubtless at some stage of the proceed- <lb/>
            ings the cry of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰατταταῖ</foreign> was, as Conz <lb/>
            also suggests, loudly raised by the as- <lb/>
            sembled worshippers. Kock refers to <lb/>
            the account given by Athenaeus, xiv. 3, <lb/>
            of sixty jesters who in the following <lb/>
            century frequented this particular <lb/>
            temple. Philip of Macedon, we are <lb/>
            told, gave them a talent to write down <lb/>
            their jokes and send them to himself. <lb/>
            Cynosarges was a locality in the extra- <lb/>
            mural portion of the deme <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διόμειοι</foreign> which <lb/>
            extended on both sides of the gates <lb/>
            thence called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διάμειαι πύλαι</foreign>. There <lb/>
            was a tradition that whilst Diomus was <lb/>
            offering a sacrifice, a white dog, passing <lb/>
            along, ran off with'the meat and hid it <lb/>
            in some secret place. An oracle di- <lb/>
            rected Diomus to erect an. altar to <lb/>
            Heracles on the spot where the meat <lb/>
            had been hidden. The spot was dis- <lb/>
            covered, and from the white dog was <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κυνόσαργες</foreign>, and about it was <lb/>
            erected the famous Temple of Heracles. <lb/>
            The story is told, with variations, by <lb/>
            almost all the old grammarians.</p>
          <p>653. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰοὐ ἰαὐ</foreign>] Here we have another <lb/>
            exclamation of dubious import. As <lb/>
            originally uttered by Dionysus, it was <lb/>
            of course a shriek of agony, which he <lb/>
            tries to pass off as a shout of excitement <lb/>
            at seeing some horsemen go by. This, <lb/>
            however, as Aeacus observes, does not <lb/>
            account for the tears which suffuse his <lb/>
            eyes ; and for these he has to resort to <lb/>
            another explanation, attributing them <lb/>
            to a sudden smell of onions; cf. Lys. <lb/>
            798. Mine eyes smell onions, I shall weep <lb/>
            anon, says old Lafeu in the closing scene <lb/>
            of All's Well that Ends Well. And <lb/>
            Shakespeare introduces the same notion <lb/>
            in Antony and Cleopatra, and the <lb/>
            Taming of the Shrew. <note type="footnote"> II </note></p><pb n="98"/>

            And the audience would not pause to <lb/>
            consider whether the sensation of pain <lb/>
            was a less disproof of his divinity when <lb/>
            occasioned by a, thorn than when occa- <lb/>
            sioned by a blow. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>But there is no need to attribute the <lb/>
            mention of Hipponax to any pain or <lb/>
            flurry on the part of Dionysus. The <lb/>
            scanty poems of Ananius were always <lb/>
            appended to the more ample writings <lb/>
            of Hipponax, and were often quoted <lb/>
            under his name. Only four fragments <lb/>
            of the iambics of Ananius are still ex- <lb/>
            tant (see Bergk's Poetae Lyrici Graeci); <lb/>
            and of these there is but one which is <lb/>
            not also ascribed to Hipponax.</p>
          <p>664. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πόσειδον</foreign>] In his eagerness to <lb/>
            carry out the suggestion of Xanthias, <lb/>
            Aeacus forgets that the next blow <lb/>
            belonged of right to Xanthias himself, <lb/>
            and accordingly inflicts two in succes. <lb/>
            sion upon Dionysus. To redress this <lb/>
            injustice, Mr. Green would give the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πόσειδον ... ὂς Αἰγαίου</foreign> K.T.X. to <lb/>
            Xanthias, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥλγησέν τις</foreign> to Dionysus,, <lb/>
            so that the latter words would, be a. <lb/>
            retort to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥλγησεν</foreign>. of Xanthias four</p><pb n="99"/>
            
          <p>AEAC. Then you don't mind it? DIO. (Cheerfully.) Mind it? Not a bit.</p>
          <p>AEAC. Well, I must go to the other one again.</p>
          <p>XAN. O ! 0 ! AEAC. Hallo ! XAN. Do pray pull out this thorn. <lb/>
            AEAC. What does it mean ? 'Tis this one's turn again.</p>
          <p>Dio. (Shrieking.) Apollo! Lord! (Calmly) of Delos and of Pytho.</p>
          <p>XAN. He flinched! You heard him ? DIO. Not at all; a jolly <lb/>
            Verse of Hipponax flashed across my mind.</p>
          <p>XAN. Yon don't half do it: cut his flanks to pieces.</p>
          <p>AEAC. By Zeus, well thought on. Turn your belly here.</p>
          <p>Dio. (Screaming.) Poseidon! XAN. There ! he's flinching. Dio. (Singing) who dost reign <lb/>
            Amongst the Aegean peaks and creeks <lb/>
            And o'er the deep blue main.</p>
          <p>AEAC. No, by Demeter, still I can't find out <lb/>
            Which is the god, but come ye both indoors ; <lb/>
            My lord himself and Persephassa there,</p>
          <p>lines above : compare 606 supra. But <lb/>
            though I was at one time much taken <lb/>
            with this suggestion, I am now satisfied <lb/>
            that the MS. arrangement is correct. <lb/>
            To make Xanthias prepare a rod for <lb/>
            his own back (a very inappropriate <lb/>
            metaphor, however) would be to turn <lb/>
            the laugh against him, and in favour <lb/>
            of Dionysus, which is quite contrary to <lb/>
            the relation in which the pair stand <lb/>
            towards each other: nor would the <lb/>
            literary abilities of the slave, which <lb/>
            are only equal to the idea about the <lb/>
            thorn, soar to the height of the quota- <lb/>
            tion and song. Here, as before, the <lb/>
            name of the god is a mere involuntary <lb/>
            exclamation, and is only by an after- <lb/>
            thought turned into the commencement <lb/>
            of a lyrical sentence. The Scholiast <lb/>
            says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τὰ ΣοΦοκλέους ἐκ Λαοκόωντος <lb/>
            " Πόσειδον, ὂς Αἰγαίαυ μέδεις πρῶνας, ὴ <lb/>
            γλαυκᾶς μέ</foreign>Sets <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐανέμου λίμνας, ἐΦ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑψηλαῖς <lb/>
            σπιλάδεσσι στομάτν</foreign>.” This is obviously <lb/>
            corrupt, but it cannot be amended with <lb/>
            certainty.</p>
          <p>668. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὐ δὑναμαι</foreign>] ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμφότεροι γὰρ ὼδυνή- <lb/>
            θησαν</foreign>.—Scholiast. " Non potest cogno- <lb/>
            scere uter sit Deus, quia ambo dolorem <lb/>
            dissimulare non poterant.”—Bergler. <lb/>
            But the meaning is the very reverse. <lb/>
            Aeacus had accepted their explanations <lb/>
            in simple good faith, and believed that <lb/>
            neither had flinched. Had he taken the <lb/>
            ”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απολλον</foreign> in 659 for a shriek of pain, he <lb/>
            would at once have closed the inquiry, <lb/>
            and concluded Dionysus <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶναι μὴ θεὸν</foreign>, <lb/>
            supra 639; whereas the remark of <lb/>
            Xanthias, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδἐνποιεῖς γὑρ</foreign>, and the reply <lb/>
            of Aeacus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μἀ τὸν Δία</foreign>, No more I do, <lb/>
            show plainly that the test had so far <lb/>
            failed. Aeacus swears by Demeter, as <lb/>
            is becoming in a servant of Hades. <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note></p><pb n="100"/>

          <p>673. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πληγὰς λαβεῖν</foreign>] The actors retire <lb/>
            from the stage, and the Chorus, turning <lb/>
            to the audience, commence the last <lb/>
            Parabasis which has come down to our <lb/>
            days. It is not a complete Parabasis <lb/>
            like those of the Acharnians, the Knights, <lb/>
            the Wasps, and the Birds. It answers <lb/>
            to the second or shorter Para basis of <lb/>
            the Knights and the Birds. The Para- <lb/>
            basis Proper is gone, and with it the <lb/>
            Commation which introduced it, and <lb/>
            the Pnigos with which it concluded. <lb/>
            The last four parts alone remain : the <lb/>
            Strophe and Epirrhema : and the Anti- <lb/>
            strophe and Antepirrhema.</p>
          <p>674-685. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μοῦσα κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] THE STROPHE. <lb/>
            The commencement of the Strophe is <lb/>
            obviously borrowed from some tragic <lb/>
            poet, and as we know that the com- <lb/>
            mencement of the Antistrophe is taken <lb/>
            from Ion of Chios, we may perhaps not <lb/>
            unreasonably infer that we are here <lb/>
            also listening to his words. It seems <lb/>
            to me that the actual quotation or <lb/>
            parody goes down to and includes the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοτιμότεραι</foreign>, Aristophanes sub- <lb/>
            stituting the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλεοφῶντος</foreign> for the <lb/>
            high-flown genitives of the original as <lb/>
            well for the sake of raising a laugh <lb/>
            at the unexpected bathos, as for the <lb/>
            purpose of indulging in a fling at that <lb/>
            pernicious demagogue. I take it, how- <lb/>
            ever, that the language of Ion is more <lb/>
            or less adapted, though of course wrested <lb/>
            from its proper context, throughout the <lb/>
            remainder of the Strophe.</p>
          <p>674. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορῶν ἱερῶν ἐπίβηθι</foreign>] Commence <lb/>
            the sacred choral dance and song. They <lb/>
            speak of the Muse as of a charioteer <lb/>
            mounting upon her car. Compare <lb/>
            Hesiod (W. and D. 658, 659), <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig152.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              The Scholiast says that the Muse here <lb/>
              invoked is Terpsichore, and this is <lb/>
              perhaps implied by the juxtaposition <lb/>
              of the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορῶν</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέρψιν</foreign>.</p>

            O see on the benches before us that countless and wonderful throng, <lb/>

            On the lips of that foreigner base, of Athens the bane and disgrace,</p>
          <p>Veiled with his gorgeous wings, upspringing light <lb/>
            Flew through the midst of heaven.</p>
          <p>678. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλεοφῶντος</foreign>] The political folly <lb/>
            of this demagogic lyre-maker, who in <lb/>
            the violence of his oratory out-Cleoned <lb/>
            Cleon, is attacked at the close of the <lb/>
            play, where see the notes. Here the <lb/>
            satire turns on the strain of Thracian <lb/>
            blood which he derived from his mother. <lb/>
            The Scholiast tells us that in the Cleo- <lb/>
            phon of Plato, which competed with <lb/>
            the Frogs, she was represented on the <lb/>
            stage speaking broken Greek. See the <lb/>
            remarks on that play in the Introduc- <lb/>
            tion. In this and the three following <lb/>
            lines almost every expression points <lb/>
            to the semi-Thracian origin of Cleophon, <lb/>
            "upon whose double-speaking lips the <lb/>
            Thracian swallow is terribly roaring, as <lb/>
            she sits perched on that barbarian <lb/>
            leafage." The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιλάλοις</foreign> was <lb/>
            formerly taken to mean simply garrulous, <lb/>
            but almost all recent editors consider it <lb/>
            to signify chattering in two dialects (the <lb/>
            Attic and the Thracian) like <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφί- <lb/>
            γλωσσος</foreign>, with which Mr, Green com- <lb/>
            pares it. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάρβαρον πέταλον</foreign> is another <lb/>
            description of the same perch. The <lb/>
            "Thracian swallow" is a very happy <lb/>
            expression. The swallow's song was <lb/>
            always compared to a foreign tongue. <lb/>
            Bergler cites Agamemnon 1013, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig153.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              where the Scholiast says, on <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάρβαρον <lb/>
              τὸ ὄρνεον, διὰ</foreign> TOVTO <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραβάλλει</foreign> TOVTO <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῇ· <lb/>

              Hesychius, s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χελιδόσι·τοὺς βαράρους <lb/>
              χελιδόσιν ἀπεικάζουσι διὰ τὴν ἀσύνθετον <lb/>
              λαλιάν</foreign>. See also the Scholiast on Birds <lb/>
              1680. The epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρῃκία</foreign> was as appro- <lb/>
              priate to the swallow-since it was in <lb/>
              Thrace that Procne and Philomela were <lb/>
              metamorphosed, the one into a swallow <lb/>
              and the other into a nightingale-as <lb/>
              it was apt for the poet's satire upon the <lb/>
              Thracian origin of Cleophon. At the <lb/>
              same time it was far from his intention <lb/>
              to attribute to the demagogue the <lb/>
              musical notes of the swallow, and there- <lb/>
              fore the bird on Cleophon's lips does <lb/>
              not warble but <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινὸν ἐπιβρέται</foreign> (cf. <lb/>
              infra 814), makes aterrible roaring. It</p><pb n="102"/>

          <p>is Cleophon's voice, and not her own, <lb/>
            that issues from the swallow's throat.</p>
          <p>683. à<foreign xml:lang="grc">ηδόνιον</foreign>] It would never occur <lb/>
            to us to couple the swallow's song with <lb/>
            that of the nightingale, but it was <lb/>
            otherwise with the Greeks: with them <lb/>
            the two songs were constantly men- <lb/>
            tioned together. When Apollo first <lb/>
            came to Delphi, sang Alcaeus in the <lb/>
            paean of which Himerius has left us <lb/>
            a paraphrase, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄδουσι μὲν ἀηδόνες αὐτῷ, <lb/>
            ἄδουσιδὲ καὶ χελιδόνες</foreign> (Bergk, Alcaei <lb/>

            which ought to ensure an acquittal. <lb/>
            For this was the great principle laid <lb/>
            down for all time by Athene at the <lb/>
            trial of Orestes before the Athenian <lb/>

            this rule of Athenian judicature are <lb/>
            discussed by C. O. Müller in his Disser- <lb/>
            tations on the Eumenides, Appendix i, <lb/>
            to which may be added Aeschines <lb/>
            against Ctesiphon, 253. It is thought <lb/>
            that some capital charge was impend- <lb/>
            ing over Cleophon at this moment, and <lb/>
            if these words imply that he expected <lb/>
            to be convicted by some illegal pro- <lb/>
            ceeding, his fear was, according to <lb/>
            Lysias, abundantly justified. See the <lb/>

            She pours to her spirits coptent, a nightingale's woful lament, <lb/>
            That e'en though the voting be equal, his ruin will soon be the sequel. <lb/>
            Well it suits the holy Chorus evermore with counsel wise</p>
          <p>a second representation, and the poet <lb/>
            for the glory of receiving, not merely <lb/>
            the usual wreath of ivy, but a special <lb/>
            wreath formed of branches of the <lb/>
            Sacred Olive: the final tribute of the <lb/>
            Imperial City, not to his wit or his <lb/>
            genius, but to the exalted and con- <lb/>
            sistent patriotism which had distin- <lb/>
            guished his entire career. Here he <lb/>
            pleads for sinking all differences in <lb/>
            this hour of peril: for re-enfranchising <lb/>
            all the disfranchised, specially those <lb/>
            citizens of pure Athenian blood who <lb/>
            had incurred the enmity of the demo- <lb/>
            cracy by their connexion with the revolu- <lb/>
            tion of the Four Hundred, and who had <lb/>
            consequently, for the space of several <lb/>
            anxious years, been deprived of all <lb/>
            rights of citizenship. See Lysias, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δήμου <lb/>
            καταλύσεως ἀπολογία</foreign>, § 35. He ascribes <lb/>
            their fall to the wrestling-tricks of <lb/>
            Phrynichus, the Athenian general, the <lb/>
            most zealous promoter of that revolu- <lb/>
            tion ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρέσχε δὲ καὶ φρύνιχος έαυτὸν <lb/>
            πάντων διαφερόντως προθυμότατον ἐς τὴν <lb/>
            ὀλιγαρχίαν</foreign>.-Thuc. viii. 68. On this <lb/>
            account,. and because he was strongly <lb/>
            suspected of twice attempting to betray <lb/>
            his country to the enemy, his memory <lb/>
            was especially obnoxious to the Athenian <lb/>
            people. In the oration of Lysias, For <lb/>
            Polystratus, § 11, it is said that for <lb/>
            purposes of prejudice Polystratus was <lb/>
            alleged to be a kinsman of Phrynichus ; <lb/>
            but this, the speaker declares, was a <lb/>
            calumny (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψευδῆ κατηγόρουν</foreign>) ; he was not <lb/>
            a kinsman, he was merely a fellow <lb/>
            burgher of Phrynichus : and if this is <lb/>
            a crime, it must also be a crime to be <lb/>
            his fellow citizen, as all the Athenians <lb/>
            were. Many, he adds, were led astray <lb/>
            by Phrynichus and Peisander who were <lb/>
            really good and loyal citizens. The <lb/>
            poet's advice, applauded at the moment, <lb/>
            was carried into effect before the year <lb/>
            was over. Immediately after the dis- <lb/>
            aster of Aegospotami, a decree was <lb/>
            passed, on the motion of Patrocleides, <lb/>

            Dionysus. But the Chorus of the Frogs <lb/>
            was invested with special sanctity from <lb/>
            its sacred mystical character. This <lb/>
            vindication of the right and duty of <lb/>
            the sacred Chorus to tender its advice <lb/>
            to the State seems to betray some doubt <lb/>
            and some anxiety on the part of the <lb/>
            poet as to the reception which the</p><pb n="104"/>

            (They, their fathers too before them), these our very kith and kin, <lb/>

            enrolled were not, though their de- <lb/>
            scendants were, to be eligible for the <lb/>
            archonship and certain family priest- <lb/>
            hoods. The slaves who fought at Ar- <lb/>
            ginusae were admitted to the citizen- <lb/>
            ship on the same terms. It would have <lb/>
            been very objectionable for a man who <lb/>
            had himself been an actual slave to <lb/>
            become an archon or a member of one <lb/>

            adverb; and his construction is very <lb/>
            generally followed. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τούτοις</foreign> is <lb/>
            the commonest possible expression for <lb/>
            besides, and had Aristophanes used <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς</foreign> <lb/>
            adverbially, it is incredible that he <lb/>
            should have made an unnecessary am- <lb/>
            biguity by immediately subjoining <foreign xml:lang="grc">τού- <lb/>

            all limit and restriction. "Let us not <lb/>
            reject anybody in the wide world," says <lb/>
            the poet, "who is willing to fight on <lb/>
            our ships, be he kinsman or stranger, <lb/>
            Greek or barbarian, bond or free." He <lb/>
            is now going beyond his plea for re- <lb/>
            enfranchisement, and is arguing for an <lb/>
            extension of the citizenship to all who <lb/>

          <p>718-737. THE ANTEPIRRHEMA. The <lb/>
            presence of a Spartan detachment at <lb/>
            Deceleia had doubtless, as was antici- <lb/>
            pated (Thuc. vi. 91), suspended for <lb/>
            a time the working of the silver mines <lb/>
            of Laureium. Hitherto the Athenian <lb/>
            mint had issued silver only, but when <lb/>
            this <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀργύρου πηγὴ</foreign> was temporarily closed <lb/>
            the Athenians had for the first time to <lb/>
            resort to other devices for obtaining <lb/>
            a supply of coin. In the archonship <lb/>
            of Antigenes, B. c. 407—6 (see the Scho- <lb/>
            liast on 720), certain gold statues of <lb/>
            Victory were sent to the mint, and <lb/>
            coined into money. This was doubtless <lb/>
            a pure gold coinage; the gold on the <lb/>
            statues and offerings had, at the com- <lb/>
            mencement of the war, been reckoned <lb/>
            by Pericles (Thuc. ii. 13) as one of the <lb/>
            chief financial resources of the State, <lb/>
            and all " the gold coins which have <lb/>
            been handed down to us are of ex- <lb/>
            cellent quality."—Head's Preface to the <lb/>
            British Museum Catalogue of Greek <lb/>
            Coins, Attica, &amp;c." But this supply <lb/>
            was insufficient for the commercial <lb/>
            necessities of the Athenian people, and <lb/>
            indeed it would have been impossible <lb/>
            to produce in gold the small change <lb/>
            required for every-day use. Even in <lb/>
            silver the fractions of an obol are <lb/>
            scarcely larger than the little lady-birds <lb/>
            of our gardens. Accordingly in the <lb/>
            following year, B. c. 406-5, in the ar- <lb/>
            chonship of Callias (in the latter half <lb/>
            of whose archonship this play was pro- <lb/>
            duced), a new experiment was tried, <lb/>
            and copper (or, to speak strictly, bronze) <lb/>
            coins were, for the first time, issued <lb/>
            from the Athenian mint. Aristophanes, <lb/>
            in the Antepirrhema, seizes upon the <lb/>
            comparative disuse of their splendid <lb/>
            silver and gold coinage, and the sub- <lb/>
            stitution of this inferior and manu- <lb/>
            factured metal, to lecture the audience <lb/>
            on the unwisdom of their analogous <lb/>
            policy in excluding the educated and <lb/>
            genuine citizens of pure Athenian blood</p><pb n="109"/>
            
          <p>And this the unlucky one knows, <lb/>
            Yet ventures a peace to oppose, <lb/>
            And being addicted to blows he carries a stick as he goes, <lb/>
            Lest while he is tipsy and reeling, some robber his cloak should be stealing. <lb/>
            Often has it crossed my fancy, that the city loves to deal <lb/>
            With the very best and noblest members of her commonweal, <lb/>
            Just as with our ancient coinage, and the newly-minted gold.</p>
          <p>from offices of state, and filling such <lb/>
            offices with alien adventurers, half- <lb/>
            breeds and the like. Strange to say, <lb/>
            the Scholiasts and commentators take <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καινὸν χρυσίον</foreign> of line 720 to be identi- <lb/>
            cal with rots <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηροι̑ς χαλκίοις</foreign> of line <lb/>
            725, and so get themselves into all <lb/>
            manner of difficulties, from which later <lb/>
            commentators endeavour to extricate <lb/>
            themselves by various alterations of the <lb/>
            text. To opxatov <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμισμα</foreign>, the imme- <lb/>
            morial silver coins issued before the <lb/>
            closing of the mines of Laureium, and <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">καινὸν χρυσίον</foreign>, the gold coins issued <lb/>
            after that event, are bracketed together <lb/>
            as two good coinages, the equivalent <lb/>
            of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλοὶ κἀγαθοὶ</foreign> with whom alone <lb/>
            the poet is comparing them. Both are <lb/>
            equally pure, and both are contrasted <lb/>
            with the worthless bronze of Callias. <lb/>
            It is impossible that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοίτοισιν</foreign> of the <lb/>
            following line can pass over the proxi- <lb/>
            mate <foreign xml:lang="grc">καινὸν χρυσίον</foreign> and apply exclu- <lb/>
            sively to the remoter <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαι̑ον νόμισμα</foreign>. <lb/>
            The plural indeed may be defended on <lb/>
            the same grounds as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὰ</foreign>, infra <lb/>
            1466, but it more naturally includes <lb/>
            both the old and the new ; and any- <lb/>
            how the pronoun <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος</foreign> cannot thus be <lb/>
            employed for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκείνος</foreign>. Moreover <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρυσίον</foreign> <lb/>
            is used in line 720 without the slightest <lb/>
            reference to <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλκίοις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">χολκίοις</foreign> in <lb/>
            line 725 without the slightest reference <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρυσίον</foreign>. This bronze coinage seems <lb/>
            to have been called in so soon as the <lb/>
            silver mines were again available, for <lb/>
            Kuster on Eccl. 815 is doubtless right <lb/>
            in supposing this to be the coinage <lb/>
            there mentioned. My best thanks are <lb/>
            due to Mr. G. F. Hill of the British <lb/>
            Museum, to whom I submitted my note, <lb/>
            not only for explaining to me how the <lb/>
            coins in that institution bear upon the <lb/>
            subject, but also for pointing out that <lb/>
            the view which I had adopted merely <lb/>
            -from a consideration of the language of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, had already found favour <lb/>
            with numismatists. It seems to have <lb/>
            been first suggested by Bergk (Philol. <lb/>
            xxxii, s. 131), then to have been adopted <lb/>
            by S. P. Six (Head's Preface, ubi supra), <lb/>
            and finally to have been advocated by <lb/>
            Köhler in the Zeitschrift für Numismat. <lb/>
            for the year 1898. Mr. Head, as we <lb/>
            have seen, affirms that no debased gold <lb/>
            Athenian coins have come down to us, <lb/>
            and Mr. Hill tells me that there are <lb/>
            not, to his knowledge, any bronze <lb/>
            Athenian coins extant which show traces <lb/>
            of gold either as plating, or as alloy. <figure type="illustration">

            the "wood whereon to hang yourself" <lb/>
            has struck a more serious chord, and <lb/>

            Aeacus and Xanthias now return to <lb/>
            the stage in familiar converse; the <lb/>

            agents of their masters, or as jest- <lb/>
            makers for the audience, but as mem- <lb/>
            bers of a distinct class, speaking of <lb/>
            their own feelings, of their own likes <lb/>

            common enough in later Greek comedy, <lb/>

            abruptly Aristophanes turns from the <lb/>
            regular progress of his plot to introduce <lb/>
            the poetical contest, which is quite <lb/>
            irrelevant to it. With equal abrupt- <lb/>
            ness, in 1415 infra, he drops the artistic <lb/>
            question, and returns to the original <lb/>
            purpose of the play. In my opinion, <lb/>
            the idea of this contest had been long <lb/>
            maturing in the poet's mind, and had <lb/>
            probably been completely elaborated, <lb/>
            before the death of Euripides inspired <lb/>
            him with the general plot of the <lb/>
            comedy of the Frogs. On this point, <lb/>
            some remarks will be found in the <lb/>
            Introduction. The Scholiast thinks <lb/>
            that Xanthias was about to question <lb/>
            Aeacus <foreign xml:lang="grc">περί τινος πράγματος δουλικου̑</foreign>, <lb/>
            but being interrupted by the com- <lb/>
            motion within, asks instead what is <lb/>
            the meaning of all this hubbub. And <lb/>
            this view is adopted by Mr. Mitchell <lb/>
            and Mr. Green, but seems to me ex- <lb/>
            ceedingly doubtful. <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note></p><pb n="116"/>

            who, coming from the crafts above, is <lb/>

            speech is Sophocles, whose attitude <lb/>
            towards Aeschylus in the world below <lb/>
            is being contrasted with that of Euri- <lb/>
            pides, of whom they have hitherto been <lb/>
            talking. The strange notion that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">νος</foreign> <lb/>
            must here mean Aeschylus has arisen <lb/>
            from not observing that the speaker is <lb/>
            but carrying on the pronoun appro- <lb/>
            priated to Sophocles at the commence- <lb/>
            ment of the speech : " He, for his part, <lb/>
            saluted Aeschylus, and he, for his part, <lb/>
            resigned all claim to the chair." To <lb/>
            suppose that Aeschylus recognized <lb/>
            Sophocles as his superior is contrary to <lb/>
            the mind of Aristophanes and to the <lb/>
            whole tone and tenor of the play (cf. <lb/>
            infra 1519), while it is impossible to <lb/>
            regard seriously the grotesque sug- <lb/>
            gestion that Aeschylus gave him a <lb/>
            little bit of his chair, so that the two <lb/>
            poets sat at dinner in one chair. <lb/>

            How came not he to claim the tragic chair ?</p>
          <p>AEAC. Claim it? Not he ! When he came down, he kissed <lb/>
            With reverence Aeschylus, and clasped his hand, <lb/>
            And yielded willingly the chair to him. <lb/>
            But now he's going, says Cleidemides, <lb/>
            To sit third-man: and then if Aeschylus win, <lb/>

            probably in his later years the easy <lb/>
            and indolent old man had little com- <lb/>
            munication with the busy outer world : <lb/>
            so that what the Athenians heard of <lb/>
            their great poet came mostly through <lb/>
            the medium of Cleidemides, whom some <lb/>
            call his son, but others, with more <lb/>
            probability (since the name does not <lb/>
            occur in the list of his sons given by <lb/>
            Suidas), the chief actor in his plays. <lb/>
            Aristophanes seizes hold of the poet's <lb/>
            habit of using Cleidemides as his inter- <lb/>
            preter, and transfers it to the world <lb/>

            Bring to the scales and weigh. As to <lb/>
            the derivation of the word, the Scholi- <lb/>
            asts tell a strange story, improbable in <lb/>
            itself, but corroborated, with slight <lb/>
            variation, by all the old grammarians, <lb/>
            Harpocration, Pollux, Hesychius, Pho- <lb/>
            tius, Suidas. When a father brought <lb/>
            his son to be enrolled as a member of <lb/>
            a phratry, he brought also a lamb for <lb/>
            a sacrifice. The lamb was bound to be <lb/>
            of a certain size and weight, and such <lb/>
            parts of it as were not consumed for <lb/>
            the sacrifice were given as a feast for <lb/>
            the members of the phratry. These <lb/>
            gentlemen were therefore very deter- <lb/>
            mined that it should not fall short of <lb/>
            the weight required, and while it was <lb/>
            being weighed, kept shouting, <foreign xml:lang="grc">με</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ον, <lb/>

            Skilled men were hard to find: for with the Athenians <lb/>

            Kock's emendation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΞΑ. πλινθεύσουσι</foreign> <lb/>
            yap ; is universally accepted.</p>
          <p>804. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυρηδόν</foreign>] The word denotes, not <lb/>
            the quality, but the manner of the <lb/>
            glance. It means a glance shot upward <lb/>
            from underneath bended brows. The <lb/>
            name is derived from the circumstance <lb/>
            that a bull about to charge lowers its <lb/>
            head, and cannot therefore look straight <lb/>
            at its adversary without glancing up- <lb/>
            ward from beneath its overhanging <lb/>
            brows. With a bull the glance would, <lb/>
            from the nature of the case, be savage ; <lb/>
            but with a man it may be hostile, <lb/>
            friendly, humorous, or of any other <lb/>
            quality. It was a favourite trick of <lb/>
            Socrates; and in the closing scene of <lb/>
            the Phaedo, when the attendant brings <lb/>
            in the cup of hemlock, Plato mentions <lb/>
            it with the loving tenderness with which <lb/>
            he ever recalls his master's peculiarities. <lb/>
            "He took the cup," he says, " very <lb/>
            cheerfully ; his hand did not shake nor <lb/>
            his colour change, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ', ὥοπερ εἰώθει, <lb/>
            ταυρηδὸν ὑποβλέψας πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον</foreign>, <lb/>
            he asked if he might pour out some <lb/>
            drops as a libation to the gods," The <lb/>
            two participles, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκύψας κάτω</foreign> here and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποβλέψας</foreign> in the Phaedo, embrace the <lb/>
            entire idea conveyed by the adverb <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυρηδόν</foreign>. The glance of Aeschylus was <lb/>
            hostile ; that of Socrates probably <lb/>
            shrewd and humorous; but neither <lb/>
            quality is implied by the adverb. In <lb/>
            Lucian's Philopatris 2, a man in anxious <lb/>
            thought is said <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυρηδὸν ἐπιβλέπειν</foreign>. He <lb/>

            dies of Aeschylus, for no tragic poet <lb/>
            was more successful on the Athenian- <lb/>
            stage than he: but to the misunderstand- <lb/>
            ing, whatever it was, which resulted in <lb/>
            his leaving Athens, and taking up his <lb/>
            abode in Sicily. The cause of this mis- <lb/>
            understanding is uncertain: but most <lb/>
            authorities attribute it to the unplea- <lb/>
            sant position in which Aeschylus found <lb/>
            himself placed by the charge that in <lb/>
            some of his dramas he had too plainly <lb/>
            trenched upon the secrets of the Eleu- <lb/>

              him: "When our talk is of men," <lb/>

            leave the stage and are seen no more. <lb/>
            Whilst the preparations for the next <lb/>
            great scene are proceeding within, the <lb/>
            Chorus deliver four symmetrical stanzas <lb/>
            descriptive of the impending conflict. <lb/>
            Each stanza consists of four lines, the <lb/>
            first two being Homeric hexameters, <lb/>
            purely dactylic, except that in the first <lb/>
            line the first foot, and in the. second <lb/>
            line the fourth foot, is invariably a <lb/>
            spondee. The third line merely omits <lb/>
            the spondee. The fourth is a trochaic <lb/>
            dimeter catalectic. In the first stanza <lb/>
            the two combatants are likened to two <lb/>
            wild boars, preparing for the fray. <lb/>
            Aeschylus is styled <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐριβρεμέτης</foreign>, an epi- <lb/>
            thet which the commentators consider <lb/>
            to be boiTowed from Zeus, but which, <lb/>
            as well as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρίβρομος</foreign>, is applied by Pindar <lb/>
            to the lion (01. x. 21, Isthm. iii. 64), <lb/>
            and is here probably given to the wild <lb/>
            boar in respect of the " short savage <lb/>
            grunt of anger" with which it turns <lb/>
            upon its pursuers. In Bacchylides v. <lb/>
            116 the Calydonian boar is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σῦς <lb/>
            ἐριβρύχας</foreign>, with which compare <foreign xml:lang="grc">βρυχώ- <lb/>
            μενος</foreign> in the third stanza. " Assuredly," <lb/>
            say the Chorus, " will he of the thunder- <lb/>
            voice be full of terrible wrath, when he <lb/>
            sees with a sidelong glance his opponent <lb/>
            whetting his sharp-voiced tusk." <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀξύ- <lb/>
            λαλον</foreign> is contrasted with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐριβρεμέτης</foreign>. <lb/>
            The compound <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορίδῃ</foreign> refers to the side- <lb/>
            long glance and attack of the charging <lb/>
            boar, which Homer (Iliad, xii. 148), in <lb/>
            describing the sally of the two La- <lb/>
            pithae, represents by the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοχμώ</foreign>. <lb/>
            Perhaps I may be allowed to quote <lb/>
            the passage from Mr. Way's noble <lb/>
            version :— <lb/>
            Like unto fierce wild boars that in some lone mountain glen <lb/>
            Unquailing abide the oncoming tumult of hunter and hound : <lb/>
            Forth spring they with sidelong rush, and the saplings crash all round, <lb/>
            Snapped short at the roots, and rings out sharp through the din of the strife <lb/>
            The clash of the tusks, till the darts smite out each monster's life; <lb/>
            Even so on the breasts of the champions rang the brass flame-bright <lb/>
            As the darts rained down, for in dauntless-desperate wise did they fight, &amp;c.</p><pb n="124"/>

              The same metaphor is employed in <lb/>
              Lys. 1256.</p>
          <p>818. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔσταιδ</foreign>' K.T.X.] In the second <lb/>
            stanza the simile of the wild boar is <lb/>
            dropped, though it reappears in the <lb/>
            third. Dobree therefore wished to trans- <lb/>
            pose the second and third stanzas : but <lb/>
            it is more probable that the stanzas <lb/>
            were divided between two semichoruses, <lb/>
            one of whom sang the first and the <lb/>
            third, and the other the second and <lb/>
            the fourth. "Then will be plume- <lb/>
            dancing contests of lofty-crested words " <lb/>
            on the part of Aeschylus, and whirl- <lb/>
            ing of splinters and chiselling of work " <lb/>
            on the part of Euripides, " as the man <lb/>
            in repelling the high-stepping phrases <lb/>
            of the creative-minded hero": <foreign xml:lang="grc">φὼς</foreign> is <lb/>
            good enough for Euripides, the nobler <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὴρ</foreign> is reserved for Aeschylus.</p>
          <p>819. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκινδαλάμων</foreign>] Split straws, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ τῶν <lb/>

            ting subtleties of casuistical argument. <lb/>
            It is employed in exactly the same <lb/>
            sense in Sozomen's Eccl. Hist. i. 18. 2, <lb/>
            and as these subtleties are there attri- <lb/>
            buted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρὶ τεχνίτῃ λάγων</foreign>, the historian <lb/>
            would seem to have been familiar with <lb/>
            the language of Aristophanes. See also <lb/>
            Lucian's " Hesiod," 5, and the Scholiast <lb/>
            there. The Scholiast here explains <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραξόνια</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="grc">κινδυνδη καὶ παράβολα</foreign>, 'repi <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν τροχὸν ἑλκόμενα</foreign>. It seems rather to <lb/>
            mean minute particles thrown off as <lb/>
            the wheel revolves. The quibbles of <lb/>
            Euripides are not even split straws; <lb/>
            they are merely the particles shaken <lb/>
            off them. But perhaps we should adopt <lb/>
            Herwerden's conjecture <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραξόανα</foreign>, scrap- <lb/>
            ings, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξέω. σμιλεύειν</foreign> is to polish or <lb/>
            smooth with a plane or chisel. In the <lb/>
            epigram on Tragedy by Dioscorides, <lb/>
            cited on 1004 infra, Aeschylus is described <lb/>
            as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ μὴ σμιλευτὰ χαράξας Γράμματα</foreign>. The <lb/>
            metaphor was a common one in later <lb/>

              so Dr. Merry explains it. A similar idea <lb/>

            reverts to the wild boar, and like the <lb/>
            first, is descriptive of the action of <lb/>
            Aeschylus. He "uprearing the shaggy- <lb/>

            Euripides, unused to utter such long <lb/>

            Paley translates it " moving along with <lb/>

            "shaking the loose reins of malice"; <lb/>
            Dr. Merry, "shaking loose the reins <lb/>
            of malice"; Dr. Blaydes, "champing <lb/>
            the bit in envy." Possibly it may be <lb/>
            equivalent to our common expression- <lb/>
            " giving a free rein to his envy " ; but <lb/>
            the attack of Aeschylus has been com- <lb/>
            pared to a charge of cavalry, and I am <lb/>
            inclined to think that the curbs are <lb/>
            intended to restrain the onset of the <lb/>

            by subtle refinement and sophistry. <lb/>

            Pluto, represented by a Choregic actor, <lb/>

            (indeed until the poetic contest is over), <lb/>
            and then speaks three lines only. Then <lb/>
            he again relapses into silence whilst the <lb/>
            political catechism is proceeding, after <lb/>
            which he intervenes with three short <lb/>
            remarks, each less than a line. And <lb/>
            see the note on 1479 infra. As the <lb/>
            scene opens, the pert and confident <lb/>
            voice of Euripides is heard in eager <lb/>
            expostulation with Dionysus.</p><figure type="illustration">

            with passion, passionately (cf. infra 856, <lb/>
            9981; Pausanias, iii. 9. 5; Lucian's Jupiter <lb/>

            would be supremely ridiculous to exhort <lb/>
            Aeschylus not to provoke Euripides to <lb/>
            wrath. In the Comedies of Aristophanes, <lb/>
            if not in reality, Euripides had no pas- <lb/>
            sions to be provoked ; he is always <lb/>
            the philosopher-poet of imperturbable <lb/>
            serenity, whose equanimity and self- <lb/>
            complacency nothing can disturb, and <lb/>
            whose argumentative loquacity nothing <lb/>
            can repress. The words which follow <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπλάγχνα θερμήνῃς ΚΟΤΩ</foreign>t are a parody <lb/>

            expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπλάγχνα θερμαίνειν ποτῳ</foreign> may <lb/>
            very well have caught the fancy of <lb/>
            young Athenian tipplers, and passed <lb/>
            into the current phraseology of the day : <lb/>

            what Tennyson called "A Lyrical Mono- <lb/>
            logue " ; and the ill repute of the Cretan <lb/>
            ladies in Hellenic legend had linked to <lb/>
            the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρητικὰς</foreign> the idea of " love- <lb/>
            sick," "incestuous.'' Euripides had <lb/>
            written a play called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρη̃σσατ</foreign>, or The <lb/>
            Cretan Women, and another called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρη̃τες</foreign> or The Cretan Men. Each seems <lb/>
            to have contained a lovesick monody : <lb/>
            the former depicting the incestuous <lb/>
            passion of Aerope, the latter, the un- <lb/>
            natural passion of Pasiphae. Pasiphae <lb/>
            was the mother of Phaedra, who carried <lb/>
            on the Cretan taint, though her inces- <lb/>
            tuous longings are displayed (in the <lb/>
            Hippolytus) not in a monody but in <lb/>
            a Lyrical Dialogue. See the note on <lb/>
            1356 infra. It was from an entire mis- <lb/>
            apprehension of the nature of a Cretan <lb/>
            monody that Fritzsche endeavoured to <lb/>
            connect it with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρητικὰ ύπορχήματα</foreign>a. <lb/>

            mentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews <lb/>
            viii. Here there is a play on the ety- <lb/>

            Τήλεφον</foreign>, words of a somewhat analogous <lb/>
            sound. This is merely for the purpose <lb/>
            of raising another laugh at that unlucky <lb/>
            play, the very mention of which was <lb/>
            always a source of unbounded amuse- <lb/>
            ment to Aristophanes. The story of <lb/>
            the play was as follows. Telephus has <lb/>
            been wounded by the spear of Achilles; <lb/>
            and is informed by an oracle that <lb/>
            nothing will relieve the intolerable <lb/>
            anguish of the wound save that which <lb/>
            caused it. Thereupon he disguises him- <lb/>
            self as a beggar and visits the Argive <lb/>
            leaders. His attire is described with <lb/>
            great minuteness in the Acharnians, <lb/>
            where it is donned by Dicaeopolis, who <lb/>
            wears it through an important scene, and, <lb/>
            with the hero's dress puts on the hero's <lb/>
            unlimited power of speech. Achilles is <lb/>
            playing at dice (infra 1400), but Telephus <lb/>
            gains a hearing by snatching out of his <lb/>
            cradle, and threatening to slay, the infant <lb/>
            Orestes ; somewhat after the fashion of <lb/>
            Dicaeopolis in the Acharnians, and <lb/>
            Mnesilochus in the Thesmophoriazusae. <lb/>
            Ultimately he is cured by the spear of <lb/>
            Achilles, and undertakes, in return, to <lb/>
            guide the Argive host on its journey <lb/>

            Aeacus, for killing their half-brother, <lb/>
            Phocus. It is, no doubt, as Musgrave <lb/>
            observes, to these two tragedies of Euri- <lb/>
            pides that Horace is referring in the <lb/>
            familiar lines- <lb/>
            Telephus et Peleus, cum pauper et exul, uterque <lb/>
            Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba, <lb/>

          <p>A line from the Peleus is reproduced in <lb/>
            Clouds 1154, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βούσομαι τἂρα τὰν ύπέρτονον <lb/>

            field at Choeph. 642. They are probably <lb/>
            the words of the exile clamouring for <lb/>
            admittance into a house where he hopes <lb/>
            for a friendly reception. The Aeolus <lb/>
            was the notorious tragedy which dealt <lb/>

          <p>868. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχὶ συντέθνηκέ μοι</foreign>] We are told <lb/>
            by Athenaeus (viii. 39) that once, when <lb/>
            Aeschylus was unjustly defeated, he <lb/>
            merely remarked, with philosophic com- <lb/>
            posure, that he dedicated his tragedies to <lb/>
            Time, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρόνῳ τὰς τραγῳδίας ἀντιθέναι</foreign>, <lb/>
            well knowing, adds Athenaeus, or the <lb/>
            author from whom he borrows the <lb/>
            anecdote, that he would in the future <lb/>
            obtain his due meed of honour. What <lb/>
            he then anticipated has now come to <lb/>
            pass. Though he himself has passed <lb/>
            into the unseen world, his plays are <lb/>
            still living in the world above. The <lb/>
            Scholiast refers to the well-known fact <lb/>
            that at the date of the Frogs, he was <lb/>
            the only deceased author whose trage- <lb/>
            dies could be acted on the Athenian <lb/>
            stage, a privilege awarded them by <lb/>
            a special decree of the Athenian people. <lb/>
            See also the Greek Life of Aeschylus <lb/>
            and the Scholiast on Ach. 10, Haigb's <lb/>
            Attic Theatre, ii. 7. But of course the <lb/>
            language of the text must not be <lb/>
            limited to this particular privilege. In <lb/>
            a characteristic fragment which has <lb/>
            come down to us from the funeral <lb/>
            oration of Gorgias, the orator, after <lb/>
            setting forth in evenly-balanced periods <lb/>
            the merits of the dead, says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιγαροῦν</foreign>, <figure type="illustration">

            869. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτῳ δὲ συντέθηκεν</foreign>] He means <lb/>
            that the tragedies of Euripides are as <lb/>
            dead as their author, and therefore <lb/>
            both poet and poems are together in <lb/>
            the realm of Hades. But though Aris- <lb/>
            tophanes rightly foretells the immor- <lb/>
            tality of Aeschylus, his satire on Euri- <lb/>
            pides was speedily refuted by the event. <lb/>
            There were no real successors to the <lb/>
            great Triumvirate of Tragedy : and the <lb/>
            plays of all three were, in the follow- <lb/>
            ing century, commonly acted on the <lb/>
            Athenian stage. And ultimately Euri- <lb/>
            pides became the one popular tragedian : <lb/>
            in part, no doubt, because, as he says <lb/>
            himself, he dealt with <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰκι̃α</foreign> ITpaypara, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἲς χρώμεθ', οἲςξύνεσμεν</foreign>. In the Philoc- <lb/>

          <p>a statement which seems reasonable <lb/>
            enough, considering that the speaker <lb/>
            himself had' passed into the unseen <lb/>
            world, and found that his piety and <lb/>
            good works had, to use the scriptural <lb/>
            expression, followed him there. But <lb/>
            Dawes, in his note on this passage of <lb/>
            Aristophanes, altered the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠ γὰρ <lb/>
            εὐσέβεια</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ού</foreign> -yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ηὐσέβεια</foreign>, a change <lb/>
            which, I should have thought, would <lb/>
            require the following line to commence <lb/>
            with a negative instead of with <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign>, but <lb/>

            mere victory that the poets seek. <lb/>
            Aeschylus, indeed, does not ask for <lb/>

            Demeter's high and holy mysteries. <lb/>

          <p>910. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρμνίχῳ</foreign>] The tragedies of Phry- <lb/>
            nichus were of an essentially lyrical <lb/>
            character. Nothing could surpass, in <lb/>
            the estimation of his contemporaries, <lb/>
            the sweetness of his melodies, and the <lb/>
            infinite variety of his dance-music. But <lb/>
            there could be little dramatic vigour, <lb/>
            when the entire business of the play <lb/>
            was supported by the Chorus and a <lb/>
            single actor : a state of things which <lb/>
            continued until Aeschylus introduced <lb/>

            Achilles was introduced, wrapped in <lb/>
            sullen gloom for the loss of Patroclus, <lb/>
            and refusing all food and consolation. <lb/>
            See the Greek Life of Aeschylus. In <lb/>
            the latter, Niobe was shown, dumb with <lb/>
            sorrow for her six sons and six daugh- <lb/>
            ters, whom Apollo and Artemis had <lb/>
            slain. In her maternal pride, she had <lb/>

            however, be remembered (1) that the <lb/>
            development of the tragic play con- <lb/>
            sisted chiefly of a progressive diminu- <lb/>

            equivalent enlargement of the actors' <lb/>

            So when he had humbugged thus awhile, and now his wretched play <lb/>

            at his rival's accusations. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκορδινα̑σθαι</foreign> <lb/>

            by ancient writers, Plato, Aristotle, and <lb/>
            the later Attic comedians. Its memory <lb/>

              I think that Euripides is here referring <lb/>

          <p>943. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ βιβλίων</foreign>] Euripides possessed <lb/>
            one of the largest libraries in the <lb/>
            ancient world (Athenaeus, i. 4) : and <lb/>
            out of his stores of book-learning he <lb/>
            was able to extract philosophic and <lb/>
            casuistical arguments which, the innu- <lb/>
            endo is, he placed in the mouths of his <lb/>
            various characters, so departing from <lb/>
            the simple dignity of ancient tragedy. <lb/>
            For though Euripides is himself the</p><pb n="145"/>
            
          <p>And next a dose of chatter juice, distilled from books, I gave her, <lb/>
            And monodies she took, with sharp Cephisophon for flavour. <lb/>
            I never used haphazard words, or plunged abruptly in ; <lb/>
            Who entered first explained at large the drama's origin <lb/>
            And source. DIO. Its source, I really trust, was better than your own.</p>
          <p>EUR. Then from the very opening lines no idleness was shown; <lb/>
            The mistress talked with all her might, the servant talked as much, <lb/>
            The master talked, the maiden talked, the beldame talked. AESCH. For such <lb/>
            An outrage was not death your due ? EUE. No, by Apollo, no : <lb/>
            That was my democratic way. Dio. Ah, let that topic go. <lb/>
            Your record is not there, my friend, particularly good.</p>
          <p>speaker, he is of course, here and else- <lb/>
            where, merely giving effect to the <lb/>
            criticisms of Aristophanes, directed <lb/>
            against himself.</p>
          <p>944. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΚηΦισοΦω̑ντα μιγνύς</foreign>] With an <lb/>
            infusion of Cephisophon. Cephisophon <lb/>
            seems to have been a slave born in the <lb/>
            house of Euripides ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκογενὲς μειράκιον</foreign>, <lb/>
            as he is called in the Greek Life of <lb/>
            Euripides published by Rossignol in the <lb/>
            Journal des Savans, Avril, 1832. His <lb/>
            cleverness attracted the attention of his <lb/>
            master, and he was popularly credited <lb/>
            with having a hand in the composition <lb/>
            of his master's tragedies. The author <lb/>
            of the Greek Life referred to above <lb/>
            preserves some lines of Aristophanes— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig219.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>We may perhaps gather from the present <lb/>
            passage that he was supposed to have <lb/>
            contributed some of those famous <lb/>
            Euripidean monodies of which we have <lb/>
            already heard, supra 849, and shall <lb/>
            hear more hereafter. How universal <lb/>
            was the belief in his collaboration is <lb/>
            shown by the incidental way in which <lb/>
            his name is introduced, without the <lb/>
            slightest explanation. And see infra <lb/>
            1408, 1452, 1453. Others say, and this <lb/>
            also is probable enough, that he took <lb/>
            part in the representation of his master's <lb/>
            dramas. One of the five extant letters <lb/>
            attributed to Euripides is addressed to <lb/>
            Cephisophon, announcing the writer's <lb/>
            arrival at the Court of Archelaus, and, <lb/>
            amongst other things, expressing his <lb/>
            indifference to the criticism of Aris- <lb/>
            tophanes. But the letter is no doubt <lb/>
            spurious.</p>
          <p>946. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐξιών</foreign>] That is, the Prologist. <lb/>
            The TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαυτου̑</foreign> in the next line is of <lb/>
            course another allusion to the maternal <lb/>
            greengrocer.</p>

          <p>used adverbially, as frequently in Aris- <lb/>
            tophanes, or for <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάλλιστΟν</foreign>, as Euripides <lb/>
            employs it in Troades 1282, where <lb/>
            Hecabe says: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig221.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Either way, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίπατος</foreign> of the MSS. <lb/>
              and Edd. seems impossible, and I have <lb/>
              substituted <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιπατεῖν</foreign>. " This is not the <lb/>
              best of themes for you, of all men, to <lb/>
              expatiate upon." He is alluding to the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιπάτοις</foreign> of 942 supra. The line in <lb/>
              the translation is rather an explanation <lb/>
              than a version. Dionysus is of course <lb/>
              referring generally to the antidemo- <lb/>
              cratical tendencies of the school to <lb/>
              which Euripides belonged. His pupils <lb/>
              mentioned below, Theramenes and Olei- <lb/>
              tophon, were both active promoters of <lb/>
              the establishment of the Four Hundred. <lb/>
              Theramenes is indeed described by both <lb/>
              Thucydides and Aristotle (widely as <lb/>
              they differ in details) as the prime <lb/>
              agent of that antidemocratic revolution. <lb/>
              —Thuc. viii. 68 ; Polity of Athens, 32. <lb/>
              And though Cleitophon afterwards pro- <lb/>
              posed to restore the constitution of <lb/>
              Cleisthenes, he did so on the express <lb/>
              ground that it was not democratic.- <lb/>
              Polity of Athens, 34. Euripides him- <lb/>
              self, as Hermann observes, had left <lb/>
              democratic Athens, and spent his last <lb/>
              years in the Court of King Archelaus <lb/>
              of Macedon.</p>
          <p>954. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτουσί</foreign>] He glances at the <lb/>
            audience as he speaks. For of course <lb/>
            it is to the audience that he is referring <lb/>
            as well by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτουσὶ</foreign> here as by <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτοι</foreign> six <lb/>
            lines below.</p>
          <p>956. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσβολὰς ... γωνιασμούς</foreign>] These <lb/>
            accusatives are governed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε'δίδαξα</foreign>, and <lb/>
            not, as Fritzsche supposed, by <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαλεῖν</foreign>. <lb/>
            I taught the Athenians to talk: I also <lb/>
            taught them the application of subtle rules, <lb/>
            and the neat carpentry of words. No <lb/>
            doubt the accusatives occur somewhat <lb/>
            strangely in the midst of a string of <lb/>

            By Cycnuses or Memnons clad in terrible array, <lb/>
            With bells upon their horses' heads, the audience to dismay. <lb/>
            Look at his pupils, look at mine: and there the contrast view. <lb/>
            Uncouth Megaenetus is his, and rough Phormisius too;</p>
          <p>seems descriptive rather of the refine- <lb/>
            ments which Euripides had introduced <lb/>
            into the tragic art, than of the subtle- <lb/>
            ties which he had taught the Athenian <lb/>
            people. Very possibly it is interpolated <lb/>
            from some other passage. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσβολαὶ</foreign> here, <lb/>
            as infra '1104, involves the idea of <lb/>
            attacks or incursions. He attacks, with <lb/>
            his new rules of art, the rudeness of <lb/>
            ancient tragedy. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνιασμοὺς</foreign>, like <foreign xml:lang="grc">σμιλεύ- <lb/>
            ματα</foreign>, supra 819, is a metaphor from the <lb/>
            carpenter's art. There Euripides is <lb/>
            described as finishing off his work with <lb/>
            a chisel: here, as employing the car- <lb/>
            penter's angle, or, as we less correctly <lb/>
            designate it, his square.</p>

            son of Poseidon, and Memnon the son <lb/>
            of the Morning, were allies of Priam in <lb/>
            the Trojan war, coming, like Rhesus, <lb/>
            in the splendour of barbaric trappings, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλοῖσι σὺν κώδωσιν</foreign>. Both of them <lb/>
            had the honour of falling by the hand <lb/>
            of Achilles. We do not know in which <lb/>
            of his tragedies Aeschylus introduced <lb/>
            Cycnus : but Memnon was represented <lb/>
            in two tragedies, the Memnon and the <lb/>
            Psychostasia. For though Welcker <lb/>
            thinks that these were two names of <lb/>
            one and the same tragedy, Hermann <lb/>
            and Wagner are no doubt right in <lb/>
            considering them the names of two suc- <lb/>
            cessive tragedies in the same trilogy. <lb/>
            In the Psychostasia (as we know from <lb/>
            Eustathius on Iliad, viii. 73, and other <lb/>
            authorities) the lives of Achilles and <lb/>
            Memnon are weighed by Zeus in those <lb/>
            golden balances which are more than <lb/>
            once brought forward in the Iliad to <lb/>
            decide the fate of heroes. In such com- <lb/>
            pounds as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωδωνοφαλαροπώλουςΕ</foreign>uripides <lb/>

          <p>the following year, immediately after <lb/>
            the surrender of Athens, we find this <lb/>
            typical disciple of Aeschylus associated <lb/>
            with the two typical disciples of Euri- <lb/>
            pides mentioned just below, in an <lb/>
            endeavour to restore the ancient constitu- <lb/>
            tion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν πάτρτον πολιτείαν</foreign>, of Athens, <lb/>
            in a moderate and equitable form.- <lb/>
            Aristotle's Polity of Athens, chap. 34. A <lb/>
            little later, after the downfall of the <lb/>
            Thirty, we find him proposing to re- <lb/>
            strict the franchise to persons holding <lb/>
            land, and assailed on that account by <lb/>
            Lysias in a speech still extant, for <lb/>
            attempting to destroy <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν πάτριον πολι- <lb/>
            τείαν</foreign>. Not that this implies any incon- <lb/>
            sistency on the part of Phormisiu s. The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάτριος πολιτεία</foreign> which the Athenians <lb/>
            were permitted to restore, was susceptible <lb/>
            of more than one interpretation (Polity <lb/>
            of Athens, ubi supra). To Phormisius <lb/>
            it doubtless meant the old Solonian <lb/>
            constitution; in the speech of Lysias <lb/>
            it represents the unbridled democracy <lb/>
            which preceded and occasioned the fall <lb/>
            of Athens. Here the allusion is partly <lb/>
            to his rough hirsute appearance. See <lb/>
            the note on Eccl. 97. Of Megaenetus <lb/>
            and his nickname <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ Μανῆς</foreign>, nothing is <lb/>
            known. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μανῆς</foreign> was a common servile <lb/>
            name, and occurs as such in the Peace, <lb/>
            the Birds, and the Lysistrata. And some <lb/>
            think that Megaenetus was so called <lb/>
            because of his (supposed) barbarian <lb/>
            extraction. More probably it was de- <lb/>
            rived from his constant presence at the <lb/>
            game of cottabus, where the little <lb/>
            statuette with which the game was <lb/>
            played, was called the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μανῆς</foreign> or "Jack." <lb/>
            See the note on Peace 1244. Athenaeus <lb/>
            quotes many passages from the comic <lb/>
            poets relating to this Manes. One is <lb/>
            from Hermippus describing the changes <lb/>
            consequent on the departure of citizens <lb/>
            for the way <lb/>
            The rod for the cottabus used of yore <lb/>
            Is now in the dustbin thrown, <lb/>
            The small bronze Manes will hear no more <lb/>
            The plash of the wine which it heard before, <lb/>
            And I saw the tiny and well-poised plate <lb/>
            Forlorn by the hinge of the garden gate <lb/>
            In the refuse and dirt, alone.</p>
          <p>And again: <lb/>

          <p>the second, the latter part <foreign xml:lang="grc">πιτυοκάμπται</foreign> <lb/>
            carries us back to the legendary robber <lb/>
            Sinis, who tied his victims to two pine- <lb/>
            trees which he had bound together, and <lb/>
            which, when let go, tare them limb <lb/>
            from limb by the rebound. Theseus, on <lb/>
            his journey from Tro'ezene to Athens, <lb/>
            made Sinis himself undergo the cruel <lb/>
            death he had loved to inflict upon <lb/>
            others. The prefix <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαρκασμο</foreign>- refers to <lb/>
            this rending of flesh." The secondary <lb/>
            meaning which some would give it ama- <lb/>
            rulento risu Sinidem referentes (Brunck) <lb/>
            has really nothing to recommend it.</p>
          <p>967. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλειτοφῶν ... θηραμένης</foreign>] Of <lb/>
            Theramenes we have already heard, <lb/>
            supra 541. Cleitophon is twice named <lb/>
            in the Polity of Athens as a well-known <lb/>
            politician of these days. One instance <lb/>
            (from chap. 34) is given in the preceding <lb/>
            note ; and he had previously, in chap. <lb/>
            29, been mentioned as taking an active <lb/>
            part in the proceedings which resulted <lb/>
            in the establishment of the Four <lb/>
            Hundred. See the note on 953 supra. <lb/>
            He was doubtless the philosophic stu- <lb/>
            dent who, in the remarkable Platonic <lb/>
            dialogue which bears his name, displays <lb/>
            such a keen appreciation of the sterility <lb/>
            of the Socratic method, and shows <lb/>
            himself determined to obtain some more <lb/>
            definite teaching, even if, to obtain it, <lb/>
            he has to go over to Thrasymachus. <lb/>
            There is much probability in Mr. Grote's <lb/>
            suggestion (Plato, chap. 32) that the <lb/>
            Cleitophon was originally designed as <lb/>
            the introduction to the great con- <lb/>
            structive discourse on Justice which we <lb/>
            know as the Republic of Plato, but was <lb/>
            eventually discarded for the present first <lb/>
            book in which the same characters <lb/>
            appear, but which does not so con- <lb/>
            vincingly expose the necessary barren- <lb/>
            ness of the negative method of Socratic <lb/>
            criticism.</p>
          <p>969. <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιπέοῃ</foreign>] The translation does <lb/>
            not reproduce the exact meaning of <lb/>
            the original. In this passage <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακοῖς περι- <lb/>
            πίπτειν</foreign> means, not to fall into troubles, <lb/>
            but to fall into the midst of, so as to <lb/>
            be encompassed by, troubles. Then the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλησίον παραστῇ</foreign> carry us a step <lb/>
            further. Theramenes is close to, and on <lb/>
            the very verge of falling into, troubles, <lb/>
            when by an acrobatic feat he contrives <lb/>
            to fall outside them, leaving his adver- <lb/>
            saries to fall in. The allusion, no doubt, <lb/>
            is to the shocking events which followed <lb/>
            the battle of Arginusae. The victorious <lb/>
            generals complained of his neglect to <lb/>
            pick up the dead and drowning (Xen. <lb/>
            Hell., ii. 3. 35), and he was in great <lb/>
            peril, but by a fatal exercise of in- <lb/>
            genuity, he wriggled outside the peril <lb/>
            and pushed the generals in.</p><pb n="150"/>

            some critics, both ancient and modern, <lb/>

            arisen merely from a faulty interpreta- <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μαμμάκυθος</foreign> was also the name of a real <lb/>
              person, but it is only a vulgar nickname <lb/>
              for a babyish fool, like <foreign xml:lang="grc">βλιτομάμμας</foreign> in <lb/>
              Clouds 1001, and our "mammy-suck" <lb/>
              or "molly-coddle." It gave its name <lb/>
              to a play of Metagenes or (some say) <lb/>
              Plato Comicus. Here it is an adjective, <lb/>
              " doltish Melitideses," and so the gram- <lb/>
              marians mostly take it. The Scholiast <lb/>

            the Scholiast tells us, is the first line <lb/>
            of the Myrmidons of Aeschylus. It is <lb/>
            apparently spoken by the Myrmidon <lb/>
            Chorus, appealing to their chieftain to <lb/>
            lead them forth to the battle. The <lb/>
            "things which Achilles beheld" were <lb/>
            the utter discomfiture of the Greeks, <lb/>
            and the victorious pursuit of the Tro- <lb/>

            ships were lying. The actual incident <lb/>

            in which the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξουθὸς ίππαλεκτρυὼν</foreign> (supra <lb/>
            932) played so distinguished a part, <lb/>
            was doubtless related by a messenger <lb/>
            later on. Harpocration (s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προπεπω. <lb/>
            κότες</foreign>)adds two more lines, which, how- <lb/>
            ever, do not form a complete sentence, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοριλυμάντους Δαναῶν μόχθους οῦς εἴσω <lb/>
            κλισίας</foreign>. But as Harpocration is quoting <lb/>

            Come, tell me what are the points for which a noble poet our praise obtains. <lb/>
            For his ready wit, and his counsels sage, and because the citizen folk he trains <lb/>
            To be better townsmen and worthier men. AESCH. If then you have done the very reverse, <lb/>
            Found noble-hearted and virtuous men, and altered them, each and all, for the worse, <lb/>
            Pray what is the meed you deserve to get ? Dio. Nay, ask not him. He deserves to die. <lb/>
            H. For just consider what style of men he received from me, great six-foot-high <lb/>
            Heroical souls, who never would blench from a townsman's duties in peace or war; <lb/>

          <p>Hal., Comp. Verb. c. 22."—Tragic Drama <lb/>
            of the Greeks, ii. 5.</p>
          <p>1005. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τραγικὰν λῆραν</foreign>] We may con- <lb/>
            jecture that tragic poets had spoken <lb/>
            with contempt of comedy as mere <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τρυγικὸν λῆρον</foreign>, and that this is the retort <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν τρυγῳδῶν</foreign>. And possibly this is the <lb/>
            meaning of the Scholiast's comment, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅτιἀλλήλαυς διαβάλλουσικωμικαὶκαὶ τρα- <lb/>

          <p>1009. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βελτίους</foreign>] In this proposition the <lb/>
            two poets could readily agree ; but as <lb/>
            to what constituted " better citizens " <lb/>
            their opinions would be widely at <lb/>
            variance. The ideal of a good citizen <lb/>
            was, to Aeschylus, the valiant, noble- <lb/>
            minded, and generous Athenian of the <lb/>
            Persian wars ; to Euripides, the shrewd, <lb/>
            quick-witted, and inquisitive Athenian <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesian War.</p>
          <p>1012. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεθνάναι</foreign>] In 177 supra, the joke <lb/>
            consisted in a dead man dooming him- <lb/>
            self to life, just as a living man might <lb/>
            doom himself to death. Here we have <lb/>
            the opposite joke, which consists in <lb/>
            dooming to death a man already dead : <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γελοίαυ χάριν εἶπεν</foreign>, says the Scholiast, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤδη γὰρ ἀπέθανε</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1014. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετραπήχεις</foreign>] The word, like our <lb/>
            epithet " tall" in Shakespeare's time, <lb/>
            refers in this passage not so much to <lb/>
            physical stature as to a stout and <lb/>
            soldierly spirit. In Wasps 553 it re- <lb/>
            fers chiefly to the social importance of <lb/>
            the persons so described. With <foreign xml:lang="grc">δια- <lb/>

            vii. 220-266), and always in reference <lb/>
            to the mighty shield of Aias, which <lb/>
            was formed of seven folds of tough <lb/>
            bull-hide, with one plate of bronze <lb/>
            superadded. But what Aeschylus wants <lb/>
            is not so much the strong unyielding <lb/>
            shield as the strong unyielding spirit.</p>

          <p>1023. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεπαιήκας</foreign>] At first sight we <lb/>
            should certainly be disposed to inter- <lb/>
            pret this (with Brunck and others), <lb/>
            "You represented the Thebans as the <lb/>
            better soldiers," that is, "as the victors <lb/>
            over their Seven opponents." But both <lb/>
            the change of tense (from the aorist to <lb/>
            the perfect) and the reply of Aeschylus <lb/>
            show that this is not the true inter- <lb/>
            pretation, and that Dionysus really <lb/>
            meant that the effect of that play was <lb/>
            to awaken new military ardour in the <lb/>
            hearts of the Thebans, and to make <lb/>
            them better warriors than they had <lb/>
            previously been. And in truth the <lb/>
            interruption of Dionysus would, on <lb/>
            Brunck's interpretation, be altogether <lb/>
            pointless: since the defeat of the <lb/>
            Septem was not an invention of Aes- <lb/>
            chylus, but ancient history, well known <lb/>
            in Homer's day nor were the Athe- <lb/>
            nians interested more in the invaders <lb/>
            than in the defenders of Thebes.</p>
          <p>1024. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπτου</foreign>] He suits the action to <lb/>
            the word, and administers a gentle tap <lb/>
            to Aeschylus. In the next line aura is <lb/>
            rightly explained by the Scholiast to <lb/>
            mean <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ πολεμικά</foreign>. <figure type="illustration">

            He'll stun me, I know, with his armoury-work; this business is going from bad to worse. <lb/>
            And how did you manage to make them so grand, exalted, and brave with your wonderful verse? <lb/>
            Come, Aeschylus, answer, and don't stand mute in your self-willed pride and arrogant spleen. <lb/>
            A drama I wrote with the War-god filled. DI. Its name ? AE. 'Tis the " Seven against Thebes " that I mean. <lb/>
            Which whoso beheld, with eagerness swelled to rush to the battlefield there and then. <lb/>
            0 that was a scandalous thing you did ! You have made the Thebans mightier men, <lb/>
            More eager by far for the business of war. Now, therefore, receive this punch on the head. <lb/>
            Ah, ye might have practised the same yourselves, but ye turned to other pursuits instead. <lb/>
            Then next the " Persians " I wrote, in praise of the noblest deed that the world can show, <lb/>
            And each man longed for the victors wreath, to fight and to vanquish his country's foe. <lb/>
            I was pleased, I own, when I heard their moan for old Darius, their great king, dead ;</p>
          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶπεν</foreign>.—Scholiast. This is confirmed by <lb/>
            the arguments of the plays. The <lb/>
            Persae was acted B.C. 472 ; the Septem, <lb/>
            B.C. 467.</p>
          <p>1028. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν θρῆνον ἀκούσας</foreign>] I have sub- <lb/>
            stituted these words for the unmetrical <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡνίκ' ἤκουσα</foreign> of the MSS., which (as <lb/>
            others also have observed) is most prob- <lb/>
            ably a gloss on, and has taken the place <lb/>
            of, the participle <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκούσας</foreign>. But then the <lb/>
            question arises, What was it that Diony- <lb/>
            sus rejoiced to hear ? He identifies <lb/>
            it in the following line with the Choral <lb/>
            cry <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῖαυοῖ</foreign>. Now, in the lamentable in- <lb/>
            vocation addressed to the dead Darius <lb/>
            (Persae 625-676), we find a refrain <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βόσκε πάτερ ἄκακε 'Δαρειὰν, οἶ</foreign>.Bp. Blom- <lb/>
            field changes <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δαρειὰν, οἶι</foreign>nto <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δαρεῖ</foreign>' <lb/>
            lavol, a change which is approved by <lb/>
            Dobree and Fritzsche, and is probably <lb/>
            right. And anyhow Dionysus appears <lb/>
            to be referring to that particular ode. <lb/>
            But that ode is a <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρῆνος</foreign>, and is indeed <lb/>
            so called by-the kingly ghost, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίμεῖς</foreign> <lb/>
            8i <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρηνεῖτ' ἐγγὺς ἑστῶτες τάφοι</foreign>', Persae <lb/>
            682. It is, in truth, a <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρῆνος περὶ <lb/>
            Δαρείου τεθνεῶτος</foreign>. By inserting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόν <lb/>
            θρῆνον</foreign> therefore in the line before us, <lb/>
            we satisfy at once the sense, the metre, <lb/>
            and the reference to the Persae. Diony- <lb/>
            sus was delighted with the wild Eastern <lb/>
            coronach which Aeschylus had brought <lb/>
            on the Athenian stage. The only other <lb/>
            readings worthy of mention are (1) the <lb/>
            introduction from one or two very in- <lb/>
            ferior MSS. of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡνίκ' ἀπηγγέλθη</foreign>, to which <lb/>
            nothing in the Persae answers : and <lb/>
            which is rightly styled by Fritzsche "con- <lb/>
            iectura audacissima et infelicissima' <lb/>
            of some grammarian : and (2) Fritzsche's <lb/>
            own <foreign xml:lang="grc">νικῆσοι ὰκούσαςο</foreign>r <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇ νίκῃ ἀκούσας</foreign>, to <lb/>
            which the same objection applies, which <lb/>
            requires the further alteration of <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign>, and depends on the resem- <lb/>
            blance of <foreign xml:lang="grc">νικη</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡνίκα</foreign>, although <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡνίκα</foreign> <lb/>
            has already been accounted for in the <lb/>

            of the human race, Homer and Hesiod <lb/>
            are as familiar to us now as they were <lb/>
            to the Athenians 2300 years ago. The <lb/>
            other two, Orpheus and Musaeus, whose <lb/>
            names are usually coupled together, are <lb/>
            wellnigh lost in the mists of antiquity. <lb/>

            all authorities attributed to Orpheus, <lb/>

          <p>When they smote together their hands, like this, and Evir alake the Chorus said. <lb/>
            Aye, such are the poet's appropriate works: and just consider how all along <lb/>
            From the very first they have wrought you good, the noble bards, the masters of song. <lb/>
            First, Orpheus taught you religious rites, and from bloody murder to stay your hands: <lb/>
            Musaeus healing and oracle lore ; and Hesiod all the culture of lands, <lb/>
            The time to gather, the time to plough. And gat not Homer his glory divine <lb/>
            By singing of valour, and honour, and right, and the sheen of the battle-extended line, <lb/>
            The ranging of troops and the arming of men ? Dio. 0 ay, but he didn't teach that, I opine, <lb/>
            To Pantacles; when he was leading the show I couldn't imagine what he was at, <lb/>
            He had fastened his helm on the top of his head, he was trying to fasten his plume upon that. <lb/>
            But others, many and brave, he taught, of whom was Lamachus, hero true; <lb/>
            And thence my spirit the impress took, and many a lion-heart chief I drew,</p>
          <p>Doubtless he restrained men from <lb/>
            murder by excluding murderers from <lb/>
            his sacred rites. Eustathius seems to <lb/>
            think that the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">άκέσειςνύσν</foreign> are <lb/>
            the title of a medical poem composed <lb/>
            by Musaeus (see the Preface to his <lb/>
            Commentary on the Iliad) : and cer- <lb/>
            tainly some prescriptions ascribed to <lb/>
            Musaeus were known to Pliny (N. H., <lb/>
            xxi. 21). Several of the foregoing <lb/>
            passages have been already cited by <lb/>

            The speaker is referring to an incident <lb/>
            which mightily amused the Athenian <lb/>

            it is well known from Mr. William <lb/>

            nounced to her husband, after the <lb/>
            fashion of Potiphar's wife (see Scholiast <lb/>

            innocent youth who had repelled her <lb/>
            advances. And finally each of them, <lb/>

            To stretch themselves to their measure and height, whenever the trumpet of war they hear. <lb/>
            But Phaedras and Stheneboeas? No ! no harlotry business deformed my plays. <lb/>
            And npne can say that ever I drew a love-sick woman in all my days. <lb/>
            For you no lot or portion had got in Queen Aphrodite. AES. Thank Heaven for that. <lb/>
            But ever on you and yours, my friend, the mighty goddess mightily sat ; <lb/>
            Yourself she cast to the ground at last. Dio. 0 ay, that came uncommonly pat. <lb/>
            You showed how cuckolds are made, and 10, you were struck yourself by the very same fate <lb/>
            But say, you cross-grained censor of mine, how my Stheneboeas could harm the state. <lb/>
            Full many a noble dame, the wife of a noble citizen, hemlock took, <lb/>
            And died, unable the shame and sin of your Bellerophon-scenes to brook. <lb/>
            Was then, I wonder, the tale I told of Phaedra's passionate love untrue ? <lb/>
            Not so: but tales of incestuous vice the sacred poet should hide from view, <lb/>
            Nor ever exhibit and blazon forth on the public stage to the public ken.</p>
          <p>Aeschylus, considering the leading part <lb/>
            which the adulteress Clytaemnestra takes <lb/>

            more reason to be amazed at this state- <lb/>
            ment of Spanheim. The Agamemnon <lb/>
            of Aeschylus depends upon the fact of <lb/>
            the guilty passion of Clytaemnestra, just <lb/>
            as, and no more than, the Iliad of <lb/>
            Homer depends upon the fact of the <lb/>
            guilty passion of her sister Helen. But <lb/>
            neither in the tragedy nor in the epic <lb/>
            is there any portrayal of the guilty <lb/>
            passion itself, or any analysis or descrip- <lb/>

            and Commentators supply specimens' of <lb/>
            the characters to which Aeschylus is <lb/>
            taking objection. The nurse in the <lb/>
            Hippolytus is a sufficient example of <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαγωγός</foreign>. We know from Clemens <lb/>
            Alexandrinus (Strom. vii. 4. 23) that <lb/>
            Aage, in the tragedy called by her <lb/>
            name, not only gave birth to a child <lb/>
            (Telephus) in Athene's temple, but, on <lb/>
            Athene's expressing her indignation at <lb/>
            such conduct, entered into a truly <lb/>
            Euripidean argument to convince the <lb/>
            goddess that her anger was illogical, <lb/>
            Aristophanes had already, in Clouds <lb/>
            1372, denounced the portrayal, in the <lb/>
            Aeolus, of the incestuous loves of Ma- <lb/>
            careus and Canace, the children of <lb/>
            Aeolus. And cf. supra 850, 863, and <lb/>
            infra 1475, and the notes there. And <lb/>
            as to the suggestion that Life is <lb/>

          <p>1083. <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκ τούτων</foreign>] And hence it is, says <lb/>
            Aeschylus, that the city is full of under- <lb/>
            clerks and demagogue-buffoons who are <lb/>
            always deceiving the people. The latter <lb/>
            words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">έξαπατώντων τὸν δη̑μον άεὶ</foreign>, apply <lb/>
            to both classes alike. And, by omitting <lb/>
            them, Meineke has struck out the <lb/>
            only ground which Aristophanes gives <lb/>
            for objecting to these <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπογραμαμματὶς</foreign>. <lb/>
            Euripides is accused, not of merely <lb/>
            filling the city with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ιπογραμματϊς</foreign> (who <lb/>
            in their place might be useful enough), <lb/>
            but of filling it with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπογραμματεϊς</foreign> who, <lb/>
            presuming on the argumentative clever- <lb/>
            ness which he had taught them, in- <lb/>
            truded themselves into the public dis- <lb/>
            cussions, and so were for ever deceiving <lb/>
            the people. By the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπογραμματει̑ς</foreign> <lb/>
            we are not to understand the holders <lb/>
            of any particular office: they were <lb/>
            under-clerks of any description, who, <lb/>
            as Dr. Holden truly remarks, were <lb/>
            amongst the lowest and most despised <lb/>
            of the citizens. Dr. Holden very appro- <lb/>
            priately cites Lysias against Nicomachus, <lb/>
            37, "Our forefathers selected men <lb/>
            such as Solon and Themistocles and <lb/>
            Pericles to make their laws; but ye <lb/>

            And others opine <lb/>

            And therefore our city is swarming to-day <lb/>
            With clerks and with demagogue-monkeys, who play <lb/>
            Their jackanape tricks at all times, in all places, <lb/>
            Deluding the people of Athens; but none <lb/>

            are the words of a comic poet: but the <lb/>
            self-same language is held by both <lb/>
            Xenophon and Aristotle about the events <lb/>
            of this troubled period. The condemna- <lb/>
            tion of the victorious generals after <lb/>
            Arginusae is in the Polity of Athens, <lb/>
            chap. 34, ascribed to this trickery, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαπατηθένος ταῦ δήμου διὰ τοὺς παροργί- <lb/>
            σαντας</foreign>. And Xenophon (Hellenics, i. <lb/>
            7. 39) says that before long the <lb/>
            Athenians repented of this terrible act, <lb/>
            and resolved to prosecute the men who <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰν δῆμαν ἐξηπάτησαν</foreign>. So the people <lb/>

          <p>1087. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμπάδα... Φέρειν</foreign>] From want of <lb/>
            athletic training nobody is able any longer <lb/>
            now to carry the torch in the races. The <lb/>
            allusion is to the torchrace, A <foreign xml:lang="grc">αμπαδηΦορία</foreign>, <lb/>
            in the special form which it assumed <lb/>
            at the Panathenaea, and probably at <lb/>
            some other festivals. The course, com- <lb/>
            mencing, as Pausanius tells us (Attica, <lb/>
            xxx. 2), from the altar of Prometheus, <lb/>
            situated in that part of the outer <lb/>
            Cerameicus which afterwards became <lb/>
            so famous under the name of the <lb/>
            Academy, passed through the Thriasian <lb/>
            gates (otherwise called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ Δίπυλον</foreign>) and <lb/>
            on to the Acropolis of Athens. Each <lb/>
            runner carried a flaming torch, and the <lb/>
            race was won, not necessarily by the <lb/>
            man who arrived first at the goal, but <lb/>
            by him who was the first to arrive with <lb/>
            his torch unextinguished. The Academy <lb/>
            was nearly a mile beyond the Thriasian <lb/>
            gates, which divided the outer from the <lb/>
            inner Cerameicus, so that the entire <lb/>
            course was somewhat long and arduous <lb/>
            for an untrained runner. This torch- <lb/>
            race must not be confounded with that <lb/>
            which was run at the Hephaesteia, when <lb/>
            the torch was passed on by one runner <lb/>
            to another (Hdt. viii. 98), though doubt- <lb/>
            less both started from the same place, <lb/>

            secondary matters of which mention <lb/>
            has been made in the note on 1099 <lb/>

          <p>1109. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δὲ τοῦτο κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] No one ean <lb/>
            read these comedies without being <lb/>
            struck by the confidence which their <lb/>
            author exhibits that his entire audience <lb/>
            --one might almost say the whole <lb/>
            Athenian people—will be shrewd enough <lb/>
            and well-read enough at once to detect <lb/>
            and appreciate the slightest allusion he <lb/>
            may make to the works of their famous <lb/>
            tragedians. Doubtless his confidence <lb/>
            as a rule was justified : yet occasionally <lb/>
            of course a point here and there would <lb/>
            be missed; and nowhere would this <lb/>
            mishap be more likely to occur than in <lb/>
            the ensuing scenes, dealing as they do <lb/>
            not with one particular play, but with. <lb/>
            isolated sentences and isolated verses, <lb/>
            culled from the whole range of Aeschy- <lb/>
            lean and Euripidean literature, old as <lb/>
            well as new, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τά τε παλαιὰ καὶ τὰ καινά</foreign>. <lb/>
            From this antistrophe we may gather <lb/>
            that many points were in fast missed <lb/>
            on the first exhibition of the Frogs. <lb/>
            And therefore, in the play before us, <lb/>
            which is the Frogs as revised for the <lb/>
            second performance, the Chorus en- <lb/>
            courage the rivals by alleging that this <lb/>

          <p>Always in one position only : many the fields for your keen-edged wit. <lb/>
            On then, wrangle in every way, <lb/>
            Argue, battle, be flayed and flay, <lb/>
            Old and new from your stores display, <lb/>
            Yea, and strive with venturesome daring something subtle and neat to say. <lb/>
            Fear ye this, that to-day's spectators lack the grace of artistic lore, <lb/>
            , Lack the knowledge they need for taking <lb/>
            All the points ye will soon be making ? <lb/>
            Fear it not: the alarm is groundless : that, be sure, is the case no more. <lb/>
            All have fought the campaign ere this : <lb/>
            Each a book of the words is holding; never a single point they'll miss. <lb/>
            Bright their natures, and now, I ween, <lb/>
            Newly whetted, and sharp, and keen. <lb/>
            Dread not any defect of wit,</p>
          <p>campaign, they have already witnessed <lb/>
            the play. More than that, each has <lb/>
            now got a book of the words (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βιβλίον</foreign>, <lb/>
            libretto), and so will understand all the <lb/>
            witticisms, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ δεξιά</foreign>. So far as the <lb/>
            audience are concerned therefore, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεα- <lb/>
            τῶν οὕνεχ</foreign>’, the poets need be under no <lb/>
            apprehension. This, I think, is the <lb/>
            true interpretation of the antistrophe. <lb/>
            Lessing's suggestion that by <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστρατευ- <lb/>
            μένοι</foreign> we are to understand the slaves <lb/>
            who won their freedom at Arginusae is <lb/>
            at first somewhat attractive, but the <lb/>
            subsequent statement, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱΦύσειςκράτισται</foreign>, <lb/>
            shows clearly enough that the Chorus <lb/>
            are speaking of freeborn Athenian <lb/>
            citizens. The explanations given by <lb/>
            the commentators seem to me very wide <lb/>
            of the mark. Differing on the one point <lb/>
            whether <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστρατευμένοι</foreign> is to be under- <lb/>
            stood of real military expeditions, or of <lb/>
            studious exercises, they all agree in <lb/>
            referring the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">βιβλίον τ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχων <lb/>
            ἕκαστος</foreign> to the increased book-learning <lb/>
            of the Athenian people. Bergler's trans- <lb/>
            lation, Nam exercitati sunt, et librum <lb/>
            quisque habens discit sapientiam, is <lb/>
            adopted without alteration by Brunck. <lb/>
            Mitchell pictures ten or fifteen thou- <lb/>
            sand spectators, each with a philo- <lb/>
            sophical treatise in his hand." Bothe <lb/>
            observes, " <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστρατευμένους</foreign> dicit litterariâ <lb/>

              included the entire trilogy (or tetralogy) <lb/>
              has been too readily accepted, and <lb/>
              scholars have possibly been a little too <lb/>
              ingenious in discovering or devising <lb/>
              special names for special trilogies. It <lb/>
              is not likely that the author himself <lb/>
              bestowed a name on the complete <lb/>
              trilogy, over and above the names of <lb/>
              the several plays; it is more probable <lb/>
              that the wider name subsequently came <lb/>
              into use as a convenient mode of refer- <lb/>
              ence to a group of plays (whether <lb/>
              combined in a trilogy or not) dealing <lb/>
              with one and the same personage. <lb/>
              Thus the Prometheus <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρΦόρος</foreign>, the <lb/>
              Prometheus <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσμώτης</foreign>, the Prometheus <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">λυόμενος</foreign>, and, it may be, the satyric <lb/>
              Prometheus <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυρκαεὺς</foreign> were known as the <lb/>
              Prometheuses, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ Προμηθεῖς</foreign>, a name very <lb/>
              unlikely to have been given them by <lb/>
              Aeschylus himself. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δυκουργία</foreign> may <lb/>
              well have comprised the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἠδωνοὺς</foreign>, the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βασσαρίδας</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεανίσκους</foreign>, and the satyric <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αυκοῦργον</foreign> (Thesm. 135 and the Scholiast <lb/>

              appears to have formed the most <lb/>
              prominent character. See Hermann's <lb/>
              Opuscula, vol. v. But it is to my mind <lb/>

              the Agamemnon should have gone to <lb/>
              make up a group which went by the <lb/>
              secondary name of the Oresteia. I be- <lb/>
              lieve that the Oresteia meant simply <lb/>
              the group of plays which dealt with the <lb/>
              story of Orestes, and comprised therefore <lb/>
              the Choephoroe, the Eumenides, and <lb/>
              possibly other plays, but not the Aga- <lb/>
              memnon : just as the Electra, the <lb/>
              Orestes, the Iphigeneia in Tauris, the <lb/>
              Andromache, and possibly other plays,</p><pb n="173"/>

            Beginning first to test the first beginning <lb/>
            Of this fine poet's plays. Why he's obscure <lb/>
            Even in the enunciation of the facts.</p>
          <p>Dio. Which of them will you test? EUR. Many : but first <lb/>
            Give us that famous one from the Oresteia.</p>
          <p>Dio. St! Silence all! Now, Aeschylus, begin.</p>
          <p>AESCH. Grave Hermes, witnessing a father's power, <lb/>
            Be thon my saviour and mine aid to-day,</p>
          <p>may have formed the Oresteia of <lb/>
            Euripides. And this seems implied by <lb/>
            the present passage. It is obvious that <lb/>
            Euripides is referring to the individual <lb/>
            prologue which Aeschylus immediately <lb/>
            begins to recite : and-unless the words <lb/>
            can mean, as I have. translated them, <lb/>
            " the well-known prologue " (the pro- <lb/>
            logue to the Choephoroe being spoken <lb/>
            by the chief character, whilst the <lb/>
            prologists of the Agamemnon and <lb/>
            Eumenides are subordinate personages <lb/>
            who never appear again) -it is difficult, <lb/>
            on the assumption that the Oresteia <lb/>
            included the entire trilogy, to see how <lb/>
            they can have pointed to the prologue <lb/>
            of the Choephoroe. But understand <lb/>
            the Oresteia to mean the Orestes-group <lb/>
            of plays," and the prologue of the <lb/>
            Oresteia can mean nothing else than <lb/>
            the prologue of the Choephoroe.</p>

            Hermes in his character of <foreign xml:lang="grc">χθόνιος</foreign> <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πομπαῖον 'Ερμῆν χθόνιον</foreign>, Ajax 832), <lb/>
            because in that character he has already <lb/>
            conducted the shade of Agamemnon to <lb/>
            the world below, and is about to con- <lb/>
            duct thither the shades of Aegistbus <lb/>
            and Clytaemnestra. It seemed necessary <lb/>
            to adapt the translation to the pun <lb/>
            below, 1149. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐποπτεύειν</foreign>, from its use in <lb/>
            connexion with theEleusinian mysteries, <lb/>
            acquired the signification of “partici- <lb/>

            The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρῷ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐποπτεύων κράτη</foreign> <lb/>

          <p>This passage is notable, not only for <lb/>

            and this fact (viz. that it was the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐριούνιος</foreign>) Orestes made clear by saying <lb/>

            Orestes, as in the twenty-fourth Iliad he <lb/>
            saved Priam, in his hour of need. A <lb/>
            Greek god possessed many and diverse <lb/>
            characters, and almost seemed a distinct <lb/>
            personality in each. Therefore instead <lb/>
            of saying, " He invoked Hermes in this, <lb/>

          <p>offices of Hermes are enumerated in <lb/>
            Plutus 1153-1170, where he is presented <lb/>
            successively as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στροφαῖος, Ἐμπολαῖος, Δό- <lb/>

          <p>1149. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυμβωρύχος</foreign>] Euripides again <lb/>
            misinterprets the words of Aeschylus, <lb/>
            taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατρῷον γέρος</foreign> to refer to <foreign xml:lang="grc">χθόνιον</foreign>, <lb/>
            whereas it refers to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐριούνιον</foreign>. Dionysus <lb/>
            now breaks in with an unseemly joke. <lb/>
            If Hermes is invoked <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τῷ τύμβω̩</foreign> as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χθόνιος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταχθόνιος</foreign>, he must be a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυμβωρύχος</foreign>, and this unsavoury business <lb/>
            therefore is what he derived from his <lb/>
            father. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυμβωρύχος</foreign>, properly a rifler <lb/>
            of graves, became (like <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοιχωρύχος</foreign>, <lb/>
            Clouds 1327, Plutus 909, 1141, etc.) a <lb/>
            simple term of abuse. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰρωνεύῃ ταυ̂τα <lb/>
            πρὸς ἐμὲ</foreign>, says Timocles in Lucian's <lb/>

            "Bacchus, the joke you make is stale <lb/>
            and fusty " ; but as addressing the god <lb/>
            of wine, he substitutes "the wine you <lb/>
            drink " for " the joke you make " : just <lb/>
            as in Wasps 525 the old dicast, for <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύλικα</foreign>, the cup, substitutes <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισθὸν</foreign>, the <lb/>
            dicasticfee. The expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰνος ἀνθο- <lb/>
            σμίας</foreign>, “ wine with a bouquet,” is of very <lb/>
            frequent occurrence. In Plutus 807 <lb/>
            and Achilles Tatius ii. 2 it has the epithet <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλας</foreign>, blood-red, attached to it; and in <lb/>
            Longus (Pastorals iv. 8) a wine is called <lb/>

            the wealth and luxury of Corcyra, they <lb/>
            grew so dainty, Xenophon tells us <lb/>
            (Hell. vi. 2, 6), that they would touch <lb/>

          <p>EUR. Why this is worse than all. If from his father <lb/>
            He held this office grave, why then- Dio. He was <lb/>
            A graveyard rifler on his fathers side.</p>
          <p>AESCH. Bacchus, the wine you drink is stale and fusty.</p>
          <p>Dio. Give him another: (to Eur.) you, look out for faults.</p>
          <p>AESCH. Be thou my saviour and mine aid to-day, <lb/>
            For here I come, and hither I return.</p>
          <p>EUR. The same thing twice says clever Aeschylus.</p>
          <p>Dio. How twice ? EUR. Why, just consider: I'll explain. <lb/>
            “ I corner says he; and “ I return," says he : <lb/>

          <p>Chrysostom (de Annâ, v. 3), arguing that <lb/>

              water into 50 measures of new wine, <lb/>
              and it becomes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθοσμίας</foreign>.” Greek wine <lb/>
              generally was noted for its pleasant <lb/>
              fragrance, Eur. Cyclops 153 ; especially <lb/>
              the Thasian.</p>

            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ δὲ βούλει</foreign>appear to introduce <lb/>
            not an alternative, but an addition. <lb/>
            In Xenophon's Memorabilia (iii. 5) <lb/>
            Socrates is recounting the military <lb/>
            achievements of Athens: "Consider," he <lb/>
            says, “ their successes in old time under <lb/>

              <lb/>

              (Phaedrus, chap. 5), dilating on the <lb/>
              amenities of the spot to which Phaedrus <lb/>

              —Scholiast. When you say that a man <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκει</foreign> to a country, Aeschylus means, you <lb/>
              merely denote his arrival and nothing <lb/>
              else : <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωρὶς ἄλλης ξυμΦορα̑ς</foreign> without any <lb/>
              other circumstance: but when you say <lb/>
              that he <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέρχεται</foreign> you introduce an- <lb/>
              other circumstance, viz. that he is an <lb/>
              exile returning to his fatherland.</p>
          <p>1167. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατελθεῖ</foreign>] Euripides replies <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατελθζῖν</foreign> really means to be re- <lb/>
            called, and is therefore inapplicable to <lb/>
            Orestes. His contention may seem to <lb/>
            derive some countenance from such <lb/>
            phrases as that in Thuc. viii. 68 <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομίζων</foreign> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>AESCH. It is not so, you everlasting talker, <lb/>
            They're not the same, the words are right enough.</p>
          <p>Dio. How so ? inform me how you use the words.</p>
          <p>AESCH. A man, not banished from his home, may “ come " <lb/>
            To any land, with no especial chance. <lb/>
            A home-bound exile both “ returns " and “ comes.”</p>
          <p>Dio. 0 good, by Apollo ! <lb/>
            What do you say, Euripides, to that ?</p>
          <p>EUR. I say Orestes never did return." <lb/>
            He came in secret: nobody recalled him.</p>
          <p>Dio. 0 good, by Hermes ! <lb/>
            (Aside.) I've not the least suspicion what he means.</p>
          <p>EUR. Repeat another line. Dio. Ay, Aeschylus, <lb/>
            Repeat one instantly: you, mark what's wrong.</p>
          <p>AESCH. Now on this funeral mound I call my father <lb/>
            To hear, to hearken. EUR. There he is again. <lb/>
            To " hear,” to " hearken ” ; the same thing, exactly.</p>
          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">κατελθεῖν</foreign>, as well as <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατιέναι</foreign>, is commonly <lb/>
            used in the wider meaning which Aes- <lb/>
            chylus gives it here. In the Antigone <lb/>
            of Sophocles (200) Polyneices is called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυγὰς κατζλθών</foreign>; in Hdt. v. 30 the <lb/>
            Naxian exiles beseech Aristagoras to <lb/>
            assist them by force, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατελθεῖν ἐς τὴν <lb/>
            ἑωυτω̑ν</foreign> ; in Hdt. v. 62 the exiled Alc- <lb/>
            maeonids who fortified Leipsydrium are <lb/>
            described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πειρώμενοι κατιέναι</foreign> and <lb/>
            numberless other passages might be <lb/>
            cited in which these words are em- <lb/>
            ployed without any thought of recall. <lb/>
            The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάθρα̣</foreign> in 1168 is not of the <lb/>
            essence of the objection : it merely em- <lb/>
            phasizes the fact that Orestes was not <lb/>
            recalled by the rulers of the state.</p>

            1151.</p>
          <p>1173. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλύειν, ἀκαυ̑σαι</foreign>] There is prob- <lb/>
            ably no substantial distinction between <lb/>
            these two words ; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλύοντες αύκ ἥκουον</foreign> <lb/>
            of Prometheus 456 resembles the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκουον- <lb/>
            τες οὐκ ἀκούουσινο</foreign>f St. Matthew's Gospel: <lb/>
            and the joke with which Dionysus closes <lb/>
            the discussion justifies, rather than <lb/>
            denies, the alleged tautology. Fritzsche <lb/>
            happily retorts on Enripides his own <lb/>
            offences with the same words; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούκ <lb/>

            Wordsworth (in Conington's note on <lb/>
            the present line in the Choephoroe) <lb/>

          <p>1176. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρὶς λέγοντες</foreign>] He is alluding, <lb/>
            as Stanley remarks on this line in the <lb/>
            Choephoroe, to the ancient custom of <lb/>
            thrice bidding farewell to the dead, <lb/>
            a custom commemorated in several well- <lb/>
            known passages which are cited by <lb/>
            Stanley there and Spanheim here. In <lb/>
            the Odyssey, ix. 63, Odysseus is recount- <lb/>
            ing his repulse from the Thracian coast, <lb/>
            with the loss of many of his comrades. <lb/>
            And he says :- <lb/>
            Then stood we out to sea, full dismally leaving the coast, <lb/>
            Glad from the death to flee, yet grieving for comrades lost. <lb/>
            But or ever the keels ran out to the offing, we turned to the shore, <lb/>
            THRICE raising the farewell shout to those we should see nevermore, <lb/>
            Whom Death in the plain did meet with Ciconian men as they fought.—WAY. <lb/>
            So in Virgil vi. 505 Aeneas, describing to the shade of Deiphobus the honours <lb/>
            they had paid to his memory, says :— <lb/>
            Yea, and a vacant mound upon far Rhaetaeum's coast, <lb/>
            Built I for thee and THRICE bade loud farewell to thy ghost.—BOWEN.</p>
          <p>" Mortuis dicisolet Vale ! Vale ! Vale ! " <lb/>
            says Servius on Aen. ii. 644. Finally <lb/>
            in Theocr. xxiii. 44, a despairing lover <lb/>

          <p>1177. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ φράσω</foreign>] It is now the turn <lb/>
            of Euripides to bring his prologues to <lb/>

          <p>Dio. Aye, but he's speaking to the dead, you knave, <lb/>
            Who cannot hear us though we call them thrice.</p>
          <p>AESCH. And how do you make your prologues? EUR. You shall hear; <lb/>
            And if you find one single thing said twice, <lb/>
            Or any useless padding, spit upon me.</p>
          <p>Dio. Well, fire away : I'm all agog to hear <lb/>
            Your very accurate and faultless prologues.</p>
          <p>EUR. A happy man was Oedipus at first—</p>
          <p>AESCH. Not so, by Zeus; a most unhappy man. <lb/>
            Who, not yet born nor yet conceived, Apollo <lb/>
            Foretold would be his father's murderer. <lb/>
            How could he be a happy man at first.</p>
          <p>EUR. Then he became the wretchedest of men.</p>
          <p>AESCH. Not so, by Zeus; he never ceased to be.</p>
          <p>ful alacrity of a mail who feels that he <lb/>
            will be found (to adopt his own language <lb/>
            twenty lines below) TOVS <foreign xml:lang="grc">προλόγους καλοὺς <lb/>
            ποιεῖν</foreign>. There will be no vain repetitions, <lb/>
            no redundant verbiage there. In view <lb/>
            of the wholesale ruin which awaits his <lb/>
            prologues, the self-satisfied confidence <lb/>
            with which he introduces them might <lb/>
            well be found highly diverting.</p>
          <p>1182. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν Οἰδἕίπους</foreign>] This and line 1187 <lb/>
            are the first two lines of the Antigone <lb/>
            of Euripides ; and the bald juxtaposition <lb/>
            of their two statements about Oedipus <lb/>
            might seem to invite the criticism of <lb/>
            Aristophanes. Euripides himself in the <lb/>
            Phoenissae (1595-1611) supplies the <lb/>
            arguments, and indeed almost the <lb/>
            language, with which Aristophanes <lb/>
            demolishes the first line of the Antigone <lb/>
            and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγένετο</foreign> of the second. We are <lb/>
            told by the Scholiast on 53 supra that <lb/>
            the Phoenissae preceded the Frogs by <lb/>
            a short interval only: and there is no <lb/>
            manner of doubt that Aristophanes was <lb/>
            referring, and would be understood by <lb/>
            the audience to, be referring, to the <lb/>
            language and arguments of the tragic <lb/>
            play. It is only fair, however, to observe <lb/>
            that the view taken in the first two <lb/>
            lines of the Antigone, whether right <lb/>
            or wrong, is by no means specially <lb/>
            Euripidean: the sudden downfall of <lb/>
            Oedipus from the height of happiness <lb/>
            and prosperity to the lowest depth of <lb/>
            adversity was the stock illustration, <lb/>
            in ancient times, of the changes and <lb/>
            chances of -this mortal life: and is <lb/>
            displayed with great and impressive <lb/>
            skill by Sophocles in the Oedipus <lb/>
            Tyrannus. And the closing trochaics <lb/>
            in which Sophocles points the contrast <lb/>
            between his hero's earlier and later <lb/>
            condition, are, strangely enough, trans- <lb/>
            ferred almost verbatim by Euripides to <lb/>
            the final scene of the Phoenissae.</p><pb n="182"/>

          <p>1195. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδαίμων ἄρ' ἦν</foreign>] The meaning <lb/>
            of this little speech is not quite clear, <lb/>
            but in my opinion Dionysus is alluding <lb/>
            to the last preceding words of Aeschylus <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξετύφλωσεν αὑτόν</foreign>. "There indeed he <lb/>
            was lucky," interprets Dionysus, "if at <lb/>
            least he was one of the colleagues of <lb/>
            Erasinides." For had he been blind, <lb/>
            he would not have joined the fleet (192 <lb/>
            supra); would not have won the battle <lb/>
            of Arginusae; would not have fallen <lb/>
            a victim, as Erasinides did, to the mad- <lb/>
            ness of the Athenian people. I take <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστρατήγησεν</foreign> to mean, not (as Bergler <lb/>
            and Brunck translate it) si exercitum <lb/>
            duxisset, but si strategus fuisset. This <lb/>
            seems to me both the simplest and the <lb/>
            most satisfactory interpretation. But <lb/>
            the passage is generally explained quite <lb/>
            otherwise. " Happy indeed was he: he <lb/>
            only wanted to be a colleague of Erasi- <lb/>
            nides to complete such happiness," is <lb/>
            Mr. Green's rendering, and Dr. Blaydes <lb/>
            takes the same view. On the other <lb/>
            hand, Dr. Merry explains it: "If Oedipus <lb/>
            could be called happy under such a <lb/>
            complication of disasters, he would even <lb/>
            have been happy if he had been a <lb/>
            colleague of Erasinides." The words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδαίμων ἄρ' ἦν</foreign> recur in Plutus 657, but <lb/>
            without throwing any light on the <lb/>
            passage before us.</p>
          <p>1201. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ ληκυθίου σὺ τοὺς ἑμούς</foreign>;] <lb/>

          <p>No sooner born, than they exposed the babe, <lb/>
            (And that in winter), in an earthen crock, <lb/>
            Lest he should grow a man, and slay his father. <lb/>
            Then with both ankles pierced and swoln, he limped <lb/>
            Away to Polybus: still young, he married <lb/>
            An ancient crone, and her his mother too. <lb/>
            Then scratched out both his eyes. Dio. Happy indeed <lb/>
            Had he been Erasinides's colleague !</p>
          <p>EUR. Nonsense; I say my prologues are firstrate.</p>
          <p>AESCH. Nay then, by Zeus, no longer line by line <lb/>
            I'll maul your phrases: but with heaven to aid. <lb/>
            I'll smash your prologues with a bottle of oil.</p>
          <p>EUR. You mine with a bottle of oil ? AESCH. With only one. <lb/>
            You frame your prologues so that each and all <lb/>

            Or “ reticule-bag.” I'll prove it here, and now.</p>
          <p>EUR. You'll prove it? You? AESCH. I will. Dio. Well then, begin.</p>

            events, is concluded, the fatal tag <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign> completes both the <lb/>
            sense and the metre. Only one of the <lb/>
            six is taken from an extant play, the <lb/>
            Iphigenia in Tauris : it is quite accur- <lb/>
            ately cited, and doubtless the remaining <lb/>
            five are cited with equal accuracy. For <lb/>
            a fuller discussion of all these minor <lb/>
            contests the reader is referred to the <lb/>
            Introduction.</p>
          <p>1206. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἵγυπτας</foreign>] In all probability <lb/>
            this was the original commencement <lb/>
            of the Archelaus, though it had lost its <lb/>
            place before the days of the Alexan- <lb/>
            drine grammarians. The Scholiast says : <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig264.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>

              Now the legend of Aegyptus and Danaus, <lb/>
              as told by Hyginus (Fab, 168), was as <lb/>
              follows. They were brothers, and the <lb/>
              former had fifty sons and the latter <lb/>
              fifty daughters. The former, plotting <lb/>
              to destroy Danaus and his family, <lb/>
              demanded that the fifty daughters <lb/>
              should be given to his fifty sons. Danaus, <lb/>
              aware of the plot, fled with his daugh- <lb/>
              ters to Argos, whither they were quickly <lb/>
              followed by the fifty sons of Aegyptus <lb/>
              (and, according to Euripides, by Aegyptus <lb/>
              himself). Danaus finding himself the <lb/>
              weaker, was obliged to give his fifty <lb/>
              daughters in marriage to their fifty <lb/>
              cousins, but counselled them to slay <lb/>
              their husbands, which all but Hyper- <lb/>
              mnestra did. The two voyages to Argos <lb/>
              are so closely interwoven that Euripides <lb/>
              could hardly have commenced one play <lb/>
              with an account of the voyage of Danaus, <lb/>
              and another with an account of the <lb/>
              voyage of Aegyptus. It is far more <lb/>
              probable that he originally commenced <lb/>
              the Archelaus with an account of the <lb/>
              voyage of Aegyptus, which was sub- <lb/>
              sequently discarded either by himself <lb/>
              or, as Fritzsche thinks, by the younger <lb/>
              Euripides, in favour of the earlier voyage <lb/>
              of Danaus. The change could not how- <lb/>
              ever have been occasioned, as Fritzsche <lb/>
              and others contend, by the satire of <lb/>
              Aristophanes, since the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλθὼν ἐς 'Αργος</foreign> <lb/>
              of the later prologue is just as amenable</p><pb n="185"/>

            syllables displaced by these two words <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυλάκιον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign> would have had the <lb/>

            catalectic <figure type="illustration">

              which the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον</foreign> wrought amongst <lb/>
              the Euripidean prologues made such an <lb/>
              impression upon the popular mind that <lb/>
              this metre ever thereafter went by <lb/>
              the name of the Euripidean or the <lb/>
              Lecythian. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δίμετρον καταληκτικὰν</foreign>, says <lb/>
              Hephaestion (chap. 6) in his enumera- <lb/>

              Εὐριπίδειαν ἦ ληκύθιαν</foreign>. And the Scholiast <lb/>
              there explains that it acquired those <lb/>

              present passages. The Scholiast indeed <lb/>
              suggests another reason, which is plainly <lb/>
              untenable.</p>
          <p>1211. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διάνυσος</foreign>] This, the Scholiast <lb/>
            tells us, is the commencement of the <lb/>
            Hypsipyle, a play to which reference is <lb/>
            elsewhere made in the Frogs. In the <lb/>
            tragedy the third line ran <foreign xml:lang="grc">πηδᾷ χαρεύων <lb/>

          <p>1214. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἵμαι πεπλήγμεθ</foreign>'] The two famous <lb/>
            death cries of Agamemnon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥμοι πέπληγ- <lb/>
            μαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥμοι μάλ' αὖθις</foreign> (Aesch. Ag. 1343, <lb/>
            1345), which were repeated by his murder- <lb/>
            ess in Sophocles (Electra 1415,1416), and <lb/>
            are imitated by the sycophant in Plutus <lb/>
            934, 935, are here blended together. <lb/>
            Dionysus employs the plural <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεπλήγμεθ</foreign>' <lb/>
            because, apart from merely metrical <lb/>
            reasons, he is here, as in 1228 infra, <lb/>
            identifying himself for the moment <lb/>
            with the cause and the prologues of <lb/>
            Euripides. There is no allusion, as <lb/>
            some have fancied, to the fact that, if <lb/>
            the preceding three lines are to be <lb/>
            taken literally, it is Dionysus himself <lb/>
            who has lost his <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιαν</foreign>. The stage <lb/>
            Dionysus, both here and in the Iacchus <lb/>
            scene above, is far too deeply engrossed <lb/>
            in his stage business to take heed of <lb/>
            any allusion to himself in any other <lb/>
            than his stage character.</p>

            were peculiarly obnoxious to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληκύθιον</foreign> <lb/>
            test, chooses for his third example a <lb/>
            prologue of an entirely different char- <lb/>
            acter. This is the commencement of <lb/>
            his Stheneboea, the third line being <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ δυσγενὴς ὢν πλουσίαν ἀροῖ πλάκα</foreign>. It <lb/>
            consists of a double apophthegm like <lb/>
            the commencement of the Heracleidae, <lb/>
            which itself, if adduced, would have <lb/>
            fallen a victim to the same test.</p>
          <p>1220. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφέσθαι μοι δοκεῖ</foreign>] I recommend <lb/>
            you to lower your sails. Kuster compares <lb/>

            δοκεῖ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1225. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σιδώνιόν ποτ᾽</foreign>] The philosophic <lb/>
            exordium having fared no better than <lb/>
            its predecessors, Euripides now reverts <lb/>
            to the more familiar type, and recites <lb/>
            as his fourth example the commence- <lb/>
            ment of the'Phrixus, the second line in <lb/>
            the original being <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀγήνορος παῖς ἵκετ᾽ ἐς <lb/>
            Θήβης πέδον</foreign>. The Scholiast calls the <lb/>
            play the second Phrixns, as if either <lb/>
            there were two plays of that name, as <lb/>

            Fritzsche’s theory has little to recom- <lb/>
            mend it: and there seems no doubt that <lb/>
            the line before us was recognized as the <lb/>
            final commencement of the Phrixus. <lb/>
            In [Plutarch's] Lives of the Ten Orators <lb/>
            we are told that Isocrates, when dying, <lb/>
            recited three lines of Euripides, <figure type="illustration">

              all obviously introductory lines: and <lb/>
              lines which could hardly have been <lb/>
              uttered without- some reminiscence of <lb/>
              the present passage.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρίωμαι</foreign> is substituted for <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιωπῶ</foreign>, this <lb/>
            line is identical with 1134 supra. There <lb/>
            Aeschylus, as here Euripides, is repudi- <lb/>
            ating with indignation the pacific coun- <lb/>
            sels of Dionysus.</p>
          <p>1232. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πέλοψ</foreign>] This is the commence- <lb/>

            And his alteration is accepted by several <lb/>
            editors. But all this proceeds on the <lb/>
            assumption that the appeal is addressed <lb/>
            to Aeschylus, whereas it seems clear <lb/>
            that it is addressed to Euripides. The <lb/>
            expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάσῃ τέχνῃ</foreign> "by all means in. <lb/>
            your power,” "if you possibly can," <lb/>
            shows that the proposal was of the <lb/>
            utmost importance to the persou ad- <lb/>
            dressed : whilst the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔτι καὶ νῦν</foreign> <lb/>
            imply that he has already missed an <lb/>
            opportunity or displayed some reluct- <lb/>
            ance to grasp it. Neither of these <lb/>
            considerations applies to Aeschylus: <lb/>
            both apply to Euripides. Aeschylus <lb/>
            would not be anxious to part with his <lb/>
            victorious weapon: to purchase it <lb/>
            seems the only chance left to Euripides <lb/>
            of saving his unfortunate prologues. <lb/>
            Aeschylus has not been asked, and <lb/>
            therefore has not refused, to sell; <lb/>
            Euripides has been asked, and has <lb/>
            refused, to buy. And Dr. Blaydes, who <lb/>
            takes the same view, observes that the <lb/>
            response comes not from Aeschylus, but <lb/>
            from Euripides. I agree with him and <lb/>
            Fritzsche that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδος</foreign> is here used, as <lb/>
            supra 270, in its ordinary signification, <lb/>
            Pay him the price. The epithets <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλήν <lb/>
            τε κἀγαθὴν</foreign> are applied to the Aeschylean <lb/>
            weapon because its owner is <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλὸς <lb/>

            Scholiast tells us, comes from, but does <lb/>
            not commence, the prologue of the <lb/>
            Meleager, t he first line being k<foreign xml:lang="grc">αλυδὼν <lb/>

          <p>to say : but they are admittedly a part <lb/>
            of its prologue ; and perhaps Euripides <lb/>
            was entitled to bring any part, and not <lb/>
            merely the commencement, of a pro- <lb/>
            logue to the test. The Scholiast com- <lb/>

          <p>1243. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔασον, ὦ τᾶν</foreign>] Euripides is getting <lb/>

            irritability, and cannot brook any jest- <lb/>

            occurred twice in the plays of Euripides : <lb/>

            remarks, as the commencement of the <lb/>
            Melanippe Sapiens, where it was followed <lb/>
            by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞Ελλην᾽ ἔτικτε</foreign>. Plutarch <lb/>

            Fame and praise for his lays, <lb/>
            Lays so many and fair. <lb/>

          <p>here the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος</foreign> is specially regarded <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελοποιὸς</foreign>, making all his <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλη</foreign> alike, he <lb/>
            means that they all partake of the same <lb/>
            metre. When, infra 1262, he promises <lb/>
            to cut down all the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλη</foreign> of Aeschylus <lb/>
            to one, he means to one metre.</p>
          <p>1251. TL <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποτε κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] Short as this little <lb/>
            glyconic chorus is, it apparently con- <lb/>
            sists of two versions of the same lyric, <lb/>
            one version probably belonging to the <lb/>
            original, and the other to the revised <lb/>
            comedy. We may conjecture that the <lb/>
            first six lines constitute one version, <lb/>
            from <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ποτε</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυνί</foreign>. And that the other <lb/>
            consisted of the first line <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ποτε πρῦγμα <lb/>
            γενήσεται</foreign>, and the last four, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">θαυ- <lb/>

            thing would be changed in combining <lb/>
            the two.</p>
          <p>1262. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς ἅν</foreign>] Aeschylus, the most <lb/>
            Homeric of poets, would naturally have <lb/>
            the swing of the Homeric hexameter <lb/>
            for ever vibrating in his mind; and <lb/>
            Euripides is about to show that his <lb/>
            various metres, however they commence, <lb/>
            are constantly gliding into that heroic <lb/>
            metre. For this purpose he takes a <lb/>

          <p>last syllable of the second foot cut off), <lb/>
            and applies it as a standard measure to <lb/>
            various verses cited from the plays of <lb/>
            Aeschylus. This standard measure may <lb/>
            be illustrated from the first verse of the <lb/>
            Odyssey, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνδρα μαι ἔννε</foreign>||<foreign xml:lang="grc">πε, Μοῦσα, πολύ- <lb/>
            τροπον</foreign>, ô<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς μάλα πολλά</foreign>. Euripides gives <lb/>
            it in the form <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰὴ, κάπαν, αὐ πελάθεις ἐπ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρωγάν</foreign> ; Dionysus proposes to take some <lb/>
            counters, and reckon the number of <lb/>
            lines cut down to this measure. Two <lb/>
            of them, the second and the fifth, are <lb/>
            pure heroics; the three others com- <lb/>
            mence differently: but however they <lb/>
            commence, they are sure to slip into <lb/>
            just so much of the heroic metre as <lb/>
            corresponds to the twelve syllables <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰὴ, <lb/>
            κάπαν, αὐ πελάθεις ἐπ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρωγάν</foreign> ; The por- <lb/>

            observing that by so doing they are <lb/>
            rendering the line unsuitable for the <lb/>
            purpose for which it is quoted. For <lb/>
            the standard commences with a short <lb/>
            syllable, as if the second foot of the <lb/>

            every line with which the standard is <lb/>

            Phrynichus, with his mellifluous songs, <lb/>
            and dances numberless as the waves <lb/>
            of ocean, we have already heard iu <lb/>
            the Wasps, the Birds, and supra 910. <lb/>
            Aeschylus was not long content to <lb/>
            follow in the steps of his illustrious <lb/>
            predecessor; he soon struck out a new <lb/>
            line for himself, infusing into Athenian <lb/>
            tragedy the sublime and heroical spirit <lb/>
            of the Homeric epos.</p>

            three words, there are almost “a score <lb/>
            of faults." The <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν</foreign> is entirely out of <lb/>
            place ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φέρει</foreign> requires some object, such <lb/>
            as <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλη</foreign>, to be expressed; the second <lb/>
            syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορνιδίων</foreign> is short: nor is the <lb/>
            word itself suitable, since Aeschylus is <lb/>
            describing not the persons from whom, <lb/>
            but the garbage from which, the lyrics <lb/>
            of Euripides were derived. Person pro- <lb/>
            posed <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορνιδίων μέλη Φέρει</foreign>, which some <lb/>
            have accepted, but which is a rather <lb/>
            violent change, and leaves the last <lb/>
            objection untouched. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελοΦορει̑</foreign>, a verb <lb/>
            formed like <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελοποιει̑</foreign>, does not seem an <lb/>
            impossible source for <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν Φέρει</foreign>, whilst <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορνω̩δικὰ μέλη</foreign>, songs of the harlotry <lb/>
            kind (like <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρω̨δικὰ μέλη</foreign>, songs of a <lb/>
            burlesque character), gives the sense <lb/>
            which the passage requires. The lyric <lb/>
            inspiration of Aeschylus was derived <lb/>
            from the Homeric poems : but whence <lb/>
            comes the lyric inspiration of Euripides ? <lb/>
            It is drawn, his opponent tells us, <lb/>
            from every sort of harlotry-melody, the <lb/>
            catches of Meletus, &amp;c. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκόλια</foreign> of <lb/>
            Meletus,the tragic poet who shortly after- <lb/>
            wards acquired an unenviable notoriety <lb/>
            as one of the accusers of Socrates (Atb. <lb/>
            xii. 75 ; Plato, Apol. chap. 10), are not <lb/>
            elsewhere mentioned: but as his erotic <lb/>
            poems were (according to Dobree's <lb/>

            the Antilais of Epicrates.—Meineke, <lb/>

            of Sappho and the like, we may readily <lb/>
            believe that they were not unfairly <lb/>
            described as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορνω̨δικὰ μέλη</foreign>. Nor was <lb/>
            such an appellation less suited to the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καρικὰ αὐλήματα</foreign>, if we may judge by <lb/>

            a banquet, much as Bdelycleon describes <lb/>
            it in the Wasps. "The tables are <lb/>

            ing oyster-shells together. Aeschylus <lb/>
            hails him as the Muse of Euripides.</p>
          <p>1308. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλεσβίαζεν</foreign>] The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεσβιάζειν</foreign> <lb/>
            means to practise the filthiest tricks of <lb/>
            harlotry: and Dionysus, seeing a miser- <lb/>
            able wanton introduced as Euripides's <lb/>
            Muse, exclaims, "You don't mean to <lb/>
            say that the Muse herself (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτὴ</foreign>, not as <lb/>
            usually read, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὔτη</foreign>) has played the <lb/>
            harlot! No, that I cannot believe." <lb/>
            The lyrics of Aeschylus have been <lb/>
            criticized as perpetually falling into one <lb/>
            cadence, the long roll of the Homeric <lb/>
            hexameter. The lyrics of Euripides are <lb/>
            now to be criticized as corrupting the <lb/>
            noble simplicity of the ancient metres, <lb/>
            by the introduction of affected novelties, <lb/>
            and dainty little devices, like the tricks <lb/>
            of a harlot, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὰ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δωδεκαμήχονον Κυρήνης</foreign>, <lb/>
            as Aeschylus says below. To prove his <lb/>
            case he brings forward seven passages, <lb/>
            one of which is accurately cited from <lb/>
            an extant play, and the others are <lb/>
            doubtless taken with no less accuracy <lb/>
            from plays long since perished. We <lb/>
            know so little about the lyrical niceties <lb/>
            of Athenian tragedy that it is impos- <lb/>
            sible to lay one's finger with anything <lb/>
            like certainty on the particular innova- <lb/>
            tions to which objection is taken, but <lb/>
            a brief discussion of the subject will be <lb/>
            found in the Introduction. It is of <lb/>
            course impossible in the translation to <lb/>
            show the supposed innovations, or even <lb/>
            the metres which they are supposed to <lb/>
            have corrupted.</p>
          <p>1309-12. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλκυόνες... δροσιζόμεναι</foreign>] This <lb/>
            first passage, the Scholiast informs us, <lb/>
            is taken from the Iphigenia in Aulis. <lb/>
            It is not found in the extant play, <lb/>
            which indeed was not exhibited at the <lb/>
            date of the Frogs, though it may have</p><pb n="200"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig291.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>been published before. But all agree <lb/>
            that the play has not come down to us <lb/>
            as it left its author's hands. Boeckh <lb/>
            indeed (Graec. Trag. Princ.) contended <lb/>
            that there were two plays of this <lb/>
            name: one, now lost, by the great <lb/>
            tragedian; and the extant play, the <lb/>
            work of Euripides the younger. But <lb/>
            Bp. Monk, in the dissertation appended <lb/>
            to his edition of the play, convincingly <lb/>
            proves that ours is the original play, <lb/>
            but that much has perished and much <lb/>
            has been interpolated. Bergler observes <lb/>
            that the halcyon is mentioned in the Iph. <lb/>
            in Tauris (1089), but there is no simi- <lb/>
            larity between that passage and the lines <lb/>
            here quoted. Here there seem to be two <lb/>
            metrical blots, as Aristophanes regards <lb/>
            them. The first line is paeonic, and <lb/>
            after the two paeons, — ◡◡◡ I — ◡◡◡, <lb/>
            instead of the expected cretic, — ◡, <lb/>
            Euripides surprises his hearers with an <lb/>
            iambic dipody (-<foreign xml:lang="grc">νάοις θαλάσσ</foreign>-). The <lb/>
            fourth line is a choriambic dimeter, <lb/>
            where, in place of the iambic dipody <lb/>
            with which it usually begins, Euripides <lb/>
            substitutes two tribrachs, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥανίσι χρόα <lb/>
            δροσ</foreign>-. Indeed the resolution of one <lb/>
            long syllable into two short ones is one <lb/>
            of the special devices with which he <lb/>
            is supposed to have tickled the ears of <lb/>
            his audience.</p>
          <p>1313-5. a? <foreign xml:lang="grc">θ</foreign>’ . . . <foreign xml:lang="grc">πηνίσματα</foreign>] Whence <lb/>
            the address to the spiders, which forms <lb/>
            the second test-passage, is taken we do <lb/>
            not know. Probably from some such <lb/>
            play as the Danae, where we may well <lb/>
            imagine the imprisoned princess, like <lb/>
            Robert the Bruce in Scottish history, <lb/>
            watching these patient and tireless <lb/>
            workers. Here the "blot" is in the <lb/>
            third line, which, except that there is <lb/>
            but one paeon instead of two, is identical <lb/>
            with the first line of the first passage.</p><pb n="201"/>
            
          <p>Waves of the sea are babbling, <lb/>
            Dewing your plumes with the drops that fall <lb/>
            From wings in the salt spray dabbling. <lb/>
            Spiders, ever with twir-r-r-r-r-rling fingers <lb/>
            Weaving the warp and the woof, <lb/>
            Little, brittle, network, fretwork, <lb/>
            Under the coigns of the roof. <lb/>
            The minstrel shuttled care. <lb/>
            Where in the front of the dark-prowed ships <lb/>
            Yarely the flute-loving dolphin skips. <lb/>
            Races here and oracles there. <lb/>
            And the joy of the young vines smiling, <lb/>
            And the tendril of grapes, care-beguiling.</p>
          <p>1316. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κερκίδος ... μελέτας</foreign>] The third <lb/>
            passage, we are told, is borrowed from <lb/>
            the Melehger, a play quoted supra 1238 <lb/>
            and infra 1402. The blot here is similar <lb/>
            to that in the fourth line of the first <lb/>
            passage : the first iamb of a choriambic <lb/>
            dimeter being changed into a dactyl, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κερκίδος</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1317, 1318. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵν</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ... κυανεμβόλοις</foreign>] This <lb/>
            fourth passage is the only quotation <lb/>
            from an existing play, the Electra of <lb/>
            Euripides. It is of course cited quite <lb/>
            correctly as far as it goes (otherwise the <lb/>
            criticism would be pointless), but the <lb/>
            full passage in the original is :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig292.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Here the blot is obvious. These are gly- <lb/>
              conic lines, which should properly consist <lb/>
              of a disyllabic base, a choriamb, and an <lb/>
              iamb. The second line is a flawless <lb/>
              glyconic. In the first line the base <lb/>
              consists of three syllables.</p>
          <p>1319. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαντει̑α καὶ σταδίους</foreign>] We are not <lb/>
            told whence this fifth passage is taken. <lb/>
            This again is a choriambic dimeter, but <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαντει̑α</foreign> stands for an iambic dipody, <lb/>
            which has lost its last syllable. The <lb/>
            absence of the syllable constitutes the <lb/>
            blot in this passage. <figure type="illustration">

              is clear that the Scholiast has no idea <lb/>

          <p>dissimilar passage in which the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰνάνθη</foreign> occurs. The second line con- <lb/>
            tains exactly the same blot as the <lb/>
            fourth line of the first passage, the <lb/>
            iambic dipody being changed into two <lb/>
            tribrachs.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πύλης</foreign>.—Scholiast. The blot here con- <lb/>
            sists in making an anapaest the base of <lb/>
            a glyconic line.</p>
          <p>1323. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁρα̜̑ς τὸν πόδα τόνδ</foreign>’ ;] Do you see <lb/>
            this foot ? asks Aeschylus, referring to <lb/>
            the anapaestic base of the preceding <lb/>
            glyconic line. In the energy of his <lb/>
            scorn and indignation he advances his <lb/>
            own foot; and Dionysus, speaking of <lb/>
            the human, and not of the metrical, <lb/>
            foot, replies, Yes, I see it well enough. <lb/>
            Well then, says Aeschylus, advancing <lb/>
            his other foot, do you see this too ? Yes, <lb/>
            replies Dionysus, I see that too. In the <lb/>
            first line Aeschylus is quite serious, <lb/>
            and only Dionysus is jesting. In the <lb/>
            second line they are both playing the <lb/>
            fool.</p>
          <p>1327. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὰ τὸ δωδεκαμήχανον</foreign>] This is <lb/>
            borrowed from the Hypsipyle of Euri- <lb/>
            pides, though it is doubtful whether <lb/>
            the phrase there was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνὰ τὸ δωδεκαμήχονον <lb/>

            ceeds to improvise a monody, or lyrical <lb/>
            monologue, in the style, and to a great <lb/>
            extent in the very words, of Euripides. <lb/>
            It is intended as a satire on the trivial <lb/>
            incidents around which Euripides was <lb/>
            accustomed to throw the grace and <lb/>
            dignity of tragic diction. A poor spin- <lb/>
            ning-girl has a bad dream, a vision of <lb/>
            the night so threatening and so terrible, <lb/>
            that it is plainly the forerunner of <lb/>
            some tremendous catastrophe. She <lb/>
            begins by appealing to Night about <lb/>
            her dream, 0 black-litten darkness of <lb/>
            Night! The epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελαινοΦαὴς</foreign> contains <lb/>
            the same idea as Milton's “darkness <lb/>
            visible," which was the sole illumination <lb/>
            of hell. The spinning-girl's appeal may <lb/>
            recall the monody in Hecuba 67-99, <lb/>
            but it is going too far to say, as some <lb/>
            even before the time of the Scholiast <lb/>
            had said, that Aristophanes is specially <lb/>
            imitating or referring to that or any <lb/>
            other particular monody. <foreign xml:lang="grc">̓́ΟρΦνα</foreign>, says <lb/>
            Mitchell, is "a word not found in <lb/>
            Aeschylus or Sophocles, but of frequent <lb/>
            occurrence in Euripides." It is found <lb/>
            more than a dozen times in his extant <lb/>
            tragedies.</p>

          <p>1338. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλά μοι, ἀμΦιπολοι</foreign>] Aroused <lb/>
            from her sleep the dreamer gives herself <lb/>
            the airs of a tragedy queen, a Clytae- <lb/>
            mnestra or a Hecabe, commanding her <lb/>
            ladies in waiting, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμΦίπολοι</foreign>, to fill their <lb/>
            pitchers with water from the running <lb/>
            stream, and heat it well, that so she <lb/>
            may purge away the evil dream. The <lb/>
            custom of washing away the ill-omened <lb/>
            dream with water from sea or river is of <lb/>
            course well known, and many instances <lb/>
            are collected by the commentators. In <lb/>
            Silius Italicus, viii. 125 (to which Kuster <lb/>
            refers) Anna seems to have bathed her <lb/>
            whole person in the running water, <lb/>
            "vivo purgor in amni." In Aesch.Persae <lb/>
            203 (to which Bergler refers) Atossa <lb/>
            seems to have washed her hands only <lb/>
            in the bright-welling fountain : whilst <lb/>
            in Apollonius Rhodius, iv. 671 (to which <lb/>
            Brunck refers) Circe washed her hair and <lb/>
            her raiment in the sea. " Heating " the <lb/>
            water is quite alien to the nature of <lb/>
            these ceremonial ablutions : but <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέρμετέ <lb/>
            θ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ</foreign> is a Homeric phrase, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμΦὶ δέ οἱ <lb/>

            purpose of rounding off so important <lb/>
            a commission with epic, or shall we say, <lb/>
            Aeschylean stateliness ; for the metre is <lb/>
            the old <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰὴ κόπον οὐ πελάθεις</foreign> in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρωγάν</foreign>. <lb/>
            The Scholiast says Tropo <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> etc <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̑ν Εὐ- <lb/>
            μενίδων</foreign>, which is probably only an <lb/>

            what the dream portended, and knows <lb/>
            that the blow has fallen. Whilst she <lb/>
            was toiling at her spinning-wheel <lb/>
            within, that vile girl Glyce has absconded <lb/>
            with her cock. This, this is the momen- <lb/>
            tous event foreshadowed by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">θει̑ον <lb/>

            Euripidean reduplications (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δάκρυα, δά- <lb/>
            κρυα, ἔβαλον, ἔβαλον</foreign>), and with those <lb/>
            long-drawn musical trills of which we <lb/>
            have heard before, supra 1314. The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόντιος δαίμων</foreign> is Poseidon, who is so <lb/>
            described by Euripides in Rhesus 240. <lb/>
            She calls to all the dwellers in the <lb/>
            house <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυνοίκους</foreign> her housemates) to come <lb/>
            and behold for themselves the porten- <lb/>
            tous outcome of her dream.</p>
          <p>1344. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γλύκη</foreign>] She has carried away my <lb/>
            coch: she is off, is Glyce. Glyce was <lb/>
            apparently a neighbour (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γυνή τις ἐκ <lb/>
            γειτάνων</foreign>.—Scholiast) who had come to <lb/>
            the spinning-girl's house. The exceed- <lb/>
            ing neatness of the sentence <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φραύδη <lb/>
            Γλύκη</foreign> suggests a reminiscence of some <lb/>
            lost passage of Euripides.</p>

            spinning-girl.—Thesm. 728; Athenaeus, <lb/>

            a poor girl with the mountain-born <lb/>

          <p>1351. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνέπτατ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐς αἰθέρα</foreign>] This " upward <lb/>
            flight into aether " is hardly consistent <lb/>
            with Glyce's theft; but the speaker <lb/>
            disregards the inconsistency, for the <lb/>
            sake of introducing a phrase which, as <lb/>
            indeed Mitchell has already observed, <lb/>
            is a special favourite of Euripides. <lb/>
            " Shall I soar to the halls above, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰθέρ</foreign>’ <lb/>

            singing this little ode, a large balance <lb/>

            tion which ensues was of course a fore- <lb/>
            gone conclusion in favour of Aeschylus, <lb/>
            who has already been described as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυργώσας ῥήματα αεμνὰ</foreign>, and than whom <lb/>
            no poet ever composed more dignified <lb/>
            and weighty verse ; whilst Euripides has <lb/>
            been boasting that he had relieved <lb/>
            tragedy of its heavy weight, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ βάρος <lb/>

            however, is turned into a mere farce by <lb/>
            the device of weighing the competing <lb/>

            scale steady as he spoke his line into it, <lb/>
            so as to prevent the scales rising or <lb/>
            falling until Dionysus gave the signal. <lb/>
            To speak a line into the scale is treated <lb/>
            as tantamount to laying the line bodily <lb/>
            upon it. The reply <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχόμεθα</foreign> means that <lb/>
            each is holding his scale in the manner <lb/>

            brought forward in the competition is <lb/>
            likewise the only one quoted from a, <lb/>
            still extant drama. It is the opening <lb/>
            line of the Medea. Aeschylus responds <lb/>
            with a line from his Philoctetes. For <lb/>
            each of the three great tragedians wrote <lb/>
            a tragedy of that name, though only <lb/>
            the Philoctetes of Sophocles has sur- <lb/>
            vived.</p>

            might moisten the wool to make it <lb/>
            weigh the heavier, so Aeschylus, says <lb/>
            Dionysus, increased the weight of his <lb/>
            verse, by infusing a whole river into it.</p>

          <p>The worship of Peitho seems to have <lb/>
            been introduced into Athens by Theseus <lb/>
            when he had' made all the people of <lb/>
            Attica Athenian citizens. In honour of <lb/>
            that event he erected, Pausanias tells <lb/>
            us (i. 22. 3), a temple for the conjoint <lb/>
            worship of Peitho and Aphrodite Pan- <lb/>
            demus ; Peitho representing the persua- <lb/>
            sion whereby he had effected the change, <lb/>
            and Aphrodite Pandemus (quite different <lb/>
            from the Aphrodite who bore that ap- <lb/>
            pellation in later times) signifying that <lb/>
            now "the heart of the people beat with <lb/>
            one desire." That the worship of Peitho <lb/>
            was still the subject of an annual cele- <lb/>
            bration we know from Isocrates, who, in <lb/>
            his speech on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίδοσις</foreign>, 266, argues <lb/>
            that they who rail at the art of rhetoric <lb/>

          <p>1392. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόνος θεῶν</foreign>] Aeschylus gives a <lb/>
            line from his Niobe, frequently cited by <lb/>
            the ancient grammarians. Stobaeus <lb/>
            (Anth. 118. 1) preserves the passage in <lb/>
            which it occurs :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig304.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              In the second line, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνοις</foreign> is Dobree's <lb/>

              The fourth line, attesting the superiority <lb/>
              of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάνατος</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειθὼ</foreign>, seems, as has often <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note></p><pb n="212"/>

          <p>been remarked, very apposite to the <lb/>
            present competition. The passage itself, <lb/>
            by whomsoever spoken, is intended to <lb/>
            illustrate the hopeless case of Niobe, <lb/>
            whom Death had bereft of her children. <lb/>
            See the note on 912 supra. All other <lb/>
            gods might be propitiated by gifts or <lb/>
            won over by prayers. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δῶρα θεοὺς πείθει, <lb/>

          <p>1400. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βέβληκ᾽ Ἀχιλλεύς</foreign>] Euripides <lb/>
            cannot at the moment call to mind any <lb/>
            great and weighty line that he has ever <lb/>
            written ; and Dionysus maliciously ad- <lb/>
            vises him to resort to that notable scene <lb/>
            in his Telephus, which had represented <lb/>
            the Achaean heroes playing at dice, but <lb/>
            which had been so unmercifully handled <lb/>
            by the Athenian wits for its lack of <lb/>
            tragic dignity, that the poet himself, <lb/>
            though, sufficiently enured (one would <lb/>
            suppose) to raillery of that sort, felt the <lb/>
            necessity of suppressing it in the revised <lb/>
            edition of the play. The Scholiasts, <lb/>
            unable to find the line in the Euripides <lb/>
            of their own day, were in doubt whether <lb/>
            it originally came from the Telephus, <lb/>
            the Iphigenia in Aulis, or the Philo- <lb/>
            ctetes, or whether it was not a mere <lb/>
            concoction of Aristophanes himself. <lb/>
            However, as was long ago pointed out <lb/>
            by Kuster, the real facts of the case are <lb/>
            preserved by Eustathius (on Iliad, xvi. <lb/>
            742, and Odyssey, i. 107). " It will not <lb/>
            be out of place," says he (I give a con- <lb/>
            densed translation of the learned arch- <lb/>
            bishop's narrative), "to mention here <lb/>
            that the ancients used three dice, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρισὶ <lb/>
            κύβοις ἐχρῶντο</foreign>, and not, as is now the <lb/>
            custom, only two. Hence the proverbial <lb/>
            expression in relation to people who <lb/>

          <p>Dio. A vain and empty sound, devoid of sense. <lb/>
            Think of some heavier-weighted line of yours, <lb/>

          <p>EUR. Where have I got one ? Where ? Let's see. Dio. I'll tell you. <lb/>

            κύβου</foreign>, õ<foreign xml:lang="grc">περ ἐστὶ, μόναδος</foreign>. For the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύβος</foreign> has two significations : first, the <lb/>
            die itself, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναρριπτούμενον</foreign>, as in <lb/>

            and secondly, the ace, as in the line <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">βέβληκ᾽ Ἀχιλλεὺς δύο κύβω καὶ τέτταρα</foreign>, <lb/>
            that is to say two aces and a four,' of <figure type="illustration">

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεισόδιον</foreign>. The Scholiast quotes an <lb/>
              allusion of Eupolis to the same line, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποφθαρεὶς δὲ δύο κύβω καὶ τέτταρα</foreign>. There <lb/>
              seems to be nothing in the suggestion <lb/>
              that under the name of Achilles, Dio- <lb/>
              nysus is referring to Aeschylus as having <lb/>
              made a good hit, or to Euripides as <lb/>
              having made a bad one.</p>
          <p>1401. <foreign xml:lang="grc">στάσις</foreign>] Weighing, a meaning <lb/>
            more commonly found in compounds, <lb/>
            such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ψυχοστασία</foreign>, than in this simple <lb/>
            form. And perhaps, after all, <foreign xml:lang="grc">στάσις</foreign> <lb/>
            may bear its more ordinary signification <lb/>
            of "contest," "dispute"; since this is <lb/>
            not merely their last weighing, it is also <lb/>
            the last round altogether in the poetical <lb/>
            competition.</p>
          <p>1402. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιδηροβριθές</foreign>] Euripides cites a <lb/>
            line of his Meleager, doubtless from the <lb/>
            narrative of a messenger, describing <lb/>
            how the hero " grasped in his right <lb/>
            hand an iron-shotted club." But the <lb/>
            heaviest club is as nothing beside the <lb/>
            " chariot rolled upon chariot, and corpse <lb/>
            on corpse," which Aeschylus cites from <lb/>
            his Glaucus Potniensis. The Scholiast <lb/>
            on Eur. Phoen. 1194 adds another line, <lb/>
            the couplet standing, according to <lb/>
            Valckenaer's correction, as follows : — <figure type="illustration">

            as supra 1198. As before, Aeschylus <lb/>
            wishes to deal with the subject in a <lb/>
            wholesale manner. And he again (cf. <lb/>
            supra 943) refers to the great library of <lb/>
            Euripides. He may step into the scale <lb/>
            and take all his books with him, and <lb/>
            add to these his wife, his children, and <lb/>
            his friend Cephisophon, and then <lb/>
            Aeschylus will weigh down the lot with <lb/>
            only two of his lines.</p>
          <p>1411. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνδρες φίλοι</foreign>] The aspirate, <lb/>
            which was added by Seager, turns an <lb/>

            my friends.</p>
          <p>1413. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφὸν... ἤδομαι</foreign>] The exceeding <lb/>
            cleverness of Euripides fascinates his <lb/>
            intellect: the nobility of Aeschylus <lb/>
            touches his heart.</p>
          <p>1414. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν</foreign> K.T.X.] Pluto (see the note <lb/>
            on 830 supra) now opens his mouth for <lb/>
            the first time, and speaks to some <lb/>
            purpose too ; for by means of his inter- <lb/>
            vention the plot is jerked back into its <lb/>
            original groove as abruptly as it was <lb/>
            jerked out of it, supra 757. During the <lb/>
            intervening space, the purpose for which <lb/>
            Dionysus came down has been entirely <lb/>
            ignored, and the poetical competition <lb/>
            has proceeded on its own merits. Now, <lb/>
            however, Pluto announces that the suc- <lb/>
            cessful poet shall-not occupy the chair <lb/>
            of tragic art at his table, but—reascend <lb/>
            with Dionysus to the upper world. And <lb/>
            Dionysus improves on this idea by giving <lb/>
            the go-by to the poetic competition <lb/>
            altogether, and determining to take the <lb/>
            poet who will be the most useful ad- <lb/>

            Dionysia, which would come on some <lb/>
            two months later," seems to me alto- <lb/>
            gether inadequate. It was not for so <lb/>
            slight a purpose as this that a noble <lb/>
            poet was to be called up from the <lb/>
            underworld. Men's hearts were at this <lb/>
            time failing them for fear, lest Athens, <lb/>
            if she fell into the hands of her enemies, <lb/>
            should share the fate of the many Hel- <lb/>
            lenic communities which she herself <lb/>
            had swept from the face of the earth : <lb/>
            and then the great dithyrambic choruses <lb/>
            of fifty men or fifty boys, with which the <lb/>
            ten tribes year by year contended : then <lb/>
            the splendid dramatic choruses which, <lb/>
            at the city Dionysia, drew all the <lb/>
            friendly Hellenic world to her theatre : <lb/>
            and all other choral worship of the <lb/>
            gods would be silenced and dumb for <lb/>
            evermore. It was to avert this terrible <lb/>
            catastrophe that the wise counsels of the <lb/>
            old <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μαραθωνομάχης</foreign> were needed by his <lb/>
            anxious countrymen : infra 1501, 1530. <lb/>
            And really, when we remember that <lb/>
            these choral contests formed part of a <lb/>
            great religious solemnity, we may per- <lb/>
            haps, without offence, look upon this <lb/>
            line as the Athenian counterpart of the <lb/>
            sacred prayer in the Church's Benedictus, <lb/>
            "That we, being delivered out of the <lb/>
            hands of our enemies, may serve Thee <lb/>
            without foar."</p><pb n="216"/>

            problem could have been propounded <lb/>
            than this : and it is plain from the <lb/>
            language placed in the mouth of Diony- <lb/>
            sus that it was seriously exercising the <lb/>
            minds of the Athenians at this particular <lb/>
            season ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ πόλις γὰρδυστοκεῑ</foreign>, the city is <lb/>
            in sore travail for a solution, but cannot <lb/>
            bring to the birth. Alcibiades was now <lb/>
            for the second time in exile, and was <lb/>
            residing on his private estate in the <lb/>
            Chersonese. Would it be wise to recall <lb/>
            him ? His genius, both in council and <lb/>
            in war, was so transcendent that it <lb/>
            might possibly even yet pull the Athen- <lb/>
            ians through their troubles : but the <lb/>
            man himself was so wayward and <lb/>
            meteoric that it might be unsafe to <lb/>
            entrust him with the supreme command. <lb/>
            Nevertheless the period of his dictator- <lb/>
            ship was undeniably the most hopeful <lb/>
            period subsequent to the Sicilian cata- <lb/>
            strophe : and this at least is certain, that <lb/>
            had he been retained in command of the <lb/>
            fleet, the final disaster at Aegospotami <lb/>
            would never have happened: it was <lb/>
            rendered possible only by his successors' <lb/>
            neglect of his personal warnings. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>To describe the feelings of Athens <lb/>
            towards Alcibiades, Aristophanes adapts <lb/>
            a line of Ion of Chios. His translator <lb/>
            might adapt a line of Shakespeare <lb/>
            (Othello, iii. 3), She dotes, yet doubts; <lb/>
            suspects, yet strongly loves.</p>
          <p>1427. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισῶπολίτην, κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] Euripides, <lb/>
            always the first to begin, is ready with <lb/>
            an epigrammatic criticism on the general <lb/>
            character of Alcibiades. And so far as <lb/>
            he means that Alcibiades had wrought <lb/>
            his country infinitely more harm than <lb/>
            good, his criticism is abundantly justified: <lb/>
            but the particular wording is possibly' <lb/>
            not free from objection. For when <lb/>

          <p>Now then, whichever of you two shall best <lb/>
            Advise the city, he shall come with me. <lb/>
            And first of Alcibiades, let each <lb/>
            Say what he thinks; the city travails sore.</p>
          <p>EUR. What does she think herself about him ? Dio. What ? <lb/>
            She loves, and hates, and longs to have him back. <lb/>
            But give me your advice about the man.</p>
          <p>EUR. I loathe a townsman who is slow to aid, <lb/>
            And swift to hurt, his town : who ways and means <lb/>
            Finds for himself, but finds not for the state.</p>
          <p>Dio. Poseidon, but that's smart! (To Aesch.) And what say you ? <lb/>
            AESCH. ’Twere best to rear no lion in the state:</p>
          <p>Athenians, his strokes were just as rapid, <lb/>
            and his resources as ample, on their <lb/>
            behalf, as they were at other times on <lb/>
            behalf of their enemies.</p>
          <p>1431. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ χρη̇ κ.τ.λ</foreign>.] In this political <lb/>
            catechism we more than once light upon <lb/>
            (what seem to be) traces of the double <lb/>
            representation of the play. I take it <lb/>
            that in the first performance the lines <lb/>
            ran : <figure type="illustration">

            altered it into <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig313.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>And this was the final form of the speech. <lb/>
            Plutarch (Alcibiades, chap. 16) cites the <lb/>
            last-mentioned couplet as the entire <lb/>
            maxim : and Valerius Maximus (vii. 2. 7) <lb/>
            must have read it in the same way, since <lb/>
            the advice given was, he says, " non <lb/>
            oportere in nrbe nutriri leonem; sin <lb/>
            autem sit alitus, obsequi ei convenire " ; <lb/>
            though other commentators draw other <lb/>
            conclusions from these passages. Fritz- <lb/>
            sche indeed takes the intermediate line <lb/>
            to be an interposition of Dionysus, refer- <lb/>
            ring not to the king of the beasts, but <lb/>
            to Leon the Athenian general, Most cer- <lb/>
            tainly we ought not to rear a Leon in the <lb/>
            state : a somewhat ludicrous idea, though <lb/>
            supported by all the learning and in- <lb/>
            genuity of a most learned and ingeni- <lb/>
            ous scholar. The lines themselves are <lb/>
            thoroughly Aeschylean, and as Hermann <lb/>
            (Opnscula, ii. 332, &amp;c.) observes, if they <lb/>
            do not actually occur in some lost <lb/>
            tragedy, are probably adumbrated from <lb/>

            peculiar expression, probably taken from <lb/>
            a fragment, to which Bergler refers, of <lb/>

          <p>1434. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφῶς ... ϭοφῶς</foreign>] Dionysus had <lb/>
            asked the rivals to advise the state, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇ πό- <lb/>
            λει παραινέσειν</foreign>. Euripides had answered <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭαφῶς</foreign> ; he had uttered a smart epigram- <lb/>
            matic criticism on the character of <lb/>
            Alcibiades, but nobody could tell whether <lb/>
            he would advise or oppose the return of <lb/>
            the exile. Aeschylus had spoken <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭαφῶς</foreign> ; <lb/>
            there was no doubt as to the course he <lb/>
            advised, viz. that the state, having the <lb/>
            misfortune to possess an Alcibiades, <lb/>
            should bear with his humours, and avail <lb/>
            itself of his talents. The reply of <lb/>
            Euripides was clever, the reply of <lb/>
            Aeschylus was clear.</p>

            It cannot be doubted that the words <lb/>

            What plan of safety for the state ye've got.</p>
          <p>EUR. [First with Cinesias wing Cleocritus, <lb/>
            Then zephyrs waft them o'er the watery plain.</p>
          <p>Dio. A funny sight, I own : but whereas the sense ?</p>
          <p>EUR. If, when the fleets engage, they holding cruets <lb/>
            Should rain down vinegar in the foemen's eyes,] <lb/>
            I know, and I can tell you. Dio. Tell away.</p>
          <p>Euit. When things, mistrusted now, shall trusted be, <lb/>
            And trusted things, mistrusted. Dio. How ! I don't <lb/>
            Quite comprehend. Be clear, and not so clever.</p>
          <p>EUR. If we mistrust those citizens of ours <lb/>
            Whom now we trust, and those employ whom now <lb/>
            We don't employ, the city will be saved. <lb/>
            If on our present tack we fail, we surely</p>
          <p>place, or whether we have again here, <lb/>
            in juxtaposition, passages from the <lb/>
            original and revised editions (so to speak) <lb/>
            of the Frogs, it is difficult to form an <lb/>
            opinion. Cleocritus was a gawky mis- <lb/>
            shapen Athenian, who from some pecu- <lb/>
            liarity of appearance or gait was thought <lb/>
            to resemble an ostrich ; see Birds 877. <lb/>
            And as an ostrich has no wings for flight, <lb/>
            he is to be furnished with wings in the <lb/>
            person of the extravagantly slim and <lb/>
            slender Cinesias. See Birds 1372-8. <lb/>
            These two will then rise from the earth <lb/>
            and be wafted by the breezes over the <lb/>
            watery plain. Thence, when the fleets <lb/>
            are engaged in battle, they will rain <lb/>
            down vinegar into the eyes of the foe. <lb/>
            And so, says Bergler, the foe being <lb/>
            blinded will be all the more easily <lb/>
            defeated. See Schömann (Opuscula, i. <lb/>
            308), who thinks, with much probability, <lb/>
            that the following line is taken as it <lb/>
            stands from some lost play of Euripides.</p>
          <p>1442. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγὼ μὲν οἶδα</foreign>] The question <lb/>
            having been asked, Euripides, like a <lb/>
            forward boy in a school class, is eager to <lb/>
            announce at once that he is prepared <lb/>
            with the answer.</p>
          <p>1445. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμαθέϭτερον</foreign>] This verse seems <lb/>
            to have been turned into the proverb <lb/>

            difference in signification between these <lb/>
            words and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὗ γ</foreign>’, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧ Πόϭειδον</foreign> of 1430 <lb/>

            pides himself, as a compliment to his <lb/>
            amazing cleverness. The artfulness of <lb/>
            Palamede foiled even the craft of Odys- <lb/>
            seus. The latter, to avoid the necessity <lb/>
            of joining in the Trojan expedition, <lb/>
            feigned himself mad, and ploughing with <lb/>
            an ox and an ass pretended to sow salt <lb/>
            in the furrows ; but Palamede, placing <lb/>
            the infant Telemachus before the <lb/>
            plough, at once discovered the sanity of <lb/>
            the ploughman. He was also famous <lb/>
            as the inventor of dice, and many other <lb/>
            discoveries. Euripides gave his name <lb/>
            to one of his plays, which is parodied in <lb/>

            war (Thuc. i. 140-144). "What if the <lb/>
            enemy ravages Attica ? So long as <lb/>
            Athens is mistress of the sea, the whole <lb/>
            world will be open to her fleets." The <lb/>
            third line conveys the same advice in <lb/>
            another form. They are to consider <lb/>
            their fleet to be their real wealth ; and <lb/>
            mere money stores, not expended on <lb/>
            their fleet, to be unworthy of the name <lb/>
            of wealth. Dionysus concurs in this, but <lb/>
            as to spending money on the fleet, he <lb/>
            observes that the dicasts alone absorb it <lb/>
            all, atra, To <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρήματα</foreign> involved in the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρον</foreign>. This observation is in striking <lb/>
            contrast to the argument in Wasps 660-5, <lb/>
            where it is shown that not one tithe of <lb/>
            the revenue went into the pockets of the <lb/>
            dicasts. And although since that date <lb/>
            the revenue had greatly declined, the <lb/>
            statement here is doubtless a comic ex- <lb/>
            aggeration. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταπίνει</foreign> is em- <lb/>
            ployed in precisely the same signification <lb/>
            by St. Chrysostom (Horn. i. in Titum, <lb/>
            735 A), <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταπίνει τὰ τῶν πενήτων</foreign>.</p><pb n="222"/>

            have been given; the statement is <lb/>
            placed in the mouth of Euripides merely <lb/>
            as an opening for the retort which is <lb/>
            immediately delivered. The crisis of <lb/>
            the drama has arrived, and Aristophanes <lb/>
            surrounds it with a series of brilliant <lb/>
            repartees which must have been irresis- <lb/>

            singular <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμὲ</foreign> was probably derived from <lb/>
            the scene in the Hippolytus (607-613) <lb/>
            which gives us also the succeeding <lb/>
            line. Hippolytus has pledged himself <lb/>
            not to reveal the secret which the nurse <lb/>
            is desirous of unfolding, but when he <lb/>
            hears what the secret is, when he learns <lb/>
            that his stepmother Phaedra has con- <lb/>
            ceived an incestuous passion for himself, <lb/>
            he at first declines to be bound by his <lb/>
            oath, and to keep the intelligence from <lb/>
            his father. The nurse declares that she <lb/>
            will be ruined if he repeats her tale, <lb/>
            and the following dialogue ensues :— <figure type="illustration">

            one of the earliest and keenest of <lb/>

            them himself, came as a shock to the <lb/>
            honest instincts of Athenian morality. <lb/>
            The suggestion that perjury might in <lb/>
            some cases be justified, especially on so <lb/>
            flimsy a plea as that the mind had not <lb/>

          <p>might well seem to imperil the very <lb/>
            framework of society : and perhaps no <lb/>
            line that ever was written made so deep <lb/>
            an impression on the public as the line, <lb/>
            quoted in the preceding note, from <lb/>
            which the words in the text were bor- <lb/>
            rowed. Aristophanes thrice refers to it, <lb/>
            here, supra 101, and still earlier in <lb/>
            Thesm. 275. In the last-mentioned <lb/>
            passage Euripides pledges his oath to <lb/>
            Mnesilochus that he will not desert him, <lb/>
            whereupon Mnesilochus responds :— <lb/>
            And please remember 'twas your MIND that swore, <lb/>
            Not your tongue only : please remember that.</p>
          <p>Plato alludes to it twice, Theactetus, <lb/>
            154 D; Symposium, 199 A. Cephisodo- <lb/>
            rus, a disciple of Isolates, selected <lb/>
            this line as a special instance of the <lb/>
            immoral sayings of poets and sophists. <lb/>
            —Ath. iii. 94. Aristotle in the Rhetoric <lb/>
            (iii. 15. 8) tells us that, Euripides being <lb/>
            involved in a lawsuit, his opponent up- <lb/>
            braided him with this line, apparently <lb/>
            meaning that the poet could not be <lb/>
            trusted even when speaking upon oath ; <lb/>
            whereto Euripides replied that his op- <lb/>
            ponent was himself acting illegally, in <lb/>
            bringing before the legal judges a rem <lb/>
            judicatam, a matter of which the theatri- <lb/>
            cal judges had already disposed. Lucian <lb/>
            refers to it in his Vitarum auctio, 9. <lb/>
            Cicero (De Officiis, iii. 29) shows that on <lb/>
            philosophical grounds the aphorism may <lb/>
            well be supported. However, in the <lb/>
            play itself, Hippolytus himself abandons <lb/>
            it. Many other passages are collected <lb/>
            by the industry of Valckenaer and Bp. <lb/>
            Monk in their notes on the Hippolytus. <lb/>
            Origen condemns a sect of heretics for <lb/>
            teaching that it was no sin to deny their <lb/>
            Lord with their tongue, so that they <lb/>
            denied him not with their heart, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ <lb/>

            from another questionable line of Euri- <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκῇ</foreign>; It occurred in his Aeolus, that <lb/>
            notorious play which represented the <lb/>
            incestuous union of a brother and sister <lb/>
            (see the note on 863 supra) ; and, taken <lb/>
            literally, it seemed to make right and <lb/>
            wrong depend upon the opiuion of the <lb/>
            agent. What’s wrong if they who do it <lb/>
            think not so? It was believed in after <lb/>
            times, that when these words were first <lb/>
            pronounced by the actor, a great tumult <lb/>
            arose in the theatre, and a voice, which <lb/>
            tradition ascribed to Antisthenes, was <lb/>
            heard to reply, Nay, wrong is wrong, <lb/>
            whatever men may think, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχρὸν τό γ</foreign>’ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰσχρὸν, κἂν δοκῇ κἂν μὴ δακῇ</foreign>. (Plutarch, <lb/>
            De Andiendis Poetis, 12.) Athenaeus <lb/>
            (xiii, chap. 45) quotes some lines of <lb/>
            Machon, in which the Corinthian Lais, <lb/>
            like Dionysus here, makes use of this <lb/>
            line to barb a cutting repartee against <lb/>
            Euripides himself. The lines may be <lb/>
            roughly rendered as follows :— <lb/>
            Lais of Corinth, so the story goes, <lb/>
            Beheld Euripides with pen and tablet <lb/>
            Out in a garden. Poet, she exclaimed, <lb/>
            Whatever made you say in your Medea, <lb/>
            " Off, shameless hussy" ? Then the bard, amazed <lb/>
            At the girl's cheek, said, Are you not yourself <lb/>
            A shameless hussy? Lais laughed, and answered, <lb/>
            What's shameless if your lovers think not so?</p>
          <p>The exclamation <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρῤ αἰσχραποιὲ</foreign> is from <lb/>
            Jason's speech to Medea (Med. 1343). <lb/>
            The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρωμέναις</foreign>, as used by the poet, <lb/>
            means merely the performers of the act <lb/>
            in question ; as used by the courtesan, <lb/>
            it means her lovers : cf. Wasps 1028, <lb/>
            and the note there. Fritzsche's conjec- <lb/>
            ture that the preceding line, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴσχιστον <lb/>
            ἕργον πρασβλέπεις μ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰργασμένος</foreign>; also <lb/>
            came from the Aeolus, and was addressed <lb/>
            by Aeolus to his incestuous son, to <lb/>
            which Macareus replied with the line <lb/>
            before us, would destroy the whole <lb/>
            humour of the passage. Dionysus would <lb/>
            be merely continuing a quotation, in- <lb/>
            stead of making a felicitous and un- <lb/>
            expected repartee ; and Euripides must <lb/>
            have been deserted by all his <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαφία</foreign> <lb/>
            when he deliberately led up to such a <lb/>
            damaging retort.</p>
          <p>1476. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεθνηκάτα</foreign>] Probably as he utters <lb/>
            this word,Euripides drops to the ground,</p><pb n="225"/>
            
          <p>Dio. What's shameful, if the audience think not so ?</p>
          <p>EUR. Have you no heart ? Wretch, would you leave me dead ?</p>
          <p>DID. Who knows if death be life, and life be death, <lb/>
            And breath be mutton broth, and sleep a sheepskin ?</p>
          <p>PLUTO. Now, Dionysus, come ye in, DID. What for ?</p>
          <p>PLUTO. And sup before ye go. Dio. A bright idea.</p>
          <p>and there remains, after the fashion of <lb/>
            Cleon in the Knights, till the conclusion <lb/>
            of the play.</p>
          <p>1477. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίς οἶδεν</foreign>] Yet a third time <lb/>
            Dionysus replies to the disappointed <lb/>
            tragedian with a line borrowed from <lb/>
            his own tragedies, and a third time <lb/>
            Euripides rots <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκείοις πτεροῖς ἁλίσκεται</foreign>. <lb/>
            The idea is twice found in the fragments <lb/>
            of Euripides : <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig321.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              And again</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig322.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>Some discover in these passages a fore- <lb/>
            cast of the sublime doctrine of the <lb/>
            Faith. And truly the language is well <lb/>
            adapted to express the Christian view of <lb/>
            death. A great Persian archbishop, <lb/>
            exhorting his fellow martyrs in Sapor's <lb/>
            persecution, declared <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζωὴν ἀληθῶς εἶναι</foreign> <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧδε ἀποθανεῖν</foreign> (Sozomen, Eccl. Hist. ii. <lb/>
            10). And Theodoret's ordinary way of <lb/>
            recording a Christian's death is to say <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὴν ἀγήρω καὶ ἄλυπον μετέστη ζωὴν</foreign>, <lb/>
            "he passed to the life which knows, no <lb/>
            ending, the tearless life." And see <lb/>
            Plato's Gorgias, chap. 47. However, on <lb/>
            the lips of Euripides the lines seem <lb/>
            rather to be an expression of philosophic <lb/>
            doubt. " What do we know of life or <lb/>
            death ? We call those yet on earth, <lb/>
            the living, and those in the world below, <lb/>
            the dead. Yet, perchance, those in the <lb/>
            world below call our state death, and <lb/>
            their own life." The next line, of <lb/>
            course, is a mere burlesque addition of <lb/>
            Dionysus.</p>
          <p>1479. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δαί</foreign>] Dionysus seems a little <lb/>
            surprised, if not a little alarmed, at <lb/>
            receiving an invitation from Pluto. <lb/>
            And in truth the real reason why Pluto <lb/>
            seeks to get him behind the scenes is to <lb/>
            deprive him of the professional actor <lb/>
            who has hitherto represented Dionysus, <lb/>
            but who in the closing scene is to give <lb/>
            greater dignity to the utterances of <lb/>
            Pluto. Accordingly when Pluto re- <lb/>
            appears at line 1500 he is represented <lb/>
            by the state actor, and becomes the <lb/>
            chief speaker, whilst Dionysus, if he <lb/>
            reappears at all, is represented by <lb/>
            Pluto's choregic actor, and sinks into <lb/>
            the unwonted position of a mute.</p>

            probably accompanied by other ban- <lb/>
            queters, amongst whom may perhaps <lb/>
            have appeared the venerable form of <lb/>
            Sophocles, re-enter the stage : and the <lb/>
            former (now represented by one of the <lb/>
            three state actors) bids farewell to <lb/>
            the victorious poet, and entrusts him <lb/>
            with a commission to be executed on <lb/>
            his return to Athens. He is to present <lb/>
            halters to several obnoxious citizens, <lb/>
            who are to terminate their existence <lb/>
            therewith without unnecessary delay. <lb/>
            And if they hesitate, then Pluto, who <lb/>

            Athens, and after branding and fetter- <lb/>
            ing them as his runaway slaves, will <lb/>
            drive them before him to the under- <lb/>
            world. The first line of Pluto's speech <lb/>
            is very similar to a line (154) in the <lb/>
            Peace, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ aIe, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πήγασε, χώρει χαίρων</foreign>, <lb/>
            but the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρει χαίρων</foreign> have not <lb/>
            quite the same meaning in the two <lb/>
            lines, since here, as in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴθι χαίρων</foreign> of <lb/>
            Knights 498, Wasps 1009, and elsewhere, <lb/>
            they involve the notion of "farewell," <lb/>
            which is absent in the line of the Peace.</p>
          <p>1501. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμετέραν</foreign>] In this last solemn <lb/>
            scene-for a solemn scene it is, although <lb/>
            it occurs in a comedy-Pluto, as Dr. <lb/>
            Merry observes, is paying a compliment <lb/>
            to Athens, by identifying himself with <lb/>
            her citizens. The Scholiast's explana- <lb/>
            tion, TOVTO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔφη ὁ Πλούτων ἐπεὶ προσήκει ἡ</foreign> <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αττικὴ Δήμητρι καὶ Κόρῃ</foreign>, is a little too <lb/>
            far-fetched. <lb/>

            the Scholiast, and again on the following <lb/>

            And it seems to me far more probable <lb/>
            that he gives three halters than that, <lb/>
            as Elmsley suggests in a note on Ach. <lb/>
            784, he gives a dagger for one, a halter <lb/>
            for another, and hemlock for the third. <lb/>
            As to Cleophon, see supra 678, infra. <lb/>
            1532. He at least was not slow in <lb/>
            obeying the . summons of Pluto, dying <lb/>
            in the following year.</p>

            of taxes, and apparently of superintend- <lb/>
            ing the collection of the taxes. They <lb/>
            were our Chancellor of the Exchequer, <lb/>

            For many a fool dwells there. <lb/>
            And this to Cleophon give, my friend, <lb/>
            And this to the revenue-raising crew, <lb/>
            Nicomachus, Myrmex, next I send, <lb/>
            And this to Archenomus too. <lb/>
            And bid them all that without delay, <lb/>
            To my realm of the dead they hasten away. <lb/>
            For if they loiter above, I swear <lb/>
            I'll come myself and arrest them there. <lb/>
            And branded and fettered the slaves shall go, <lb/>
            With the vilest rascal in all the town, <lb/>
            Adeimantus, son of Leucolophus, down,</p>
          <p>that Euripides (possibly the poet's son) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπόρισεν</foreign>, that is, devised as one of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορισταὶ</foreign> the means of raising it by a <lb/>
            property tax of 2½ per cent. The people <lb/>
            were delighted to think that so large <lb/>
            a sum could be raised by so slight an <lb/>
            imposition ; but when it was found that <lb/>
            the tax did not realize anything like <lb/>
            the required amount, Euripides was <lb/>
            abused as cordially as he had at first <lb/>
            been praised. Myrmex and Nicomachus <lb/>
            are supposed to have been guilty of <lb/>
            embezzlement in carrying out their <lb/>
            financial schemes : and it is probably <lb/>
            to these very persons, and to this very <lb/>
            passage, that the gloss of Photius and <lb/>
            of Suidas refers, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πορισταί. οἱ τοὺς πόρους <lb/>
            εἰσηγούμενοι δημαγωγοὶ ἐπὶ τῷ έαυτῶν <lb/>
            λυσιτελεῖ</foreign>. And certainly if this is, as <lb/>
            Paulmier supposes, the Nicomachus <lb/>
            against whom Lysias inveighs in his <lb/>
            thirtieth oration, we can well believe <lb/>
            him to have been guilty of any amount <lb/>
            of embezzlement. And see the note on <lb/>
            1083 supra. It is interesting to observe <lb/>
            that, in the speech of Lysias, Nicomachus <lb/>
            is said by means of a forged law to <lb/>
            have brought about the death of <lb/>
            Cleophon. Of Myrmex and Archenomus <lb/>
            nothing is known.</p>
          <p>1513. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀδειμάντου</foreign>] What induced the <lb/>
            poet to include Adeimantus in his list <lb/>
            of reprobates, we cannot tell: but that <lb/>
            he had good reason for doing so may <lb/>
            be inferred from the fact that this <lb/>
            Adeimantus is the Athenian commander <lb/>
            who was credited with having, a few <lb/>
            months later, on the fatal day of <lb/>
            Aegospotami, betrayed to Lysander the <lb/>
            entire Athenian fleet. His father, here <lb/>
            called Leucolophus, is elsewhere called <lb/>
            Leucolophides (Xen. Hell. i. 4. 21; <lb/>
            Plato, Protagoras, 7). Possibly he was <lb/>
            Leucolophus, the son of Leucolophus,</p><pb n="230"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig325.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>and was therefore sometimes called by <lb/>
            his patronymic to distinguish him from <lb/>
            his own father. This double nomen- <lb/>
            clature is by no means uncommon. The <lb/>
            father of Euripides is called indifferently <lb/>
            Mnesarchus and Mnesarchides ,see Suidas <lb/>
            s. v. Euripides. The archon eponymus <lb/>
            for the year 394-3 is sometimes called <lb/>
            Eubulus, and sometimes Eubulides. See <lb/>
            Clinton's F. H. on that year. And many <lb/>
            other examples might be given.</p>
          <p>1519. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭοΦίο̣</foreign>] That is, in the art of <lb/>
            tragedy. Cf. supra 766, 776, 780.</p>
          <p>1524. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φαίνετε</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρὸς τὸν χορόν. ἀντὶ <lb/>

            torches were lighted when the Chorus <lb/>
            entered, supra 313, 344, but were <lb/>
            probably extinguished at line 459, if <lb/>
            not before. Here the mystics are bidden <lb/>
            to relight them, Light for him the holy <lb/>
            torches, and doubtless obey the order at <lb/>
            once. There is much in these directions, <lb/>
            as Bergler observes, which recalls the <lb/>

            is regarded in its metrical aspect (see <lb/>

            Meanwhile to Sophocles here commit, <lb/>

            Till I come once more by thy side to sit. <lb/>
            But as for that rascally scoundrel there, <lb/>
            That low buffoon, that worker of ill, <lb/>
            O let him not sit in my vacant chair, <lb/>
            Not even against his will.</p>
          <p>PLUTO. (To the Chorus.) Escort him up with your mystic throngs, <lb/>
            While the holy torches quiver and blaze. <lb/>
            Escort him up with his own sweet songs, <lb/>
            And his noble festival lays.</p>
          <p>CHOR. First, as the poet triumphant is passing away to the light, <lb/>
            Grant him success on his journey, ye powers that are ruling below. <lb/>
            Grant that he find for the city good counsels to guide her aright; <lb/>
            So we at last shall be freed from the anguish, the fear, and the woe, <lb/>
            Freed from the onsets of war. Let Cleophon now and his band</p>
          <p>the six hexameters with which the play <lb/>
            concludes belong to Aeschylus. The <lb/>
            words are the words of Aristophanes, <lb/>
            though naturally in composing the <lb/>
            verses he gives even to the language <lb/>
            itself an Aeschylean colouring. The <lb/>
            Scholiast quotes from the Glaucus Pot- <lb/>
            niensis, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐοδίαν μὲν πρῶτον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">στόματος <lb/>
            χέομέν</foreign> [o-ot] : and Bergler from the <lb/>
            Eumenides (966), <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴη δ' ἀγαθῶν ἀγαθὴ <lb/>
            διάνοια πολίταις</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλος</foreign> signifies the <lb/>
            final triumph of the metre assailed by <lb/>
            Euripides, supra 1264-1292.</p>
          <p>1532. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΚλεοΦῶν</foreign>] Of the career of this <lb/>
            demagogue we have few details beyond <lb/>
            the fact that on two distinct occasions <lb/>
            he was the evil genius of Athens, <lb/>
            persuading her to reject a peace which <lb/>
            was her only hope of salvation. First, <lb/>
            after the brilliant success of Alcibiades <lb/>
            at Cyzicus (Diod. Sic. xiii. 53), and <lb/>
            again after the more important victory <lb/>
            of Arginusae (Aristotle's Polity of <lb/>
            Athens, chap. 34), the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            made overtures to Athens for the con- <lb/>
            clusion of a general peace on the uti <lb/>
            possedetis principle ; and on each occa-, <lb/>
            sion it was mainly through the in- <lb/>
            strumentality of Cleophon that these <lb/>
            overtures were rejected. Well might <lb/>
            Aeschines (adv. Ctes. 150) aver that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΚλεοΦῶν τὴν πόλιν ἀπώλεσεν</foreign>. His out-</p><pb n="232"/>

          <p>rageous conduct on the second occasion <lb/>
            is narrated by Aristotle, ubi supra, and <lb/>
            Aeschines de F. L. 80, and having <lb/>
            occurred shortly before the exhibition <lb/>
            of. this play is doubtless the reason why <lb/>
            he is here bidden to go and fight, since <lb/>
            fighting is what he so much desires, in <lb/>
            his native fields of Thrace (his mother's <lb/>
            country, see supra 678 and the note <lb/>
            there, and see also the Introduction to <lb/>
            this play). The advice here given to <lb/>
            Cleophon may remind the reader of <lb/>
            that given, though for a very different <lb/>
            reason, to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πατραλοίας</foreign> in the <lb/>

            possibly, like Cleophon himself, may <lb/>

            their veins. Let Cleophon, and such as <lb/>
            Cleophon, go and fight in their own <lb/>

          <p>THE ancient critics, in selecting the plays of the Athenian dramatists <lb/>
            which have come down to the modern world, usually commenced their <lb/>
            Aristophanic series with the Plutus, the Clouds, and the Frogs. And <lb/>
            as their selections have not always come to our hands in a complete <lb/>
            form, there are more MSS. of these three plays than of any other <lb/>
            comedy of Aristophanes. Whilst some of the later plays of the series <lb/>
            exist in a few MSS. only, there are no less than thirty MSS. which <lb/>
            contain the whole or part of the Frogs.</p>
          <p>The letters by which the MSS. are designated vary in different <lb/>
            editions of Aristophanes, and in none (except in the case of two or <lb/>
            three of the principal MSS.) bear any relation to the MSS. themselves. <lb/>
            I have therefore recast the nomenclature, denoting all the Venetian <lb/>
            MSS. by the letter V, all the Parisian by P, all the Florentine by F, <lb/>
            the Milanese by M, the Oxford by 0, the Cambridge by C, the <lb/>
            London by L, that of Modena by m, that of Munich (the initial being <lb/>
            already appropriated) by H, the Viennese by W, the Elbing by E, and <lb/>
            the Borgian by B, whilst I have retained the letters R and U for <lb/>
            the Ravenna and the Vaticano-Urbinas respectively. The Parisian <lb/>
            MSS. having been collated by Brunck, I have, for convenience sake, <lb/>
            included among the P's his own private MS., which subsequently <lb/>

          <p>The editions of the Frogs in my own possession, from which the <lb/>
            following synopsis is compiled, are as follows. As in most of the <lb/>
            MSS., so in all the editions before Bekker, the Plutus, the Clouds, and <lb/>
            the Frogs are the first three comedies given:- <lb/>

            a few notes of his). <lb/>
            (13) Faber. Amsterdam, 1670 (hardly more than a reprint of <lb/>
            Scaliger's, with the addition of Le Fevre's Ecclesiazusae). <lb/>

            the Frogs are by Beck. By some oversight Bekker <lb/>
            attributes them to Dindorf.) <lb/>

          <p>A complete enumeration of all the various readings of the MSS. <lb/>
            and editions, and of all the, conjectures of critics, would be far too <lb/>
            lengthy and confusing for a work of this character; and only those <lb/>
            are given which seem of some possible interest. It is needless to say <lb/>
            that great assistance has been derived from Dr. Blaydes's collection <lb/>
            of various readings and conjectures; assistance for which I am all the <lb/>
            more grateful, because I had to compile the Appendices to the Peace <lb/>
            and the Wasps without it.</p>
          <p>It is perhaps desirable to explain that words cited from the text <lb/>
            are given the accent required by their position in the text, and not <lb/>
            that required by their altered position in the Appendix.</p><pb n="238"/>
            
          <p>4. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χολή</foreign>. Dawes proposed to read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολή</foreign>, treating the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλὴν πιέξομοι, <lb/>
            τοῦτο δὲ Φύλαξαι</foreign> as parenthetical, and <lb/>
            translating Immo quidquid tibi lubet <lb/>
            (praeterquam, "premor," ab hoc autem <lb/>
            temperes velim), omnino enim jam vacat. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οχολή</foreign> appears in some MSS. of Suidas, <lb/>
            s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πᾴνν γάρ</foreign> eUr' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤδη χολή</foreign>, and it was <lb/>
            originally written in, but afterwards <lb/>
            erased from P. Ps. But it was justly <lb/>
            condemned by Bentley; and Thiersch <lb/>
            is the only editor who has adopted it in <lb/>
            preference to the MS. reading.</p>
          <p>7, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε μόνον ἐκεῖν</foreign>' V. and all the <lb/>
            best MSS. (save that R. omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκεῖν</foreign>'alto- <lb/>
            gether) Bentley, Brunck, Invernizzi, <lb/>
            Bekker, Bothe, Bergk, Kock, Velsen, <lb/>
            Van Leeuwen. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γ'ἐκεῖνο μόνον</foreign> a few <lb/>
            inferior MSS. and the other editions.</p>
          <p>15. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖςσκευοΦοροῦσιν</foreign>. All the editions <lb/>
            before Brunck read <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκεύη Φέρουσ</foreign>' in two <lb/>
            words, placing a colon, some after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιεῖν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and others after <foreign xml:lang="grc">Άμειψίας</foreign>, and taking <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φέρουσ</foreign>' to be the third person plural of <lb/>
            the present indicative. They therefore <lb/>
            make Xanthias impart to the audience <lb/>
            the irrelevant information that certain <lb/>
            of their popular comedians " are always <lb/>
            bearing burdens in their comedies." <lb/>
            Brunck was the first, and perhaps the <lb/>
            only editor, and (with the exception of <lb/>
            Reiske) the first, and perhaps the only <lb/>
            scholar, who rightly comprehended the <lb/>
            meaning of the passage. He found in <lb/>
            P. and P5. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκευηΦοροῦσ</foreign>'written in one <lb/>
            word, and in P3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκευοΦοροῦσ</foreign>' with, what <lb/>
            was more suggestive, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς</foreign> optima glossa <lb/>
            superscripta, and saw at once that <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκευη- <lb/>
            Φοροῦσ</foreign>' (as he read it) was the dative <lb/>
            plural of the participle, as indeed Reiske <lb/>
            had seen before. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φέρουσι</foreign>, said Reiske, <lb/>
            est datirus pluralis cohaerens cum <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιεῖν</foreign>. <lb/>
            Brunck therefore wrote the line <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκευηΦο- <lb/>
            ροῦϭ' έκάϭτοτ</foreign>'. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭκευΦορείν</foreign> is really <lb/>
            vox nihili ; the compound is <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκενορείν</foreign>. <lb/>
            The article <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς</foreign> seems absolutely neces- <lb/>
            sary ; and scholars insist, perhaps with <lb/>
            too great strictness, that the final iota <lb/>
            of the dative cannot suffer elision. <lb/>
            I therefore read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῖς σκευοΦοροῦσιν. τοῖς <lb/>
            σκευοΦοροῦσινι</foreign>s found in the Scholiast; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς σκεοΦοροῦσ</foreign>'in C. and (with the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς</foreign> superscribed) in O. and P3. It would <lb/>
            be easy to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς σκευοΦόροιςι</foreign>f it is <lb/>
            wished to adopt the idea propounded <lb/>
            by Elmsley on Ach. 178 ; but this form <lb/>
            receives no support from the MSS., and <lb/>
            the two anapaests in the second and <lb/>
            third places are of very common occur- <lb/>
            rence, being found in two more lines <lb/>
            within the next sixty lines of this play. <lb/>
            The other MS. readings are <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκευοΦορῦσ</foreign>' <lb/>
            (which of course is unmetrical without <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς</foreign>) M. V1. Suidas s.v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λύκις. σκευη- <lb/>
            Φοροῦσ</foreign>' V. P. P5. F1. F2. F3. F5- M1. m. <lb/>

            Φέρουσ</foreign>' P2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἵ σκευοΦοροῦσ</foreign>'V2. Cl. And <lb/>
            this was Porson's suggestion, and has on <lb/>
            his great authority been adopted by <lb/>
            Thiersch, Merry, and Blaydes, notwith- <lb/>
            standing that it is vitiated by the patent <lb/>
            absurdity, mentioned above, of making <lb/>
            Xanthias impart the information to the <lb/>
            spectators. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἵτινες σκευηΦοροῦσ</foreign>' H. Most <lb/>
            recent editors either bracket or omit <lb/>
            the line, though it is really essential <lb/>
            to the sense.</p>
          <p>20. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρεῖ</foreign>. Cobet prosaically proposes <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐρῶ</foreign>, which Meineke introduces into the <lb/>
            text.</p>
          <p>27. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕνος</foreign>(for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ὄνος</foreign>). So MSS. and <lb/>
            editions except as hereinafter mentioned. <lb/>
            R. and E. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄνος</foreign>, which is brought <lb/>
            into the text by Invernizzi, Fritzsche, <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            and Meineke, who absurdly suppose that <lb/>
            Dionysus meant to imply that Xanthias <lb/>
            is an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄνος</foreign>.This characteristic little <lb/>
            dialogue, 26-9, is by Hamaker character- <lb/>
            istically struck out.</p>

            F5. m. (the only MS. reading which <lb/>
            satisfies the metre) Brunck, Invernizzi, <lb/>
            Bothe, Bergk, Paley. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτταταῖ ... τῷ <lb/>
            Κλεισθένει</foreign> P. P2. P3. P5. V1. V2. and the <lb/>
            great bulk of the MSS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτταταῖ... <lb/>

          <p>67. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ταῦτα</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεθνηκότας</foreign>. These <lb/>
            words, without the note of interrogation, <lb/>
            form part of the uninterrupted speech <lb/>
            of Dionysus in the MSS. and early <lb/>
            editions. Kuster, following some ancient <lb/>
            critics mentioned by the Scholiast, was <lb/>
            the first to transfer them to Heracles, <lb/>
            and to add the note of interrogation. <lb/>
            Kuster's alteration, though overlooked <lb/>
            for a time, is followed by Fritzsche and <lb/>
            all subsequent editors.</p>
          <p>76. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign>. The MSS. and early editions <lb/>
            have <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχὶ</foreign>, but Bentley, observing that <lb/>
            the last syllable of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΣαΦακλέα</foreign> is long, <lb/>
            proposed either to change <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχὶ</foreign> into ov, <lb/>
            or to omit <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄντ</foreign>'. The former alternative <lb/>
            is adopted by Dindorf and all subsequent <lb/>
            editors. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄντ' " ἀντ</foreign>'confidenter corrigit <lb/>

            —Blaydes. And so Van Leeuwen. But <lb/>
            Heracles, proposing that Dionysus should <lb/>
            bring back Sophocles instead of Euripi- <lb/>
            des, was bound to give some reason for <lb/>
            his suggestion; and this is furnished <lb/>
            by the MS., but not by the proposed, <lb/>
            reading. And indeed if no such reason <lb/>
            were required, I should prefer Bentley's <lb/>
            second alternative to Palmer's correc- <lb/>

            alterations for the reading of the vast <lb/>
            majority of the MSS. Thus Meineke <lb/>
            and Blaydes read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποῦ σθ' ; ὅπου 'στ' ; <lb/>
            ἀπαλιπών μ' οἴχεται</foreign>. and Velsen and Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen (after a conjecture of Cobet) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποῦ ποτ' ἔστ'; ὀπολιπώνμ'οἴχετοι</foreign>. <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig328.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="240"/>
              </p>
          <p><foreign xml:lang="grc">των</foreign>, And Dobree conjectured that <foreign xml:lang="grc">σο- <lb/>
            Φοῖς</foreign> and not <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φίλοις</foreign> is the true reading <lb/>
            here; a conjecture approved, though <lb/>
            not adopted, by Blaydes. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φίλοις</foreign>, <lb/>
            even if not a reminiscence of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦ ποθει- <lb/>
            νὸς Φίλοις</foreign> of Eur. Phoen. 320, is better <lb/>
            suited to the context and infinitely <lb/>
            more harmonious. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸς</foreign>at the <lb/>
            commencement of the line is a tribute <lb/>
            to the genial, kindly nature of the man, <lb/>
            which his friends would especially <lb/>
            regret. And so great a master of har- <lb/>
            mony as Aristophanes would hardly, in <lb/>
            a line in which every word, except the <lb/>
            copula, ends with the letter <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>, have un <lb/>
            necessarily introduced an additional <lb/>
            sibilant.</p>
          <p>90. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύρια</foreign>. Van Leeuwen reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">μνρίας</foreign>, <lb/>
            after a conjecture of Dindorf.</p>
          <p>103. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μἀλλὰ</foreign> Dobree (after Porson's <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ ἀλλὰ</foreign>), Dindorf, recentiores, except <lb/>
            Bothe and Thiersch. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλα</foreign> V. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάλα</foreign> <lb/>

            Dobree proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ καὶ σοὶ δοκεῖ</foreign>;</p>
          <p>114. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανδοκεντρίας</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Her- <lb/>
            werden would substitute <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανδοκεί'ἄρισθ</foreign>', <lb/>
            Blaydes <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανδοκεῖαχρήσθ</foreign>', whilst Velsen <lb/>
            reads (from his own conjecture) <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανδοκεῖ' <lb/>
            ἔπειθ</foreign>'.</p>
          <p>116. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰέναι καὶ σύ</foreign>ye ; MSS. vulgo. <lb/>
            Seidler proposed to transfer the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ σύγε</foreign> to the reply of Dionysus, so <lb/>
            that the dialogue would run <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰέναι ; ΔΙ. <lb/>
            καὶ σύ</foreign> ye <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μηδὲν ἔτι κ.τ.λ</foreign>. And this sug- <lb/>
            gestion is adopted by Dindorf, Holden, <lb/>
            Paley, Kock, Velsen, recentiores. But <lb/>
            I agree with Fritzsche, who says, " Vul- <lb/>
            gala lectio et per se aptissima est (tu <lb/>
            adeo, inquit, cum tua ignavia, ut ego ire <lb/>
            audebis?) et concinne refertur ad v. 108- <lb/>
            111, ubi agebatur de HercuIis ad inferos <lb/>

            saria est, turn orationem e gravi reddit <lb/>
            languidam." And the MS. reading is <lb/>
            supported also by Hermann, Bergk, and <lb/>
            Meineke.</p>
          <p>117. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ὁδῶν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Fritzsche <lb/>
            altered it into <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῷν ὁδὸν</foreign>, and the altera- <lb/>

            before Brunck, and Bothe afterwards.</p>
          <p>142. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θησεὺς ἤγαγεν</foreign>. Brunck inserted <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφ</foreign>' between these words, an unnecessary <lb/>
            alteration, in which no editor has fol- <lb/>
            lowed him.</p>
          <p>149. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠλοίησεν</foreign> R. V. M. U. and (sub- <lb/>
            stantially) the MSS. generally, and all <lb/>
            the editions before Brunck, and Bekker <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            and Bergk afterwards. Brunck intro- <lb/>
            duced the "more Attic" form <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠλόησεν</foreign> <lb/>
            from Suidas, and is followed by the other <lb/>
            recent editors. See infra on 819 and 826.</p>
          <p>150. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄρκον</foreign> MSS. vulgo. But the word <lb/>
            is omitted in Aldus and Junta, and <lb/>
            made its first appearance (in print) in <lb/>
            Fracini's edition. Then it led a fitful <lb/>
            existence, appearing only in Gormont, <lb/>
            Neobari, and Gelenius, till Kuster finally <lb/>
            established it in its place.</p>
          <p>151. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤ Μορσίμου</foreign> K.r.X. Several editors <lb/>
            have been much exercised at finding a <lb/>
            humorous verse immediately following <lb/>
            a string of serious ones ; and truly, if <lb/>
            Aristophanes had not been a comic <lb/>
            writer, the contrast would have been <lb/>
            worthy of notice. Velsen encloses the <lb/>
            line in brackets. Bergk would insert <lb/>
            it between the two lines which Dionysus <lb/>
            forthwith speaks ; making the first of <lb/>
            the three lines of which that speech <lb/>
            would then consist end with <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> instead <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεἰ</foreign>, the second commence with <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ</foreign> <lb/>
            instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ</foreign>, and the third commence <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν</foreign>. Van Leeuwen <lb/>
            makes it the third line of the same <lb/>
            speech, changing (after Cobet) <foreign xml:lang="grc">τις ῥῆσιν</foreign> <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥῆσίν τιν</foreign>'.</p>
          <p>159. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγων</foreign> vulgo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγω</foreign> R. V. "quae ma- <lb/>
            nifesta est grammaticorum conjectura." <lb/>
            —Fritzsche. It is, h6wever, followed <lb/>
            by Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.</p>
          <p>160. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκαθέξω</foreign> MSS. vulgo. Blaydes <lb/>
            changes it into <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἔτ' ἄξω</foreign>. But Xanthias <lb/>
            means "I will not hold them,'' not "I <lb/>
            will not carry them on," which he has <lb/>
            not yet been ordered to do.</p>
          <p>168. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν ἐκΦερομένων κ.τ.λ</foreign>. Hamaker <lb/>
            would omit this very necessary verse, <lb/>
            and Meineke and Van Leeuwen do so. <lb/>
            What Hamaker's reason was, I know <lb/>
            not. Van Leeuwen's reason is that the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρχεται</foreign> "Attice non it sed venit <lb/>
            significat." And venit is the sense re- <lb/>
            quired here.</p>
          <p>169. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ εὕρω</foreign> (or its equivalents <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηὕρω</foreign> <lb/>
            and the like) is found in all the MSS. <lb/>
            and in all the editions before Dindorf. <lb/>
            The Scholiast, however, whilst recogniz- <lb/>
            ing <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηὕρω</foreign>, observes <foreign xml:lang="grc">γράφεται</foreign> Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχω, <lb/>
            ἤγουν ἐἀν μὴ ἔχω. ἀργύριον</foreign>. I confess that <lb/>
            to me this seems preposterous ; yet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχω</foreign> <lb/>
            is adopted by Dindorf, Bothe, Green, <lb/>
            Merry, and Blaydes. Later in the line <lb/>
            I have, with Bergk and several recent <lb/>
            editors, written <foreign xml:lang="grc">τότἔμ' ἄγεξν</foreign> for the <lb/>
            common reading Tore <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ' ἄγειν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>170. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινες ἐκφέρουσι τουτονὶ</foreign>. This is <lb/>
            the reading of U. P3. F4. and (except <lb/>
            that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκφέρουσι</foreign> they have <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέρουσι</foreign>) of <lb/>
            R. V. M. P. and all the MSS. It is also <lb/>
            the reading of all the editions before <lb/>
            Dindorf. But Elmsley, at Ach. 127, to <lb/>
            prevent an enclitic commencing an <lb/>
            anapaest in a senarius (which, however, <lb/>
            is by no means uncommon) proposed to <lb/>
            alter <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινεςι</foreign>nto <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιν</foreign>', and this alteration <lb/>
            is made by Dindorf, Fritzsche, and all <lb/>
            subsequent editors. But the two accu- <lb/>
            satives, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτυνὶ</foreign>, do not go very <lb/>
            well together, and a nominative is rather <lb/>
            wanted for the verb. Hirschig, there- <lb/>
            fore, changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκφέρουσι τουτονὶ</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκφέ- <lb/>
            ρουσιν οὑτοιὶ</foreign>, and so Meineke, Blaydes, <lb/>
            and Van Leeuwen. But Dionysus is <lb/>
            calling attention to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεκρὸς</foreign>, and not <lb/>
            to the bearers, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτονὶ</foreign> corresponds <lb/>
            with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος</foreign> of the following line. <lb/>
            Hirschig's emendation was perhaps <lb/>
            rendered necessary by Elmsley's ; but it <lb/>
            is far better to sweep away both emen- <lb/>
            dations, and to leave the line as the <lb/>
            MSS. give it. In the same note, and for <note type="footnote"> FROGS </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            the same reason, Elmsley proposed to <lb/>
            omit the enclitic <foreign xml:lang="grc">με</foreign> in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειπνε</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν με <lb/>
            δίδασκε</foreign> of 107 supra : but there his pro- <lb/>
            posal met with no response.</p>

            Cobet's suggestion, reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναβιαην</foreign>. <lb/>

            ing this line, Hamaker, after his manner, <lb/>
            proposed to strike it out; and Meineke <lb/>
            and Van Leeuwen do so ; whilst Velsen <lb/>
            places it between 182 and 183, so that <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωρῶμεν ἐπὶ τὸπλα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">αν</foreign> follow <lb/>
            immediately after <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ πλο</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">άν γ'ὁρῶ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>181, 182. Some recent editors, follow- <lb/>
            ing the suggestion of Enger and Bergk, <lb/>
            distribute these two lines thus :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig329.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              which can hardly be right. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτα ; λίμνη</foreign> <lb/>
              is Dobree's suggestion (for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτο λίμνη</foreign>), <lb/>
              which I have followed with Fritzsche, <lb/>
              Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Paley, Kock, <lb/>
              Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen.</p>
          <p>184. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρ' ὦ Χάρων</foreign>. The Scholiast <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig330.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
              <lb/>
              is obviously the Scholiast's own sugges- <lb/>
              tion, and is very improbable. See the <lb/>
              commentary on 177. It is, however, <lb/>
              adopted by Blaydes, who thus brings <lb/>
              four actors on the stage at once. Van <lb/>
              Leeuwen gives the first <foreign xml:lang="grc">χα</foreign>ȋ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρ' ὦ Χάρων</foreign> to <lb/>
              Dionysus, speaking leni voce; the second <lb/>
              to Xanthias, speaking alta voce; the <lb/>
              third to both Dionysus and Xanthias, <lb/>
              alte clamantibus.</p>
          <p>186. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄναυπόκας</foreign>. So all the MSS., <lb/>
            Greek grammarians, and editions except <lb/>
            Meineke, Kock, and Van Leeuwen, who, <lb/>
            following a suggestion of Conz and <lb/>
            others, read "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οκνου πλοκάς</foreign>; after a <lb/>
            picture by Polygnotus at Delphi, repre- <lb/>
            senting a man named Ocnus weaving a <lb/>
            rope, and a she-ass standing beside him <lb/>
            and eating the rope as fast as he wove <lb/>
            it; an allegory, it is said, of an in- <lb/>
            dustrious worker, whose earnings, as fast <lb/>
            as he made them, were dissipated by A <lb/>
            thriftless wife.-Pansanias, Phocica, 29. <lb/>
            The idea is certainly ingenious, but 1 <lb/>
            agree with Dr. Merry that it is more <lb/>
            ingenious than probable. It is difficult <lb/>
            to see what this allegory can have tu <lb/>
            do with the world after death; no such <lb/>
            proverb as "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οκναυ πλακὰς</foreign> is known to <lb/>
            exist ; and there is an overwhelming <lb/>
            weight of authority the other way,</p>

            non potest Charon cymba sua Taenarum <lb/>
            appulsurus. Charon, of course, is only <lb/>
            going across the lake. His passengers, <lb/>
            like Dionysus and Xanthias, later on, <lb/>
            must find their own way to their several <lb/>

            jected the authority of the great body <lb/>
            of MSS. I cannot tell. The line seems <lb/>
            required by 227 infra, and its omission <lb/>
            in any MS. was probably purely acci- <lb/>
            dental, and occasioned by the like <lb/>

            It is, however, inserted by Bergk, Paley, <lb/>
            Velsen, and Blaydes. Fritzsche reduces <lb/>
            lines 228-234 into excellent trochaic <lb/>
            dimeters by a variety of ingenious <lb/>
            changes, which, being quite unauthorized <lb/>
            and having met with no approval, it is <lb/>
            unnecessary here to repeat.</p>

            is continued to Dionysus in all the MSS. <lb/>
            and in all the editions before Fritzsche, <lb/>
            is by him transferred to the Frogs ; and <lb/>
            this alteration is followed by Bergk, <lb/>

            Dionysus does not join in the timing <lb/>
            song until line 250. But line 240 does <lb/>
            not seem suited to follow an interrup- <lb/>
            tion ; and Dionysus here is not joining <lb/>
            in, he is merely ridiculing, the timing <lb/>
            song. And I think, therefore, that the <lb/>
            MS. arrangement is right.</p>

            Aldus downward have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡλάμεσθα</foreign>. In <lb/>
            each case the termination -<foreign xml:lang="grc">εσθα</foreign> is re- <lb/>

            hereinafter mentioned) is continued to <lb/>
            the Frogs, I have given to the Frogs and <lb/>
            Dionysus conjointly. Bentley was the <lb/>
            first to discern that Dionysus must here <lb/>
            speak the line, and he accordingly took <lb/>
            it from the Frogs and gave it to Dionysus, <lb/>
            taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">βρεκεκεκὲξ κοὰξ κοὰξ τουτὶ</foreign> to- <lb/>
            gether. And so V. and Kock and Velsen. <lb/>
            I should unhesitatingly have followed <lb/>
            this, but that the conjoint croak is re- <lb/>
            quired also in 256 and 261. Fritzsche <lb/>
            attains the same end by doubling the <lb/>
            line in all three places, giving one to <lb/>
            the Frogs and the other to Dionysus. <lb/>
            He is followed by Blaydes and Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen, and (so far as 256 and 261 are <lb/>
            concerned) by Meineke, Holden, Green, <lb/>
            Yelsen, and Merry.</p>

            Meineke, Holden, and others ; and those <lb/>

            lines are rightly continued to Xanthias in <lb/>
            R., though, as it reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">σου</foreign>, little weight <lb/>
            can be laid on that circumstance. As a <lb/>
            rule, the first line is given to Dionysus, <lb/>
            of whom the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὺτὴν ίγών</foreign> would be <lb/>
            untrue. R. is the only MS. which reads <lb/>

            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰν, τιμὰν, άγνὰν</foreign>. But there is no <lb/>
            sufficient reason for deserting the read- <lb/>
            ing of all the best MSS. Aristophanes <lb/>
            throws in an occasional Doricism, such <lb/>
            as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤβαν</foreign> in 353 infra, but he never keeps <lb/>
            strictly to an un-Attic dialect, as the <lb/>
            tragedians do. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμὴν</foreign> Bentley con- <lb/>
            jectured and Kock reads r' <foreign xml:lang="grc">έμὰν</foreign>.</p>

            χορείαν</foreign> but R. V. P. M. U. and all the <lb/>
            best MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">μύσταισι</foreign>. Fritzsche con- <lb/>
            siders <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίερὰν</foreign> a gloss on <foreign xml:lang="grc">άκόλαστον</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰγνὴν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and therefore omits it, promoting <foreign xml:lang="grc">όσίοις</foreign> <lb/>
            to its vacant place, and making the <lb/>
            final line <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂμα μύστισι χορείαν</foreign>, two Ionics <lb/>
            a minore, in exact correspondence with <lb/>
            the final line of the antistrophe <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορπὸν, <lb/>
            μάκαρ, ἤβαν</foreign>. And this suggestion (with <lb/>
            the substitution of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετὰ</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂμα</foreign>) is <lb/>
            adopted by Kock, Meineke, Holden, Vel- <lb/>
            sen, and Van Leeuwen. But of the two <lb/>
            prepositions I much prefer <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂμα</foreign>, as more <lb/>
            suitable in itself, and more likely to <lb/>
            have dropped out after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰγνήν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>340. <foreign xml:lang="grc">έγίρου. ἔγειρεΜ</foreign>SS. vulgo. The <lb/>
            error seems to have arisen from a notion <lb/>
            that the verb was to be connected with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φλαγέας λαμπάγας</foreign>, which are in truth <lb/>
            governed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινσσων</foreign>. Fritzsche sup- <lb/>
            poses, " <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔγειρ</foreign>' pro <foreign xml:lang="grc">έγείρου</foreign> positum esse, <lb/>
            sicut in Eur. Iph. A. 624, et alibi." Bergk <lb/>
            says Forte <foreign xml:lang="grc">έγείρου</foreign> praestat," and so <lb/>
            Blaydes. Moreover (though much weight <lb/>
            cannot be laid upon this) <foreign xml:lang="grc">έγείρου</foreign> brings <lb/>
            the commencement of the anti strophe <lb/>
            into exact correspondence with the <lb/>
            commencement of the strophe.</p>
          <p>341. <foreign xml:lang="grc">έν χερσίτινάσσων</foreign>. As observed <lb/>
            in the Commentary, there seems to have <lb/>
            been a marginal gloss <foreign xml:lang="grc">̉"Ιακχοςγὰρ ἤκει</foreign>, <lb/>
            signifying that the statue of Iacchus is <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            here brought out of the temple ; and <lb/>
            the last two words yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤκει</foreign> crept into <lb/>
            the text between <foreign xml:lang="grc">χερσὶ</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιάσων</foreign>, to <lb/>
            the utter confusion of both sense and <lb/>
            metre. For all the MSS. and the editions <lb/>
            before Dindorf's read <foreign xml:lang="grc">έν χερσὶγὰρ κει</foreign> <lb/>
            (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">η̃κεις</foreign>,which is merely an attempt to <lb/>
            get some sense out of the interpolation) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινάσσων</foreign>. Hermann was the first to eject <lb/>
            the intruder, and he is followed by Din- <lb/>
            dorf, Kock, Velsen, Blaydes, Van Leeu- <lb/>
            wen. Bergk makes confusion worse <lb/>
            confounded by retaining <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ ἤκει</foreign> and <lb/>
            omitting <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιάσσων</foreign>. Nobody seems to <lb/>
            have noticed whence the objectionable <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ ἤκει</foreign> must have been derived.</p>

              after giving the same explanation of <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτω̑ν ένιαυταὺς</foreign> can be right, especially <lb/>
              as <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτω̑ν</foreign> does not suit the metre, which <lb/>
              requires an Ionic a minore in the first <lb/>
              place, answering to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέφανον μύρτ</foreign>- <lb/>
              of the strophe. Dawes therefore pro- <lb/>
              posed <foreign xml:lang="grc">άτω̑ν</foreign>, translating exeutit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άπασείεται</foreign>) <lb/>

              None of these suggestions are satisfac- <lb/>

              <foreign xml:lang="grc">έτω̑ν</foreign> is a mere gloss on <foreign xml:lang="grc">γήρως</foreign>, which, <lb/>

            Valckenaer's <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷσιν ἀπαυδῶ</foreign> by Kock and <lb/>
            Velsen. Blaydes alters the whole line <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτοις πρωυδῶ καὖθις πρωυδῶ καὖθις</foreign> <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίτον μάλα πρωυδῶ</foreign>, and Van Leeuwen <lb/>
            follows him. The other MS. variations <lb/>
            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοισίδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαυδῶ</foreign> are <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτοις ἀπαυδῶ</foreign> R. <lb/>
            M. U. and the bulk of the MSS., and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τουτοις μὲν ἀπαυδῶ</foreign> P. It will be observed <lb/>
            that V. is the only MS. which has not <lb/>
            the triple <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαυδῶ</foreign>, which is undoubtedly <lb/>
            the correct reading; and thus the first <lb/>
            word must be the equivalent of the MS. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτοις</foreign>, and nothing seems so probable <lb/>
            as Porson's emendation-</p>

            Meineke, Holden, Van Leeuwen.</p>
          <p>372. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρει νῦν</foreign>. All the best MSS. and <lb/>
            all editions before Dindorf read <foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρει <lb/>
            δὴ νῦν</foreign>. Bentley wrote "dele <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign> et <lb/>
            lege <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυν</foreign> encliticum," and so Dindorf, <lb/>
            recentiores. But although the omission <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign> is required by the metre, we <lb/>
            should retain <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῦν</foreign>, which is intended as <lb/>
            a mark of time. The procession has <lb/>
            been sifted, and a new stage commences. <lb/>
            Now, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῦν</foreign>, they are to begin the march, <lb/>
            which they could not do before. So <lb/>
            when the processional hymn to Perse- <lb/>
            phone is over, they begin the new stage <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγε νῦν ἑτέραν κ.τ.λ</foreign>. 381 infra. So with <lb/>
            the third and final stages respectively, <lb/>
            395 and 441. Every editor, I believe, <lb/>
            writes in some of these places <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυν</foreign>, and <lb/>
            in others vûv, but clearly all come within <lb/>
            the same category. The Chorus have <lb/>
            been doing one thing : now they are to <lb/>
            begin another. And with this all the <lb/>
            MSS. are in accord.</p><pb n="249"/>

            Leeuwen.</p>
          <p>382. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγε νῦν έτέραν</foreign>. Some MSS. and <lb/>

            to this and the other exhortations of <lb/>
            the like character : but, of course, the <lb/>
            lines are really spoken by the Coryphaeus. <lb/>
            Others consequently prefix KOP., but <lb/>
            these, to be logical, should give the <lb/>
            same prefix to all utterances of the <lb/>
            Chorus except the choral songs. It is <lb/>
            better to leave these distinctions to the <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ᾽ εἶα</foreign> seems the right formula for <lb/>

            and there seems no reason for departing <lb/>

            and Paley who with V. P. U. and almost <lb/>
            all the other MSS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">πνευμόνων</foreign>. The <lb/>
            Scholiast says ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αττικοὶ τὸν πνεύμονα πλεύ- <lb/>
            μονα λέγουσιν</foreign>, if <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τὰ νίτρον, λίτρον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>482. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπογγιάν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. But some <lb/>
            recent editors prefer to spell it <foreign xml:lang="grc">σφογγιάν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>483. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσθου</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προσθοῦ</foreign> <lb/>
            Bergk and subsequent editors. But this <lb/>
            is a mistake. The right accentuation <lb/>
            is <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσθου</foreign>. The author of the Etym. <lb/>
            Magn., s. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">προοῦ</foreign> (not observing that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προοῦ</foreign> if so accented is an exceptional <lb/>
            case), lays down the rule in terms con- <lb/>
            tradicted by the very examples which <lb/>
            he brings to support it. The true rule <lb/>
            in regard to the second aorist imperative <lb/>
            middle of verbs in <foreign xml:lang="grc">μι</foreign> is that "where <lb/>
            the simple verb is monosyllabic, so that <lb/>
            if the accent is thrown back it will fall <lb/>
            on the prefix, it is so thrown back : but <lb/>
            where the simple verb is polysyllabic, <lb/>
            so that the accent, if thrown back, will <lb/>
            still fall on the verb, it is not thrown <lb/>
            back." No compound of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξοῦ</foreign> retains <lb/>
            the circumflex. The MSS. give <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσθου</foreign> <lb/>
            here, Birds 361, Soph. Trach. 1224; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒνθου</foreign> Knights 51 ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνθου, ὸπόθου, κατάθου</foreign>, <lb/>
            Etym. Magn. ubi supra, cf. infra 528, <lb/>
            627; <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίθου, ὺπάθου, παράθου</foreign>, Eccl. 131, <lb/>
            1031, 1033, and so on. In the Etym. <lb/>
            Magn. the rule, which applies to the <lb/>
            syllables of the verb, is absurdly referred <lb/>
            to the syllables of the prefix itself. <lb/>
            Mr. Chandler in his learned work on <lb/>
            Greek accentuation (§ 819 Compound <lb/>
            verbs in <foreign xml:lang="grc">μι</foreign>) while apparently adopting <lb/>
            what he calls the "singular rule" of <lb/>
            the Etym. Magn. mentions, as an ex- <lb/>
            ception, “<foreign xml:lang="grc">περιδοῦ</foreign> in Eccl. 121, for which <lb/>
            the correct form <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίδου</foreign> occurs in the <lb/>
            same author in Clouds 644, Ach. 772." <lb/>
            But this is an oversight. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιδοῦ</foreign> <lb/>
            in Eccl. 121 comes from <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιδέω</foreign>, and is <lb/>
            not a compound verb in <foreign xml:lang="grc">μι</foreign> at all; the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίδου</foreign> in Clouds 644 and Ach. 772 <lb/>
            comes from <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιδίδωμι</foreign>, and is subject <lb/>
            to the rule we are considering. All <lb/>
            three words are rightly accented.</p>

            in the sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλόφρων καὶ ὶσχυρὰς</foreign>, <lb/>
            and V. has it as a marginal reading. <lb/>
            Photius explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληματίας</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρανηματίας, <lb/>
            γεννάδας</foreign>, without any reference to Ari- <lb/>

            his Lexicon the explanations of both <lb/>
            Photius and the Scholiast. Hesychius <lb/>
            has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληματίαν φρανηματίαν</foreign>, which (being <lb/>
            in the accusative) is clearly a. reference <lb/>
            to some other place in which the word <lb/>
            occurs. It is not at all in the manner <lb/>
            of Aristophanes to join together two <lb/>
            epithets of almost precisely the same <lb/>
            meaning. Yet <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληματίας</foreign> is forced into <lb/>

            ἔντερα</foreign>, as the Scholiast explains it. But <lb/>
            the first two syllables'Of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλλικας</foreign> are <lb/>
            long, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλικας</foreign> therefore must be <lb/>
            either another form of, or a mistake <lb/>
            for, <foreign xml:lang="grc">χόλικας</foreign> ; which is now universally <lb/>
            substituted for it.</p>
          <p>582. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Ξανθίδιον</foreign>. On the supposition <lb/>
            that the second syllable of the word <lb/>
            (if derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ξανθίας</foreign>) would be long, <lb/>
            Meineke would either omit the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ</foreign> or <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦ Ξάνθιον</foreign>. But there is no cer- <lb/>
            tainty about these pet names.</p>

            omitted in all the other MSS. and by <lb/>
            Invernizzi and subsequent editors, most <lb/>

            Bekker. This was corrected into '<foreign xml:lang="grc">στιν <lb/>
            πάλιν</foreign> by Bentley, who is followed by <lb/>
            Dindorf, Fritzsche, and Paley. Dawes <lb/>
            commenting on Frogs 437 quotes the <lb/>
            line as '<foreign xml:lang="grc">σται πάλιν</foreign> (without professing <lb/>
            to amend it), and this is followed by <lb/>
            Bergk, Meineke, Holden, Kock, Velsen, <lb/>
            Blaydes, Van Leeuwen. There is little <lb/>
            to choose between '<foreign xml:lang="grc">στιν</foreign> and '<foreign xml:lang="grc">σται</foreign>, but <lb/>
            on the whole I prefer the latter. R. P. <lb/>
            M. V. and the MSS. generally have <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάλιν</foreign> alone. H. W. W1. P2. P5. F3. have <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τις πάλ ιν</foreign>, and so Junta and (except <lb/>
            as aforesaid) the editions before <lb/>
            Fritzsche. This is probably a mere re- <lb/>
            arrangement of the letters in '<foreign xml:lang="grc">στι</foreign>, to <lb/>
            save the metre.</p>
          <p>611, 612. These two verses are vari- <lb/>
            ously distributed : but the arrangement <lb/>
            in the text is commonly adopted and <lb/>
            seems correct.</p>

            reading of P. M. U. and almost all the <lb/>
            MSS. ; but Dawes corrected it, as in <lb/>
            the text, from Suidas, and his correction <lb/>
            is confirmed by R. V. and followed by <lb/>
            Brunck and all subsequent editors.</p>

            is recognized by the Scholiast, and <lb/>
            apparently arose from a notion that <lb/>
            Dionysus is speaking. And this is <lb/>
            followed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸν</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοῦ</foreign> at the begin- <lb/>

            almost all the editions continue the <lb/>
            entire line to Xanthias, as in the text. <lb/>
            A few editions, not understanding the <lb/>
            passage, follow P3. in giving <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδοὺ</foreign> to <lb/>
            Aeacus.</p>
          <p>649. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί τἀτταῑ</foreign>. The variations in this <lb/>
            speech are as numerous as they are un- <lb/>
            important. The reading in the text is <lb/>
            that of V. Bekker, Dindorf, Bergk, and <lb/>
            Paley. All the editions before Brunck <lb/>
            give as the retort of Aeacus <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί δὴταταῑ</foreign>. <lb/>
            Brunck from P6. changed this into TL If <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰατταταῑ</foreign>, and so H. F3. R. runs both <lb/>
            exclamations into one, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰατταττατταττατ- <lb/>
            ατταῖ</foreign> which is probable enough, and is <lb/>
            adopted by Invernizzi and Fritzsche, <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            and, except that they divide the word <lb/>
            into a twice repeated <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰατταταῖ</foreign>, by Dobree, <lb/>
            Meineke, Holden, and Velsen. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνύσεις</foreign> TI ; <lb/>

            and Van Leeuwen. There are some <lb/>
            other minor variations.</p>
          <p>664. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥλγησέν τις</foreign> R. P. U. Dindorf, re- <lb/>
            centiores. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥλγησέ τις</foreign> V. M. editions <lb/>
            before Dindorf. Dindorf suggests that <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁλὸς ἐν βένθεσιν</foreign> should be <lb/>
            brought up here to complete the sena- <lb/>
            rius, and Van Leeuwen brings them up <lb/>
            accordingly.</p>
          <p>665. [<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχεις</foreign>]. This word is not in the <lb/>
            MSS., but without it there is nothing to <lb/>
            govern <foreign xml:lang="grc">π ρῶνας</foreign>. Bergler suggests that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχεις</foreign> may be understood from 659, but <lb/>
            this seems impossible ; Scaliger proposed <lb/>
            and Van Leeuwen reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρωυὸς</foreign>, to be <lb/>
            governed by <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέδεις</foreign>. Bergk proposed to <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂς Αἰγαίαυς ἔχεις πρῶνας</foreign>, and Velsen <lb/>
            and Blaydes insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχεις</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρῶνας</foreign>. <lb/>
            the former as part of the undisputed <lb/>
            text, the latter in brackets. I too have <lb/>
            inserted it in brackets, though rather <lb/>
            to make sense than as thinking it was <lb/>
            really inserted by Aristophanes. It <lb/>
            seems to me that Dionysus in his <lb/>
            agony is putting together some lyrical <lb/>
            language without regard to the gram- <lb/>
            matical construction.</p>

          <p>682. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ βάρβαρον ἑζαμένη πέταλον</foreign>. So <lb/>
            all the MSS. and all the editions before <lb/>
            Meineke, though it was his predecessor <lb/>
            Bergk who in an evil hour threw open <lb/>
            the floodgates of unwise conjecture by <lb/>
            suggesting <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ ϐάρβαρον ἡδομένη̣ πίτυλον</foreign>. <lb/>
            Cf. Peace 800 and the note there. <lb/>
            Bergk, however, left the text unaltered ; <lb/>
            but Meineke introduces into the text his <lb/>
            conjecture <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποβάρβαραν ἑζυμένη κέλαδαν</foreign>, <lb/>
            in which he is followed by Holden, <lb/>
            Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen. Velsen <lb/>
            again reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ βαρβάρῳ ἡδαμένη κελάδῳ</foreign>. <lb/>
            The MS. reading is far superior to any <lb/>
            of these corruptions.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελαδεῖ</foreign> is retained by Bergk and Paley. <lb/>
            Nobody raises any objection to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελαδεῖ</foreign>, <lb/>
            which is used of the nightingale's song <lb/>
            in Peace 801, and well suits the light- <lb/>
            ness and airiness of the present ode. <lb/>
            Probably some grammarian wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρύζει</foreign> <lb/>
            in the margin, and the two words <lb/>
            coalesced into the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελαρύζει</foreign> of R.</p>
          <p>684. if <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαλεῖται</foreign>. Bergk alters this <lb/>

            embrace every derail comprised in the <lb/>
            other. However, the suggestion was <lb/>
            sufficient to set the conjecturers to work. <lb/>
            Meineke himself (Vind. Aristoph.) <lb/>
            would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακαύς</foreign> TIE <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγαθοὺς</foreign>, and <lb/>
            Holden and Kock so read. But if <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶ <lb/>
            κακοί</foreign> TIE <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγαθοὶ</foreign>. could ever, in Ari- <lb/>
            stophanes, mean the evil and the good, it <lb/>
            could only be where the two are fused <lb/>
            into one class, and not where, as here, <lb/>
            the two classes are being distinguished <lb/>
            from, and contrasted with, each other. <lb/>
            Thus Solon (Polity of Athens, chap. 12) <lb/>
            says <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεσμοὺς δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ομοίους τω̜̑ κακω̜̑ τε κὰγαθω̜̑ <lb/>
            ἔγραψα</foreign>, "I made equal laws for. all <lb/>
            citizens." In the Funeral Oration of <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_06_fig335.jpg"/></figure><lb/>
              <lb/>
              we should probably with some MSS. <lb/>
              read <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλω̑ν</foreign>. But if not, the speaker is <lb/>
              blending together, not distinguishing <lb/>
              between, the two. To my mind, how- <lb/>
              ever, in Aristophanes, the words could <lb/>
              only be a parody on his favourite <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλοί</foreign> <lb/>
              Tf <foreign xml:lang="grc">κἀγαθαὶ</foreign>, arid would mean virtuous <lb/>
              villains. Velsen introduces a really <lb/>
              horrible doggrel of his own <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὺς καλοὺς <lb/>
              καὶ</foreign> row <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακαὺς</foreign> into a trochaic tetra- <lb/>
              meter, perhaps the most harmonious of <lb/>
               <pb n="257"/>
              all metres, and even more harmonious <lb/>
              in the hands of Aristophanes than in <lb/>
              those of the Tragic Poets. But some <lb/>
              scholars, provided they can get the <lb/>
              proper number of syllables into a line, <lb/>
              entirely ignore the melody of the verse <lb/>
              (as witness Bergk's dreadful -<foreign xml:lang="grc">σω</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">γὼ σφὼ</foreign> <lb/>
              in 1480 infra), a consideration which <lb/>
              Aristophanes never ignored. Moreover, <lb/>
              in composing his doggrel, Velsen over- <lb/>
              looks the fact that the adjective <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλὸς</foreign> <lb/>
              in Aristophanes never includes any refer- <lb/>
              ence to moral virtue, and that <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ καλοὶ <lb/>
              καὶ</foreign> ot <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακαὶ</foreign> on his lips could mean <lb/>
              nothing but "the beautiful and the <lb/>
              wicked." This again shows the absurdity <lb/>
              or a still older conjecture by Duker <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺς <lb/>
              καλούς τε κοὐ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">γαθούς</foreign>. Other conjectures <lb/>
              have been made, which are not worth <lb/>
              repeating here. And, of course, if the <lb/>
              view taken of this Antepirrhema in the <lb/>
              Commentary be correct, all excuse for <lb/>
              these alterations at once disappears.</p>
          <p>720. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τὸ καινὸν χρυσίον</foreign>. For the <lb/>
            reasons mentioned in relation to the <lb/>
            foregoing line, Kuster proposed to read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τὸ καινὸν χαλκίον</foreign>. And Meineke <lb/>
            actually substitutes for the text the <lb/>
            words Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλω̑ς κεκομμένον</foreign>. This was <lb/>
            his first mode of equalizing the two <lb/>
            branches of the comparison. After- <lb/>
            wards, in his Vind. Aristoph., he aban- <lb/>
            doned it for the alteration in the <lb/>
            preceding line, already considered.</p>

          <p>724. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕν τε τοι̑ς</foreign>. From the strange <lb/>
            notion that this line is governed by <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρώμεθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδἐν</foreign>, in which case we should <lb/>
            expect <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὕτ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τοι̑ς "Ελλησι</foreign>, various <lb/>
            transpositions have been made in these <lb/>
            verses by Meineke and other recent <lb/>
            editors. But the words are really, as <lb/>
            Holden observes, connected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκω- <lb/>
            δωνισμένοις</foreign>, tested both amongst the <lb/>
            Hellenes and amongst the Barbarians.</p>

            Aesch.Prom. 447. Meineke is thoroughly <lb/>
            dissatisfied with the way in which <lb/>
            Aristophanes wrote this Antepirrhema, <lb/>
            and sets to work with great zeal to <lb/>
            improve it. Some of his alterations <lb/>
            have already been noticed. Here he <lb/>
            would change <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαλκοι̑ς</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαλακοι̑ς</foreign>, so <lb/>
            striking out the very analogy on which <lb/>
            Aristophanes is insisting between the <lb/>
            pinchbeck coin and the pinchbeck citi- <lb/>
            zens. Two lines below he would alter <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">υ̒στότοις ἀφιγμένουσιν</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">υ̒στέροις ἀφι- <lb/>
            γμένοισιν</foreign>, meaning that the spurious <lb/>
            citizens arrived later than the genuine. <lb/>
            But the genuine citizens, in their own <lb/>
            opinion, never arrived at all: they were <lb/>
            Autochthons, native children of the <lb/>
            ground: and Aristophanes is laying <lb/>
            stress on the fact that the people employ <lb/>
            the newest comers, the very latest <lb/>
            arrivals. In 731 he would alter <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς <lb/>
            ἅπαντα</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσι πάντο</foreign>, and in 734 <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> <lb/>

            the bulk of the MSS., and all editions <lb/>
            before Brunck. Brunck unfortunately <lb/>
            introduced the question of dialect, quo- <lb/>
            ting from Moeris <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχινδαλμὰς ἐν τῷ χ, <lb/>
            ᾽Αττικῶςσκινδαλὰς, "Ελληνες</foreign>. In the <lb/>
            notes on Moeris, Sallier, observing that <lb/>
            in Aristophanes (here and Clouds 130) <lb/>
            and other writers of pure Attic; all <lb/>
            MSS. commence the word with <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκ</foreign>-, sug- <lb/>
            gests that in Moeris the two forms <lb/>
            should be transposed, whilst Hudson <lb/>
            and Pierson, with even less reason, <lb/>
            would alter the spelling in Aristophanes. <lb/>
            This latter view was adopted by Brunck, <lb/>
            who accordingly wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχινδαλμῶν</foreign>here. <lb/>
            Person saw, as Bentley had seen before <note type="footnote"> S 2 </note><lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            him, that the line should commence <lb/>
            with a dactyl, and for that reason (and <lb/>
            not as pronouncing any opinion as to <lb/>
            the right spelling of the word) changed <lb/>
            Brunck's <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχινδαμῶν</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχινδαλάμων</foreign>. <lb/>
            And <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχινδαλάμων</foreign> is read by Bekker, <lb/>
            Dindorf, Bothe, Holden, Velsen, Blaydes, <lb/>
            and Van Leeuwen, But of course when <lb/>
            Moeris says that one form is used <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αττικῶς</foreign>, and the other <foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Ελληνικῶς</foreign>, he <lb/>
            does not mean to exclude from the <lb/>
            Hellenic form the principal Hellenic <lb/>
            writers, the poets, philosophers, and <lb/>
            historians of Athens. He means that <lb/>
            the first form is used by the Athenians, <lb/>
            only, the second by the Athenians in <lb/>
            common with the other Hellenic peoples. <lb/>
            To give one example out of five hundred, <lb/>
            he says <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύραζε,᾽Αττικῶς. ἔξω, ῾Ελληνικῶς</foreign>, <lb/>
            yet of course both forms are quite <lb/>
            common with Attic writers. Much <lb/>
            mischief has been done by critics not <lb/>
            bearing in mind that <foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Ελληνικῶς</foreign> does <lb/>
            not mean un-Attic. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραξόνια</foreign> (from <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂξων</foreign>, whirling of splinters) which im- <lb/>
            mediately follows, Herwerden suggests <lb/>

            the reading of any of these MSS. was <lb/>
            known. " Qui vel verbum activum <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθίημι</foreign>,”says that eminent critic, " cum <lb/>

            found in R. and one or two inferior <lb/>

            Dawes referring to (amongst other <lb/>

            which Brunck accepts, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐβουλόμηνἂν</foreign>. <lb/>
            It seems, however, impossible to make <lb/>
            any change in the face of such passages <lb/>
            as the commencement of Antiphon's <lb/>
            speech, "In the matter of the murder of <lb/>
            Herodes," where efiovXo/jLTjv /iIJ, without <lb/>

            of the line, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνθάδε</foreign> is altered by Meineke, <lb/>
            Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνθαδί</foreign> </p>
          <p>867. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁγὼν νῷν</foreign>. The old editions read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν νῶἵν</foreign>, but Bentley and Dawes saw <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν</foreign> required the article, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁγὼν</foreign>, <lb/>
            and that <foreign xml:lang="grc">νῷν</foreign> must consequently be read <lb/>
            as a monosyllable. The latter alteration <lb/>
            is confirmed by every MS.; and therefore <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν</foreign>which is found in most MSS., <lb/>
            becomes unmetrical, and the former <lb/>
            alteration becomes necessary on this <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥᾴδι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν</foreign> was far more likely to be cor- <lb/>

            However sparingly Aristophanes uses <lb/>

            does so on certain occasions ; the form <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλεκτρυόνα</foreign> is necessary in 935 infra; it <lb/>
            can hardly be doubted that Aristophanes <lb/>
            would employ the actual words of <lb/>
            Aeschylus; and the MSS. are unanimous. <lb/>

            which is found in R. and is followed in <lb/>

            found in no MS. but is followed by <lb/>
            Dindorf,Fritzsche, Bergk, Holden,Kock, <lb/>
            Velsen, Green, Merry, Van Leeuwen. <lb/>
            But in every MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign> comes between the <lb/>

            ποιητὰς ... δεῖ χρηστὰ λέγειν</foreign>, in one <lb/>
            sentence. But this destroys the anti- <lb/>
            thesis, and would in every respect be <lb/>
            a change for the worse.</p>

            other MSS. and vulgo. "forte <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρνήθων</foreign>” <lb/>
            Bentley. The same suggestion is made <lb/>
            by Bp. Wordsworth (Athens and Attica, <lb/>
            chap. viii) on the ground that Lycabettus <lb/>
            and Parnes are mentioned together in <lb/>
            a fragment of the lost edition of the <lb/>
            Clouds. There the Clouds " were repre- <lb/>
            sented," says that excellent scholar, <lb/>
            "as irritated by the discourteous recep- <lb/>
            tion which they met with on the <lb/>
            Athenian stage, and threatening to <lb/>
            quit the theatre, and to fly off to the <lb/>
            heights of Mount Fames from which <lb/>
            they had come. We are informed of <lb/>
            the route which they intend to take, in <lb/>
            their way from Athens thither. They <lb/>
            are sailing off, we are told, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲς τὴν <lb/>
            Πάρνηθ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀργισθεῖσαι, Φροῦδαι κατὰ τὸν <lb/>
            Λυκαβηττόν</foreign>. To the summit of Parnes, <lb/>
            swelling with rage, and have vanished <lb/>
            along Lycabettus. They are vanishing <lb/>
            towards Mount Parnes, and they are <lb/>
            taking Lycabettus in their way. Lyca- <lb/>
            bettus is their first object on their way <lb/>
            thither." These remarks show con- <lb/>
            vincingly that Aristophanes couples <lb/>
            their names together in the fragment, <lb/>
            for a reason which does not exist here. <lb/>
            Yet the suggestion is followed, in the <lb/>
            face of every MS., by Blaydes and Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen. At the close of the line P. <lb/>
            and U. place a note of interrogation, <lb/>
            which Blaydes and Van Leeuwen retain, <lb/>
            Blaydes further changing into <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂν</foreign> <lb/>
            which immediately follows, whilst Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen deletes the note of interroga- <lb/>

            which is only preserved in Aulus Gellius, <lb/>
            xiii. 24. Bentley saw that it should <lb/>
            be read here, and it is so read by Brunck <lb/>
            and all succeeding editors. All the <lb/>
            MSS. and all the editions before Brunck <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκειν</foreign>; and though R. V. P. M. U. <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατέρχαμαι</foreign>, yet a great number of MSS. <lb/>

            exception of the first word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθρωπε</foreign> <lb/>
            which has remained unchanged through- <lb/>
            out) has had a strange history. Aldus <lb/>
            wrote it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτη</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">στ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτέρως ἔχον</foreign>, which <lb/>
            is unmetrical, is supported by no au- <lb/>
            thority,. and appears to be a reminiscence <lb/>
            of Plutus 371, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶν αὐ ταιαυ̑ταν, <lb/>
            ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτέρως ἔχαν</foreign>. Junta, Gormont, Neo- <lb/>
            bari, and Grynaeus write it exactly <lb/>
            as it stands in the text. Unfortunately <lb/>
            Fracini recalled the reading of Aldus ; <lb/>
            and both Zanetti and Farreus have <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυ̑τ</foreign>’W <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτέρως ἔχον</foreign>. After Grynaeus <lb/>
            the true reading became inexplicably <lb/>
            lost. Gelenius followed Aldus, and <lb/>
            Rapheleng followed Zanetti. And <lb/>
            presently it became merely a question <lb/>
            of amending the readings of Aldus and <lb/>
            Zanetti. In Scaliger and Faber it is <lb/>
            altered into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτη γ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶν ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτέρως <lb/>
            ἔχον</foreign>. Bentley proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὐτόν ἐστιν, <lb/>
            ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτέρως ἔχον</foreign>. Both Kuster and <lb/>
            Bergler retain the reading of Aldus, <lb/>
            though the former in his notes supplied <lb/>
            the true reading from U. which Brunck <lb/>
            inserted in the text, fully believing that <lb/>
            it had never appeared in the text before. <lb/>
            All subsequent editors have followed <lb/>
            this reading, excepting Blaydes who <lb/>
            reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτη</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">στ</foreign>’ though of course retain- <lb/>
            ing the rest of the line as in the MSS., <lb/>
            which all read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄριστ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτω̑ν ἔχον</foreign>. As <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὔτ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστ</foreign>’ the words are found so <lb/>
            accented in U. P. P<unclear/>. p5 F4. B. in. ; <lb/>
            accented as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυ̑τ</foreign>’ in R. V. M. and others ; <lb/>

          <p>1163. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλθει̑ν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. One would <lb/>
            certainly have expected <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκειν</foreign>, and at <lb/>
            Hirschig's suggestion <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥκειν</foreign> is read by <lb/>
            Meineke, Velsen, Blaydes, and Van <lb/>
            Leeuwen; but Aeschylus is perhaps <lb/>
            emphasizing the difference which the <lb/>
            prefix <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ</foreign> makes to the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρχομαι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1170. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέραινε τοίνυν</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <lb/>
            Blaydes alters it into <foreign xml:lang="grc">περαινέτω</foreign> vIVII. But <lb/>

            conjecture for the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖθις</foreign> of the MSS. <lb/>

            Meineke, Holden, Kock, Velsen, 'Green, <lb/>
            Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen. Brunck <lb/>
            had already proposed to obtain the same <lb/>
            meaning by changing <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑θ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτεραν</foreign> into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὔ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτεραν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>1180. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐγάρμαὐστὶνἀλλ</foreign>’. Blaydesalters <lb/>
            this into <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐ γὰρ ἀλλά μοὔστ</foreign>’, which is <lb/>
            certainly the more natural order of the <lb/>
            words. R. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκαυστέον</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκαυστέα</foreign> <lb/>
            is otherwise so universally read that <lb/>
            I have not altered it.</p>
          <p>1182. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδαίμων</foreign> R. U. and other MSS. <lb/>
            Brunck, recentiores. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐτυχἠς</foreign> V. P. M. <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            and other MSS. and the editions before <lb/>
            Brunck. And I am not sure that this <lb/>
            is not the true reading, for though it <lb/>
            is a good rule when in doubt follow R., <lb/>
            yet in 1186 R. and every other MS. <lb/>
            has <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐτυχὴς</foreign>, and, with <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδαίμων</foreign> here, it <lb/>
            seems necessary to substitute <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδαίμων</foreign> <lb/>
            there, as all do except Bekker and <lb/>
            Inverniz?i. The fact that in 1195 all <lb/>
            the MSS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐδαίμων</foreign> is immaterial, <lb/>
            since that does not profess to be an <lb/>
            exact repetition of the present line. <lb/>
            However both here and in 1186 I have <lb/>
            followed recent editors.</p>
          <p>1184. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὶν Φυ̑ναι μὲν</foreign> R. V. P. M. U. <lb/>
            and. the MSS. generally, and Brunck, <lb/>

          <p>1203. <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυλάκιον</foreign>. A tribrach is so seldom <lb/>
            found at the end of an iambic line (see <lb/>
            on 979 supra) that Person (at Med. 139) <lb/>
            considers this passage to be " insigniter <lb/>
            corruptum," while Reisig would substi- <lb/>
            tute <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυάθιον</foreign>, and Bothe and Fritzsche <lb/>
            read <foreign xml:lang="grc">θύλακον</foreign>. But “nice customs curtsey <lb/>
            to great” necessity ; and subsequent <lb/>
            editors have seen that a first Paeon, <lb/>
            — ◡◡\-/, is necessary here; since Aeschy- <lb/>
            lus means that <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυλάκιον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign> or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κωδάριον ἀπώλεσεν</foreign> would suit his purpose <lb/>

          <p>1209. (EY.) R. P. M. U. and most of <lb/>
            the MSS. give this line to Euripides and <lb/>
            the next to Dionysus, and so Brunck, <lb/>
            and most of the subsequent editors. V., <lb/>
            however, and one or two other MSS. <lb/>
            give both to Dionysus, and so the older <lb/>
            editions, and a few since Brunck.</p>
          <p>1220. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δακει̑</foreign>. This was suggested by <lb/>

            subsequent editors. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκει̑ς</foreign> MSS. vulgo. <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξω</foreign> arose from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξει</foreign> in the following line. <lb/>
            And so Bothe, Velsen, Blaydes, Van <lb/>

            selling, and accordingly proposes to read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδου</foreign> here. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδου</foreign> is found in P. and <lb/>
            also in O. as corrected, and is read by <lb/>
            Brunck, Invernizzi, Bekker, Dindorf, <lb/>
            Meineke, Holden, Velsen, Paley, and <lb/>
            Green. The true reading is, however, re- <lb/>
            tained, and the true explanation given by <lb/>
            Bothe, Fritzsche, Bergk, Rock, Blaydes, <lb/>
            and Van Leeuwen. Merry too retains <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδος</foreign>, but considers the appeal to be <lb/>
            addressed to Aeschylus, and translates <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδος</foreign> give it up. But I entirely agree <lb/>
            with Blaydes'sremark' 'verum hauddubie <lb/>
            est <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδος</foreign>, id est solve pretium ejus, ut <lb/>
            totius loci sententia ostendit.” Fritzsche <lb/>
            had long before said " Jure Bothius resti- <lb/>
            tuit <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόδος</foreign>, i.e. da pecuniam pro lecythio." <lb/>
            And Bothe's own translation was solve, <lb/>

            Before Dindorf the entire line was given <lb/>

            perceive that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φράσω</foreign> belonged to another <lb/>
            speaker, and he gave the word and the <lb/>
            succeeding line to Aeschylus, making <lb/>
            the speech of Dionysus commence (and <lb/>
            so it is found in R.) with <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγοιτ ἂν</foreign>. <lb/>
            But possibly the allusion to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βέβληκ' <lb/>

            in conformity with Eccl. 396. And so <lb/>
            Rock, Blaydes, Van Leeuwen. But <lb/>
            Aristophanes would hardly have written <lb/>

            are now almost universally omitted or <lb/>

          <p>1480. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενίσωμεν</foreign>. All the MSS. read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενίσω</foreign>, and down to the time of Brunck <lb/>
            all the editions had read, later in the <lb/>
            verse, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρίν</foreign> y' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπελθει̑ν</foreign>. P2. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὶν <lb/>
            ἀπελθει̑ν</foreign>, but all the other MSS. have <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὶν ἀποπλει̑ν</foreign>. Brunck therefore changed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρίν γ'ἀπελθει̑ν</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὶν ἀποπλει̑ν</foreign>, and <lb/>
            to save the metre inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοι</foreign> between <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγεις</foreign>, referring to Peace 934, <lb/>
            Plutus 198. And in this he is followed <lb/>
            by all succeeding editors, except Bergk, <lb/>
            Meineke, Kock, Velsen, and Blaydes. <lb/>
            Bergk omitted Brunck's <foreign xml:lang="grc">του</foreign>, and inserted <lb/>
            '<foreign xml:lang="grc">γὼ</foreign> between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενίσω</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σΦὼ</foreign>, as if <lb/>
            Aristophanes could have endured such <lb/>
            a combination of syllables as -<foreign xml:lang="grc">σω 'γὼ <lb/>
            σΦὼ</foreign>, and as if Pluto was likely to <lb/>
            emphasize so strongly that he alone, <lb/>
            without his Queen and Court, was to <lb/>
            entertain the guests. Nevertheless, this <lb/>
            sorry emendation is adopted by Meineke <lb/>
            and Blaydes. Meineke, however, sug- <lb/>
            gested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενίζω</foreign>, which is introduced into <lb/>
            the text by Kock and Velsen. It seems <lb/>
            to me that the true reading is either <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρίν γ' ἀπελθει̑ν</foreign> or else <foreign xml:lang="grc">νίσωμεν</foreign>, as in <lb/>
            Lysistrata 1184. And on the whole, <lb/>
            considering that every MS. but one <lb/>
            reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποπλει̑ν</foreign>, I think it safer to read <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενίσωμεν</foreign>. It may have been the very <lb/>
            fact that Persephone is joined in the <lb/>
            invitation that made Dionysus accept <lb/>
            it so cheerfully.</p>

            too was the first to change <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνοι̑σι</foreign> into <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνοι̑σιν</foreign>, infra 1496, where even R. has <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>1486. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴκαδ' αὖ</foreign>. The MSS. and editions <lb/>
            before Dindorf have <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴκαδ' αὖθις</foreign>, but <lb/>
            Dindorf changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖθις</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖ</foreign>to make <lb/>
            the line correspond with its anti- <lb/>
            strophical line, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̑ς τραγῳδικη̑ς τέχνης</foreign>. <lb/>
            For a similar reason he changed <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλοις</foreign> <lb/>
            into <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλοιϭι</foreign>, three lines below.</p>

            and a most unfortunate suggestion, <lb/>
            whoever made it) is actually introduced <lb/>
            into the text by Meineke, Holden, Rock, <lb/>
            Velsen, Van Leeuwen.</p>

            a paroemiac line in this place, and many <lb/>
            critics have endeavoured to add the <lb/>
            syllable required for a full anapaestic <lb/>
            dimeter. It would be easy, as indeed <lb/>
            Blaydes remarks, to do this by writing <lb/>
            the final word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποριϭτα</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭιν</foreign>. Bentley <lb/>
            suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτοιϭιν</foreign>. Bergk writes <foreign xml:lang="grc">του- <lb/>
            τουοὶ</foreign> (subaud. <foreign xml:lang="grc">βρόχους</foreign>), and so Kock, <lb/>
            Velsen, Blaydes, and Van Leeuwen: but <lb/>
            the use of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμου̑</foreign> as well as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τε ... καὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            in the next line show that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποριϭταὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            were not to have separate instruments <lb/>
            of self-slaughter.</p>

            here, with the exception of U. W2. F4. <lb/>
            L., all the MSS. and all the editions <lb/>
            before Brunck have <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρόνον</foreign>, contrary to <lb/>
            the metre. Bentley proposed, and <lb/>
            Brunck and all subsequent editors read, <lb/>
