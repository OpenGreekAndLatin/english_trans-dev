            <title type="main">BIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL NOTICE OF QUINTILIAN.</title>
          </head>
          <p>MARCUS FABIUS QUINTILIANUS was born at Calagurris, now <lb/>
            alled Calahorra, a town of Spain on the Ebro.* The time <lb/>
            .f his birth is uncertain, but as he was, while still young, a <unclear/> <lb/>
            mearer of Domitius Afer at Rome, who died A.D. 59,t we <lb/>
            may reasonably suppose him to have been born about A.D. 40.</p>
          <p>What his father was, is unknown. He alludes to him once, <lb/>
            in the ninth book,‡ where Spalding suggests that he may have <lb/>
            been the pleader mentioned by Seneca the rhetorician in the <lb/>
            preface to the fifth book of his Controversies; but for this <lb/>
            supposition there is no foundation.</p>
          <p>The scholiast on Juvenal § says that he studied under the <lb/>
            grammarian Palæmon.</p>
          <p>He appears to have returned to Spain, and to have been <lb/>
            brought again from thence by the emperor Galba, A.D. 68, to <lb/>
            Rome, where he distinguished himself in the two professions <lb/>
            of pleader, and teacher of eloquence. Among his pupils was <lb/>
            Pliny the younger. || His scholars seem to have been <lb/>
            mumerous, according to Martial,¶ <lb/>
            Quintiliane, vagæ moderator summe juventæ, <lb/>
            Gloria Romance Quintiliane togæ, <lb/>
            the first of which verses, says Gesner, refers to his teaching, <lb/>
            and the second to his pleading. It would appear from St. <lb/>
            Jerome's Chronicon** that he first opened a public school or <lb/>
            college for rhetoric at Rome in the eighth year of the reign <note type="footnote"> <lb/>
            * Hieron. in Chron. ad 01. 211 and 216. </note><note type="footnote"> t Inst. Or. v. 7, 7; x. 1, 11, 24, 36; xiL 11, 3. Tacit.

            of Domitian, receiving a salary from the public treasury. The <lb/>
            salaries for Greek and Latin rhetoricians had previously been <lb/>
            fixed by Vespasian at a hundred thousand sesterces, or about <lb/>
            eight hundred pounds of our money.. He himself speaks of <lb/>
            his oratorical efforts, and of the memory which he exhibited <lb/>
            in them.†</p>
          <p>He published, however, only one of his orations, which was <lb/>
            delivered on behalf of a certain Nævius Apronianus,‡ who <lb/>
            was accused of having killed his wife. Other speeches of his <lb/>
            were in circulation, but they had been made public without <lb/>
            his sanction, by short-hand writers who had taken them down <lb/>
            to make profit of them. He complains of the negligence and <lb/>
            incorrectness with which they had been given to the world.§</p>
          <p>He pleaded, on some occasion, before queen Berenice,|| and <lb/>
            on her behalf, but the subject of the pleading is not known.</p>
          <p>After spending twenty years ¶ in the forum and in his <lb/>
            school, he seems to have retired, partially or wholly, from <lb/>
            public employment, and to have devoted his leisure, at the <lb/>
            request of his friends, to the composition of his Institutiones <lb/>
            Oratoria, a work which he was the rather induced to under­ <lb/>
            take by the circumstance that two books on rhetoric had been <lb/>
            published in his name by some of his pupils, who had taken <lb/>
            notes of his lectures, and had sent them into the world with <lb/>
            more zeal than discretion... He dedicated the work to Mar­ <lb/>
            cellus Victorius, the same to whom Statius inscribes the fourth <lb/>
            book of his Silvæ. About the time that he was finishing the <lb/>
            third book, he was intrusted with the education of two grand­ <lb/>
            nephews of Domitian, the sons of Flavius Clemens, and <lb/>
            Domitilla, the grand-daughter of Vespasian.††</p>
          <p>As he was about to commence his sixth book, he was <lb/>
            afflicted with the loss of his son, aged ten years, of whom he <lb/>
            had formed high expectations, and who had been adopted by <lb/>
            some person of consular dignity. He had previously lost another <lb/>
            son at the age of five, and his wife, whose amiable qualities he <lb/>
            highly extols, at the age of nineteen. He represents himself <lb/>
            as almost in despair, and weary of life; but be resolved on seek­ <lb/>
            ing consolation from literature, and proceeded with his work.‡‡</p>
          <p>One of Pliny's Letters, the thirty-second of the sixth book. <note type="footnote"> * Suet. Vespas. c. 17. </note><note type="footnote">f XI. 2, 39. </note><note type="footnote">‡ VII. 2, 24. </note><note type="footnote"> § VII. 2, 24. </note><note type="footnote">|| IV. 1, 19. </note><note type="footnote">¶ I. 1, 1. </note><note type="footnote"> **.

            is addressed to a person named Quintilian, who had a <lb/>
            daughter, to whom Pliny offers to present fifty thousand <lb/>
            sesterces, or about four hundred pounds, on her marriage. <lb/>
            This Quintilian is generally supposed to be the author of the <lb/>
            Institutes, and, if so, the daughter, as Quintilian does not <lb/>
            mention her in speaking of his first wife and family, was <lb/>
            probably the offspring of a second marriage, to the daughter, <lb/>
            as Pliny intimates, of a certain Tutilius. Dodwell thinks <lb/>
            that this second marriage took place about A.D. 94, when <lb/>
            Quintilian was past fifty.</p>
          <p>Quintilian was invested by Domitian with the name and <lb/>
            insignia of consul, at the request, according to Ausonius,* of <lb/>
            Clemens, doubtless the Flavius Clemens to whose children he <lb/>
            had been appointed preceptor ; but " the honour," adds <lb/>
            Ausonius, " was rather a titular distinction than an indication <lb/>
            of authority." It is to this exaltation that Juvenal alludes, in <lb/>
            the verse, <lb/>
            Si Fortuna volet, fics de rhetore consul,† <lb/>
            Thou from a rhetorician mayst become, <lb/>
            If fortune will, a consul. <lb/>
            It appears, from the same passage of Juvenal, that Quintilian, <lb/>
            though parents were unwilling to pay liberally for the educa­ <lb/>
            tion of their sons, was a rich man, <lb/>
            Unde igitur tot <lb/>
            Quintilianus habet saltus ? <lb/>
            Whence has Quintilian gain'd <lb/>
            Such large estates ? <lb/>
            and the satirist attributes his wealth to the favour of fortune.</p>
          <p>When be died, is uncertain. Dodwell supposes that he was <lb/>
            alive A.D. 118, when he was probably seventy-five years old.</p>
          <p>His character, as a man, appears to have stood fair in the <lb/>
            estimation of his contemporaries. The tendency of what <lb/>
            Juvenal says of him, is to make us look upon him in a favour­ <lb/>
            able light. Gesner supposes that in the verses <lb/>
            Felix et pulcher et acer, <lb/>
            Felix et sapiens et nobilis et generosus, <lb/>
            every epithet is to be literally applied to Quintilian; that the <lb/>
            word pulcher proves him to have been of a handsome person; <lb/>
            and that the words in the sixth satire, <note type="footnote"> * In Gratiarum Action.. </note><note type="footnote">t Juv. Sat. vii. 185. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            An expectas ut Quintilianus ametur ?* <lb/>
            show that he was free from the vices into which the handsome <lb/>
            were frequently enticed. It is not, however, clear that every <lb/>
            one of Juvenal's characteristics was meant to apply strictly to <lb/>
            Quintilian ; yet there is nothing to prevent us from entertain­ <lb/>
            ing as good an opinion of Quintilian's moral character as <lb/>
            Gesner entertained.</p>
          <p>In his professional capacity, he shows, with great strength <lb/>
            and felicity of argument, that a great orator must be a good <lb/>
            man; and he recommends the strictest abstinence from all <lb/>
            licentiousness or immorality in language. Yet he never forgot <lb/>
            that he was a pleader, or that a pleader thinks himself jus­ <lb/>
            titled in resorting to every possible means for the establishment <lb/>
            of his case. He thought, with Cicero and the Stoic Panaetius, <lb/>
            that a good orator, and a good man, may sometimes tell a lie, <lb/>
            if it be told with a good motive ;f that the ignorant may be <lb/>
            misled with a view to their benefit; that the mind of a judge <lb/>
            may be drawn away from the contemplation of truth; ‡ that we <lb/>
            may sometimes speak in favour of vice to promote a virtuous <lb/>
            object; t that if a dishonourable course appear advisable, it <lb/>
            may be advocated in plausible terms; and that vices may <lb/>
            sometimes be honoured with the names of the proximate <lb/>
            virtues. But his worst offence against morality is that he <lb/>
            sanctions the subornation of witnesses to declare what they <lb/>
            know to be false. || He seems to have thought, indeed, that a <lb/>
            pleader might do all manner of evil if he could but persuade <lb/>
            himself that good would come of it.</p>
          <p>His flattery of Domitian ¶ is gross ; he calls him the most <lb/>
            upright of moral censors, a master in eloquence, the greatest <lb/>
            of poets, and a deity; but such adulation was sanctioned by <lb/>
            the usage of the time, and was not much worse than that <lb/>
            offered to the same emperor by Valerius Flaceus, or that of <lb/>
            Lucan to Nero, except that poets are allowed more liberty in <lb/>
            such respects than prose writers. That given by Velleius <lb/>
            Paterculus to Tiberius is of an equally extravagant description</p>
          <p>The great merit of Quintilian's treatise on oratory, above all <lb/>
            works of the kind that had preceded it, was its superior <note type="footnote"> * Juv. vi. 75. </note><note type="footnote">t Quint. ii. 17, 27; Cic.

            copiousness of matter and felicity of embellishment. It does <lb/>
            not offer a mere dry list of rules, but illustrates them with an <lb/>
            abundance of examples from writers of all kinds, interspersed <lb/>
            with observations that must interest, not only the orator, but <lb/>
            readers of every class. It embraces a far wider field than the <lb/>
            De Oratore of Cicero, and treats of all that concerns eloquence <lb/>
            with far greater minuteness. The orator conducts his pupil <lb/>
            from the cradle to the utmost heights of the oratorical art. <lb/>
            He speaks of the books that he must read in his boyhood, and <lb/>
            in his maturer years. He gives him precepts on study, on <lb/>
            morals, on preparing and stating causes, on arranging and <lb/>
            enforcing arguments, on the attainment of style, on elocution <lb/>
            and gesture, and on everything that can be supposed conducive <lb/>
            to the formation of an able public speaker.</p>
          <p>In the delivery of these precepts he manifests great judg­ <lb/>
            ment, extensive reading, and the utmost anxiety to do his <lb/>
            work well. His style is so studiedly elegant and graceful, <lb/>
            that the reader will sometimes be disposed to think that it <lb/>
            would be improved by the appearance of occasional negligence. <lb/>
            His La.tinity, considering the age in which he lived, deserves <lb/>
            the highest praise for its purity. His figurative embellish­ <lb/>
            ments are in general extremely happy; and it is justly <lb/>
            observed by Dr. Warton* that "No author ever adorned a <lb/>
            scientifical treatise with so many beautiful metaphors." It <lb/>
            must however be observed that he allows himself, in his illus­ <lb/>
            trations, to use the conjunctions quasi and velut with rather too <lb/>
            great frequency. In his phraseology, also, he is sometimes <lb/>
            too fond of brevity. His quotations, as Spalding shows, are <lb/>
            not always in the exact words of the authors, being apparently <lb/>
            given from memory.</p>
          <p>The parts which have most attractions for the general <lb/>
            reader are the first and second books, which relate to ele­ <lb/>
            mentary education, and the last three, especially the tenth, <lb/>
            which contains criticisms, of great spirit and justice, on a <lb/>
            long series of Greek and Latin authors in all departments <lb/>
            of literature. His characters of Homer, Aristotle, Cicero, and <lb/>
            Seneca, and his comparisons between Demosthenes and Cicero, <lb/>
            Thucydides and Herodotus, are fine specimens of critical <lb/>
            acuteness and discrimination. " I have often perused with <lb/>
            pleasure," says Gibbon,* " a chapter of Quintilian in which <note type="footnote"> * Essay on Pope, voL i. p. 177. </note><note type="footnote">t VoL ix. p. 442, note. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            that judicious critic enumerates and appreciates the series of <lb/>
            Greek and Latin classics."</p>
          <p>We learn from Quintilian himself- that he wrote a book <lb/>
            On the Causes of the Corruption of Eloquence; and it has con­ <lb/>
            sequently been inquired whether the anonymous Dialogus de <lb/>
            Oratoribus, which is also entitled, in some copies, Sive de <lb/>
            Causis Corruptæ Eloquentiæ, may not be the work to which he <lb/>
            alludes. But the phraseology of that Dialogue bears much <lb/>
            less resemblance to the style of Quintilian than to that of <lb/>
            Tacitus, to whom, accordingly, it is generally attributed. A <lb/>
            coincidence between two passages of the Dialogue, and one of <lb/>
            Pliny's Epistles, strengthens the presumption that Tacitus was <lb/>
            the author. The writer of the Dialogue, c. 9, says,</p>
          <p>Adjice quod poetis, si mod6 dignum aliquid elaborare et effingere <lb/>
            velint, relinquenda conversatio amicorum, et jucunditas urbis, dese­ <lb/>
            renda cetera officia, atque, ut ipsi dicunt, in nemora et lucos, id est, <lb/>
            in solitudinem, recedendum est: <lb/>
            and in c. 12.</p>
          <p>Nemora vero et luci, et secretum iter,—tantam mini afferunt <lb/>
            voluptatem, ut inter præcipuos carminum fructus enumerem : <lb/>
            and Pliny, in a letter to Tacitus, has,</p>
          <p>Itaque poemata quiescunt, quae tu inter nemora et lucos commodissimè <lb/>
            perfici putas.</p>
          <p>This coincidence was first noticed by Dr. Stock in his <lb/>
            edition of Tacitus printed at Dublin in 1788</p>
          <p>Attached to the editions of Quintilian are one hundred and <lb/>
            sixty-four Declamations, which remain out of a collection that <lb/>
            originally consisted of three hundred and eighty-eight. Nine­ <lb/>
            teen of these are of considerable length, and are entitled, in <lb/>
            Burmann's and other editions, Quintiliani Declamationes; the <lb/>
            other one hundred and forty-five are called Excerpta ex Quin­ <lb/>
            tiliano. But Burmann did not suppose that any of them <lb/>
            were really the work of Quintilian; he regarded them as <lb/>
            having proceeded from various hands at different periods, <lb/>
            and as of little utility either for promoting eloquence or illus­ <lb/>
            trating law; and adds that, though he had spent much labour, <lb/>
            of no very pleasant kind, in correcting them, he would wil­ <lb/>
            lingly consign them all to oblivion to recover one of the lost <lb/>
            books of Livy or Tacitus. <note type="footnote"> * B. viii. fin.; b, vi. introd. </note></p><pb n="XI"/>
            
          <p>Quintilian was first brought to light, on the revival of <lb/>
            learning, by Poggio the Florentine, who found a manuscript <lb/>
            of the Institutions in the monastery of St. Gall, near Con­ <lb/>
            stance, and made a transcript from it with his own hand, as <lb/>
            he states in a letter to Guarini, dated December, 1417.* <lb/>
            This manuscript is supposed to be the same with that which <lb/>
            is now preserved at Florence under the name of the Codex <lb/>
            Laurentianus.</p>
          <p>The Editio Princeps of the Institutions appeared at Rome <lb/>
            in 1470, from the press of J. P. do Lignamine; and the <lb/>
            second edition came forth in the same year from that of <lb/>
            Sweynheim and Pannartz. In the following year was pub­ <lb/>
            lished that of Jenson at Venice. All these were in folio, as <lb/>
            was also that of Raphael Regius, Venice, 1493, who was the <lb/>
            first that attempted to correct the numerous errors in Quin­ <lb/>
            tilian's text. He was a very acute editor, and, considering <lb/>
            the state of learning in his age, very successful in his emen­ <lb/>
            dations.</p>
          <p>Nine or ten more editions, all of little account, appeared <lb/>
            between this and that of Badius Ascensius, Paris, 1516, who <lb/>
            followed the text of Regius, but improved it by introducing <lb/>
            some emendations from a manuscript of Laurentius Valla.</p>
          <p>The nineteen longer Declamations were first published, with <lb/>
            the Institutions, at Treviso, in 1482, and one hundred and <lb/>
            thirty-six of the shorter ones at Paris in 1509. The other <lb/>
            nine were added from an old manuscript by Peter Pithou, <lb/>
            Paris, 1580.</p>
          <p>The next editions, after that of Badius Ascensius, that did <lb/>
            much for the improvement of the text, were those of Mosella­ <lb/>
            nus, 4to., 1527, and Colinæus, 8vo. 1531. The Gryphii, <lb/>
            Sebastian, Francis, and Antonius, produced several editions, <lb/>
            the first of which was that of Sebastian, Paris, 1534, but all <lb/>
            those that had the charge of them, whoever they were, left the <lb/>
            text nearly the same as they found it.</p>
          <p>In ] 543 appeared the edition of Camerarius aud Sichardus, <lb/>
            with the Castigationes of Philander, which, according to Gesner, <lb/>
            had been published eight years before, in a separate volume, <lb/>
            at Basil. These three contributed something to the emen­ <lb/>
            dation and illustration of the text.</p>
          <p>In 1553 there was published an edition at Paris by Thomas <note type="footnote"> * Fabric. Bibl. Lat. ed. Ernesti. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            Richardus, who republished it in 1556, with notes which were <lb/>
            said to be written by Turnebus, but which cannot be proved <lb/>
            to have been his, and have been generally regarded as inferior <lb/>
            to what might have been expected from him. Burmann and <lb/>
            Spalding call the writer Pseudo-Turnebus. Many of these <lb/>
            annotations, however, illustrate passages very happily; and I <lb/>
            have frequently cited them, appending the name " Turnebus."</p>
          <p>The Variorum edition of 1665, commenced by Schrevelius <lb/>
            and finished after his death by Frederic Gronovius, is useful, <lb/>
            but of no great estimation. Burmann charges the editor or <lb/>
            editors with supine negligence.</p>
          <p>Passing over a variety of minor editions, we come to the <lb/>
            first English edition, published by Edmund Gibson, 4to., <lb/>
            Oxford, 1693. Gibson seems to have been but a young man <lb/>
            when he brought out this edition. He professed to have <lb/>
            collated three manuscripts, two at Oxford and one at Cam­ <lb/>
            bridge, but both Burmann and Spalding accuse him of not <lb/>
            having made his collations with sufficient care.</p>
          <p>In 1698 appeared at Strasburg, in 4to, the edition of Ulric <lb/>
            Obrecht, with various emendations in the text, many of them <lb/>
            very judicious, but without notes. He had intended to publish <lb/>
            a separate volume of annotations, with the reasons for his <lb/>
            corrections, but was prevented by death from executing his <lb/>
            design.</p>
          <p>In 1715 Rollin published what we may call a selection from <lb/>
            the Institutions of Quintilian, for he omitted all such parts as <lb/>
            he thought not necessary to be read by youth in modern <lb/>
            times. His text is tolerably correct, but he is too sparing of <lb/>
            illustration.</p>
          <p>Five years afterwards, 1720, followed the well-known edition <lb/>
            of Burmann, containing the principal annotations of all pre­ <lb/>
            ceding commentators, and some of Burmann's own. What <lb/>
            Burmann himself did, however, was less than might have <lb/>
            been expected from him; he neglected many passages that <lb/>
            required both correction and illustration. When he attempted <lb/>
            emendation, he was extremely timid, and not always happy.</p>
          <p>What Burmann had omitted, Capperonier, Paris, 1725, <lb/>
            attempted in some degree to supply. But he wanted judg­ <lb/>
            ment to direct his good intentions. Burmann had neglected <lb/>
            to explain any of the legal or rhetorical terms used by Quin­ <lb/>
            tilian ; Capperonier resolved to explain them all with the ut­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XIII"/>
            most minuteness. He accordingly extracted, from various <lb/>
            sources, but especially from the Greek rhetoricians, all that he <lb/>
            could possibly bring to bear on the technicalities of his <lb/>
            author; but from not having divided his texts into sections, <lb/>
            to which he might refer, he has been under the necessity of <lb/>
            repeating scores of times, illustrations which it would have <lb/>
            been sufficient to have given once. His pages are accordingly <lb/>
            encumbered with superfluous matter, and he himself, from the <lb/>
            way in which he speaks of his doings, seems proud of the <lb/>
            petty erudition which he has so industriously accumulated. <lb/>
            Burmann thought himself insulted in the preface, and took <lb/>
            ample revenge in a pamphlet addressed Ad Claudium Cappe­ <lb/>
            ronnerium, Theologum Licentiatum, Diaconum Ambianensem <lb/>
            et Græcæ Linguœ Professorem, do nova ejus Quintiliani <lb/>
            editione, a pamphlet which consists of one hundred and two <lb/>
            pages, and of which the index refers to Capperonnerii calum­ <lb/>
            nice, obtrectationes, ignorantiæ, furta, ineptiæ, errore8, p. 1—102. <lb/>
            Yet it must be allowed, as Spalding justly observes, that <lb/>
            " notwithstanding Burmann's strictures and ridicule, a know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the technical terms of rhetoric, such as Capperonier <lb/>
            possessed in no small degree, is necessary, not only for the <lb/>
            interpretation of Quintilian, but for estimating the value of <lb/>
            various readings." In capacity for judging of readings, how­ <lb/>
            ever, Capperonier was deficient; and Gesner, in speaking of <lb/>
            his notes, intimates that such of them as are not on rhetorical <lb/>
            or legal points are undeserving of notice.</p>
          <p>Capperonier was followed by Gesner, 1738. whose text is <lb/>
            on the whole rather more correct than Burmann's, but who <lb/>
            quietly passed over many passages that demanded correction <lb/>
            and explanation.</p>
          <p>But all preceding editors were far surpassed by George <lb/>
            Lewis Spalding, whose first volume appeared in 1798. He <lb/>
            commenced his work with an ample store of critical mate­ <lb/>
            rials, and the aid of all that had been done by his prede­ <lb/>
            cessors ; but, what was of far more consequence, he devoted <lb/>
            himself to his undertaking with a resolution to leave no appa­ <lb/>
            rent corruptions in the text unamended, and no obscurity <lb/>
            unelucidated. As he was well qualified, by learning and per­ <lb/>
            spicacity for his task, he has produced a work of the highest <lb/>
            excellence, both for correctness and for illustration. If he <lb/>
            deserves censure on any account, it is for having paid occa­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XIV"/>
            sionally too much attention to worthless readings, and for <lb/>
            having been rather too fastidious about the Latin of his notes, <lb/>
            which, had they been more concise and spirited, would, even <lb/>
            if less elegant, have pleased the reader better. He did not <lb/>
            live to complete his work, but died suddenly when he was <lb/>
            near the end, and the conclusion was committed to the able <lb/>
            management of Buttmann, who, to one of Spalding's notes on <lb/>
            the third chapter of the twelfth book, makes the following <lb/>
            addition : <lb/>
            Hæc man 3 quum scripsisset Georgius Ludovicus Spalding, vespere <lb/>
            ereptus est Quintiliano, et his literis universis, et si quid in quocunque <lb/>
            genere boni aut re aut humanissimo gaudio plausuque juvandum erat.</p>
          <p>" The Translations of Quintilian," says Ernesti, " are but <lb/>
            few; for his Institutions are more difficult to render into our <lb/>
            modern tongues than other works of antiquity." Experience <lb/>
            has enabled me to form some opinion of the justice of this <lb/>
            remark.</p>
          <p>Four versions have, however, appeared in French; one by <lb/>
            Michael de Pures, published in 1663 ; another by the Abbé <lb/>
            Nicolas Gedoyn, which appeared first in 1718, and has been <lb/>
            several times reprinted. Gedoyn's performance deserves great <lb/>
            praise; he seems to have been extremely anxious to express <lb/>
            the sense of his author, and is said to have spent ten years <lb/>
            over his task. But the version is in some places, as Ernesti <lb/>
            remarks, fallacious. The French translation published by <lb/>
            Nisard, 1853, in his " Collection des Auteurs Latins," is <lb/>
            modelled on that of Gedoyn, and supplies a few short pas­ <lb/>
            sages which he had omitted. The French version of C. V. <lb/>
            Ouizille, Paris, 1829, I have not seen.</p>
          <p>In English we have had two versions. The earlier was that <lb/>
            of Guthrie, printed first, I believe, in 1756. The quality <lb/>
            most remarkable in Guthrie is his audacity; he was resolved <lb/>
            to give some English for Quintilian's sentences, and when he <lb/>
            could not see the sense, either by the light of his own scanty <lb/>
            learning, or of Gedoyn's French, he boldly excogitated some­ <lb/>
            thing, and thrust on his reader the offspring of his own mind <lb/>
            for that of Quintilian's. Of his travesties, that I may not <lb/>
            seem to do him injustice, I will give a few specimens. In the <lb/>
            fourteenth chapter of the fifth book Quintilian says,</p><pb n="XV"/>
            
          <p>Hæ [quæ ationes] primam habent propositionem. Sucrilegium com­ <lb/>
            misisti: Non quisquis hominem occidit, cædis tenetur.</p>
          <p>For which Guthrie gives, <lb/>
            " In all such matters a leading proposition is laid down, which is <lb/>
            the subject-matter of contest. Says one party, You have been guilty of <lb/>
            sacrilege, for you have killed a man." Says the other, "If I have <lb/>
            killed a man, it does not therefore follow that I have been guilty of sacri­ <lb/>
            lege. "</p>
          <p>In the third chapter* of the sixth book Quintilian records <lb/>
            the following jest: <lb/>
            Serus Dolabellæ, quum interrogaretur, an dominus ejus auctionem <lb/>
            proposuisset, Domum, inquit, vendidit.</p>
          <p>This Guthrie metamorphoses into <lb/>
            " When Dolabella was about to purchase a slave, who offered himself to <lb/>
            sale, he asked him whether he had his master's leave to be sold; He <lb/>
            has, replied the slave, sold his house."</p>
          <p>Quintilian remarks, on the collocation of phrases, <lb/>
            CaVendum ne decrescat oratio, et fortiori subjungatur aliquid infir­ <lb/>
            mius, ut sacrilego fur, aut latroni petulans..</p>
          <p>Guthrie presents us with <lb/>
            " We are to avoid a dwindling of style; for whatever is weak ought to <lb/>
            be subjected to what is strong: Thus sacrilege is a higher crime than <lb/>
            theft, and robbery than impudence."</p>
          <p>What he conceived himself to mean, when he was writing that <lb/>
            " whatever is weak ought to be subjected to what is strong," it <lb/>
            is not easy to conjecture.</p>
          <p>Quintilian observes of definition,† <lb/>
            Opus est aliquando finitione obscurioribus et ignotioribus verbis, ut <lb/>
            quid sit clarigatio, proletarius. Erit et interim notis nomine verbis, ut <lb/>
            quid sit penus, quid litus. Quæ varietas efficit, ut earn quidam con­ <lb/>
            jecturæ, quidam qualitati, quidam legitimis quæstionibus subjecerint.</p>
          <p>What Guthrie offers, is, <lb/>
            " There is no way of defining some things, but in terms more obscure <lb/>
            than the term that is defined. Other things are so clear in their sense, <lb/>
            they require no definition as to the term. This variety has occasionel <lb/>
            a great deal of logical jargon, which is very unprofitable to the busi­ <lb/>
            ness of an orator."</p>
          <p>If the reader choose to follow him a few sentences further, he <lb/>
            may see a little more of strange metamorphosis. <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 99. </note><note type="footnote">†. VII. 3, 13. </note> <pb n="XVI"/>
             </p>
          <p>In the fifth chapter of the eighth book* Quintilian says, <lb/>
            Est et quod appellatur a novis <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόημα</foreign>, quâ voce omnia intellectus <lb/>
            accipi potest, sed hoc nomine donârunt ea quæ non dicunt, verùm <lb/>
            intelligi volunt; ut in eum, quern sæpius a ludo redemerat soror, <lb/>
            agentem cum eâ talionis, quod ei pollicem dormienti recidisset, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>Guthrie gives, <lb/>
            " The word understanding may be indifferently applied to all opera­ <lb/>
            tions of the intellects. But when we say that a thing is understood, we <lb/>
            suppose it to be suppressed. Thus a fellow whose sister had several times <lb/>
            redeemed him from the profession of prize-fighting, sued her, upon the <lb/>
            statute of Talio, for cutting off his thumb, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>At the end of the tenth book Quintilian observes of tho <lb/>
            note-books left behind him by Cicero,</p>
          <p>Nam Ciceronis ad præsens mod<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> tempus aptatos libertus Tiro <lb/>
            contraxit; quos non ideo excuse, quia non probem, sed ut sint magis <lb/>
            admirabiles.</p>
          <p>Which Guthrie transforms thus: <lb/>
            " The notes Cicero left behind him were only for his own private <lb/>
            use, and were abridged by his freedman Tiro ; an action which I do not <lb/>
            approve of; but I mention it, that we may admire them the more..</p>
          <p>Quintilian, at the end of the ninth chapter of the twelfth <lb/>
            book, says that the orator is to study his cause well before he <lb/>
            ventures to speak upon it, premeditation being safer than <lb/>
            writing: <lb/>
            Licet tamen præcogitare plum. et animum ad omnes casus componere; <lb/>
            idque est tutius stilo, quo faciliùs et omittitur cogitatio, et transfertur.</p>
          <p>Guthrie makes him say, <lb/>
            " Upon the whole we ought to consider and premeditate every <lb/>
            circumstance, and to be prepared against all events and objections. <lb/>
            This is most safely done by writing. For thereby we can most readily <lb/>
            admit or transpose a thought."</p>
          <p>Yet he has the confidence to say, in a note on the second <lb/>
            chapter of the sixth book, that " the reader who is acquainted <lb/>
            with the original of this chapter, will not be surprised at my <lb/>
            being obliged now and then to throw in a word that is not in <lb/>
            the original;" and adds that "the Abbé Gedoyn, though he <lb/>
            takes much greater liberties of that sort than I do, has in this <lb/>
            chapter several times mistaken or obscured our author's. <lb/>
            sense" Gedoyn is closeness and accuracy itself compared <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XVII"/>
            with Guthrie, and would have shuddered at the thought of <lb/>
            "throwing in " such words as Guthrie forces on " our author." <lb/>
            It would be easy to find dozens of similar instances.</p>
          <p>Patsall, who followed Guthrie in 1774, is better on the <lb/>
            whole ; perhaps he has not more than half as many faults as <lb/>
            Guthrie; but many of what he has are very gross. He <lb/>
            translates Mithridates corpore ingenti, perinde armatus, "Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates having likewise the advantage of a huge body," from <lb/>
            which single specimen the reader may fully estimate his <lb/>
            ability to exhibit in another language the niceties of Quin­ <lb/>
            tilian a diction. It is to be observed that neither Guthrie's <lb/>
            version, nor Patsall's, is complete; for whole chapters, and <lb/>
            large portions of chapters, are omitted in each of them.</p>
          <p>There are two Italian versions of the Institutes, by Orazio <lb/>
            Toscanella, 4to., Venice, 1568, and by Garilli, Vercelli, 1780. <lb/>

          <p>Arrangement necessary to be studied, § 1—3. But no general rules <lb/>
            can be given with respect to it, 4 Page 1</p>
          <p>CH. 1. Definition of arrangement, § 1. Must be varied according to the <lb/>
            nature of causes, 2, 3. How Quintilian used to study and contem­ <lb/>
            plate causes, 4—9. The best order for arguments, 10—12. How we <lb/>
            may reply to a single accusation, 13—15. Or to several, 16—18. <lb/>
            How we may omit or neglect some points, 19—22. Further <lb/>
            remarks on the consideration of a cause, 23—25. We must pro­ <lb/>
            ceed by degrees to the most important points, 26—28. Quintilian <lb/>
            used to increase the points in his own favour by division, 29-33. <lb/>
            Invention assisted by division, 34—36. Which party should speak <lb/>
            first, is not a matter for great consideration, 37—39. How the <lb/>
            more intrinsic points in a cause are to be discovered is shown by a <lb/>
            subject for declamation in the schools, 40—64 .. 2</p>
          <p>On. II. Conjecture relates to fact and intention, and to three divisions <lb/>
            of time, § 1—6. The question may regard the fact and the agent <lb/>
            at the same time, or the fact only, or the agent only, 7—10. Con­ <lb/>
            cerning both together, 11-15. Concerning the fact only, 16, 17. <lb/>
            Concerning the agent; anticategoria, 18—21. Comparison managed <lb/>
            in several ways, 22—24. Conjecture sometimes twofold, 25—27. <lb/>
            Proof from persons, 28—34. From motives and causes, 35—41. <lb/>
            Intentions, opportunities, place, time, 42, 43. Consideration <lb/>
            whether the accused had the power to do the act with which he is <lb/>
            charged, 44, 45. Whether he did it, 46—49. Other considera­ <lb/>
            tions in different causes, 50—53. Error carried from the schools <lb/>
            into the forum, 54—57 .. . . . 18</p>
          <p>CH III. Of definition; it has something in common with conjecture and <lb/>
            quality, § 1, 2. Various reasons why it is used, 3—7. Three species <lb/>
            of it, 8—11. Other diversities, more suited to philosophical dis­ <lb/>
            cussions than to the business of the orator, 12—16. We must <lb/>
            beware of defining too subtilely, 17, 18. Method in definition, <lb/>
            19—22. How a definition is overthrown, 23—27. A general <lb/>
            definition may be adapted to cur own cause, 28—34. Some <lb/>
            concluding remarks, 35, 36 .. . . 33</p><pb n="XX"/>
            
          <p>On. IV. The consideration of quality may have regard to more points <lb/>
            than one in any matter, § 1—3. The strongest kind of defence is <lb/>
            when the accused says that the deed laid to his charge was blame­ <lb/>
            less, 4—6. We may defend an act by extrinsic aids, 7—12. Another <lb/>
            mode of proceeding is to transfer the guilt to another, 13, 14. Wo <lb/>
            may consider whether the weight of the charge can be extenuated, <lb/>
            15, 16. Deprecation, 17—20. Questions about rewards, 21—23. <lb/>
            Considerations of quality admit the highest efforts of the orator, <lb/>
            24. Causes which Virginius puts under this head, 25—31. Other <lb/>
            species of causes, 32—34 .... Page 42</p>
          <p>CH. V. Questions as to legality of proceedings, § 1—4. As to par­ <lb/>
            ticular points of law, 5, 6 . . . . 53</p>
          <p>CH. VI. Questions about writing, and the intention of the writer, either <lb/>
            regard both these points, or one only, § 1-4. Arguments against <lb/>
            the letter in writings, 5—8. In favour of it, 9—11. General <lb/>
            questions under this head, 12 .....55</p>
          <p>CH. VII. Of contradictory laws, § 1—6. Right is either admitted or <lb/>
            doubtful, 7—9. Contradictory points in the same law, 10 . 58</p>
          <p>CH. VIII. Of syllogism ; intimately connected with definition, § 1, 2. <lb/>
            Determines by inference what is uncertain in the letter of any <lb/>
            writing, 3—6. Or even what is not expressed in the writing, 7 . 60</p>
          <p>CH. IX. Ambiguity in words, § 1—3. Words divided, 4. Com­ <lb/>
            pounded, 5, 6. Ambiguity of words in connexion with one <lb/>
            another, 7—13. Some remarks on ambiguity, 14, 15 ..63</p>
          <p>CH. X. Affinity between different statu, § 1—4. Some precepts with <lb/>
            regard to causes can be given only when the causes themselves are <lb/>
            stated, 5—7. Impossible to give instruction on every particular <lb/>
            point, 8, 9. Many things the student must teach himself, and must <lb/>
            depend for success on his own efforts, 10—17 ..66</p>

          <p>A plain and simple method of teaching to be preferred, § 1—5. Re­ <lb/>
            capitulation of the precepts given in the preceding parts of the <lb/>
            work, 6—12. Style and delivery require more ability and study <lb/>
            than other parts of oratory, 13—15. Excellence in them attained <lb/>
            by study and art, 16, 17. Yet a speaker may be too solicitous <lb/>
            about his language, 18—26. Necessity of practice, 27—30. We <lb/>
            must not always be striving for something greater and higher, <lb/>
            31—33 . .0 ... 0 . 71</p>
          <p>Cu. I. Style depends on the judicious choice of words, and the <lb/>
            judicious combination of them. Necessity of studying to speak <lb/>
            pure Latin . . . . .0 . 78</p><pb n="XXI"/>
            
          <p>CH. II. Propriety of words : words are proper in more than one sense <lb/>
            § 1—3. A word which may not be exactly proper, is not always to <lb/>
            be condemned as improper, 4—6. Some words may be proper, and <lb/>
            yet have no oratorical merit, 7, 8. The excellence of significancy <lb/>
            9—11. Concerning obscurity, 12, 13. Arises from the use of unusual <lb/>
            words, or from faulty composition, 14—16. From circumlocution, <lb/>
            17, 18. From desire for brevity, 19—21. Perspicuity the chief <lb/>
            excellence of language, 22—24 ... Page 79</p>
          <p>CH. III. Of ornament of style ; fondness for it in orators, § 1—4. It is <lb/>
            however of service in gaining the attention of an audience, 5, 6. <lb/>
            What sort of ornament should be studied; some faults border on <lb/>
            excellences, 7—10. Ornament must be varied according to the <lb/>
            nature of the subject, 11—14. Ornament from the choice of words, <lb/>
            15—18. Some words are used rather from necessity than because <lb/>
            they are approved, 19, 20. Common words sometimes most <lb/>
            effective, 21—23. Of the use of old words, 24—29. The moderns <lb/>
            cautious in forming new words, 30—37. Unbecoming expressions <lb/>
            to be avoided, 38, 39. The grace of a speaker's style depends <lb/>
            partly on the language which he uses, and partly on his mode of <lb/>
            delivery, 40, 41. Suitableness of style, 42, 43. Various faults of <lb/>
            style; <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸκακέμφατον</foreign>, 44—47. Meanness, 48, 49. Diminution, <lb/>

            Affectation, ungraceful arrangement of words or matter, inelegant <lb/>
            use of figures, injudicious mixture of different styles, 56—60. <lb/>
            Excellence of clear and vivid description, 61—70. To attain it <lb/>
            nature must be studied and imitated, 71. Assisted by similes, 72. <lb/>
            But care must be taken that the similes themselves be lucid, 73. <lb/>

            to language, 87—90 ......86</p>

            parts of the same cause, 6, 7. The orator's chief consideration is, <lb/>
            what it becoming, 8—11. What is becoming is generally found in <lb/>
            union with what is expedient, 12—14. Vanity and self-applause <lb/>
            always unbecoming in an orator, 15—17. Whether Cicero in <lb/>

            judgment must be infallible, 27, 28. Other faults in orators <lb/>
            noticed, 29, 30. Different kinds of oratory are suited to different <lb/>
            speakers, 31—38. An orator should also adapt his style to the <lb/>
            characters of those for whom he pleads, 39—42. He must also <lb/>
            vary it to suit those to whom he addresses himself, 43—45. He <lb/>
            must also have regard to time and place, 46—48. To the nature <lb/>

            How he may touch on delicate subjects, 84. How he may soften <lb/>
            his language in an attack on any one, 85—90. Excess in every <lb/>

            and remarkable powers, 4—10. Simonides was the first that <lb/>
            taught an art of memory, 11—16. What method of assisting the <lb/>
            memory has been tried by orators, 17—23. Its insufficiency for <lb/>
            fixing a written or premeditated speech in the mind, 24—26. A <lb/>
            more simple method recommended, 27—39. The greatest of all <lb/>
            aids to the memory is exercise, 40—43. Whether an orator should <lb/>

          <p>Importance of the remaining portion of the work. Quintilian goes <lb/>
            farther than Cicero in forming the Orator.</p>
          <p>CH. I. A great orator must be a good man, according to Cato's defini­ <lb/>
            tion, § 1, 2. A bad man cannot be a consummate orator, as he is <lb/>
            deficient in wisdom, 3—5. The mind of a bad man is too much <lb/>
            distracted with cares and remorse, 6, 7. A bad man will not <lb/>
            speak with the same authority and effect on virtue and morality <lb/>
            as a good man, 8—13. Objections to this opinion answered, 14— <lb/>
            22. A bad man may doubtless speak with great force, but he <lb/>
            would make nearer approaches to perfect eloquence if he were a <lb/>
            good man, 23—32. Yet we must be able to conceive arguments <lb/>
            on either side of a question, 33—35. A good man may sometimes <lb/>
            be justified in misleading those whom he addresses, for the attain­ <lb/>
            ment of some good object, 36—45 . ...391</p>
          <p>CH. If. An orator must study to maintain a high moral character, § 1, <lb/>
            2. Tendencies to virtue implanted by nature may be strengthened <lb/>
            by cultivation, 3—9. Division of philosophy into three parts, <lb/>
            natural, moral, and dialectic ; remarks on the last kind, 10—14. <lb/>

            on the true merits of Attic eloquence, and on those who inju­ <lb/>
            diciously affected it, 20—26. The Romans were excelled by the <lb/>
            Greeks only in delivery; cause of the inferiority of the Romans in <lb/>
            this respect, 27—34. The Romans exhorted to cultivate force of <lb/>
            thought and brilliancy of language, 35—39 Folly of those who <lb/>
            would reject all ornament, 40—48. Whether a difference should <lb/>
            be made in the styles of speaking and writing, 49—57. Of the <lb/>
            simple, grand, and florid styles, 58—68. Many varieties and <lb/>
            mixtures of these styles, 69—72. Of corrupt taste in eloquence, <lb/>
            73—76. A good style may be acquired by study and practice ; <lb/>
            but we must carry no'fancied excellence to excess, 77—80 . 431</p>

            through old age, § 1—4. How his time may be employed after he <lb/>
            has retired, 5—7. Quintilian hastens to conclude his work; he <lb/>
            shows that students have ample time for acquiring all the qualifi <lb/>
            cations, as far as nature will allow, that he has specified, 8—20. <lb/>
            He proves, from the examples of great men, how much may be <lb/>
            done, and observes that even moderate attainments in eloquence <lb/>
            are attended with very great advantages, 21—29. Exhortation to <lb/>

          <p>Arrangement necessary to be studied, § 1—3. But no general rules <lb/>
            can be given with respect to it, 4.</p>
          <p>1. OF Invention, I think, enough has been said; for I have <lb/>
            not only treated of the mode of informing judges, but have <lb/>
            touched on the art of exciting their feelings. But as it is not <lb/>
            enough for those who are erecting edifices, to collect stones <lb/>
            and materials, and other things useful for the architect, unless <lb/>
            the hand of the workman be also applied to the disposition <lb/>
            and collocation of them, so, in speaking, however abundant be <lb/>
            the quantity of matter, it will form but a confused mass and <lb/>
            heap, unless similar arrangement bind it together, disposed in <lb/>
            regular order, and with its several parts connected one with <lb/>
            another. 2. It is therefore not without reason that arrange­ <lb/>
            ment is considered the second of the five parts* of oratory; for <lb/>
            though all the limbs of a statue be cast, it is not a statue <lb/>
            until they are united; and if, in our own bodies, or those of <lb/>
            any other animals, we were to displace or alter the position <lb/>
            of any part, they would, though they had the same number of <lb/>
            parts, be but monsters. Even our joints, if but in the least <lb/>
            degree dislocated, lose their whole use and power of action; <lb/>
            and disorder in an army is an impediment to its efficiency. <lb/>
            3. Nor do those appear to be in the wrong, who think that <lb/>
            the system of the world is maintained by order, and that, if its <lb/>
            order were broken, it would cease to exist as a whole. <note type="footnote"> * Compare vi. to 1. Spalding. See note on iii 1,1. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/>
          <p>So speech, if deficient in that quality, must necessarily be <lb/>
            confused, and float like a ship without a helm ; it can have no <lb/>
            coherence ; it must exhibit many repetitions, and many omis­ <lb/>
            sions ; and, like a traveller wandering by night in unknown <lb/>
            regions, must, as having no stated course or object, be guided <lb/>
            by chance rather than design.</p>
          <p>4. The whole of this book, therefore, shall be devoted to <lb/>
            arrangement; a quality, which, if it could be taught by rules <lb/>
            adapted to every kind of subject, would not have fallen to the <lb/>
            lot of so small a number of speakers. But as the forms of <lb/>
            causes have been, and will ever be, infinite in variety, and as <lb/>
            no one cause, during so many ages, has been found in all <lb/>
            respects similar to another, the pleader must exercise his <lb/>
            sagacity, his discernment, his invention, and his judgment, <lb/>
            and must ask counsel from himself. Yet I do not deny that <lb/>
            there are some things that may be taught by precept, and <lb/>
            of these I shall not fail to treat.</p>

          <p>Definition of arrangement, § 1. Must be varied according to the nature <lb/>
            of causes, 2, 3. How Quintilian used to study and contemplate <lb/>
            causes, 4—9. The best order for arguments, 10—12. How we <lb/>
            may reply to a single accusation, 13—15. Or to several, 16—18. <lb/>
            How we may omit or neglect some points, 19—22. Further <lb/>
            remarks on the consideration of a cause, 23—25. We must pro­ <lb/>
            ceed by degrees to the most important points, 26—28. Quintilian <lb/>
            used to increase the points in his own favour by division, 29—83. <lb/>
            Invention assisted by division, 34—36. Which party should speak <lb/>
            first, is not a matter for great consideration, 37—39. How the <lb/>
            more intrinsic points in a cause are to be discovered is shown by a <lb/>
            subject for declamation in the schools, 40—64.</p>
          <p>1. LET division, then, as I signified above,. be the distribution <lb/>
            of a number of things into its component parts ; partition, the <lb/>
            regular distribution of parts into their members, and a just <lb/>
            disposition connecting those that follow with those that pre­ <lb/>
            cede ; and arrangement a due distribution of things and their <lb/>
            parts in their proper places. 2 But let us remember that <note type="footnote"> * V. 10, 63. </note> <pb n="3"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I.]"/>arrangement is often altered to suit the interest of a cause, <lb/>
            and that the same question is not always discussed first by <lb/>
            both parties ; a point of which, to omit other examples, <lb/>
            Demosthenes and Æschines may afford us an instance, who, <lb/>
            in the trial concerning Ctesiphon, adopt a very different order <lb/>
            as the accuser commences with the question of law, on <unclear>which</unclear> <lb/>
            he thought himself the stronger, while the defendant introduces <lb/>
            all other particulars, or almost all, before touching on the <lb/>
            question of law, in order to prepare the judges for <unclear>considering</unclear> <lb/>
            the point of legality at the conclusion. 3. For it may be to <lb/>
            the interest of one side to state one point first, and of the <lb/>
            other to state another; else the pleading would always be con­ <lb/>
            ducted at the pleasure of the prosecutor; and, in a case of <lb/>
            mutual accusation, when each party defends himself before he <lb/>
            accuses his adversary, the order of everything on either side <lb/>
            must be different.. I shall therefore set forth the method <lb/>
            which I myself have followed, and which I have adopted <lb/>
            partly from the rules of others, and partly from my own <lb/>
            reasoning; nor have I ever made any mystery of it.</p>
          <p>4. It was my great care, in forensic pleadings, to ascertain, <lb/>
            in the first place, all the points that were concerned in any <lb/>
            cause t as in the schools there are certain particulars, and <lb/>
            but few, that are laid down previous to the declamation; the <lb/>
            Greeks call them <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέματα</foreign>,‡ Cicero § proposita. When I had <lb/>
            placed these, as it were, full in my view, I contemplated the <lb/>
            cause not less with reference to the opposite side than to my <lb/>
            own.</p>
          <p>5. First, then, (what is not difficult to be ascertained, but <lb/>
            is above all to be regarded,) I settled what each party wished <lb/>
            to establish, and then by what means, in the following way. <lb/>
            I considered what the prosecutor would state first; this would <lb/>
            either be an admitted, or a contested point. If it were admitted, <lb/>
            the question could not lie in it. 6. I passed therefore to the <lb/>
            answer of the defendant, and considered it in the same way. <lb/>
            Sometimes, too, what was elicited from thence was admitted. <note type="footnote"> * In amicategoria, that is, recrimination and mutual accusation, the <lb/>
            arrangement on each side is different; for instance, if you accuse me <lb/>
            of homicide, and I accuse you of sacrilege, I should speak first of <lb/>
            homicide, in order to clear myself, while you would speak first of <lb/>
            sacrilege. Turnebus. See iii. 10, 4. </note><note type="footnote"> t Comp. vi. 4, 8; iv. 2, 28. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ IV. 2, 28. </note><note type="footnote">§ Topic, c. 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="4"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            But as soon as there began to be any disagreement, the <lb/>
            question arose. The process was of this nature: You killed <lb/>
            a man ; I did kill him ; the fact is admitted; I pass on. <lb/>
            7. The defendant ought to give a reason why he killed hint <lb/>
            It is lawful, he may say, to kill an adulterer with an adulteress, <lb/>
            It is admitted that there is such a law. We may then pro <lb/>
            ceed to a third point, about which there may be a dispute. <lb/>
            They were not guilty of adultery; they were. Hence arises <lb/>
            the question. It is a controversy about fact, a matter of con <lb/>
            jecture. 8. Sometimes, however, a third point is admitted, <lb/>
            that they were guilty of adultery. But, the accuser may say, <lb/>
            it was not lawful for you to kill them; for you were an exile, or <lb/>
            infamous, There is, then, a question about law. But if, <lb/>
            when the prosecutor says at first, You have killed, the de­ <lb/>
            fendant reply, I have not killed, the dispute commences at <lb/>
            once. It is thus that we must ascertain when the controversy <lb/>
            begins ; and we must consider what forms the first question.*</p>
          <p>9. The accusation may be simple: Rabirius killed Satur­ <lb/>
            ninus ;† or complex: Lucius Varenus has incurred the penalty <lb/>
            of the law respecting assassins ; for he is guilty of killing Caius <lb/>
            Varenus, of wounding Cneius, and also of killing Salarius ;‡ <lb/>
            since there will thus be three distinct propositions. The same <lb/>
            may be said of civil suits.§ But out of a complex accusation <lb/>
            may arise several questions and states,|| if the accused denies <lb/>
            one point, justifies another, and endeavours to set aside another <lb/>
            by taking exception ¶ at the form of process. In this case the <lb/>
            accuser must consider carefully what he ought to refute, and <lb/>
            in what parts of his speech.</p>
          <p>10. As to what concerns the accuser, I do not altogether <lb/>
            dissent from Celsus, who, doubtless following Cicero, persists <lb/>
            in maintaining somewhat too positively, on this head, that strong <lb/>
            arguments should be advanced in the first place, the strongest <note type="footnote"> * Considerari debet, quœ primam quœstionem facit.] These words are <lb/>

            of all in the last, and the weaker in the middle ; because the <lb/>
            judge requires to be moved at the beginning, and pressed <lb/>
            forcibly at the end. 11. But on the side of the accused, the <lb/>
            strongest argument against him must first be attacked, lest <lb/>
            the judge, looking to that point, should regard with too little <lb/>
            favour our establishment of other points. Yet this order may <lb/>
            occasionally be changed, if the lighter points be evidently <lb/>
            false, and the refutation of the heaviest charge extremely <lb/>
            difficult; so that, after thus detracting from the credit of the <lb/>
            accusers, we may proceed to the last point, when the judge is <lb/>
            ready to suppose that all the charges may be false. It will be <lb/>
            necessary, however, to make some preliminary remarks, in <lb/>
            which a reason may be given for putting off the consideration <lb/>
            of the principal charge, and a refutation of it may be promised, <lb/>
            in order that we may not seem to fear that which we do not at <lb/>
            once verthrow. 12. Attacks on the past life of the accused <lb/>
            must generally be refuted first, that the judge may be inclined <lb/>
            to hear with favour the question on which he is to give a de­ <lb/>
            cision. But Cicero, in his speech for Varenus, has delayed <lb/>
            the consideration of such charges to the conclusion, regarding, <lb/>
            not what is expedient generally, but what was expedient on <lb/>
            that occasion.</p>
          <p>13. When the accusation is simple, we must consider <lb/>
            whether we will give our answer in one proposition or in <lb/>
            several. If in one, whether we build our case on fact, or on <lb/>
            written law.* If on fact, whether what is charged against us <lb/>
            is to be denied or justified. If on written law, on what point <lb/>
            of law the question stands, and whether it regards the letter <lb/>
            or the intention. 14. This we shall discover, if we ascertain <lb/>
            what law it is that gives rise to the suit, that is, on what the <lb/>
            point for decision rests. In the exercises of the schools, <lb/>
            some laws† are laid down merely to connect a series of cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances in a case: thus, Let a father,‡ who recognizes a <lb/>
            son that he has exposed, take him back on paying for his sub­ <note type="footnote"> * Quintilian here looks to the primary division of general states, <lb/>
            according to which some are de re, and are called status rationales; <lb/>
            others de scripto, and are called legales. Capperonier. See b. iii. c. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t Quædam.] We must understand leges, as is evident from the <lb/>

            Spalding. </note> <pb n="6"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/> <lb/>
            sistence; Let it be lawful for a father to disinherit a son who <lb/>
            is disobedient to his admonitions. A father who has taken <lb/>
            back a son that he had exposed, requires him to marry a rich <lb/>
            relation; the son, wishes to marry the daughter of the poor <lb/>
            person that brought him up. 15. The law regarding children <lb/>
            exposed is a subject for moving the feelings; * but the decision <lb/>
            depends on the law concerning disinheritance. Nor does the <lb/>
            question always rest on one law only, but sometimes on more <lb/>
            than one, as in a case of <foreign xml:lang="grc">άντινομία</foreign>, or contradictory laws.† This <lb/>
            matter being considered, it will be seen about what points the <lb/>
            question is.</p>
          <p>A complex defence is such as that in Cicero's speech for <lb/>
            Rabirius: If he had killed Satuminus, he would have acted <lb/>
            rightly; but he did not kill him. 16. But when we advance <lb/>
            many arguments against one proposition, we must consider, <lb/>
            in the first place, all the points that can be advanced, and <lb/>
            must then settle in what part of our speech it is expedient <lb/>
            that each should be stated. 17. In regard to this matter, I <lb/>
            do not hold the same opinion which I expressed a little above‡ <lb/>
            concerning propositions, and to which I assented in respect to <lb/>
            arguments, (in the place in which I treated of proofs,§) that <lb/>
            we may sometimes begin with the stronger; for, in refutation, <lb/>
            the force of our questions ought always to increase, and to <lb/>
            proceed from the weakest to the strongest, whether they be of <lb/>
            the same or a different kind. 18. But questions of law may <lb/>
            sometimes arise from one ground of dispute after another; <lb/>
            those of fact look always to one point; in both, however, the <lb/>
            order is the same. But let us speak first of such as are of <lb/>
            different kinds, the weakest of which ought to be discussed <lb/>
            first.</p>
          <p>Hence it is that, after considering some questions, we con­ <lb/>
            cede or grant them to the opposite party; for we cannot pass <lb/>
            to others unless by dismissing those that come first. 19. This <lb/>
            ought to be done in such a manner, that we may not appear <lb/>
            to have despaired of them, but to have set them aside, because <note type="footnote"> * The first of the two laws has no influence in deciding the case; <lb/>
            it merely affords a subject for either party to excite the feelings ; for <lb/>
            the father will say that he took back his exposed son ; the son will say <lb/>
            that while he was exposed he was brought up by the poor man; and <lb/>
            thus each party will have an affecting topic for eloquence. Turnebus. </note> <note type="footnote"> † III. 6, and viii 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Sect 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> § V. 12, 14. </note> <pb n="7"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I]."/><lb/>
            we can establish our cause without them. An agent demands <lb/>
            money from a person for interest on an inheritance: a ques­ <lb/>
            tion may arise whether he who is acting as agent has a right to <lb/>
            be an agent.* SO. Suppose that we, after we have discussed <lb/>
            this question, give it up, or are defeated upon it, the next <lb/>
            question may be, whether he in whose name the action is <lb/>
            brought, has a right to have an agent. Suppose that we give <lb/>
            way† on this point also, the cause may admit of the question <lb/>
            whether he, in whose name the suit is instituted, is heir to the <lb/>
            person to whom the interest is due, and sole heir. 21. If these <lb/>
            points also be granted, it may be asked whether the money is <lb/>
            really due. On the other hand, nobody would be so foolish as <lb/>
            to yield what he considered his strongest point, and pass on to <lb/>
            others of minor importance. Similar to the preceding case is <lb/>
            one that is given in the schools: You must not disinherit an <lb/>
            adopted son ; though you may disinherit this adopted son, you <lb/>
            must not disinherit one who has deserved well of his country; <lb/>
            though you may disinherit one who has deserved well of his <lb/>
            country, you may not disinherit whatever deserving son has not <lb/>
            obeyed your will; though he may have been bound to obey <lb/>
            your will in all other things, you may not disinherit him for not <lb/>
            having obeyed it in regard to an option,‡ or, if you may dis­ <lb/>
            inherit him for an option, not for such an option as this. Such <lb/>
            is the dissimilarity in questions of law. 22. But in matters <lb/>
            of fact there may be several questions all tending to the same <lb/>
            object: as if, for instance, a person who is on trial for theft, <lb/>
            should say to the accuser, Prove that you had the property; <lb/>
            prove that you lost it; prove that you lost it by theft; prove <lb/>
            that you lost it by my theft. The first three points may be <lb/>
            conceded; the last cannot.</p>
          <p>23. I used also very frequently§ to adopt this method. I <lb/>
            went back from the last species (for it is that which commonly <lb/>
            contains the point for decision) to the first general question, <lb/>
            or descended from the genus to the last species ;|| and that <lb/>
            even in deliberative causes. 24. Suppose, for example, that <lb/>
            Numa deliberates whether he shall accept kingly power when <note type="footnote"> * IV. 4, 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> t III. 6, 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ See v. 10, 97. </note> <note type="footnote"> § Præcipuè.] I cannot satisfy myself as to the force of this adverb. <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            the Romans offer it. First arises the general question, <lb/>
            Whether he ought to reign at all; then follow the particular <lb/>
            questions, Whether he ought to reign in a country not his own; <lb/>
            whether at Rome; whether the Romans will tolerate such a king <lb/>
            as himself. The case is similar in matters of controversy : <lb/>
            Suppose a man who has deserved well of his country makes <lb/>
            choice of another man's wife : the last special question is, <lb/>
            Whether a man can make choice of another's wife: The general <lb/>
            question is, Whether he who has deserved well of his country <lb/>
            ought to receive whatever he makes the object of his choice ;* <lb/>
            then follow the inquiries, whether he can choose from the pro­ <lb/>
            petty of a private person ; whether he can demand a woman in <lb/>
            marriage; whether he can demand one who has a husband. <lb/>
            25. But these questions are not set forth in our speech in the <lb/>
            same order in which they occur to us;† for that in general <lb/>
            occurs first which is to be expressed last, as thus, You ought <lb/>
            not to make choice of another mans wife. Hence haste spoils <lb/>
            division. We should not, therefore, content ourselves with <lb/>
            what offers ; but should inquire something further, as, whether <lb/>
            he may not even make choice of a widow; something further <lb/>
            still, as, whether he may not choose anything belonging to a <lb/>
            private person; or last of all, going back to what is next to the <lb/>
            general question, whether he may not make choice of anything <lb/>
            unlawful. 26. Examining the proposition of our adversary, <lb/>
            therefore, as is very easy, let us decide, if possible, what it is <lb/>
            natural should be answered first; and this, if we but contem­ <lb/>
            plate the cause as being actually pleaded, and the necessity <lb/>
            laid upon us of replying at once, will readily occur to us.</p>
          <p>27. But if it should not occur, let us set aside that which <lb/>
            occurs to us first, and reason with ourselves thus: What, if it <lb/>
            were otherwise ? questioning ourselves a second and a third <lb/>
            time, until nothing remain for consideration. Thus we shall <lb/>
            examine even the minutest points, which, if well treated, will <lb/>
            make the judge more inclined to listen to us on the main <note type="footnote"> * V. 10, 97 ; vii. 10, 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t In our speech questions are not disposed in the same order in <lb/>
            which they occur to us in meditation and investigation; for what <lb/>

            but it is to be placed last, other questions being put before it. Turne­ <lb/>

            point. 28. With this process the rule that " we should <lb/>
            descend from what is common to what is particular," is not <lb/>
            much at variance; for what is common is mostly general. <lb/>
            Some person has killed a tyrant, is a common or general pro­ <lb/>
            position ; a certain person has killed a tyrant,. a woman has <lb/>
            killed him, his wife has killed him,† are particular propositions.</p>
          <p>29. I used also to select those points in which I agreed <lb/>
            with my opponent, provided they were to my purpose, and not <lb/>
            only to press such matters as he admitted, but to multiply <lb/>
            them by division; as in this case: ‡ “A general, who, in a <lb/>
            competition for public honours, had come off superior to his <lb/>
            father, was taken prisoner by the enemy; certain deputies, <lb/>
            going to ransom him, met the father on the road as he was <lb/>
            returning from the enemy's camp, who said to them, ‘ You <lb/>
            are going too late.' 30. The deputies searched the father, and <lb/>
            found a sum of money in gold concealed in the breast of his <lb/>
            robe; they then proceeded to their place of destination, and <lb/>
            found the general fixed to a cross, who uttered the words, <lb/>
            ‘Beware of the traitor.' The father was accused." What is <lb/>
            admitted on both sides ? That treason was signified, and <lb/>
            signified by the general. We try to find the traitor. You <lb/>
            admit that you went to the enemy, and went secretly; that you <lb/>
            returned in safety, brought away gold, and had the gold con­ <lb/>
            cealed.</p>
          <p>31. What the accused has done, is sometimes set forth <lb/>
            very forcibly in the statement of the case, and, if it takes pos­ <lb/>
            session of the mind of the judge, his ears are almost closed <lb/>
            against the defence. In general, it is to the advantage of <lb/>
            the accuser to amass facts, and of the defendant to separate <lb/>
            them. I used also to do, with regard to the whole subject of <lb/>
            a cause, that which I noticed§ as being done in regard to <lb/>
            arguments; that is to say, stating all the particulars that could <lb/>
            possibly be urged against me, and overthrowing them one <lb/>
            after another, I left nothing remaining but that which I <lb/>
            wished to be believed. 32. Thus, in charges of prevarication,|| <note type="footnote"> * Virum tamen tyrannum occidit.] There seems to be some unsound­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            it may be argued, The accused could have been acquitted only <lb/>
            by the establishment of his innocence, or by the intervention of <lb/>
            some authority, or by force or bribes having been offered to the <lb/>
            judges, or through the difficulty of proof, or through prevarica­ <lb/>
            tion : That he was guilty you admit; no authority inte posed ; <lb/>
            there was no force offered; tou do not complain that the judges <lb/>
            were bribed; there was no difficulty in the way of proof; and <lb/>
            what remains, then, but that there must have been prevari­ <lb/>
            cation ? 33. If I could not set aside all the points against <lb/>
            me, I at least set aside the greater number. For instance, It <lb/>
            is acknowledged that a man was killed ; not in a solitary place, <lb/>
            to lead me to suspect that he was killed by robbers; not for the <lb/>
            sake of booty, for he was not rifled ; not in the hope of inherit­ <lb/>
            ing anything, for he was poor; Malice must then have been the <lb/>
            cause: But who was his enemy? 34. This method, of <lb/>
            examining everything that can be said, and of rejecting as it <lb/>
            were one particular after another, in order to arrive at the <lb/>
            strongest point, not only facilitates the art of division, but also <lb/>
            that of invention. Thus, Milo is accused of killing Clodius: <lb/>
            He either killed him or did not kill him: It would be safest <lb/>
            to deny that he killed him, but if that cannot be done, it must <lb/>
            be allowed that he killed him either justly or unjustly; and we <lb/>
            must doubtless say justly: He killed him then either intention­ <lb/>
            ally or through necessity; for ignorance cannot be pretended : <lb/>
            35. Whether there was intention, is doubtful, but, as people <lb/>
            think that there was, we must attempt some defence of it, and <lb/>
            say that the intention was to serve his country. Or shall we <lb/>
            say that he killed him through necessity ? The encounter with <lb/>
            him was then accidental, and not premeditated; one of them <lb/>
            therefore was lying in wait: Which of the two ? Assuredly <lb/>
            Clodius. Do you see how the necessary chain of circum­ <lb/>
            stances leads us to the ground of defence? 36. Let us <lb/>
            consider further : He certainly either wished to kill the lier-in- <lb/>
            wait Clodius, or he did not; it is safer if we can say that he <lb/>
            did not: Then the attendants of Milo must have done the <lb/>
            deed, without orders from Milo, and without his knowledge. <lb/>
            But this timid mode of defence detracts from the credit of <note type="footnote"> and proofs, and put forward such as are groundless, acting in collusion <lb/>
            with the accused person. We call those prevaricators, says Ulpian, <lb/>
            tvho betray the cause, which they profess to support, to their adver. <lb/>
            saries. Capperonier. </note> <pb n="11"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I]."/><lb/>
            oar assertion, that Clodius was justly killed. 37. We must <lb/>
            therefore add, The attendants acted in such a way as each of <lb/>
            us would wish his own attendants to act. This kind of prac­ <lb/>
            tice is the more useful, as it often happens that nothing that <lb/>
            presents itself pleases us, and yet something must be said. <lb/>
            We should accordingly contemplate the cause under every <lb/>
            aspect; and thus either that which is best will be discovered, <lb/>
            or that which is least bad. Occasionally we may turn to <lb/>
            advantage the statement of our adversary; for that it is <lb/>
            sometimes equally to the purpose of both parties, has been <lb/>
            observed in the proper place.-</p>
          <p>I know that it is discussed in some authors, in many thou­ <lb/>
            sands of lines, how we may discover which party ought to <lb/>
            speak first; but this is decided in the forum either by the <lb/>
            rigour of formulæ, or by the nature of the process, or, finally, <lb/>
            by lot. 38. In the schools such inquiries are of no importance, <lb/>
            since it is allowable to make a charge and to refute it, in the <lb/>
            same declamation, as well on the side of the prosecutor as on <lb/>
            that of the defendants But in most suits it cannot even be <lb/>
            determined which party has a right to precedence; as in the <lb/>
            case, A father, who had three sons, one an orator, another a <lb/>
            philosopher, and a third a physician, divided his property by <lb/>
            his will into four parts, and gave one part to each of the three, <lb/>
            . directing that the fourth part should go to him who should be <lb/>
            of most service to his country. 39. They go to law; who ought <lb/>
            to speak first, is uncertain ; though the statement of the case <lb/>
            is clear; for we must begin with him whose part we take. <lb/>
            Such are the directions that may be given about division in <lb/>
            general.</p>
          <p>40. But how shall we find out questions that are more <lb/>
            obscure ? Just as we discover thoughts, words, figures, style; <lb/>
            namely, by the exercise of our ability, and by care and prac­ <lb/>
            tice. Scarcely anything, however, will escape a speaker, unless <lb/>
            he be inattentive, if he will, as I remarked,† but take nature <lb/>
            for his guide. 41. But many orators, affecting a character for <lb/>
            eloquence, are content with arguments that are merely showy, <lb/>
            or that contribute nothing to the establishment of their case. <note type="footnote"> * IV. 4, 8. </note><note type="footnote"> t A possessore.] Possessor is here used, in a strange and surprising <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            Others think that they let nothing escape them, while they <lb/>
            merely contemplate what presents itself to their own eyes. <lb/>
            That what I say may be the better understood, I will give a <lb/>
            case from the schools, one not very difficult or new, as an <lb/>
            example: 42. Let the son who neglects to plead for his father <lb/>
            on a trial for treason, be disinherited. Let the man who is <lb/>
            found guilty of treason, be banished with the advocate who <lb/>
            pleads for him. A father was accused of treason ; one of his <lb/>
            sons, who was a man of eloquence, appeared as advocate for <lb/>
            his father; the other, an illiterate man, did not appear at all ; <lb/>
            the father was found guilty, and went with the son who pleaded <lb/>
            for him into exile. The illiterate son, after distinguishing him­ <lb/>
            self by his bravery, obtained of his country, as a reward,* the <lb/>
            recall of his father and his brother. The father returned and <lb/>
            died intestate; the illiterate son sues for a portion of his pro­ <lb/>
            perty; the eloquent son claims the whole of it. 43. In this case <lb/>
            those men of eloquence, to whom we appear ridiculous, as <lb/>
            being anxious about causes that rarely occur,! will seize upon <lb/>
            the favourable characters. Their pleading will be for the <lb/>
            illiterate against the eloquent son; for the brave against the <lb/>
            unwarlike; for the benefactor against the ungrateful; for him <lb/>
            who desires only a part of his fathers property, against him who <lb/>
            would allow no portion of it to his brother. 44. All these are <lb/>
            points in the cause, and a great support to it, but they do not <lb/>
            secure victory. In such a cause, the thoughts sought by such <lb/>
            orators will be, if possible, daring or obscure, (for obscurity is <lb/>
            now a virtue,) and they will think that they come off well in <lb/>
            the matter if they distinguish themselves with sufficient <lb/>
            clamour and noise. Those, again, whose object is better, but <lb/>
            whose regard is confined to that which readily presents itself, <lb/>
            will see the following points as it were swimming on the <lb/>
            surface: 45. That the illiterate son was excusable for not <lb/>
            appearing at the trial, as he could have been of no assistance <lb/>
            to his father; that the eloquent son has little ground for blaming <lb/>
            the other for his absence, as the father was found guilty; that <lb/>
            he who procured hisfathers recall deserves to inherit his fathers <lb/>
            property: and that the other son is of a covetous, unnatural, <note type="footnote"> * See v. 10, 97. </note><note type="footnote"> † Circa lites raras.] Such as the imaginary cases of the schools, as <lb/>
            Gesner and Spalding understand the words. Obrecht conjectured <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I]."/><lb/>
            and ungrateful disposition, as he refuses to share the inheritance <lb/>
            with a brother to whom he owes so much; they will see also <lb/>
            that a question may be raised as to the letter and intent of the <lb/>
            Jaw, and that, unless this question be settled, there can be <lb/>
            no room for anything else to follow. 46. But he who shall <lb/>
            follow nature, will doubtless reflect thus: that the illiterate <lb/>
            son will say, in the first place, My father, dying intestate, left <lb/>
            two sons, my brother and myself; and I claim part of his <lb/>
            property by the common law of nations. Who indeed is so <lb/>
            thoroughly foolish and ignorant, that he would not commence <lb/>
            thus, even though he knows not what a proposition is ? 47. This <lb/>
            common law of nations the pleader will moderately commend, . <lb/>
            as being extremely just. It then follows, that we consider <lb/>
            what can be replied to so equitable a claim. A reply presents <lb/>
            itself at once: The law directs that a SO'It. who does not defend <lb/>
            his father when accused of treason is to be disinherited; and <lb/>
            you did not defend your father. On this proposition will <lb/>
            naturally follow some praise of the Jaw, and some censure of <lb/>
            the son for not defending his parent. 48. Hitherto we have <lb/>
            had to do only with what is admitted. Let us again turn our <lb/>
            attention to the claimant: will he not, unless he be utterly <lb/>
            senseless, plead thus ? If the law stands in the way, there is <lb/>
            no ground for an action; the trial is a mere form. But that <lb/>
            there is a law in the way, and that it punishes that of which <lb/>
            the illiterate son was guilty, is undoubted. What then shall <lb/>
            we say on his behalf? I was illiterate. 49. But the law was <lb/>
            in force; it comprehends all men ; it will be of no use to <lb/>
            allege want of education. Let us inquire, then, whether the <lb/>
            law can be invalidated in any point. What does nature <lb/>
            suggest, (for to nature I must frequently appeal,) but that <lb/>
            when the letter of a law is against us, we must look to the <lb/>
            intention of it ? The general question then arises, Whether <lb/>
            we ought to rest on the letter, or on the intention, of any law ? <lb/>
            But concerning law in general we may dispute for ever; nor <lb/>
            has this point ever been fully decided. We must inquire, <lb/>
            therefore, whether in this particular law, about which we are <lb/>
            concerned, anything can be found that is at variance with the <lb/>
            letter of it. 50. The law says, then, Whatever son has not <lb/>
            defended his father, shall be disinherited. What? Whatever <lb/>
            son, without exception ? Considerations such as these will <lb/>
            then present themselves of their own accord: Suppose thai <lb/>
            <pb n="14"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            a son who was but an infant, or one who was sick, or one who <lb/>
            was out of the country, or in the army, or on an embassy, did <lb/>
            not defend his father, would he be disinherited ? Something <lb/>
            considerable has now been gained ; a son may not have <lb/>
            defended his father, and yet not be disinherited.</p>
          <p>61. Let him, however, who has so far meditated on the case, <lb/>
            “pass over," as Cicero says, " after the manner of a Latin <lb/>
            flute-player,”* to the side of the eloquent son. He will say, <lb/>
            Though I allow the reasonableness of such exceptions, Tou were <lb/>
            not an infant, or out of the country, or serving in the army <lb/>
            Will anything else occur to the other son, but to say, I am <lb/>
            illiterate. 52. But the eloquent son will make the obvious reply, <lb/>
            Though you could not plead for your father, you might have <lb/>
            appeared at his side; and the remark is just. The illiterate <lb/>
            son must consequently recur to the intention of the lawgiver: <lb/>
            He intended, he will say, to punish unnatural conduct, but I <lb/>
            have not behaved unnaturally. 53. In reply to which the <lb/>
            eloquent son will say, You did act unnaturally, as you incurred <lb/>
            the penalty of being disinherited, though penitence or desire of <lb/>
            distinction has since gained you the privilege of this kind of <lb/>
            option.t Besides, it was through you that your father was <lb/>
            found guilty; for you seemed to have already decided on his <lb/>
            case. To this the illiterate son will reply, you rather were the <lb/>
            cause that he was found guilty; for you had offended many <lb/>
            people, and excited enmity against our family; conjectural <lb/>
            allegations, as will also be that which the illiterate son may <lb/>
            say in the way of excuse for his absence, that it was the object <lb/>
            of his father not to expose his whole family to danger. Such <lb/>
            are the considerations that come under the first question as to <lb/>
            the letter and intent of the law.</p>
          <p>54. Let us direct our attention further, and examine whether <lb/>
            anything more may be found out, and, if so, how it may be <lb/>
            discovered. I purposely imitate the manner of one inquiring, <lb/>
            that I may teach the student how to inquire, and laying aside <lb/>
            all regard to ornaments of style, lower myself to promote the <lb/>
            advantage of my pupils. Hitherto we have drawn all our <note type="footnote"> * Cic. Pro Muræn. c. 12. The flute-player on the stage turned from <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I]."/>questions from the person of the claimant; why should we net <lb/>
            ask some questions regarding the father ? The words of the <lb/>
            law are, Whatever son has not defended his father, shall be dis­ <lb/>
            inherited.- 65. Why may we not ask this question, Whether <lb/>
            such is the case, whatever be the character of the father whom <lb/>
            he has not defended ? We ask such a question frequently in <lb/>
            those cases in which sons are prosecuted, as liable to the <lb/>
            penalty of imprisonment, who do not support their parents; <lb/>
            as the son that did not support his mother who had given <lb/>
            evidence against him when he was accused of not being a <lb/>
            Roman citizen ; and he that did not maintain his father who <lb/>
            had sold him to a dealer in slaves, But with regard to the <lb/>
            father of whom we are speaking, of what argument can we lay <lb/>
            hold? He was found guilty. 56. Does the law then relate <lb/>
            only to fathers who are acquitted ? A hard question at first <lb/>
            sight. But let us not despair. It is probable that the inten­ <lb/>
            tion of the legislator was, that the aid of children should not <lb/>
            be wanting to innocent fathers. But the illiterate son would <lb/>
            be ashamed to allege this intention, because he acknowledges <lb/>
            that his father was innocent.t 57. The law, however, Let him <lb/>
            who is found guilty go into exile with his advocate, furnishes <lb/>
            another argument in the cause. It seems scarcely possible <lb/>
            that a penalty should have been directed against a son, in <lb/>
            reference to the same father, whether the son appeared in his <lb/>
            defence, or did not appear. Besides, no law has any relation <lb/>
            to exiles.‡ It is not, therefore, probable that this law was <lb/>
            intended to refer to the advocate of the person condemned ; <lb/>
            for can any property be possessed by an exile ? The illiterate <lb/>
            son, whether he looks to the letter or to the intention of the <lb/>
            law,§ makes it doubtful whether he was called upon to defend <lb/>
            his father. 58. The eloquent son will both cling to the words <lb/>
            of the law, in which no exception is expressed, and will say <note type="footnote"> * Dictum non eat, Cui quis non affuerit.] Several manuscripts have <lb/>

            that it wasfrom this very consideration that the penalty of being <lb/>
            disinherited was denounced against sons who should not defend <lb/>
            their fathers, lest they should be deterred from defending them <lb/>
            by fear of banishment, and that the illiterate son did not <lb/>
            appear on behalf of an innocent father. It is well deserving <lb/>
            of remark that from one state- may spring two general ques­ <lb/>
            tions: Whether every son is obliged to defend his father? and <lb/>
            Whether every father has a right to expect defence from his <lb/>
            son? 59. All our questions hitherto have arisen from two <lb/>
            persons ; t as for the third, which is that of the adversary, no <lb/>
            question can arise about him, because there is no controversy <lb/>
            about bis share of the property.‡ Let our investigations, <lb/>
            however, be still pursued ; for all that has been said might <lb/>
            have been said even though the father had not been recalled <lb/>
            from exile. Nor let us fix immediately on the reflection which <lb/>
            readily presents itself, that his recall was procured by the illite­ <lb/>
            rate son. He that shall sagaciously consider that point, will <lb/>
            find his view directed to something further; for as species <lb/>
            follow genus, so genus precedes species. 60. Let us sup <lb/>
            pose, therefore, that his recall had been procured by another; <lb/>
            a question of ratiocination and syllogism|| will arise, Whether <lb/>
            the recall is equivalent to a repeal of the sentence, and places <lb/>
            the father in the same position as if judgment had not been <lb/>
            pronounced against him ? Here the illiterate son will proceed <lb/>
            to say that he could not have obtained the restitution of his <lb/>
            property, being entitled to one reward only,¶ by any other means <lb/>
            than by procuring the recall of his father on the same under. <lb/>
            standing as if he had never been accused; an understanding <lb/>
            which also annulled the penalty of the advocate, as completely as <lb/>
            if he had not appeared on behalf of his father. 61. We then <lb/>
            come to that which presented itself to us at first, that the <note type="footnote"> * III. 6, 1. </note><note type="footnote"> t The father and the illiterate son. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote">‡ De sud parte.] De parte quam ex paternâ hæreditate vult capere. <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I]."/>father's recall was procured by the illiterate son. Here we <lb/>
            again proceed to reason whether he who procured the recall <lb/>
            ought not to be regarded in the light of an advocate, as he effected <lb/>
            that which the advocate sought to effect; and that it is not <lb/>
            unfair that that should be received as equivalent which is more <lb/>
            than equivalent. 62. What remains is a question of equity: which <lb/>
            of the two makes the more rightful claim. This question, too, <lb/>
            admits of division: Even if each claimed the whole property, <lb/>
            —and, surely, when the one claims but half, and the other the <lb/>
            whole, to the exclusion of his brother.* But, even when <lb/>
            these points are discussed, the memory of the father will have <lb/>
            great influence with the judges, especially when the question <lb/>
            is about the disposal of his property. It will, therefore, be a <lb/>
            subject for conjecture, what intention the father had in leaving <lb/>
            no will at his death. But this relates to quality, which is <lb/>
            matter for another state.† 63. It is, however, at the conclusion <lb/>
            of causes that questions of equity are generally considered, <lb/>
            because there is nothing to which judges listen with greater‡ <lb/>
            readiness. Yet expediency will occasionally cause a change in <lb/>
            the order; for instance, if we have but little confidence that <lb/>
            the law will be in our favour, we may work on the minds of <lb/>
            the judges at the commencement by considerations of equity.</p>
          <p>On this head I have no further directions to give in general. <lb/>
            64. But let us now proceed to consider the several parts of <lb/>
            judicial causes ; and though I cannot pursue them to the last <lb/>
            species,§ that is, to every particular form of question and pro­ <lb/>
            cess, I may yet treat of them in a general way, so as to show <lb/>
            under which state each kind of cause commonly falls. And <lb/>

          <p>Conjecture relates to fact and intention, and to three divisions of time, <lb/>
            § 1—6. The question may regard the fact and the agent at the <lb/>
            same time, or the fact only, or the agent only, 7—10. Concerning <lb/>
            both together, 11—15. Concerning the fact only, 16, 17. Con. <lb/>
            corning the agent; anticategoria, 18—21. Comparison managed <lb/>
            in several ways, 22—24. Conjecture sometimes twofold, 25—27. <lb/>
            Proof from persons, 28—34. From motives and causes, 35—41. <lb/>
            Intentions, opportunities, place, time, 42, 43. Consideration <lb/>
            whether the accused had the power to do the act with which he is <lb/>
            charged, 44, 45. Whether he did it, 46—49. Other considers <lb/>
            tions in different causes, 50—53. Error carried from the schools <lb/>
            into the forum, 54—57.</p>
          <p>1. ALL conjecture has reference either to fact or intent. To <lb/>
            each belong three parts of time, the past, the present, and <lb/>
            the future. Concerning fact there are both general and par­ <lb/>
            ticular questions; that is, such as are not limited to the con­ <lb/>
            sideration of certain circumstances, and such as are so limited. <lb/>
            2. About intent there can be no question, unless where there <lb/>
            is a person concerned, and a fact is admitted. When the ques­ <lb/>
            tion, then, is about a fact, it is to be considered either what <lb/>
            has been done, or what is being done, or what is going to be <lb/>
            done. Thus, in general questions, we inquire whether the world <lb/>
            was formed by a fortuitous concourse of atoms; whether it is <lb/>
            ruled by a providence ; whether it will one day fall to pieces; <lb/>
            in particular questions, whether Roscius has committed parri­ <lb/>
            cide ;* whether Manlius is aspiring to sovereignty; whether <lb/>
            Cæcilius will justly prosecute Verres.† 3. In judicial plead­ <lb/>
            ings past time is most concerned ; for no man accuses another <lb/>
            but for something that has been done ; while what is actually <lb/>
            taking place, or is likely to take place, is inferred from the <lb/>
            past. It is a subject for inquiry, also, whence a thing has pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded, as, concerning a pestilence, whether it arose from the <lb/>
            anger of the gods, from the bad state of the atmosphere, or from <lb/>
            the corruption of the waters, or from noxious exhalations from <lb/>
            the ground. Concerning a fact, too, what was the cause of it: <lb/>
            as, why did fifty princes sail to Troy, whether from being bound <lb/>
            by an oath, or from being led by example, or from a desire to <lb/>
            oblige the sons of Atreus ? These two kinds of questions ‡ <note type="footnote"> * Cicero pro Rose. Amerino. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero Div. in Q. Cæcilium. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Whence a thing arose; and what was the cause of an act. Spalding. </note> <pb n="19"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II]."/>are not very different. 4. As to matters that concern the <lb/>
            present time, if they are not to be discovered by proofs, from <lb/>
            circumstances which must have preceded, but by the senses, they <lb/>
            have nothing to do with conjecture ; for example, if it should <lb/>
            he asked at Lacedæmon whether walls are in the course of <lb/>
            erection at Athens. But the state of conjecture, which may <lb/>
            seem foreign to this head, has also a place under it,. as when <lb/>
            it is inquired respecting any individual, who he is; as it was a <lb/>
            question, in the action against the heirs of Urbinia,† whether he <lb/>
            who laid claim to the property as a son was Figulus or Sosipater :* <lb/>
            5. The person of the man was under the eye of the court, so <lb/>
            that it could not be inquired whether he was, (as we inquire <lb/>
            whether anything is beyond the ocean,)‡ nor what he was, nor <lb/>
            of what nature, but who he was. This kind of question, how­ <lb/>
            ever, depends for decision on the past, as whether this <lb/>
            Clusinius Figulus was born of Urbinia. Such causes have <lb/>
            been tried in my time, and some of them have come under <lb/>
            my advocacy. 6. Conjecture with regard to intent has <lb/>
            reference doubtless to all the parts of time, as with what <lb/>
            intent was Ligarius in Africa ? With what intent does Pyrrhus <lb/>
            solicit peace ? How will Cæsar feel, if Ptolemy kills Pompey ?§</p>
          <p>Questions of conjecture and quality are made with regard <lb/>
            to magnitude, species, and number, as, whether the sun is <lb/>
            greater than the earth; whether the moon is spherical, plane, <lb/>
            or conical; whether there is only one world or several. 7. Nor <lb/>
            are such questions confined to physical subjects; for we in­ <lb/>
            quire, whether the Trojan or Peloponnesian war was the greater; <lb/>
            what sort of shield was that of Achilles ; whether there was but <lb/>
            one Hercules.</p>
          <p>But in judicial causes, which consist of accusation and <lb/>
            defence, there is one kind of question, that of conjecture, in <lb/>
            which the inquiry is about an act, and the author of it <lb/>
            This sometimes embraces the two questions in one, and both <lb/>
            are alike denied; sometimes considers them separately, as <lb/>
            when it is first inquired, whether the act was committed or not, <lb/>
            and, if it was, by whom it was committed. 8. The consideration <lb/>
            of the act itself, also, sometimes embraces a single question, <note type="footnote"> * Though some might be disposed to refer such questions rather to <lb/>
            the state of quality. Spalding. </note> <note type="footnote"> It IV. 1. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ III. 8, 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> § III. 8, 56. </note> <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <pb n="20"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/>as whether a man died, sometimes two, as whether he died of <lb/>
            poison or disease of the stomach. There is another kind of <lb/>
            conjectural question which regards the act only, when, if the <lb/>
            act be admitted, there can be no doubt as to the author of it; <lb/>
            and a third, which has reference only to the author when the <lb/>
            act is acknowledged, but it is disputed by whom it was com­ <lb/>
            mitted. 9. But that which I have specified in the third place, <lb/>
            is not always confined to one question, for the accused person <lb/>
            may either simply deny that he himself committed the act, <lb/>
            or may assert that another committed it; nor is there one <lb/>
            mode only of throwing the charge upon another person, for <lb/>
            sometimes there arises mutual accusation * which the Greeks <lb/>
            call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιϰατηγοϩία</foreign>, and some of our writers accusatio con­ <lb/>
            certativa; sometimes the guilt is thrown upon some person not <lb/>
            implicated in the cause, which person is sometimes known and <lb/>
            sometimes unknown ; and when it is thrown upon one that is <lb/>
            known, it may be imputed to one out of the question, or to <lb/>
            the deceased, as having killed himself intentionally. 10. In <lb/>
            these cases there is a comparison of persons, motives, and <lb/>
            other things, similar to that which there is in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιϰατηγοϩία</foreign>: <lb/>
            as Cicero, for example, in pleading for Varenus, throws a sus­ <lb/>
            picion of guilt on the slaves of Ancharius; and, in speaking for <lb/>
            Scaurus, with reference to the death of Bostar, turns the <lb/>
            imputation of it on Bostar's mother. 11. There is also a kind <lb/>
            of comparison contrary to this, in which each party claims <lb/>
            the credit of some act, and another in which persons are not <lb/>
            opposed, but only facts, that is, when it is inquired, not which <lb/>
            of two persons did a thing, but which of two things was done. <lb/>
            When the question is settled about the act and the agent, we <lb/>
            may then inquire about the intention.</p>
          <p>I now proceed to speak of particulars. When a charge is <lb/>
            denied, both as to the act and the agent, it is denied in this <lb/>
            way: I have not committed adultery; I have not aspired to <lb/>
            regal power. On trials for murder and poisoning, such a dis­ <lb/>
            tinction as the following is very common: The deed has not <lb/>
            been committed, or, if it has been, I am not guilty of it. IS. <lb/>
            But when the accused says, Prove that the man was murdered, <lb/>
            the weight of the argument falls wholly on the accuser, for <lb/>
            nothing else will he said against him on the part of the accused, <note type="footnote"> * C. 1. sect 3. </note> <pb n="21"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II]."/>except perhaps some suspicions, which he ought to throw out <lb/>
            as vaguely as possible; because, if we fairly assert a point, we <lb/>
            must make it good, or be in danger of being found guilty ; for <lb/>
            as, while the question lies between what is advanced by our <lb/>
            opponent and what is advanced by ourselves, the statement of <lb/>
            either party may be presumed to be true, so, when the point on <lb/>
            which we take our stand is overthrown, we may be hard pressed <lb/>
            on all the remaining points. 13. But when a cause turns on the <lb/>
            ambiguous symptoms of disease of the stomach or poisoning, <lb/>
            there is no third point, and, therefore, each side must hold to <lb/>
            what it has alleged. Sometimes the question is about the <lb/>
            nature of the thing itself, whether it was poisoning or disease <lb/>
            of the stomach, when arguments are drawn from circumstances, <lb/>
            independently of any consideration of the person. 14. For <lb/>
            it is of importance to inquire, whether a banquet preceded the <lb/>
            death, or any serious transaction; whether toil or ease, wake­ <lb/>
            fulness or sleep. The age of the deceased, too, may have some <lb/>
            influence on the decision; and it is of consequence to know <lb/>
            whether he died suddenly, or was wasted with long illness. If <lb/>
            it be sudden death only that calls for consideration, there will <lb/>
            be a still wider field for discussion for both parties. 15. <lb/>
            Sometimes proof respecting an act is sought from the cha­ <lb/>
            racter of the accused party; as, it is credible that poisoning was <lb/>
            the cause of death, because it is credible that poisoning was com­ <lb/>
            mitted by the accused; or, it is incredible that the accused was <lb/>
            guilty of poisoning, therefore it is incredible that poisoning was <lb/>
            the cause of death.</p>
          <p>But when there is a question at the same time regarding <lb/>
            the person accused, and the deed of which he is accused, the <lb/>
            natural order of things is for the accuser to prove first of all <lb/>
            that the deed was committed, and then that it was committed <lb/>
            by the accused. If, however, he find more proofs bearing on <lb/>
            the person, he may change that order. 16. The accused, on the <lb/>
            other hand, will make it his first object to deny that the deed <lb/>
            was committed; because, if he succeeds in establishing that <lb/>
            point, he has no need to say anything further ; while, if he is <lb/>
            defeated on it, there may remain some other means for him to <lb/>
            establish his innocence. In cases, also, where there is a <lb/>
            dispute about fact only, and where, if the fact is proved, there <lb/>
            can be no doubt as to the agent, arguments are in like manner <lb/>
            drawn from persons and from circumstances, though with <pb n="22"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/>regard to the question of fact simply. 17. This is the case <lb/>
            (for I must adduce such examples as are most familiar to <lb/>
            learners) in the following subject of controversy : A son, who <lb/>
            had been disinherited by his father, devoted himself to the <lb/>
            study of medicine. His father falling sick, and every other <lb/>
            physician despairing of saving his life, the son, being consulted, <lb/>
            said that he would cure him, if he would take a draught which <lb/>
            he would give him. The father, after drinking part of the <lb/>
            draught that he had received, said that poison had been given <lb/>
            him; the son drank what was left; the father died; the son was <lb/>
            accused of parricide. J 8. Here it is known who gave the <lb/>
            draught; and, if it was poison, there can be no doubt as to the <lb/>
            author of the poisoning; but whether it was poison must be <lb/>
            decided by arguments arising from the character of the <lb/>
            accused.</p>
          <p>There remains a third kind of conjectural causes, in which <lb/>
            it is admitted that a deed has been done, but there is a ques­ <lb/>
            tion about the author of it. Of such cases it is superfluous to <lb/>
            give an example, since abundance of trials on such points <lb/>
            occur ; as when it is acknowledged that a man has been killed, <lb/>
            or that sacrilege has been committed, but the person who is <lb/>
            accused of the deed denies that he is guilty of it.</p>
          <p>Hence arises <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιϰατηγοϩία</foreign>, or recrimination ; it being <lb/>
            admitted that a deed has been done, while each party charges <lb/>
            the other with the commission of it. 19. As to this kind of <lb/>
            cause, Celsus tells us that it cannot occur in the forum; a fact <lb/>
            of which I suppose that nobody is ignorant. The judges are <lb/>
            assembled to decide the case of one accused person; and if <lb/>
            the accused and the accuser bring charges against each other, <lb/>
            the judges must choose which of the two cases they will try.* <lb/>
            SO. Apollodorus also says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιϰατηγοϩία</foreign> includes two <lb/>
            causes; and doubtless, according to the practice of the forum, <lb/>
            there are two distinct cases. Yet this kind of conjectural <lb/>
            cause may come under the cognizance of the senate or the <lb/>
            emperor. But even on ordinary trials it requires no difference <lb/>
            in the pleadings ;f for the decision that is given affects both <note type="footnote"> * The judges must give the preference to one of those, who come <lb/>

            this kind of cause defence must always have the precedence ; <lb/>
            first, because to protect ourselves is of more importance to us <lb/>
            than to injure our adversary; secondly, because we shall have <lb/>
            greater weight in accusing, if our own innocence be first estab­ <lb/>
            lished ; and, lastly, because it is only by this order of things <lb/>
            that the cause can become double; for he who says, I did not <lb/>
            kill, leaves it free for himself to add you killed, but he who <lb/>
            first says, you killed, renders it superfluous to say afterwards, <lb/>
            I did not kill.</p>
          <p>22. Such causes, moreover, depend on comparison, which is <lb/>
            managed in more than one way; for we either set the whole <lb/>
            of our cause against the whole cause of our adversary, or par­ <lb/>
            ticular arguments on our side against particular arguments on <lb/>
            his. Which of these two modes ought to be adopted in any <lb/>
            case, can only be decided by considering which is the more <lb/>
            likely to be of service to it. Thus Cicero, in pleading for <lb/>
            Varenus, compares, in regard to the first head of accusation, <lb/>
            argument with argument; for he has the advantage,! as the <lb/>
            person of a stranger is but rashly compared with that of a <lb/>
            mother. It is best, therefore, that particular arguments <lb/>
            should, if possible, be overthrown by particular arguments; <lb/>
            but if we find a difficulty as to certain parts, we must fight <lb/>
            with the whole force of our cause in a body. 23. But whether <lb/>
            the parties accuse one another; whether the accused turns the <lb/>
            guilt on the accuser without any formal accusation; (as Roscius <lb/>
            throws it on his accusers, though he does not bring them <lb/>
            before the judges;) or whether a deed be attributed to persons <lb/>
            whom we assert to have perished by their own hand,‡ the <lb/>
            arguments of the two parties are matched in the same way as <lb/>
            in causes which involve recrimination. 24. That species, <lb/>
            however, of which I spoke last,§ is often handled not only in <lb/>
            the schools, but also in the forum ; for, in the case of Nævius <lb/>
            of Arpinum,|| the question was merely whether his wife had <note type="footnote"> * When one gains his cause, the other loses; when one is con­ <lb/>
            demned, the other is acquitted. </note><note type="footnote"> t This I presume to be inexplicable, as the speech of Cicero for <lb/>

            own accord. My pleading in that cause is the only one that I <lb/>
            have hitherto published; and I acknowledge that I was <lb/>
            induced to publish it by a youthful desire for fame. As for <lb/>
            the other pleadings, which are circulated under my name, <lb/>
            they are so corrupted by the carelessness of the short-hand <lb/>
            writers who took them down to make profit of them, that they <lb/>
            contain very little genuine matter of mine.</p>
          <p>25. There is also another kind of conjectural cause, involving <lb/>
            two questions, differing from <foreign xml:lang="grc">άντιϰατηγοςία</foreign>, and relating to <lb/>
            rewards; as in the following case : A tyrant, suspecting that <lb/>
            poison had been given him by his physician, put him to the tor­ <lb/>
            ture. As he persisted in denying that he had given poison, the <lb/>
            tyrant sent for another physician, who said that poison had <lb/>
            been given him, but that he would administer an antidote; he <lb/>
            then gave the tyrant a draught, and the tyrant, immediately <lb/>
            after drinking it, died. The two physicians dispute about the <lb/>
            reward for tyrannicide ; and as, in a case of <foreign xml:lang="grc">άντιϰατηγοςία</foreign>, <lb/>
            where each party endeavours to throw the blame on the oppo­ <lb/>
            site, so in this case, where each party makes a claim, persons, <lb/>
            motives, means, opportunities, instruments, and evidence are <lb/>
            brought into comparison. 26. Another kind of case also, <lb/>
            though there is no recrimination in it, is treated in the same <lb/>
            manner as one of recrimination ; I mean that in which it is <lb/>
            inquired, without accusing any one, which of two things has <lb/>
            taken place; for each side makes its own statement, and <lb/>
            supports it; as, in the suit concerning the property of Urbinia,* <lb/>
            the claimant says that Clusinius Figulus, the son of Urbinia, <lb/>
            finding the army, in which he was serving, defeated, fled, and <lb/>
            after being thrown into various adventures, and even kept pri­ <lb/>
            soner by a king, made his way at length into Italy, and arrived <lb/>
            at his native place Margini,t where he was recognized: Pollio, <lb/>
            on the other hand, asserts that he was a slave to two masters at <lb/>
            Pisaurum; that he practised medicine ; and that, being set free, <lb/>
            he joined himself to another person's company of slaves, and <note type="footnote"> which Burmann erroneously supposed to be the same as that to which <lb/>

            Does not the whole action consist of a comparison of two <lb/>
            allegations, and two distinct questions for conjecture? But <lb/>
            the mode of proceeding for those who claim property or resist <lb/>
            claims to it, is the same as that for persons prosecuting and <lb/>
            defending in civil suits.</p>
          <p>Grounds for conjecture are drawn in tho first place from the <lb/>
            past, in which are comprehended persons, motives, intentions. <lb/>
            For the order in which we have to consider evidence as to any <lb/>
            act, is, whether the party charged with the commission of it <lb/>
            had the will to do it, had the power to do it, and whether he <lb/>
            actually did it.†</p>
          <p>28. Hence we must consider, first of all, what sort of cha­ <lb/>
            meter he is against whom a charge is brought; and it is the <lb/>
            business of the accuser to make whatever he imputes to the <lb/>
            accused appear not only disgraceful, but as consistent as pos­ <lb/>
            sible with the crime for which he is brought to trial. For <lb/>
            instance, if he reproaches a man accused of murder with being <lb/>
            incontinent, or adulterous, such dishonourable imputations will <lb/>
            indeed hurt him, but will be of less avail to support the charge <lb/>
            than if he prove him to be daring, headstrong, cruel, or rash. <lb/>
            29. The advocate of the accused, on the other hand, must make <lb/>
            it his object, if possible, to refute, justify, or extenuate such <lb/>
            allegations; or, if he find it impracticable to do so, the next <lb/>
            thing is to separate them from the question before the court; <lb/>
            and many imputations of that nature are not only irreconcileable <lb/>
            with the charge, but tend to overthrow it; for example, if a <lb/>
            man who is accused of theft be represented as prodigal or <lb/>
            careless of his property; for disregard of money, and covetous­ <lb/>
            ness, do not seem likely to meet in the same character. 30. <lb/>
            If such means of defence fail, he must have recourse to the <lb/>
            remark, that the question has no reference to the imputation; <lb/>
            that he who has committed one offence has surely not been <lb/>
            guilty of all kinds of offences ; that the accusers had the <lb/>
            audacity to make such false charges only because they hoped <note type="footnote"> * Ut eis serviret.] What I have given in the text is not an exact <lb/>
            translation of these words ; for, as Gesner and Spalding observe, it is <lb/>
            not easy to see what is meant by them, nor how they are to be con­ <lb/>
            nected. Gesner, for eis, proposes ei, that is Urbinia; but this seems <lb/>
            foreign to the purpose. Obrecht gives uti serviret. </note><note type="footnote"> t All the three particulars seem to refer to will or intention; at <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/>that the accused, being injured and wooded by them, would <lb/>
            be overwhelmed by a weight of slander.</p>
          <p>31. Other allegations may be made by the accusers, against <lb/>
            which common-place arguments rise in opposition. In such a <lb/>
            case, the advocate of the accused may commence with argu­ <lb/>
            ments drawn from his character; and this sometimes generally, <lb/>
            as, It is incredible that a father should have been killed by his <lb/>
            son; or that a general should have betrayed his country to the <lb/>
            enemy. To such arguments it is easily answered, either, that <lb/>
            every sort of crime may be committed by the bad, and is, indeed, <lb/>
            daily detected among them, or, that it is monstrous that charges <lb/>
            should be denied on the ground of their atrocity. 32. Some­ <lb/>
            times particularly; a mode which may have various results; <lb/>
            as dignity, for example, sometimes supports an accused <lb/>
            person, and at other times is turned into a proof of his guilt, <lb/>
            on the representation that the hope of impunity was conceived <lb/>
            from it; and in like manner poverty, humility, wealth, are set <lb/>
            in different lights according to the ability of each party.* <lb/>
            33. Good morals, however, and integrity in the past time of <lb/>
            life, must always be of great influence in favour of an accused <lb/>
            party. If no attack is made on his character, his advocate will <lb/>
            dwell strongly on that circumstance; while the accuser will <lb/>
            try to confine the attention of the court to the question before <lb/>
            it, on which alone judgment is to be pronounced, and will <lb/>
            observe that every offender must have committed a first offence, <lb/>
            and that the commencement of guilt is not to be celebrated by <lb/>
            a feast of glorification.† 34. Such will be the observations which <lb/>
            the accuser will make in reply; but in the early part of his <lb/>
            pleading he will impress the mind of the judge in such a way <lb/>
            as to be thought rather to have been unwilling to throw out <lb/>
            imputations than to have been unable. Hence it is better for <lb/>
            the accuser to abstain from casting any reflection on the past <lb/>
            life of the accused, than to attack him with light or frivolous <lb/>
            charges, or such as are manifestly false, because the credit of <lb/>
            his other statements would thus be diminished ; and he who <note type="footnote"> * Ut citique ingenio vis est.] This appears to me a strange construc­ <lb/>
            tion ; I should prefer ingenii, or ut quisque ingeniosUs est. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Per <foreign xml:lang="grc">έγ</foreign>ĸ<foreign xml:lang="grc">αίνια</foreign>.] Enccenia was a feast at the dedication of a temple, <lb/>

            appear more of a subject for exultation than for condemnation. Taking <lb/>
            the passage as sound, this seems to be the only sense that can be given <lb/>
            to it. But its soundness is very doubtful. </note> <pb n="27"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II]."/>throws out ao imputations may be thought to have abstained <lb/>
            from them as being superfluous, while he who throws out <lb/>
            groundless imputations shows that his only* chance of success <lb/>
            lay in attacking the past life of the accused, a point on which <lb/>
            he chose rather to be defeated than to be silent. 35. Other <lb/>
            considerations, derived from the character of individuals, I <lb/>
            have fully noticed where I have treated of the sources of <lb/>
            arguments.!</p>
          <p>The next sort of proof is derived from motives, ‡ in which <lb/>
            are chiefly to be regarded anger, hatred, fear, avarice, hope; <lb/>
            for all others fall under some variety of these. If any of them <lb/>
            be attributable to the accused, it is the part of the accuser to <lb/>
            make it appear that motives may stimulate a person to any act <lb/>
            whatever, and to exaggerate the force of those motives on <lb/>
            which he lays hold for the support of his arguments. 36. If <lb/>
            none of them are attributable to him, he may shape his speech <lb/>
            in such a way as to insinuate that there may have been latent <lb/>
            motives, or may observe that it is to no purpose to consider <lb/>
            from what motive the accused committed the crime, if it is <lb/>
            apparent that he did commit it; or he may say that the crime <lb/>
            is the more detestable from there having been no motive for it. <lb/>
            The advocate of the accused, on the other hand, will insist, as <lb/>
            often as possible, on this point, that it is incredible that any <lb/>
            crime can have been committed without a motive. On this <lb/>
            consideration Cicero dwells with great force in many of his <lb/>
            speeches, and especially in that for Varenus, who had every­ <lb/>
            thing else against him, and was in consequence condemned. <lb/>
            37. But if a motive is alleged by the accuser for the crime, <lb/>
            the advocate of the accused may say that the motive is false, <lb/>
            or frivolous, or was unknown to the accused. Motives may <lb/>
            sometimes be imputed to the accused to which he must be <lb/>
            a stranger; for instance, it could not be known, be may <lb/>
            say, whether the deceased intended to make him his heir by <lb/>
            whom he is said to have been killed, or designed to prosecute <lb/>
            him.§ If other grounds of defence fail, we may say that <lb/>
            motives are not necessarily to be regarded, for what person <lb/>
            can be found that does not fear, hate, and hope, but that most <lb/>
            entertain those feelings without violating the moral duties ? 38. <note type="footnote"> * I read unum, instead of varium, with Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> + V. 10, 23-32. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡See sect. 27. </note><note type="footnote"> I An hœredem habuerit, an accusaturus fuerit, cum à quo dicitur </note> <pb n="28"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/>Nor must the advocate omit to observe that all kinds of motives <lb/>
            do not prevail with all kinds of persons; for though poverty <lb/>
            may have incited some persons to steal, it could have had no <lb/>
            influence with a Curius or a Fabricius.</p>
          <p>39. Whether we should speak of the motive or of the person <lb/>
            first, is a question; and different courses have been adopted <lb/>
            by different orators; with Cicero motives generally take the <lb/>
            precedence. But to me, unless the nature of a cause gives a <lb/>
            preponderance to either, it seems more natural to commence <lb/>
            with the person; since for the accuser, for instance, to say <lb/>
            either the charge is credible of no one, or it is credible of the <lb/>
            accused, is a more general proposition, and a more just <lb/>
            division. 40. Yet regard to convenience may change that <lb/>
            order, as it changes many other things. Nor are motives for <lb/>
            the wilful commission of an act only to be sought, but motives <lb/>
            that may have misled to the commission of it, as drunkenness, <lb/>
            or ignorance; for as these lessen the culpability when the <lb/>
            quality of an act is considered, so they tend greatly to establish <lb/>
            a question regarding fact.* 41. However, I know not whether a <lb/>
            person can ever be the subject of a charge, (I mean in a real <lb/>
            cause,) without one or other party speaking of him; but <lb/>
            concerning motives it is often superfluous to inquire, as in <lb/>
            cases of adultery and theft, because the crimes themselves <lb/>
            carry their motives on the face of them.</p>
          <p>42. In the next place, it seems necessary to look to views, † <lb/>
            which open a wide field for consideration : as, whether it be <lb/>
            probable that the accused hoped that such a crime could be executed <lb/>
            by him; that when he had committed it, it would not be klown ; <lb/>
            or that, if it were known, it would be forgiven, or visited with a <note type="footnote">occisus ?] This is the way in which Spalding points the text, in order <lb/>
            that eum may refer to both the preceding clauses. The Romans, says <lb/>
            Turnebus, often made several wills, and we may on that ground say <lb/>
            that it was unknown to the accused whether he was heir to the <lb/>
            deceased; for though he might have been aware that he was named as <lb/>
            his heir in one will, he could not have been certain that he was named <lb/>
            as heir in his last will. </note><note type="footnote"> * In speaking of the quality of an act, we may often make a concession, <lb/>
            and say that it was done through ignorance, imprudence, intoxication; <lb/>
            and such considerations may tend to make it seem pardonable; but <lb/>
            in a question of fact considerations of that nature tend rather to <lb/>
            strengthen the evidence of it; for example, if a person accused of <lb/>
            adultery denies that he is guilty, and it be said that he waa intoxicated <lb/>
            at the time. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> t See sect. 27. </note> <pb n="29"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II]."/>light or tardy punishment, or one from which he would feel a <lb/>
            less portion of inconvenience than he would experience of <lb/>
            gratification from the commission of the deed; or whether he <lb/>
            thought it worth so much to undergo the penalty. 43. After­ <lb/>
            wards it may be considered whether he might have done the deed <lb/>
            at another time, or in another way, orwith greater facility or secu­ <lb/>
            rity; a method adopted by Cicero in defence of Milo, when he <lb/>
            specifies the number of occasions on which Clodius might have <lb/>
            been killed by Milo with impunity. Besides, we may ask why <lb/>
            the accused should have preferred to make an attack in that <lb/>
            place, or at that time, or in that manner, (arguments which <lb/>
            are also most ably enforced in the same pleading,) 44. or <lb/>
            whether, if he was led by no design, he was hurried away by <lb/>
            impulse, and without reason, (for it is a common saying, that <lb/>
            crimes have no reason,*) or whether he was led away by a habit <lb/>
            of vice.</p>
          <p>The first point, whether he had the will, being discussed, the <lb/>
            next consideration is, whether he had the power. † Under this <lb/>
            head are contemplated place and time; as, with respect to a <lb/>
            theft, whether it was committed in a solitary or frequented <lb/>
            place ; in the daytime, when there might have been many <lb/>
            witnesses, or in the night, when the difficulty of proof is <lb/>
            greater. 45. All obstacles and opportunities, indeed, will <lb/>
            be taken into consideration; they are numerous and well <lb/>
            known, and require no examples. This second head is of <lb/>
            such a nature, that, if the crime could not have been committed, <lb/>
            the trial comes to nothing ; if it could, the question follows, <lb/>
            Did the accused commit it ? But these considerations respect <lb/>
            also conjecture as to intention, for it is inferred from these <lb/>
            whether he hoped to effect his purpose. In consequence means <lb/>
            ought also to be regarded, as the suites of Clodius and Milo.</p>
          <p>46. The question, whether the accused committed the crime, <lb/>
            commences with the second division of time, that is, the <lb/>
            present, and that which is closely connected with it, to which <lb/>
            belong noise, cries, groans, or anything similar; ‡ to subsequent <note type="footnote"> * Scelera non habere consilium.] A saying of the same nature as, <lb/>

            these are to be added all kinds of signs or indications, of <lb/>
            which I have already treated ;* as well as words and acts, both <lb/>
            such as preceded and such as followed. 47. These words and <lb/>
            acts are either our own or those of others. But some words <lb/>
            hurt us less than others; our own words hurt us more and <lb/>
            profit us less than those of others; those of others profit us <lb/>
            more and hurt us less than our own. As for acts, sometimes <lb/>
            our own profit us more, and sometimes those of others, as <lb/>
            when our adversary has done anything that appears in our <lb/>
            favour; but our own always hurt us more than those of <lb/>
            others. 48. There is also this difference to be observed in <lb/>
            words, that they are either plain or equivocal; but whether <lb/>
            they are our own or those of others, those which are equivocal <lb/>
            must necessarily be less effective either to benefit or to injure. <lb/>
            Our own, however, are often injurious to us, as in the well- <lb/>
            known case, A son being asked where his father was, replied, <lb/>
            wherever he is, he is alive; † but he was found dead in a well. <lb/>
            49. The words of another which are equivocal, can never hurt us, <lb/>
            unless when the author of them is uncertain or dead; as in <lb/>
            the cases, A voice was heard in the night, Beware of tyrannical <lb/>
            power: and, A dying man being asked from whom he received <lb/>
            the poison of which he was dying, replied, It is not expedient <lb/>
            for you to know ;‡ for if there be any one that can be <lb/>
            questioned as to the meaning, he will put an end to the <lb/>
            ambiguity. 50. But while our own words and acts can be <lb/>
            justified only by reference to the intention, those of others <lb/>
            may be refuted in various ways.</p>
          <p>In what I have said, I have spoken, I think, chiefly with <lb/>
            reference to one kind of conjectural causes ;§ but something of <lb/>
            these is applicable to all kinds of causes; for in questions <note type="footnote"> * B. v. a 9. </note><note type="footnote">t Ubicunque est, vivit.] What is equivocal here? I suppose the <lb/>
            word vivit, which might be taken for bibit ; non vivebat in puteo pater, <lb/>
            Bed bibebat. That there was a continual confusion of the letters b and <lb/>
            v is known to every one who is conversant with the writers of <lb/>
            antiquity; and especially to those who have examined the Florentine <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II]."/>respecting theft, deposits, and loans of money, arguments <lb/>
            are derived both from possibilities, as whether there was any <lb/>
            money that could have been deposited, and from persons, as <lb/>
            whether it was credible that such a person deposited money with <lb/>
            such another person, or whether it was credible that he lent <lb/>
            money to such a person ; whether it is probable that the pro­ <lb/>
            secutor is a slanderer, or that the defendant is an impostor or a <lb/>
            thief. 51. But even in the case of a person accused of theft, <lb/>
            as in cases of murder, there is an inquiry about the deed <lb/>
            and the author of it. In regard to cases of loan and deposit <lb/>
            there are two questions, but always separate,. whether the <lb/>
            money was given, and, whether it was returned. Cases of <lb/>
            adultery have this peculiarity, that two parties are generally <lb/>
            imperilled in them, and that something must be said of the <lb/>
            past life of both; a question, however, may arise, in some <lb/>
            cases, whether both ought not to be defended together; but the <lb/>
            decision of this point must depend on the nature of the case ; <lb/>
            for if the defence of one party will support the other, I should <lb/>
            take them together, if it is likely to be injurious to it, I would <lb/>
            separate them. 52. But lest any one may think me incon­ <lb/>
            siderate in saying that adultery is generally a charge against <lb/>
            two persons, but not always, I would add that a woman alone <lb/>
            may be accused of adultery with an unknown person: Presents, <lb/>
            it may be said, have been found in her house, and money, of <lb/>
            which the giver has not been discovered; and love letters, of <lb/>
            which it is doubtful to whom they were written. 58. In regard <lb/>
            to forged writing † the case is similar; for either several per­ <lb/>
            sons may be charged with the crime, or one only. The <lb/>
            writer of an instrument however will always find it necessary <lb/>
            to guarantee the signature of the person who has signed it ; <lb/>
            but the person who has signed it cannot always guarantee the <lb/>
            handwriting of him who is said to have written it; for he may <lb/>
            be deceived. But he who is said to have engaged their ser­ <lb/>
            vices, and for whom the instrument is alleged to have been <lb/>
            written, will have to support both the writer and all who <lb/>
            signed the writing. The sources of proof are similar in cases <lb/>
            of treason and of aspiring to sovereignty. <note type="footnote"> * In regard to a deposit it may sometimes be inquired whether the <lb/>
            accuser really deposited money, and whether it was ever returned; but <lb/>
            these questions will hardly be asked at the same time. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> t See be v. c. 5; and a. 10, sect 19. </note></p><pb n="32"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/>54. But the custom in the schools, of considering every <lb/>
            thing in our favour that is not in the argument laid down for <lb/>
            us,* may be prejudicial to young men proceeding to the forum. <lb/>
            You accuse me of adultery : who is witness ? who testifies to <lb/>
            the fact ? of treason : what reward have I received ?† who was <lb/>
            privy to the transaction ? of administering poison : where did I <lb/>
            buy it ? from whom ? when ? for how much ? through whose <lb/>
            hands did I convey it ? Or we plead in defence of one accused <lb/>
            of aspiring to tyranny, where were his arms ? what guards had <lb/>
            he assembled 55. I do not deny that such questions may be <lb/>
            asked, or that we may urge them on behalf of the party whom <lb/>
            we defend; for I myself would call for such proofs in the <lb/>
            forum, if I should find my adversary not in a condition to <lb/>
            give them. But in the forum we miss the facility for asking <lb/>
            such questions that there is in the schools, where scarcely a <lb/>
            single cause is pleaded in which some argument of this kind, <lb/>
            or perhaps several, are not advanced. 56. Similar is the <lb/>
            ease with which some declaimers, in their perorations, assign <lb/>
            parents, children, or nurses, to whomsoever they please. <lb/>
            Yet we may more reasonably allow a speaker to call for proofs <lb/>
            that are not offered than to discuss them as if they were <lb/>
            offered.</p>
          <p>How we must examine as to intention, was sufficiently sig­ <lb/>
            nified when we distinguished § the three points of inquiry, <lb/>
            whether a person had the will, whether he had the power, and <lb/>
            whether he did the deed; for in the same manner as it is in­ <lb/>
            quired whether a person had the will, so it is inquired with <lb/>
            what intent he acted, that is to say whether he intended to do <lb/>
            an evil act. 57. The order in which circumstances are stated, <lb/>
            also, either adds to the credit of the statement, or detracts <lb/>
            from it; and so much the more as the circumstances are more <lb/>
            or less consistent or inconsistent with each other. But these <lb/>
            qualities are not discovered but by reference to the connexion of <lb/>
            a cause throughout. Yet we must always observe what par­ <lb/>
            ticular agrees or suits with any other particular. <note type="footnote"> * See iv. 2, 28. </note><note type="footnote"> t Quis index ? quod pretium ?] Spalding very justly supposes that <lb/>

          <p>Of definition ; it has something in common with conjecture and quality, <lb/>
            §1,2. Various reasons why it is used, 3—7. Three species of it, <lb/>
            8—11. Other diversities, more suited to philosophical discussions <lb/>
            than to the business of the orator, 12—16. We must beware of <lb/>
            defining too subtilely, 17,18. Method in definition, 19—22. How <lb/>
            a definition is overthrown, 23—27. A general definition may be <lb/>
            adapted to our own cause, 28—34. Some concluding remarks, <lb/>
            35, 36.</p>
          <p>1. NEXT to conjecture respecting a fact comes definition of it. <lb/>
            for he who is unable to prove that he has done nothing, will <lb/>
            try, in the next place, to make it appear that he has not done <lb/>
            that which is laid to his charge. Definition is accordingly <lb/>
            managed, for the most part, by the same methods as con <lb/>
            jecture, the kind of defence only being changed,* as we may <lb/>
            see in cases of theft, deposits, or adultery; for as we say, 1 <lb/>
            have not been guilty of theft, I did not receive a deposit, I have <lb/>
            not committed adultery, so we say, what I did is not theft, what <lb/>
            I received was not a deposit, what I committed is not adultery. <lb/>
            2. Sometimes we proceed from quality to definition, as in <lb/>
            actions regarding madness, bad treatment of awife, and offences <lb/>
            against the state, in which, if it cannot be said that what is <lb/>
            laid to the charge of the accused was rightly done, it remains <lb/>
            to say, that to act thus is not to be mad, to treat a wife ill, to <lb/>
            injure the state.</p>
          <p>Definition, then, is an explication of something in question, <lb/>
            .proper, clear, and concisely expressed. 3. It consists chiefly, <lb/>
            as has been said,t in the notification of genus, species, dif­ <lb/>
            ferences, and peculiarities; as, to define a horse (for I shall <lb/>
            adopt a well known example), the genus is animal, the species <lb/>
            mortal, the difference irrational (for man is also a mortal <lb/>
            animal,) and the peculiarity neighing. 4. Definition is fre­ <lb/>
            quently used in pleading causes, for many reasons; for some­ <lb/>
            times parties are agreed upon the term, but differ as to what <lb/>
            is to be included under it; and sometimes the thing is clear, <lb/>
            but there is a doubt as to the term to be applied to it. When <lb/>
            there is an agreement about the name, and a doubt about the <note type="footnote"> * For in conjectural cases the fact is simply denied ; in cases of <lb/>
            definition an objection is made to the term applied to the fact. This <lb/>
            is the change which Quintilian means. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote">t V. 10,55. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.VII."/>thing the decision sometimes depends upon conjecture; as <lb/>
            when it is asked, what is God 5. For he* who denies that <lb/>
            God is a spirit, diffused through every part of the universe, <lb/>
            does not say that the term divine is improperly applied to his <lb/>
            nature, like Epicurus, who has given him a human form, and a <lb/>
            place in the spaces between the worlds. Both † use one term, <lb/>
            but are in doubt which of the two natures ‡ is consistent with <lb/>
            the reality. 6. Sometimes it is quality that is to be considered, <lb/>
            as, What is oratory ? is it the power of persuading, or the art of <lb/>
            speaking well ? This kind of question is very common in civil <lb/>
            causes; thus it is inquired, whether a man found with another <lb/>
            man's wife in a brothel is an adulterer ? because the question <lb/>
            is not about the name, but the quality of the act, and whether <lb/>
            the man has been guilty of any offence at all; for if he has <lb/>
            committed any offence, he can be nothing else but an adul­ <lb/>
            terer. 7. It is a definition of a quite different kind when the <lb/>
            question is wholly about a term, the application of which de­ <lb/>
            pends on the letter of the law, and which would not be dis­ <lb/>
            cussed in a court of justice, but for the words which give rise <lb/>
            to the dispute. Thus it is inquired, whether he who kills him­ <lb/>
            self is a murderer; whether he who forced a tyrant to kill <lb/>
            himself is a tyrannicide; and whether the incantations of <lb/>
            magicians are poisons; for about the thing itself there is no <lb/>
            controversy, as it is known to all men that it is not the same <lb/>
            to kill one's self as to kill another, to kill a tyrant as to drive <lb/>
            him to suicide, to recite incantations as to administer a <lb/>
            draught of poison, but it is a question whether they do not, <lb/>
            respectively, come under the same denomination.</p>
          <p>8. Though I hardly dare to dissent from Cicero,§ who, <lb/>
            following many authorities, says that definition is always con­ <lb/>
            cerned about a thing itself and something else, (as he that <lb/>
            denies that a certain term is applicable to a certain thing, is <lb/>
            obliged to show what term would be more applicable,) yet I <lb/>
            consider that there are, as it were, three species of it. || <lb/>
            9. F'or sometimes it is convenient to put a question thus: <note type="footnote"> * The Stoic. </note><note type="footnote"> t Both the Stoic and the Epicurean. Spalding, </note><note type="footnote"> ‡A diffused spirit or a human form. Spalding, </note><note type="footnote"> § See iii. 6, 31. </note><note type="footnote"> || I follow Regius's reading, in eandem tres habeo velut species, <lb/>
            Most texts omit in. Gesner and Capperonier would read in eâdem. </note> <pb n="35"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III]."/>Is that adultery which is committed in a brothel ? When we <lb/>
            deny that it is adultery, it is not necessary to show by what <lb/>
            term it ought to be called, for we deny the whole charge. <lb/>
            Sometimes the inquiry is made thus : Is this act theft or sacri­ <lb/>
            lege ? Not but that it is sufficient for the defence that it is <lb/>
            not sacrilege ; still it is necessary to show what else it is : and <lb/>
            consequently both theft and sacrilege must be defined <lb/>
            10. Sometimes, again, it is a question with regard to things of <lb/>
            different species, whether one can come under the same deno­ <lb/>
            mination as the other, when each has its own proper appella­ <lb/>
            tion, as a philtre* and a dose of poison. But in all disputes of <lb/>
            this kind the question is whether this also comes under the same <lb/>
            term, because the term, about which the dispute is, is acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged to be applicable to something else. It is sacrilege to <lb/>
            steal what is sacred from a temple; is it also sacrilege to steal <lb/>
            from it private property ? It is adultery to lie with another <lb/>
            manes wife in her own home ? is it also adultery to lie with her <lb/>
            in a brothel ? It is tyrannicide to kill a tyrant; is it also tyran­ <lb/>
            nicide to drive a tyrant to kill himself ? 11. Accordingly <lb/>
            syllogism, of which I shall speak hereafter,! is, as it were, a <lb/>
            weaker kind of definition; because in the one, it is inquired <lb/>
            whether the same term is applicable to the thing in question <lb/>
            as is applicable to something else ; and, in the other, whether <lb/>
            one thing is not to be reasoned about in the same manner as <lb/>
            another. 12. There is also so much difference in definitions, <lb/>
            that it is doubtful, as some think, whether the same thing can <lb/>
            be defined in more than one form of words:‡ as, whether rhetoric <lb/>
            can be defined not only as the art of speaking well, but also as that <note type="footnote"> * VIII. 5, 31. t In the eighth chapter of this book. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Est et talis finitionum diversitas, ut quidam sentiunt, num idem <lb/>
            diversisverbis comprehendatur.] So stands this passage in all the <lb/>
            editions, but who has been satisfied with it, I know not; though some <lb/>
            of the commentators pass it in silence. Spalding conjectures ut qui <lb/>
            idem sentient, non iisdem verbis comprehendant; but he proposes this <lb/>
            conjecture with timidity, and it has the disadvantage of necessitating <lb/>
            the change of rhetorice and scientia, immediately following, into the <lb/>
            accusative case. What I have given is nearly a translation of the <lb/>
            Abbé Gedoyn's French: " Les definitions sont si diverses, selon <lb/>
            quelques-uns, que cette diversity donne lieu de douter si une chose <lb/>
            peut se definir dans des tonnes differents." The unsatisfactory state <lb/>
            of the text seems to arise from something having fallen out of it. </note> <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/>of tonceiving and expressing thoughts well, and of speaking with <lb/>
            the full force of language, and of saying what is to the purpose. <lb/>
            Yet we must take care that different definitions, though not <lb/>
            at variance in sense, be expressed in a different form of words. <lb/>
            But this is a subject for discussion among philosophers, not in <lb/>
            courts of justice. 13. Sometimes words that are obscure, and <lb/>
            but little known, require definition, as clarigatio* proletarius. † <lb/>
            Sometimes also words that are well known in common speech, <lb/>
            as what is the exact meaning of penus, “provisions,”† and <lb/>
            litus, " a shore."</p>
          <p>This variety is the reason that some authors include deft <lb/>
            nition in the state § of conjecture, others in that of quality; <lb/>
            others even rank it among legal questions. || 14. Some have <lb/>
            not been at all pleased with that subtilty of definition which is <lb/>
            adapted to the manner of logicians, thinking it rather fitted <lb/>
            for cavilling about the niceties of words in the discussions of <lb/>
            philosophers than likely to be of any service in the pleadings <lb/>
            of orators. For though, they say, definition is of avail, in dis­ <lb/>
            cussion, to hold in its fetters him who has to reply, and to <lb/>
            force him to be silent, or to admit, even against his will, that <lb/>
            which is to his prejudice, yet it is not of the same use in legal <lb/>
            arguments; for in them we have to persuade the judge, who, <lb/>
            though he may be fettered by our wards, will yet, unless he is <lb/>
            satisfied with our matter, mentally dissent from us altogether. <lb/>
            15. What great necessity, indeed, has a pleader of such pre­ <lb/>
            ciseness of definition ? If I do not say Man is an animal <lb/>
            mortal and rational, can I not, by setting forth his numerous <lb/>
            qualities of body and mind, in words of a wider scope, distin­ <lb/>
            guish him from the gods or from brutes? 16. Is it not <lb/>
            generally allowed, too, that one thing may be defined in more <note type="footnote"> * Properly "a demand of satisfaction from an enemy under <lb/>

            universos, “ for what are we to understand by publicly? All <lb/>
            men,") and with a freedom and variety of manner, such as all <lb/>
            orators have ordinarily adopted ? Since, assuredly, the slavery <lb/>
            of binding ourselves to certain words, (for slavery it indis­ <lb/>
            putably is,) which has its origin in the practice of the <lb/>
            philosophers, is very seldom to be seen in them ; and Marcus <lb/>
            Antonius, in the books of Cicero de Oratare,† expressly <lb/>
            cautions us against attempting such exactness; IT. for it is <lb/>
            even dangerous,‡ since, if we err but in one word, we are <lb/>
            likely to lose our cause entirely; and the best course is that <lb/>
            middle one which Cicero adopts in his oration for Carina,§ <lb/>
            and in which things are set forth, but exactness of terms is not <lb/>
            hazarded. For, says he, judges,|| that is not the only kind <lb/>
            of violence which is offered to our persons and our lives, but <lb/>
            there is a far more atrocious kind of violence, which, threatening <lb/>
            us with the peril of death, often unsettles the mind, alarmed with <lb/>
            terror, from its proper state and condition. 18. Or we may be <lb/>
            secure, I may add, by letting proof precede definition ; as <lb/>
            when Cicero, in his Philippics,¶first establishes that Servius <lb/>
            Sulpicius was killed by Antony, and then, in conclusion, <lb/>
            defines thus: for he certainly killed who was the cause of death. <lb/>
            I would not deny, however, that such rules are to be observed <lb/>
            in pleading only as far as they are serviceable for our cause ; <lb/>
            and that if a definition can be made, at once strong, and ex­ <lb/>
            pressed in a concise form of words, it is not only an ornament <lb/>
            to our speech, but has very great effect, provided that it be <lb/>
            impregnable.</p>
          <p>19. The invariable order in definition is what a thing is, <lb/>
            and whether it is this ;** and in general there is more difficulty <note type="footnote"> *Pro Muræn, c. 35. </note><note type="footnote">t II. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> | ‡ Compare iv. 5, 2. </note><note type="footnote">§ C. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> II Recuperatores.] Judges appointed by the prætor in private or civil <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            in establishing the definition than in applying it to the matter <lb/>
            in hand.</p>
          <p>As to the first point, what a thing is, there are two objects <lb/>
            to be regarded; for our own definition is to be established, <lb/>
            and that of the opposite party is to be overthrown, 20. Hence <lb/>
            in the schools, where we imagine contradiction offered to us, <lb/>
            we have to lay down two definitions as exact as is possible for <lb/>
            each party. But what we have to observe In the forum is, <lb/>
            that our definition be not, possibly, superabundant, or nothing <lb/>
            to the purpose, or ambiguous, or inconsistent, or equally <lb/>
            favourable to both sides; faults that cannot happen except <lb/>
            through the unskilfulness of the pleader. 21. But, if we would <lb/>
            define accurately, we shall be likely best to effect our object, <lb/>
            if we first settle in our mind what we wish to establish; for <lb/>
            our words will thus be exactly suited to our purpose. That <lb/>
            this point may be the clearer, let us still adhere to our <lb/>
            familiar example : A man who has stolen private property from <lb/>
            a temple, is accused of sacrilege. 22. The fact is not disputed; <lb/>
            the question is, whether the term sacrilege, which is in the <lb/>
            law, is applicable to the offence. It is accordingly disputed <lb/>
            whether the act is sacrilege. The prosecutor adopts the term, <lb/>
            because the money was stolen from a temple; the defendant <lb/>
            denies that it is sacrilege, because he stole private property, but <lb/>
            admits that it was theft. The advocate of the prosecutor, <lb/>
            therefore, will define thus, It is sacrilege to steal anything from <lb/>
            a sacred place; while the advocate of the defendant will define <lb/>
            in this way, It is sacrilege to steal anything sacred. 23. Each, <lb/>
            too, will try to overthrow the definition of the other; and a <lb/>
            definition is overthrown in two ways, by being proved to be <lb/>
            false or incomplete. It may indeed have a third fault, that of <lb/>
            having no relation to the matter under consideration, but it <lb/>
            will hardly be made faulty in this respect, except by fools. <lb/>
            24. We make a false definition, if we say, A horse is a rational <lb/>
            animal; for a horse is indeed an animal, but irrational.* <note type="footnote"> * There is little doubt that something has dropped out of the text <lb/>
            here, probably through the negligence of transcribers. Spalding very <lb/>
            judiciously considers that the passage may have stood originally thus : <lb/>
            Falsa est, si dicas, Equus est animal rationale ; nam est equus animal, <lb/>
            sed rationale. Parum plena, si dicas, Equus animal irrationale; com­ <lb/>
            mune enim ei cum aliis multis est irrationale; quod autem commune, <lb/>
            &amp;c. “It is a false definition, if you say, A horse is a rational animal; </note> <pb n="39"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III."/><lb/>
            That, again, which is common to anything else, will not be <lb/>
            peculiar to the thing defined. Thus, then, the accused will <lb/>
            say that the definition of the accuser is false ; while the <lb/>
            accuser cannot say that that of the accused is false ; for it is <lb/>
            sacrilege to steal anything sacred; but he will say that it is <lb/>
            incomplete, since he ought to have added, or from a sacred <lb/>
            place. 25. But for establishing and overthrowing definitions, one <lb/>
            of the most effective modes is to have recourse to the conside­ <lb/>
            ration of peculiarities and differences, and sometimes, also to <lb/>
            etymology. All these particulars equity, as in other matters, <lb/>
            will assist to support, and sometimes, also, conjecture. Ety­ <lb/>
            mology is but rarely introduced. We have one example of it <lb/>
            in Cicero: For what is a tumult,* but such a perturbation that <lb/>
            greater fear (timor) arises ? whence also the term tumult is <lb/>
            derived. 26. But about peculiarities and differences great <lb/>
            subtility is displayed ; as when it is inquired whether an <lb/>
            addictus,† whom the law condemns to serve until he pays his <lb/>
            debts, is a slave. The one party will define thus: He is a <lb/>
            slave who is legally in slavery; the other: He is a slave who is <lb/>
            in slavery under the same legal conditions as a slave; or, as the <lb/>
            ancients said, qui servitutem servit, “who serves as a slave." <lb/>
            Yet this last definition, though it differs somewhat from the <lb/>
            other, is feeble, unless it be supported by the aid of peculiarities <lb/>
            and differences; for the opponent will say that the addictus <lb/>
            does serve as a slave, or under the same legal conditions as a <lb/>
            slave. 27. Let us look, then, to the peculiarities and dif­ <lb/>
            ferences on which I touched lightly, in passing, in the fifth <lb/>
            book: A slave, when he is set free, becomes a freedman ; an <lb/>
            addictus, when he recovers his liberty, is ingenuus ;‡ a slave <lb/>
            cannot obtain his liberty without the consent of his master; <lb/>
            a slave has no benefit of law ;§ an addictus has. What is <lb/>
            for a horse is indeed an animal, but irrational. It is an incomplete <lb/>
            one, if you say, A horse is an irrational animal; for to be irrationalis <lb/>
            common to a horse with other beasts; and that which is common to <lb/>
            anything else will not be peculiar,3 &amp;c. <note type="footnote"> * Cic. Philipp. viii. 1. Thmultus is generally supposed to be from <lb/>

            peculiar to a freeman, is that which no one has who is not <lb/>
            free, as a pronomen, nomen, cognomen, and tribe; and these an <lb/>
            addictus has.</p>
          <p>28. When it is decided what a thing is, the question, <lb/>
            whether it is this, is almost settled. However, we have to <lb/>
            take care that our definition be favourable to our own cause. <lb/>
            But what is most influential in a definition is the question of <lb/>
            quality, as whether love be madness ? To this question belong <lb/>
            such proofs as Cicero says are proper to definition; proofs <lb/>
            from antecedents, consequents, adjuncts, contraries, causes, <lb/>
            effects, similitudes; of the nature of which arguments I have <lb/>
            already spoken.* 29. Cicero, in his speech for Cæcina,† gives <lb/>
            a concise example of arguments from beginnings, causes, effects, <lb/>
            antecedents, consequents: Why then did they flee? For fear. <lb/>
            What did they fear ? Violence, doubtless. Can tou then deny <lb/>
            the beginning, when tou hav.e admitted the end ? He has also <lb/>
            recourse to similitude : Shall not that which is called violence <lb/>
            in war, be called by the same name in peace ? 30. But argu­ <lb/>
            ments are also drawn from contraries ; for instance, if it be <lb/>
            inquired whether a philtre be poison or not, because poison is <lb/>
            not a philtre.</p>
          <p>That the other kind of definition may be better known to my <lb/>
            young men, (for I shall always think them my young men,)‡ I <lb/>
            shall here give an example of a fictitious case. 31. Some youths, <lb/>
            who were in the habit of associating together, agreed to dine <lb/>
            on the sea-shore. One of them being absent from the dinner, <lb/>
            the others erected a sort of tomb to him, and inscribed his name <lb/>
            upon it. His father returning from a voyage across the sea, <lb/>
            landed at that part of the coast, and, on reading his sons <lb/>
            name, hanged himself. 32. These youths are said to have <lb/>
            been the cause of the father's death. The definition of the <lb/>
            accuser will be, He that commits any act that leads <lb/>
            to the death of another, is the cause of the other’s death. That <lb/>
            of the accused will be, He who knowingly commits any act by <lb/>
            which the death of another must necessarily be caused, etc. <lb/>
            But setting aside definition, it is enough for the accuser to say, <lb/>
            You were the cause of the man’s death; for it was through your <lb/>
            act that he died, since, if Tou had not acted as tou did, he <lb/>
            would now be alive. 33. To this the advocate of the accused <lb/>
            will reply, He by whose act the death of a person has been <note type="footnote"> * V. 10, 78—94. </note><note type="footnote">t a 15. </note><note type="footnote">† His old pupils. </note> <pb n="41"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III]."/><lb/>
            caused, is not necessarily to be condemned for it; else what <lb/>
            would become of accusers, witnesses, and judges, in cases of <lb/>
            life and death ? Nor is there always guilt in the person from <lb/>
            whom the cause proceeded; for instance, if a person recom­ <lb/>
            mends a voyage to another, or invites a friend from over the <lb/>
            sea, and he perishes by shipwreck, or if he invites a person to <lb/>
            supper, and he dies of a surfeit committed at it, would he be <lb/>
            guilty of the death of any of those persons ? 34. Nor was the act <lb/>
            of the young men the sole cause of death, but also the credulity <lb/>
            of the old man, and his weakness in enduring affliction; for if <lb/>
            he had had more fortitude or wisdom, he would be still living. Nor <lb/>
            did the young men act with any bad intention; and he might <lb/>
            have judged, either from the place of the supposed tomb, or <lb/>
            from the marks of haste in its construction, that it was no real <lb/>
            sepulchre. How then ought they to be punished, who, though <lb/>
            they may seem to be homicides in every other respect, are evidently <lb/>
            not so in intention ?</p>
          <p>35. Sometimes there is a settled definition, in which both <lb/>
            parties agree. Thus Cicero says, Majesty resides in the govern­ <lb/>
            ment and in the whole dignity of the Roman people. But it may <lb/>
            sometimes be a question whether this majesty has been injured, as <lb/>
            was the case in the cause of Cornelius.* 36. But even if † such <lb/>
            a cause be thought similar to one dependent on definition, <lb/>
            yet, as there is no dispute in it about definition, the point for <lb/>
            decision must be one of quality, and must be included in that <lb/>
            state which we happen to have had occasion to mention. It <lb/>
            was however the subject next in order. <note type="footnote"> * There are many observations on the majesty of the people, and the <lb/>

          <p>The consideration of quality may have regard to more points than one <lb/>
            in any matter, § 1—3. The strongest kind of defence is when the <lb/>
            accused says that the deed laid to his charge was blameless, 4—6. <lb/>
            We may defend an act by extrinsic aids, 7—12. Another mode <lb/>
            of proceeding is to transfer the guilt to another, 13, 14. We may <lb/>
            consider whether the weight of the charge can be extenuated, 15, <lb/>
            16. Deprecation, 17—20. Questions about rewards, 21—23. <lb/>
            Considerations of quality admit the highest efforts of the orator, <lb/>
            24. Causes which Virginius puts under this head, 25—31. Other <lb/>
            species of causes, 32—34.</p>
          <p>1. As to quality, it is sometimes considered in the most <lb/>
            comprehensive sense,* and in reference to more points than one; <lb/>
            for it is sometimes a question what is the nature of a thing, and <lb/>
            what is its form, as whether the soul is immortal, and whether God <lb/>
            is of human shape; sometimes the inquiry is about magnitude <lb/>
            and number, as what is the size of the sun ? Are there more <lb/>
            worlds than one ? All such questions are indeed to be solved <lb/>
            by conjecture, but they involve the question of quality. <lb/>
            2. They are also often treated in deliberative questions, as, if <lb/>
            Cæsar should deliberate whether he should make war on Britain, <lb/>
            he would have to inquire what is the nature of the ocean there ; <lb/>
            whether Britain is an island (for the point was then unknown); <lb/>
            what extent of land there is in it; and with what number of <lb/>
            forces it would be proper to attack it. Under the head of <lb/>
            quality, too, falls the consideration of what ought to be done or <lb/>
            not done; to be sought or to be avoided; matters which enter <lb/>
            most into deliberative questions, but also present themselves <lb/>
            frequently in judicial pleadings, the only difference being that <lb/>
            in one case the question regards the future, in the other the past. <lb/>
            3. All that relates, too, to the demonstrative kind of oratory <lb/>
            falls under the consideration of quality; it is admitted that <lb/>
            something has been done; it is to be shown what sort of a <lb/>
            thing has been done. All judicial causes relate either toreward, <lb/>
            or to punishment, or to the measure of one or the other. The <lb/>
            first kind of cause is accordingly either simple or comparative, <lb/>
            in the former we inquire what is just; in the latter, what is <lb/>
            more just; or what is most just.</p>
          <p>When the point for decision has respect to punishment, <lb/>
            there is offered on the part of him who is accused, either justifi <note type="footnote"> * De summo genere.] Do toth rei naturà. Turnebus. </note> <pb n="43"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.IV]."/><lb/>
            cation of the charge, or extenuation of it, or excuse, or, as some <lb/>
            think, deprecation.*</p>
          <p>4. Of these the most efficient is justification, by which we <lb/>
            make it appear that the act, which is laid to the charge of the <lb/>
            accused, was unobjectionable. A Ion is disinherited because <lb/>
            he has served in the army, or been a candidate for office, or <lb/>
            taken a wife, without the consent of his father; the father jus­ <lb/>
            tines what he has done. The followers of Hermagoras call <lb/>
            this kind of defence <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίληψιν</foreign>, " contrasumption," using <lb/>
            that term with reference to the mind of the pleader.† 1 find <lb/>
            no literal translation of the word in Latin; but it is called <lb/>
            defensio absoluta, “absolute defence." 5. The sole question, <lb/>
            however, is respecting the act, whether it is just or not. <lb/>
            Whatever is just, is founded either on nature or on human <lb/>
            institutions. 6. On nature is based whatever is consonant to <lb/>
            dignity of anything, in which designation are comprehended the <lb/>
            virtues piety, integrity, continence, etc. Some also add to <lb/>
            render like for like; but that is not to be lightly admitted; for <lb/>
            though violence opposed to violence, or retaliation, may offer no <lb/>
            injustice towards him who has been the aggressor,‡ yet § it does <lb/>
            not follow that, because the act of each party is similar, the <lb/>
            first act was just. Where there is strict justice on both sides, <lb/>
            there is the same law, and the same condition; and perhaps <lb/>
            no acts can be regarded as equal that are in any respect dis <lb/>
            similar. Human institutions consist of laws, customs, decisions, <lb/>
            arguments.</p>
          <p>7. There is another mode of defence, in which we justify an <lb/>
            act in itself indefensible by aids drawn from without; this the <lb/>
            Greeks call the defence <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίθεσιν</foreign>, " by opposition." The <lb/>
            Latins also do not render this literally, for among them it is <lb/>
            called causa assumptiva, “defence by assumption." 8. In this <lb/>
            kind of defence the strongest plea is when we justify the act <lb/>
            by the motive of it; such is the plea of Orestes, Horatius, <note type="footnote"> * V. is, 5. </note><note type="footnote">t Ad intellectum id nomen referentis.] The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίληψις</foreign>, which <lb/>
            signifies contrasumptio, the followers of Hermagoras understand, not of <lb/>
            any corporeal act or sumptio, but of the action of the mind of the <lb/>
            advocate, who, in contemplating the matter in question, thinks that it <lb/>
            is to be regarded in a different lignt from that in which his adversary <lb/>
            views it. Capperonier. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Cicero de Inv. ii. 22. </note><note type="footnote">Et non, quoniam.] Gesner would very properly read Sed non. </note> <pb n="44"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            and Milo. It is also called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντέγϰλημα</foreign>, “recrimination," <lb/>
            because all our defence depends on accusing the person who is <lb/>
            indicated by the other party: He was killed, but he was a <lb/>
            robber; he was emasculated, but he was a ravisher. 9. There <lb/>
            is also another kind of defence derived from the motives of an <lb/>
            act, which differs from that just mentioned, and in which a <lb/>
            deed is neither justified on its own ground, as in the absolute <lb/>
            defence* nor by opposing another deed to it, but on the repre­ <lb/>
            sentation of its having been of some service to our country, or <lb/>
            to some body of men, or even to our adversary, or sometimes <lb/>
            to ourselves, provided it be such a deed as we might lawfully <lb/>
            do for our own benefit; an argument which can be of no <lb/>
            profit with regard to an accuser who is a stranger to us, and who <lb/>
            prosecutes us according to the letter of the law, but which may <lb/>
            be of use in reference to family disputes. 10. For a father may <lb/>
            without presumption say to his children, on a trial for <lb/>
            renouncing them, or a husband to his wife, if he is accused of <lb/>
            treating her ill, or a son to his father, whom he seeks to prove <lb/>
            insane, that what he has done was for his own interest; but, <lb/>
            in such cases, the plea of escaping loss is much better than <lb/>
            that of aiming at advantage. 11. Cases similar to those of the <lb/>
            schools have to be conducted in trials about real occurrences; <lb/>
            for the case of the renounced children in the schools is in the <lb/>
            forum a case of children actually disinherited by their parents, <lb/>
            and seeking to recover their property before the centumviri; <lb/>
            the case of ill-treatment in the schools is in the forum a case <lb/>
            of restoring a wife's dowry, in which the question is, through <lb/>
            whose fault the divorce was caused; and that which in the <lb/>
            schools is a case of insanity is in the forum a suit for appoint­ <lb/>
            ing a guardian. 12. Under the head of advantage comes also <lb/>
            the plea that something worse would have happened if the <lb/>
            defendant had not acted as he did ; for in a comparison of evils <lb/>
            the less is to be regarded as a good; for example, if Mancinus <lb/>
            should justify the treaty with Numantia on the ground that, if it <lb/>
            had not been made, the whole Roman army would have been <lb/>
            destroyed. This species of defence is called in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίστασις</foreign>, <lb/>
            “balancing." Some rhetoricians call it comparison.</p>
          <p>13. Such are the modes of proceeding in defence of an act; <lb/>
            but if a defence can neither be sustained on the motive of the <lb/>
            act itself, nor by extrinsic aid, our next course is to transfer the <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 4. </note> <pb n="45"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.IV.]."/><lb/>
            charge, if we find it possible, on another party. Hence trans <lb/>
            lation, or “exception," has been regarded as forming one of <lb/>
            those states which have been previously mentioned.. Some­ <lb/>
            times, then, the blame is thrown on a person, as if Gracchus, <lb/>
            being accused of concluding the Numantine treaty, (through fear <lb/>
            of which accusation he seems to have passed his popular laws <lb/>
            in his tribuneship,t) should say that he was sent to conclude it <lb/>
            by his general. 14. Sometimes it is cast on some circumstance, <lb/>
            as if a person who had been directed to do something in the tiU <lb/>
            of another, and had not done it, should say that it was rendered <lb/>
            impossible by the laws, This the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετάστασις</foreign>, <lb/>
            " transference."</p>
          <p>Should these modes of defence fail us, there remains excuse. <lb/>
            founded either on ignorance or on necessity. On ignorance: as <lb/>
            if a person should brand another as afugitive slave, and, after <lb/>
            he is decided by law to be a freeman, should excuse himself by <lb/>
            saying that he did not know that he was free. On necessity : <lb/>
            as when a soldier does not present himself at the end of his <lb/>
            furlough, and alleges that he was hindered by floods or by sick­ <lb/>
            ness. 15. Chance, also, is sometimes represented as the cause <lb/>
            of a fault. Sometimes, too, we state that we have certainly <lb/>
            erred, but that we acted with a good intention. Of both these <lb/>
            kinds of excuses examples are so numerous and obvious that <lb/>
            to offer any here is unnecessary.</p>
          <p>If, again, none of those means which have been mentioned <lb/>
            can avail us, we must see whether the charge can be extenuated. <lb/>
            This is what is by some said to be the state of quantity.‡ 16. <lb/>
            But quantity, when it relates either to penalty or reward, is <lb/>
            decided by the quality of the deed, and accordingly appears to <lb/>
            me to fall under the state of quality, as well as quantity used <lb/>
            with reference to number. The Greeks have the terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">πηλι­ <lb/>
            ϰότης</foreign>, “magnitude,” and “multitude;”§ we include <lb/>
            both under the same term.</p>
          <p>17. The last method of all is deprecation; a mode of <lb/>
            address which most rhetoricians do not allow to be admissible <note type="footnote"> * Qui jam scripti sunt.] Qui jam descripti sunt. Obrecht. See iii. 6, <lb/>
            53, 78. </note><note type="footnote"> + The words in the parenthesis are very justly suspected by Spalding <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            into judicial pleadings; and Cicero himself, in his speech for <lb/>
            Quintus Ligarius,* seems to declare himself of the same <lb/>
            opinion, when he says, I have pleaded many causes, Cœsar, and <lb/>
            even in conjunction with yourself, while regard to your public <lb/>
            duties retained you in the forum, but I certainly never stooped <lb/>
            so far as to say, “Forgive him, judges, he has erred, he <lb/>
            has offended, he did not think of what he was doing; <lb/>
            if he ever do so again," etc. 18. But in the senate, before <lb/>
            the people or the emperor, and wherever there is power to re­ <lb/>
            lax the law, deprecation finds its place. It sometimes derives <lb/>
            its greatest efficacy from the character of the accused himself, if <lb/>
            it appear, from his previous life, that there are these three kinds <lb/>
            of merit in him: that he has lived innocently, that he has <lb/>
            been serviceable to others, and that he affords expectation <lb/>
            that he will conduct himself blamelessly for the future, and <lb/>
            make himself of some use to the world ; and if, in addition, he <lb/>
            seems to have already suffered sufficient, either from other in­ <lb/>
            conveniences, from his present imminent peril, or from peni­ <lb/>
            tential feelings. Sometimes, too, external circumstances give <lb/>
            weight to deprecation, as nobility, dignity and the support of <lb/>
            relatives and friends, 19. Most dependence however is to be <lb/>
            placed on the judge, if we can make it appear that, should he spare <lb/>
            the accused, commendation for clemency, rather than blame for <lb/>
            weakness, will attend him. But even in common causes †, de­ <lb/>
            precation is often introduced, though not through the whole <lb/>
            course of a cause, yet in a great portion of. it; for there is fre­ <lb/>
            quently such a distinction as this made : Even if he had been <lb/>
            guilty of the charge, he ought to be pardoned; a method which <lb/>
            has often had great effect in doubtful questions; and all pero­ <lb/>
            rations contain some portion of entreaty. 20. Sometimes, <lb/>
            too, the accused rests the whole of his cause on this ground ; <lb/>
            for instance, if a father has disinherited his son,‡ and testified, <lb/>
            by an express declaration §, that he did so because he had <note type="footnote"> * C. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> t Judiciis.] As distinguished from pleadings before the senate or <lb/>

            but children who had been disinherited, as well as those not named in <lb/>

            Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> § Elogio.] Elogium was a testimony concerning any person, whether <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.IV.]."/><lb/>
            formed a connexion with a courtezan; for the whole question, <lb/>
            in this case, is whether the father ought not to have pardoned <lb/>
            such a fault, and whether the centumviri ought not to be <lb/>
            indulgent to it. But even under strict forms of law, and in <lb/>
            penal prosecutions, we make the distinction in pleading <lb/>
            whether the penalty has been incurred, and whether it ought to <lb/>
            be inflicted. However, what the rhetoricians thought,. is <lb/>
            true, that a criminal cannot be rescued from the law solely by <lb/>
            this mode of defence.</p>
          <p>21. With respect to rewards, two questions are to be con <lb/>
            sidered; whether a party claiming a reward is deserving of <lb/>
            any; and whether he is deserving of so great a reward as he <lb/>
            claims. If there be two claimants, which of them is the more <lb/>
            worthy ; if several, which is the most worthy. 22. The deci­ <lb/>
            sions of such questions depend on the species of merit in the <lb/>
            claimants. We have accordingly to regard, not only the act <lb/>
            of any claimant, whether as represented to the judges, or as <lb/>
            compared with the acts of others, but also his character; for it <lb/>
            makes a great difference whether the person who has killed a <lb/>
            tyrant is a young or an old man; whether a man or a woman ; <lb/>
            whether a stranger or a relative; and we must consider the <lb/>
            place, too, on several accounts; whether it were in a state <lb/>
            accustomed to tyranny, or one that had been always free; in <lb/>
            the citadel, or at his own house; as also the manner, whether by <lb/>
            sword or by poison; and at what time, whether during war or <lb/>
            in peace; when he was about to resign his power, or when he <lb/>
            was going to attempt some new wickedness. Among the recom­ <lb/>
            mendations of such an act, also, are to be reckoned the loss of <lb/>
            popularity, the risk incurred, and the difficulty surmounted. <lb/>
            23. In regard to liberality, likewise, it is important to consider <lb/>
            from what sort of character it has proceeded ; for it is more <lb/>
            pleasing in a poor than a rich man ; in one who confers, than <lb/>
            in one who requites, an obligation; in a person who has chil­ <lb/>
            dren than in one who is childless. We ought to inquire, too, <lb/>
            what degree of benefaction he has bestowed, at what time, and <lb/>
            with what object, that is, whether with any expectations of <lb/>
            advantage to himself. Similar points are to be considered in <lb/>
            a similar manner. The question of quality, accordingly, calle <note type="footnote">praise, as in Cic. Tusc. Qamt L 14, Quid elogia sepulchi orum, &amp;c <lb/>
            Regius. </note><note type="footnote"> * Sect 15. </note> <pb n="48"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            for the greatest resources of the orator; for there is a vast <lb/>
            field for ability, whichever side the speaker takes, and the <lb/>
            feelings have nowhere greater influence. 24. Conjecture also <lb/>
            frequently admits proofs adduced from extrinsic circumstances, <lb/>
            and employs arguments derived from the nature of the subject; <lb/>
            but to show the quality of an act is the business of eloquence; <lb/>
            and it is here that she reigns, predominates, and triumphs.</p>
          <p>Under this head Virginius* puts cases of disinheritance, <lb/>
            insanity, ill-treatment of a wife, and those of female orphans <lb/>
            suing for marriage with relatives.! For the most part, indeed, <lb/>
            such cases actually come under the consideration of qualities, <lb/>
            and some writers have been found to call them questions of <lb/>
            moral obligation. 25. But the laws respecting these matters <lb/>
            sometimes admit also other states; ‡for conjecture enters occa­ <lb/>
            sionally into many such questions, as when the accused parties, <lb/>
            for instance, maintain that they have not done what is laid to <lb/>
            their charge, or that they did it with a good intention. <lb/>
            Examples of such cases are abundant; and those of insanity <lb/>
            and ill-treatment depend on definition. For laws often give <lb/>
            rise to considerations of equity, when it has to be shown for <lb/>
            what reasons equity would not be observed by a strict adhe­ <lb/>
            rence to the law. 26. What is not justifiable as a legal act, may <lb/>
            be defended on the ground of equity. We have to consider, <lb/>
            too, in how many and what cases it is unlawful for a father to <lb/>
            disinherit his son; under what charges a suit for ill-treatment <lb/>
            is inadmissible ; and in what circumstances a son is not <lb/>
            allowed to accuse his father of insanity.</p>
          <p>27. Of disinheriting there are two forms ; the one for a crime <lb/>
            completed, as when a son is disinherited for having committed <lb/>
            rape or adultery ; the other for a crime as it were incomplete, <lb/>
            and still dependent on a condition, as when a son is disin­ <lb/>
            herited because he continues disobedient to his father.§ The <lb/>
            one is attended with rigorous proceedings on the part of the <note type="footnote"> * IV. 1, 23. </note><note type="footnote"> t A theme for declamation in the schools, taken from the laws of <lb/>

            due satisfaction to the father. 28. I know that those pleaders, <lb/>
            who are ready to make attacks on fathers under cover of a figure <lb/>
            of speech,. will not allow the justice of this remark ; attacks <lb/>
            which I would not say should never be made, (for cases may <lb/>
            occur that demand them,) but they should certainly be avoided <lb/>
            when it is possible to proceed in any other manner. But of <lb/>
            figures I shall treat in another book.†</p>
          <p>29. The suits of wives on account of ill-treatment are <lb/>
            similar to those of sons in regard to disinheritance; for they <lb/>
            require the same moderation in stating charges.</p>
          <p>As to actions on account of insanity, they are brought <lb/>
            either on the ground of something that has taken place, or <lb/>
            something that may or may not hereafter take place. 30. In <lb/>
            regard to what has taken place, the pleader for the son has an <lb/>
            open field for attack, but he should make his attack in such a <lb/>
            way as exposes only the conduct of the father, while he should <lb/>
            manifest pity for the father himself, as being disordered in mind <lb/>
            from weakness of body. But in regard to that which has not <lb/>
            taken place, and which admits of a change of purpose, he <lb/>
            should use much solicitation and persuasion, and at last express <lb/>
            his regret that infirmity, not immorality, obscures his reason ; <lb/>
            and the more he praises his previous goodness of character, <lb/>
            the more easily will he prove that it has been changed by <lb/>
            disease. 31. The accused party himself, as often as the case <lb/>
            allows, should observe calmness in making his defence; for <lb/>
            anger and excitement are indications of insanity. What is <lb/>
            common to all such causes, is, that the accused parties do not <lb/>
            always attempt a justification of their conduct, but frequently <lb/>
            have recourse to apology and entreaties for pardon. For in <lb/>
            family disputes it is often sufficient to secure acquittal, if it <note type="footnote"> it Libenter patres figurâ lædunt.] What a figure is, is fully shown by <lb/>
            Quintilian, ix. 2, 65, seqq. It often happens that orators are ready to <lb/>
            attack a father under cover of a figure, that is, to throw out something <lb/>
            against him which, at first sight, does not appear calumnious, but in <lb/>
            which there is some secret assault on his character. Gamer. </note><note type="footnote"> t Book is. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="50"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            can be shown that a person has offended but once, or through <lb/>
            mistake, or less gravely than is laid to his charge.</p>
          <p>32. But many other kinds of suits come under the consider <lb/>
            at ion of quality; as those for assault; for though the accused <lb/>
            sometimes denies that he committed any assault, yet the <lb/>
            decision generally depends on the nature of the act and the <lb/>
            apparent intent. 33. Another kind of questions are those <lb/>
            about appointing an accuser, which are called divinations; <lb/>
            as to which Cicero, who accused Verres at the solicitation of the <lb/>
            allies, adopts the following division : that we must consider <lb/>
            by whom those, for whom redress is sought, would most desire <lb/>
            the cause to be conducted, and by whom the party, who is <lb/>
            accused, would least wish it to be conducted. 34. Such <lb/>
            questions as the following, however, are most frequent: which <lb/>
            of two pleaders has the stronger reasons for desiring to be the <lb/>
            accuser; which of the two will bring the greater energy or <lb/>
            ability to support the impeachment; which will carry it forward <lb/>
            with greater integrity. 35. To these are to be added also <lb/>
            questions respecting guardianship, in which it is usual to <lb/>
            inquire whether regard ought to be had to anything else <lb/>
            besides accounts; whether honesty only is required to be observed, <lb/>
            and not also care as to speculations and consequences. Similar <lb/>
            to these are cases of mismanagement of agency, or, in the forum,* <lb/>
            cases of misconduct of business; for an action may be brought <lb/>
            for the mismanagement of anything intrusted to another.</p>
          <p>36. Besides these, there are imagined in the schools cases <lb/>
            of crimes not mentioned in the laws ;† cases in which it is either <lb/>
            inquired whether the act in question is really not mentioned in <lb/>
            the laws, or whether it be really a crime. Both these inquiries <lb/>
            rarely occur in the same case. Among the Greeks there were <lb/>
            often prosecutions, and not in imaginary cases, for misconduct <lb/>
            on embassies; where it was a common question, on the ground <lb/>
            of equity, whether it is at all allowable for an ambassador to act <lb/>
            otherwise than he has been instructed; and for how long a <note type="footnote"> * By adding these words. Quintilian signifies that the cases of " mis­ <lb/>

            period the accused was an ambassador; since some ambassadors <lb/>
            terminate their office with the delivery of their message ; at <lb/>
            in the case of Heius,* who, after his message was delivered, <lb/>
            gave his testimony against Verres. But much depends on <lb/>
            the quality of the act with which the ambassador is charged. <lb/>
            37. Another sort of accusation is that of having acted contrary to <lb/>
            the interests of the state.t From such accusations arise a <lb/>
            thousand legal cavillings: as, what it is to act contrary to the <lb/>
            interests of the state; whether the accused has injured the state ; <lb/>
            or merely neglected to serve it; and whether it was injured by <lb/>
            him or only on his account. But in these eases, again, much <lb/>
            depends on the nature of the supposed act. Another charge <lb/>
            is that of ingratitude ; and in cases of that kind it is inquired <lb/>
            whether the party against whom the charge is brought really re­ <lb/>
            ceived any kindness; an inquiry which is rarely to be answered <lb/>
            in the negative; for he who denies the receipt of a kindness <lb/>
            which he has received, fixes the charge of ingratitude on him­ <lb/>
            self. 38. Additional inquiries are, what was the extent of the <lb/>
            kindness that he received ; whether he made any return at all; <lb/>
            whether he who has made no return ought necessarily to be con­ <lb/>
            victed of ingratitude; whether he could have made any return ; <lb/>
            whether he ought to have made that return which was demanded <lb/>
            of him; and what is his general disposition.</p>
          <p>Such as follow are of a more simple kind, as that of unjust <lb/>
            divorce;‡ cases of which, as regards the law, have this pe­ <lb/>
            culiarity, § that the defence is on the side of the accuser, and <lb/>
            the accusation -on that of the defendant. SO. That, too, in <lb/>
            which a person makes a statement to the senate of the reasons <lb/>
            that prompt him to kill himself; where the only point of <note type="footnote"> * Alii in renunciando sunt.] Spalding conjectures alice (legationes) <lb/>
            in renunciando desinunt. With regard to Heius, who was at the head <lb/>
            of the deputation sent by the Sicilians to Rome, (Cic. in Verr. iv. 8) it <lb/>
            was made a question whether he should not have returned to Sicily, <lb/>
            and reported the result of his embassy, before he proceeded to give <lb/>
            testimony against Verres. Burmann fully illustrates the difference <lb/>
            between perferre legationem and renunciare legationem. </note><note type="footnote"> t Examples of this sort of cause may be seen in Seneca the Rheto­ <lb/>

            law is, whether he who desires to die, that he may withdraw <lb/>

            prevented from killing himself;* all other considerations de. <lb/>
            pend on quality. Cases are also imagined regarding wills, <lb/>
            in which the question has reference to quality alone, as in the <unclear/> <lb/>
            rase which I have detailed above,! where a philosopher, a <lb/>
            physician, and an orator, contend for the fourth part of their <lb/>
            father's property, which he had bequeathed to the most worthy <lb/>
            of his children. It is a similar case when suitors, equal in <lb/>
            rank, claim marriage with a female orphan relative, ‡ and when <lb/>
            the only question is about the most deserving among the <lb/>
            competitors. 40. But it is not my intention to go through all <lb/>
            such sorts of cases; (for more might still be imagined ;) nor are <lb/>
            the questions that arise from them common to all alike, but <lb/>
            are varied by circumstances. I only wonder that Flavus,§ <lb/>
            whose authority is deservedly great with me, restricted the <lb/>
            subject of quality, when he was composing a work merely for <lb/>
            schools, within such narrow limits.</p>
          <p>41. Quantity also, whether with respect to measure or <lb/>
            number, falls generally, as I said,|| if not always, under the <lb/>
            head of quality; but measure is sometimes determined by the <lb/>
            equitable estimation of an action, as when it is inquired, how <lb/>
            great an offence has been committed, or how great an obligation <lb/>
            received, and sometimes by strict legality, as when it is dis­ <lb/>
            puted, under what law a person is to be punished or rewarded. <lb/>
            42. Thus, If he who has insulted a youth ought to pay ten <lb/>
            thousand sesterces ¶ (which is the penalty appointed for such <lb/>
            an offence,) ought he, if the youth whom he has dishonoured <lb/>
            hangs himself, to be punished capitally, as being the cause of <lb/>
            his death ? In such a case, those are deceived who plead as <note type="footnote"> * A subject for declamation in the schools, taken from a law at <lb/>

            if there were a question between two laws; for, in regard to <lb/>
            the ten thousand sesterces there is no controversy, since they <lb/>
            are not claimed. 43. The point to be decided is, whether the <lb/>
            accused was the cause of the young man's death. The same sort <lb/>
            of question regarding measure also, resolves itself, at times, <lb/>
            into a question of fact, as when it is disputed, whether a per­ <lb/>
            son, who has killed another, should be condemned to perpetual <lb/>
            banishment, or to banishment for five years; the point for <lb/>
            decision is, whether he committed the murder intentionally or <lb/>
            not. 44. Such a question as the following, too, which arises <lb/>
            from number, depends for decision on law: whether thirty re <lb/>
            wards be due to Thrasybulus for removing thirty tyrants:* <lb/>
            and when two thieves have carried off a sum of money, whether <lb/>
            each of them ought to restore fourfold or only double. But <lb/>
            in such cases the act† is taken into estimation, and yet the <lb/>
            question of law‡ depends on quality.</p>

          <p>Questions as to legality of proceedings, § 1—4. As to particular points <lb/>
            of law, 5, 6.</p>
          <p>1 AN accused person who can neither deny that he has <lb/>
            committed an act, nor prove that the act which he has com­ <lb/>
            mitted is of a nature different from that which is attributed to <lb/>
            it, nor justify the act, must necessarily take his stand on some <lb/>
            point of law that is in his favour; whence generally arises a <lb/>
            question about the legality of the process against him,§ a <lb/>
            question which does not, as some have thought, always present <lb/>
            itself in the same manner. 2. For it sometimes precedes the <lb/>
            trial, as in the case of the nice examinations of the prætor, <lb/>
            when there is a doubt about the right of a person to be an <lb/>
            accuser, and sometimes it occurs in the progress of the trial <note type="footnote"> * See iii. 6, 26. </note><note type="footnote"> t Factum.] That is qualitas facti ; comp. sect. 32. Spalding, </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Jus.] That is juris quæstio, or legalis quæstio. Spalding. Gedoyn <lb/>
            lenders this concluding sentence thus: " Mais ici on estime aussi Is <lb/>
            fait; et le droit lui-même depend de la qualité.” Both the question of <lb/>
            fact and the question of law depend on the consideration of quality. </note><note type="footnote"> I Actionis eat quœstio.] See v. 13, &amp; </note> <pb n="54"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            itself. The nature of such a question is twofold, as it is <lb/>
            either intention* or prescription† that gives rise to it. There <lb/>
            were some who made a state of prescription, as if prescription <lb/>
            were not concerned in all questions in which other laws are con <lb/>
            cerned. 3. When a cause depends on prescription, it is not <lb/>
            necessary that there should be any inquiry about the fact itself. <lb/>
            A son, who has been disinherited by his father, raises the <lb/>
            question of prescription against him, as being infamous ; and the <lb/>
            dispute is then merely on the point whether the father has the <lb/>
            right to disinherit. As often as we can, however, we must take <lb/>
            care that the judge may conceive a favourable opinion of <lb/>
            the main question, for he will thus be more inclined to listen <lb/>
            to our arguments on the point of law ; as in cases respecting <lb/>
            sponsions, which arise from interdicts of the prætor,‡ though <lb/>
            the question may not be about right to possession, but merely <lb/>
            about possession itself, yet it will be proper to show not only <lb/>
            that we were in possession, but that that of which we were in <lb/>
            possession was our own. 4. But the question occurs still more <lb/>
            frequently with regard to intention. Let him who has saved <lb/>
            his country by his valour choose whatever he pleases as a <lb/>
            recompence.§ I deny that whatever he chooses ought to be <lb/>
            given to him ; I have no formal prescription; but I try to set <lb/>
            the intention of the lawgiver, in the manner of prescription, <lb/>
            against the written letter. In either case the state|| is the same.</p>
          <p>5. Moreover every Jaw either gives, or takes away, or <lb/>
            punishes, or commands, or forbids, or permits. It gives rise <lb/>
            to dispute either on its own account, or on account of another <lb/>
            law; and to inquiries either with regard to its wording, or to its <lb/>
            intention. As to its wording, it is either clear, obscure, or <lb/>
            equivocal. 6. What I say of laws, I wish to be understood of <lb/>
            wills, agreements, contracts, and every sort of written instru <lb/>
            ments ; and even of verbal bargains. And as I have made <lb/>
            four states or questions on this head, I will touch upon each of <lb/>
            them. <note type="footnote"> * VI. 4, 2 </note><note type="footnote"> † III. 6, 50 </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Concerning sponsions and interdicts see note on ii. 10, 5. </note><note type="footnote"> § V. 1: 97; vii. 10, 6. </note><note type="footnote"> || That of exception, which Quintilian here calls actionis quœstis <lb/>

          <p>Questions about writing, and the intention of the writer, either regard <lb/>
            both these points, or one only, § 1—4. Arguments against the <lb/>
            letter in writings, 5—8. In favour of it, 9—11. General questions <lb/>
            under this head, 12.</p>
          <p>1 THE question of most frequent occurrence among lawyers <lb/>
            is concerning the written letter of a law, and the intention of <lb/>
            it; and it is about such questions that a great part of legal dis­ <lb/>
            cussion is employed. It is, therefore, not at all wonderful that <lb/>
            they prevail in the schools, where cases involving them are <lb/>
            purposely invented. One species of this kind of question, is <lb/>
            that in which there is a dispute about the letter of a Jaw as <lb/>
            well as the intention of it. 2. This occurs where there is any <lb/>
            obscurity in a law, of which each party* supports his own in­ <lb/>
            terpretation, and tries to overthrow that of his adversary ; as <lb/>
            in this case: Let a thief pay fourfold what he has stolen: Two <lb/>
            thieves stole in company ten thousand sesterces;† forty thousand <lb/>
            are demanded from each; they represent that they ought to pay <lb/>
            only twenty thousand each: here the prosecutor will say that <lb/>
            what he demands is fourfold ; and the thieves will say that <lb/>
            what they offer is fourfold ; and the intention of the law is <lb/>
            alleged by each side in its own favour. 3. Or a dispute of <lb/>
            this kind may occur when the wording of the law is clear in one <lb/>
            sense, and doubtful in another ; as, Let not the son of a harlot <lb/>
            be allowed to make a speech to the people; ‡ A woman who had <lb/>
            had a son by her husband, began to play the harlot: Her son <lb/>
            is prohibited from addressing the people. Here the letter of <lb/>
            the law evidently refers to the son of a woman who was a <lb/>
            harlot before he was born, and it is doubtful whether the case <lb/>
            of the son in question does not come under the law, because he <lb/>
            is the son of the woman named, and she is a harlot. 4. It is <lb/>
            a common question, too, how the following law, Let there be no <lb/>
            second pleading about the same matter,§ is to be understood ; <lb/>
            that is, whether the term second pleading refers to the pleader. <note type="footnote"> * In ed aut uterque, &amp;c.] The student of the text will observe, that <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            or to the suit. Such are the questions that arise from the <lb/>
            obscurity of laws.</p>
          <p>But there are others that arise, and this is the second class, <lb/>
            where the words of the law are clear; and those who have <lb/>
            particularly attended to this point, have called it, the state of <lb/>
            what is expressed and what is intended. In this case, the one <lb/>
            party makes a stand on the letter, and the other on the <lb/>
            meaning. 5. But the literal interpretation may be combatted <lb/>
            in three ways. One is, when it is shown from the law itself <lb/>
            that it cannot be observed invariably, as is the case with regard <lb/>
            to the law, Let children maintain their parents, or be put in <lb/>
            prison; for an infant will surely not be put in prison. From <lb/>
            this exception there will be a possibility of proceeding to others, <lb/>
            and of making a distinct inquiry whether every one who does <lb/>
            not maintain his parents is to beput in prison, and whether the par­ <lb/>
            ticular person in question. 6. For this reason. some masters <lb/>
            in the schools propose a sort of cases in which no argument <lb/>
            can be drawn from the law itself, and in which the only <lb/>
            question is concerning the matter that is the subject of contro­ <lb/>
            versy. For example, Let a foreigner, if he mounts the wall, <lb/>
            be punished with death: The enemy having scaled the walls, a <lb/>
            foreigner repulsed them: It is demanded that he be put to death. <lb/>
            7. Here there will not be distinct questions whether every <lb/>
            stranger, or whether this stranger, should be put to death, because <lb/>
            no stronger objection can be brought against the literal interpre­ <lb/>
            tation of the law than the act which is the subject of dispute. It <lb/>
            is sufficient merely to ask whether a foreigner may not mount the <lb/>
            walls even for the purpose of saving the city. The defence of the. <lb/>
            foreigner, therefore, must rest on equity and the intention of <lb/>
            the law. It may happen, however, that we may be able to <lb/>
            adduce examples from other laws, by which it may be shown <lb/>
            that we cannot always adhere to the letter; a method which <lb/>
            Cicero has adopted in his pleading for Cæcina.† 8. There is a <lb/>
            third mode, when we find something in the very words of a <lb/>
            law to prove that the legislator intended something different <lb/>
            from what is expressed, as in this case: Let him who is caught <lb/>
            with steel in his hand at night, be sent to prison : A magistrate <lb/>
            sent to prison a man who was found with a steel ring. Here, <lb/>
            as the word in the law is “caught," it appears sufficiently <note type="footnote"> * Propter hoc.] Spalding conjectures præter hoc. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. 14, and especially 18, 19. </note> <pb n="57"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VI.]."/><lb/>
            clear that nothing is meant in it but steel intended for <lb/>
            mischief.</p>
          <p>9. But though be who rests on the meaning of the law, <lb/>
            vill endeavour, as often as he can, to explain away the letter <lb/>
            of it; yet he, who adheres to the letter, will try at the same <lb/>
            time to gain support from the intention of it. In wills it <lb/>
            sometimes happens that the intention of the testator on a <lb/>
            point is manifest, even though there be nothing written upon <lb/>
            it, as in the case of Curius, when the well-known contest <lb/>
            between Crassus and Scævola occurred.* 10. A second heir <lb/>
            was appointed, if a posthumous IOn should die before he was <lb/>
            past the years of tutelage: No posthumous son was born. The <lb/>
            near relatives laid claim to the property. Who could doubt <lb/>
            but that it was the will of the testator that the same person <lb/>
            should be heir if a son was not born who was to be heir if a <lb/>
            son died ? But he had written nothing on the point. 11. A <lb/>
            case exactly the reverse of this lately occcurred, when some <lb/>
            thing was written in a will which it was evident that the <lb/>
            testator had not intended. A person who had bequeathed five <lb/>
            thousand sesterces,† having, in making a correction, erased the <lb/>
            word " sesterces," inserted “pounds weight of silver," leaving <lb/>
            the words “five thousand" standing. Yet it was apparent that <lb/>
            he meant to leave five pounds weight of silver, for such a sum <lb/>
            of silver as five thousand pounds weight for a legacy was <lb/>
            unheard of and incredible. 12. Under this head fall the <lb/>
            general questions, whether we ought to adhere to letter or intent; <lb/>
            and what was the intention oj the writer under consideration. <lb/>
            The methods of treating them are to be sought from quality <lb/>
            or conjecture,‡ of which I think that enough has been said. <note type="footnote"> * Cic. De Orate i. 39; it 32. </note><note type="footnote"> f Something more than £40. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The only foundations for arguments in such cases, are, either to <lb/>

          <p>Of contradictory laws, § 1—6. Right is either admitted or doubtful, <lb/>
            7—9. Contradictory points in the same law, 10.</p>
          <p>1. THE next head to be considered is that of contradictory <lb/>
            laws, because it is agreed among all writers on rhetoric that in <lb/>
            antinomia,* there are two† states regarding letter and intent; <lb/>
            and not without reason ; because, when one law is opposed to <lb/>
            another, there arise, on both sides,‡ objections against the <lb/>
            letter, and questions regarding the intention ; and it becomes <lb/>
            a matter of dispute, with respect to each law, whether we ought <lb/>
            to be guided by that law. 2. But it is obvious to everybody <lb/>
            that one law is not opposed to another in strict equity; for, if <lb/>
            there were two kinds of equity, the one must be abrogated by <lb/>
            the other; but that the laws clash with each other only <lb/>
            casually and accidentally.</p>
          <p>The laws that interfere with one another may be of a like <lb/>
            nature, as, if the option§ of a tyrannicide, and that of a man <lb/>
            who has saved his country, occur at the same time, liberty <lb/>
            being granted to each of choosing what he pleases, there <lb/>
            would hence arise a comparison of their respective services, of <lb/>
            the conjunctures in which they acted, and of the nature of the <lb/>
            recompences on which they fix their thoughts. 3. Or the same <lb/>
            law may be opposed to itself; as in the case of two deliverers of <lb/>
            their country, two tyrannicides, two women who have been <lb/>
            violated ;|| in regard to whom there can be no other question <lb/>
            but that of time, whose claim had the priority, or of quality, <lb/>
            whose claim is the more just. 4. Dissimilar or similar laws, <lb/>
            also, are sometimes in conflict.. Dissimilar laws are such as <lb/>
            may be attacked by arguments of a different kind even though <note type="footnote"> * III. 6, 46. </note><note type="footnote"> t One state regarding the letter, and one regarding the intent, in <lb/>
            reference to each law; as Pithceus remarks. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Et utrinque, in the text, should probably be utrinque et, as <lb/>
            Spalding observes. </note><note type="footnote"> § V. 10, 97. </note><note type="footnote"> || A common case in the schools, where it was an imaginary law that <lb/>
            woman who had been forcibly violated might demand that the ravisher <lb/>
            should be put to death, or that he should marry her without receiving <lb/>
            any dowry. In the case to which allusion is made in the text, one <lb/>
            man is represented as having violated two women in one night, one of <lb/>
            whom demands his death, and the other his hand in marriage. Regius, </note> <pb n="59"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VII.]."/><lb/>
            no law be opposed to them; as in this case,* Let not the com­ <lb/>
            mandant quit the citadel; Let the man who has saved his <lb/>
            country choose what he pleases. [Suppose that the command­ <lb/>
            ant and the deliverer of his country are the same person; then, <lb/>
            with respect to him in his character of deliverer,]† though no <lb/>
            law stand in the way, it may be inquired whether he ought to <lb/>
            receive whatever he chooses; and, in regard to him in his <lb/>
            character of commandant, many arguments may be urged by <lb/>
            which the letter of the law is overthrown; for instance, if there <lb/>
            be a fire in the citadel, or if it be necessary to sally forth <lb/>
            against the enemy. 5. Similar laws are those to which no <lb/>
            opposition can be made but that of another similar Jaw. Sup­ <lb/>
            pose that one law says, Let the statue of a tyrannicide be <lb/>
            placed in the gymnasium; that another law says, Let not the <lb/>
            statue of a woman be placed in the gymnasium; and that a <lb/>
            woman kills a tyrant; it is plain that neither under any other <lb/>
            circumstances can the statue of a woman be placed there, nor <lb/>
            the statue of a tyrannicide be prevented from being placed <lb/>
            there. 6. Two laws are of unlike nature, when many argu­ <lb/>
            ments may be used against the one, and nothing can be said <lb/>
            against the other but what is the subject of the controversy; <lb/>
            as in the case where the deliverer of his country demands <lb/>
            impunity for a deserter; for against the law regarding the <lb/>
            deliverer of his country many arguments may be brought, as I <lb/>
            have just remarked, but the law concerning deserters can be <lb/>
            set aside only by the option allowed to the deliverer of his <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>7. In addition, the point of right involved in conflicting <lb/>
            laws, is either admitted by both parties, or doubtful. If it is <lb/>
            admitted, there commonly follow such questions as these: <lb/>
            Which of the two laws is the more binding; whether it relates to <lb/>
            gods or men ; to the state, or to private individuals; to reward <lb/>
            or to punishment; to great or small matters; whether it permits, <lb/>
            forbids, or commands. 8. It is a common subject of inquiry, too, <lb/>
            which of the two laws is the more ancient; but the most import­ <lb/>
            ant consideration is, which of the two laws will suffer less; as in <note type="footnote"> * It wiU be an example of antinomia, if the commandant of a citadel, <lb/>
            who has saved his country, demand permission to quit his post. <lb/>
            Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote">t The words in brackets are supplied as necessary to the sense. The <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="B.VII."/><lb/>
            the case of the deserter and the deliverer of his country ; for <lb/>
            if the deserter be not put to death, the whole law regarding <lb/>
            deserters is set aside: but if he is put to death, another choice <lb/>
            may be allowed to the deliverer of his country. It is, however, <lb/>
            of great consequence which course is the better and more equit­ <lb/>
            able; a point on which no direction can be given but when the <lb/>
            case is proposed for consideration. 9. If the point of right be <lb/>
            doubtful, then arises a question on one side, or on both sides <lb/>
            reciprocally, respecting it; as in such a case as this : Let a <lb/>
            father have the power of seizing the body of his son, and a <lb/>
            patron that of seizing his freedman: Let freedmen belong to the <lb/>
            heir: A certain person made the son of his freedman his heir, <lb/>
            after his death the right of seizure is claimed both by the son of <lb/>
            the freedman and the freedman himself, each over the other; <lb/>
            and the son, now become patron, denies that his father was <lb/>
            possessed of the rights of a father, because he was subject to <lb/>
            a patron.</p>
          <p>10. Two provisions in a law may interfere with one another, <lb/>
            as well as two laws. Thus, Let an illegitimate son, born be­ <lb/>
            fore a legitimate one, be to his father as legitimate; if born after <lb/>
            an illegitimate, only as a citizen.*</p>
          <p>What I say of laws, is also to be said of decrees of the <lb/>
            senate. If they contradict each other, or are at variance with <lb/>
            the laws, there is still no other name t for the state of the <lb/>
            question.</p>

          <p>Of syllogism; intimately connected with definition, § 1, 2. Deter­ <lb/>
            mines by inference what is uncertain in the letter of any writing, <lb/>
            3—6. Or even what is not expressed in the writing, 7.</p>
          <p>1. THE state called syllogism has some resemblance to that of <lb/>
            letter and intention, inasmuch as one party, under it, always <lb/>
            takes its stand ofthe letter; but there is this difference, that <lb/>
            in the state of letter and intention, arguments are brought <lb/>
            against the letter, in that of syllogism the meaning is carried <lb/>
            beyond the letter; in the former, he who adheres to the letter, <note type="footnote"> * See iii. 6, 96. </note><note type="footnote"> t It will always be called antinomia. Capper onier. </note> <pb n="61"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VII.]."/><lb/>
            makes it his object that at least what is written may be <lb/>
            carried into effect; in the latter, that nothing may be done <lb/>
            besides what is written. Syllogism has also some affinity to <lb/>
            definition ;* for if syllogism be weak, it often has recourse to <lb/>
            definition. 2. For suppose that there be this law: Let a <lb/>
            woman who administers poison be put to death. And this case: <lb/>
            A woman several times gave a philtre to her husband who <lb/>
            had neglected her; afterwards she procured a divorce from <lb/>
            him; being solicited by her relatives to return to him, she did <lb/>
            not return; the husband hanged himself; the woman is accused <lb/>
            of poisoning. The strongest argument of the accuser will be <lb/>
            to say that a philtre is poison ; this will be a definition ; but <lb/>
            if it fail to produce sufficient effect, the syllogism will be <lb/>
            attempted, (to which he may proceed, giving up, as it were, the <lb/>
            definition,) to decide whether she does not deserve to be <lb/>
            punished as much as if she had actually poisoned her husband.</p>
          <p>3. The state of syllogism, therefore, deduces from that <lb/>
            which is written that which is uncertain; and, as this is <lb/>
            collected by reasoning, it is called the ratiocinatory state.t <lb/>
            The following are the points which it mostly embraces: <lb/>
            Whether what is lawful to be done once, is lawful to be done <lb/>
            more than once : A woman found guilty of incest, and precipi­ <lb/>
            tated from the TarpeiaM rock, is found alive; sce is required <lb/>
            to undergo the punishment a second time.‡ Whether what the <lb/>
            law grants with regard to one person or thing, it grants with <lb/>
            regard to several: A man who has killed two tyrants at once, <lb/>
            claims two rewards. 4. Whether what was lawful before <lb/>
            a certain time, was also lawful after it: A woman is forcibly <lb/>
            violated; the ravisher flees ; the woman is married, and, on his <lb/>
            return, demands her option.§ Whether what is forbidden with <lb/>
            regard to the whole, is forbidden with regard to part: It is not <lb/>
            lawful to receive a plough in pledge ; a man received a plough­ <lb/>
            share. Whether what is forbidden with regard to part, is <lb/>
            forbidden with regard to the whole: It is not lawful te export <note type="footnote"> * There is a very great affinity between syllogism and definition ; for <lb/>
            definition decides that the name of two things is the same; syllogism <lb/>
            proves that two things are to be regarded in the same light. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, we cannot avail ourselves of a definition, we have recourse to <lb/>
            syllogism. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> t III. 6, 61. </note><note type="footnote"> t See this case in Seneca Rhet p. 92. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> I C. 7, sect 3. </note> <pb n="62"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.Vii."/><lb/>
            wool from Tarentum; a person, exported sheep. 5. In these <lb/>
            cases of syllogism the one party rests on the letter; the other <lb/>
            alleges that no provision is made in the law against the act in <lb/>
            question. " I demand," says the accuser, “that the woman <lb/>
            guilty of incest be thrown headlong from the rock; for such <lb/>
            is the law." On the same ground the woman who has been <lb/>
            forcibly violated claims her option ; and “ in exporting sheep," <lb/>
            it is said, “wool is exported;" and it is the same with other <lb/>
            cases. 6. But it may be replied, “ It is not written in <lb/>
            the law that a woman condemned should be twice thrown <lb/>
            headlong; that a woman forcibly violated should have her <lb/>
            option whenever she pleases ; that a tyannicide should receive <lb/>
            two rewards ; that there is no provision in the law about a <lb/>
            ploughshare, or about sheep ;” and what is doubtful is then to <lb/>
            be collected from what is certain. To deduce from what is <lb/>
            written that which is not written, is a matter of greater <lb/>
            difficulty: Let him who has killed his father be sewn up in a <lb/>
            sack; A man kills his mother.* Let it be unlawful to drag a <lb/>
            man from his house to the judgment-seat; A man drags <lb/>
            another from his tent. 7. In such cases, the questions are, <lb/>
            whether, when there is not a particular law for a case, we <lb/>
            must have recourse to a similar law ; and whether the matter in <lb/>
            question is similar to that to which the letter of the law refers.</p>
          <p>But what is similar may be either greater, or equal, or <lb/>
            less.t In the first case, we inquire whether sufficient pro­ <lb/>
            vision has been made with regard to the matter in question in <lb/>
            the law to which we refer it, and whether, if sufficient provision <lb/>
            has not been made, we ought to apply that law to it. In the <lb/>
            two other cases, we inquire concerning the intention of the <lb/>
            legislator. But arguments founded on equity are the strongest. <note type="footnote"> * V. 10, 88. </note><note type="footnote"> t Similitude is three-fold; a thing may be like another, but less; <lb/>

          <p>Ambiguity in words, § 1—3. Words divided, 4. Compounded, 5, 6. <lb/>
            Ambiguity of words in connexion with one another, 7—13. Some <lb/>
            remarks on ambiguity, 14, 15.</p>
          <p>1. OF ambiguity the species are innumerable; insomuch <lb/>
            that some philosophers think there is not a single word that <lb/>
            has not more significations than one.. But the genera of it <lb/>
            are very few; for it arises either from words taken singly or in <lb/>
            connexion.</p>
          <p>2. A single word gives rise to ambiguity, when it is a deno­ <lb/>
            mination for more things or persons than one, (the Greeks <lb/>
            apply to such ambiguity the term homonymy,) as Gallus; for <lb/>
            as to this word, taken by itself, it is uncertain whether it <lb/>
            means a bird, a native of a certain country, a proper name, or <lb/>
            a person in a certain condition of body;t and it is uncertain <lb/>
            whether Ajax means the son of Oileus. Some verbs also <lb/>
            have different meanings, as cerno. 3. Such ambiguity pre­ <lb/>
            sents itself in many ways; whence often arise disputes, <lb/>
            especially with regard to wills, when persons who have the <lb/>
            same name contend about their liberty,‡ or succession to an <lb/>
            inheritance; or when, from ambiguity in the expression, it <lb/>
            becomes a matter of doubt what is bequeathed to any person.</p>
          <p>4. Another source of ambiguity is, when a word has one sig­ <lb/>
            nification if taken entire, and another if divided, as ingenua, <lb/>
            armamentum, Corvinum. Such words can only give rise to <lb/>
            Billy cavillings, but the Greeks make them the origin of con­ <lb/>
            troversies in the schools: hence comes the well-known dispute <lb/>
            about the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀυλητϱίς</foreign>, whether a hall that had fallen three times, <lb/>
            or a female flute-player, if she fell, was to be sold.§</p>
          <p>5. A third kind of ambiguity arises from compound words; <lb/>
            for example, if a person should direct by his will, that his body <lb/>
            should be buried in occulto loco, “in a sequestered spot," and <lb/>
            should bequeath a portion of land round his tomb, to be taken <lb/>
            from his heirs, as is usual, for the protection of his ashes, the <lb/>
            expression in occulto, if taken as a compound word, inocculto, <lb/>
            " uusequestered," might be the origin of a law-suit. 6. So, <note type="footnote"> * See Aul. Gell. xi. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Galli were emasculated priests of Cybele. </note><note type="footnote"> t When slaves are set free by a will. </note><note type="footnote"> | See Diog. Laert. vii. 62 ; Theon. Progymn. p. 35. Spalding. A <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρὶς</foreign> is “a hall three times;” <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀυλητρίς</foreign>, "a female flute-player.” </note> <pb n="64"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            among the Greek rhetoricians, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λέων</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πανταλίων</foreign> have a <lb/>
            contention, as it is doubtful whether the letter of a will sig. <lb/>
            nines that all the possessions are left to Leon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα Λέοντι</foreign>. <lb/>
            or that the possessions are left <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πανταλέοντι</foreign>, to Pantaleon.</p>
          <p>7. But ambiguity is more frequent in words put together; <lb/>
            it sometimes arises from uncertainty with respect to cases, as in <lb/>
            the verse, <lb/>
            Aio te, Æacida, Romanos vincere posse,* <lb/>
            I say that you, offspring of Æacus, <lb/>
            The Romans can defeat.</p>
          <p>Sometimes from collocation, when it is doubtful to what a <lb/>
            word or words ought to be referred; and this very frequently <lb/>
            happens when that which is in the middle may be connected <lb/>
            either with what precedes or with what follows, as in the words <lb/>
            of Virgil t respecting Troilus, <lb/>
            Lora tenens tamen, <lb/>
            Holding still the reins, <lb/>
            Where it may be asked, whether Troilus is dragged because he <lb/>
            still holds the reins, or whether, though he still holds the reins, <lb/>
            he is nevertheless dragged. 8. Hence is that case in the schools, <lb/>
            that a man in his will ordered to be erected statuam auream <lb/>
            hastam tenentem, where it is a question, whether it was to be a <lb/>
            golden statue holding a spear, or a golden spear, with a statue <lb/>
            of some other material. Ambiguity is caused still more fre­ <lb/>
            quently by an improper inflexion‡ of the voice, as in the verse, <lb/>
            Quinquaginta ubi erant centum inde occidit Achilles.§ <lb/>
            9. Sometimes it is doubtful to which of two antecedents a <lb/>
            word is to be referred; hence the scholastic case, Let my heir <lb/>
            be bound to give my wife a hundred pounds of the plate, " quod <lb/>
            elegerit," where it is doubtful to which of the two elegerit should <lb/>
            be referred. But of the three last examples of ambiguity, the <note type="footnote"> * A verse from Ennius; see Cicero do Divin. it 56. </note><note type="footnote"> t Æneid. i. 477. </note><note type="footnote"> t Flexum.] "L'inflexion de Is voix." Gedoyn. " Commutationem <lb/>
            vocis." Regius. An improper mode of delivering a phrase or sentence, <lb/>
            so as to connect such parts of it as ought to be separated, and to <lb/>
            separate such as ought to be connected, would misrepresent the <lb/>
            sense ; as would be the case in the verse in the text, by making a stop <lb/>
            after erant, instead of stopping after quinquaginta and centum. </note><note type="footnote"> § A verse translated, with A slight change, from the Greek. See <lb/>
            Aristot. Sophist. i. 4. </note> <pb n="65"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.IX.]."/><lb/>
            first may be corrected by a change of cases, the second by a <lb/>
            separation or transposition of the words, and the third by <lb/>
            some addition. 10. Ambiguity, caused by the doubling of an <lb/>
            accusative, may be removed by the introduction of an ablative, <lb/>
            as in the words, <lb/>
            Lochetem audivi percussisse Demeam, * <lb/>
            may be altered to a Lachete percussum Demeam. There is, <lb/>
            however, in the ablative, as I remarked in the first book,! <lb/>
            a natural ambiguity, as in Cœlo decurrit aperto,‡ it is doubtful <lb/>
            whether per apertum Caelum, “through the open heaven," is <lb/>
            meant, or quum Coelum apertum esset, “when the heaven was <lb/>
            opened." 11. We may divide words from one another in pro­ <lb/>
            nunciation by taking breath or pausing; thus we may pause <lb/>
            after statuam, and then say auream hastam, or we may pause <lb/>
            after statuann auream, and then add hastam. An addition, in <lb/>
            the third example, may be made by inserting ipse after elegerit, <lb/>
            “quod elegerit ipse," that the heir may be understood, or ipsa, <lb/>
            that the wife may be understood. An ambiguity caused by <lb/>
            the insertion of a superfluous word, may be removed by with­ <lb/>
            drawing it, as in the phrase nos flentes illos deprehendimus.§ <lb/>
            12. Where it is doubtful to what a word or phrase should be <lb/>
            referred, and where, perhaps, the word or phrase itself is <lb/>
            ambiguous, we may have to alter several words to make a cor­ <lb/>
            rection ; as in Hares meus dare illi damnas e8to omnia sua.|| <lb/>
            Cicero runs into this kind of fault, in speaking of Caius <lb/>
            Fannius He, by the direction of his father-in-law, of whom, <lb/>
            as he had not been elected into the college of augurs, he was <lb/>
            not extremely fond, especially as he had preferred Quintus <lb/>
            Scævola, his younger son-in-law, sibi, to hint, &amp;c.; for this sibi <lb/>
            may be referred, either to the father-in-law or to Fannius. <lb/>
            13. The lengthening or shortening of a syllable, too, left <note type="footnote"> * These words are cited again, vii. 2, 16. They may be translated <lb/>
            either, " I heard that Laches bad struck Demea," or, " I heard that <lb/>
            Demea had struck Laches.” Such accusatives, observes Spalding, <lb/>
            often give much trouble to commentators. </note><note type="footnote"> t I. 7, 3. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ It is not known whence these words come. Virgil has pelago <lb/>
            decurrit aperto, An. v. 212. </note><note type="footnote"> § It is the word illos that may be withdrawn. </note><note type="footnote"> || It is doubtful whether the word sua is to be referred to hæres os <lb/>
            to illi. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶Cicero Brut. c. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VII."/><lb/>
            dubious in any writing, may be a cause of ambiguity, as in the <lb/>
            word Cato, for it means one thing in the nominative, when its <lb/>
            second syllable is short,- and another in the dative or ablative, <lb/>
            when that syllable is made long. There are many other <lb/>
            species of ambiguity besides, which it is not necessary to <lb/>
            specify.</p>
          <p>14. Nor is it of importance whence ambiguity arises, or <lb/>
            how it is removed; it is sufficient that it presents two senses <lb/>
            to the mind; and the mode of understanding the writing or <lb/>
            the pronunciation, is a matter of equal consideration for both <lb/>
            parties in a suit. It is a useless precept, therefore, that we <lb/>
            should endeavour, in this state,† to turn the word or phrase <lb/>
            in our own favour, for, if that be possible, there is no <lb/>
            ambiguity.</p>
          <p>15. Every question of ambiguity, however, has respect to the <lb/>
            following points; sometimes, which of two interpretations is <lb/>
            the more natural; and always, which of the two is the more <lb/>
            equitable; and which was the meaning attached to the words by <lb/>
            him who wrote or spoke them. But the manner of treating <lb/>
            these questions, for or against, has been sufficiently shown in <lb/>
            what I have said ‡ on conjecture and quality.</p>

          <p>Affinity between different states, § 1—4. Some precepts with regard <lb/>
            to causes can be given only when the causes themselves are stated, <lb/>
            5—7. Impossible to give instruction on every particular point, 8, <lb/>
            9. Many things the student must teach himself, and must depend <lb/>
            for success on his own efforts, 10—17.</p>
          <p>1. BETWEEN the states § there is a certain affinity, for in <lb/>
            definition the question is, what is the meaning of a term; in <lb/>
            the syllogism, which is the most nearly related to definition,∥ <note type="footnote"> * Quintilian speaks as if the o in the nominative case of Cato were <lb/>
            uniformly shortened. "This shortening of nominatives in o," says <lb/>
            Spalding, " perhaps became general in the age of Quintilian; see <lb/>
            Vossius de Arte Gramm. ii. 27, though he does not refer to this <lb/>
            passage. Compare Varro vocat, viii. 6, 73." </note><note type="footnote"> f III. 6, 1, seqq. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See c. 6, fin. </note><note type="footnote"> § Not the two, of which he has just been speaking, but states in <lb/>

            the object is to ascertain what the writer meant; and from <lb/>
            antinomia, or the contradiction of laws, it appears that there <lb/>
            are two. states of writing and intention of the writer. Defi­ <lb/>
            nition, again, is itself a kind of ambiguity, as the meaning <lb/>
            of a word may be regarded in two lights. 2. The state of what <lb/>
            is written and the intention of the writer has regard also to the <lb/>
            signification of terms, and the same object is kept in view in <lb/>
            antinomia.† Hence some rhetoricians have said, that all <lb/>
            these states merely constitute that of letter and intention; <lb/>
            others think that in that of letter and intention lies the am­ <lb/>
            biguity which gives rise to dispute. ‡</p>
          <p>But all these states are in reality distinct; for an obscure <lb/>
            law is one thing, and an ambiguous law another. 3. Defini­ <lb/>
            tion is concerned with a general question regarding the nature <lb/>
            of a term ; which question may be unconnected with the scope <lb/>
            of a cause ; the state of letter and intention discusses the <lb/>
            meaning of the very word which is in the law ; syllogism tries <lb/>
            to settle what is not in the law ; ambiguity considers a word <lb/>
            under two senses; antinomia is a comparison between two <lb/>
            contradictory laws. 4. This distinction, accordingly, has <lb/>
            been justly admitted by the most learned rhetoricians, and <lb/>
            continues to be observed among the generality of the wisest.</p>
          <p>As to discussions of this kind, though directions on all <lb/>
            points could not be given, yet it has been practicable to give <lb/>
            some. 5. There are other particulars which allow facility for <lb/>
            instruction concerning them only when the subject, on which <lb/>
            we have to speak, is propounded ; for not only § must a whole <lb/>
            cause be divided into its general questions and heads, but <lb/>
            these divisions themselves must also have their own distribution <lb/>
            and arrangement of matter. In the exordium there is some­ <lb/>
            thing first, something second, and so on; and every question <note type="footnote"> * One in regard to each law. </note><note type="footnote"> t Scriptum et voluntas habet in verbis vocis quœstionem ; quod idem <lb/>

            even from the troublesome intrusion of the word vocis. I am also <lb/>
            dissatisfied with the expression idem peti, in regard to antinomia. <lb/>
            Quid tandem petitur ? An ulla quœstio potest peti ? Let some one <lb/>

            and head must have its own disposition of particulars, as <lb/>
            single theses.- 6. For is it possible that he can be thought <lb/>
            sufficiently skilled in arrangement, who, after dividing his <lb/>
            case into these points, whether every kind of reward ought to be <lb/>
            granted to the deliverer oj his country; whether he should be <lb/>
            permitted to take private property; whether a marriage with <lb/>
            whom he pleases should be allowed him; whether a married lady <lb/>
            should be given him; and whether the lady whose case is before <lb/>
            the court, should then, when he has to speak on the first point, <lb/>
            mix up his observations indiscriminately, just as each happens <lb/>
            to come into his head, not knowing that he should consider <lb/>
            first whether we should hold to the letter of a law, or to the <lb/>
            intent of it, that he should make a commencement on this <lb/>
            question, and then, connecting with it what follows, should <lb/>
            arrange the whole of his speech with the same regularity as <lb/>
            the parts of the human body, of which, for example, the hand <lb/>
            is a portion, the fingers a portion of the hand, and the joints <lb/>
            portions of the finger? 7. It is this nicety of arrangement that <lb/>
            a writer on rhetoric cannot teach, unless when he has a certain <lb/>
            and definite subject before him. 8. But what would one or <lb/>
            two examples avail, or even a hundred or a thousand, in a <lb/>
            field that is boundless ? It is the part of a teacher to demon­ <lb/>
            strate day after day, sometimes in one kind of causes and <lb/>
            sometimes in another, what is the proper order and connexion <lb/>
            of particulars, that skill may gradually be acquired by his <lb/>
            pupils, and the power of application to similar cases. 9. All <lb/>
            cannot be taught that art is able to accomplish.! What <lb/>
            painter has learned to copy every object on the face of the <lb/>
            earth ? But when he has once acquired skill in copying, he <lb/>
            will produce a representation of whatever he takes in hand. <lb/>
            What artist in fashioning vases has not produced one such as <lb/>
            he had never seen ?</p>
          <p>Some things, however, depend not on the teachers, but on <lb/>
            the learners. 10. A physician ‡ will teach his pupil what is <lb/>
            to be done in every sort of disease, and what is to be conjec­ <lb/>
            tured from certain symptoms; but it is the pupil's own genius <lb/>
            that must acquire for him the nice faculty of feeling the pulse. <note type="footnote"> * General or indefinite questions.

            of observing the different degrees of heat, and the alterations <lb/>

            cannot be made but when the whole cause is spread as it were <lb/>
            before us, and which tells us when we ought to adopt an <lb/>
            exordium, and when to omit it; when we should make a con­ <lb/>
            tinuous statement of a case, and when a statement subdivided <lb/>
            into heads; when we should begin at the beginning, and <lb/>
            when, after the manner of Homer,t in the middle or towards <lb/>
            the end; 12. when we should make no statement at all; <lb/>
            when we should commence with our own allegations, and when <lb/>
            with those of our adversary; when with the strongest proofs, <lb/>
            when with the weaker; in what sort of cause questions should <lb/>
            be propounded in the introduction; in what causes the way <lb/>
            should be prepared for them by prefatory hints; what the <lb/>
            mind of the judge will be likely to admit if expressed at once, <lb/>
            and to what he must be conducted gradually; whether our <lb/>
            refutation should oppose the arguments of the adversary one <lb/>
            by one, or in a body; whether our appeals to the feelings <lb/>
            should be reserved for the peroration, or diffused through our <lb/>
            whole speech; whether we should speak first of law, or of <lb/>
            equity ; whether we should first charge our opponent with past <lb/>
            offences, or repel them if advanced against ourselves, or <lb/>
            confine our remarks to the points for decision; 13. and, if 8 <lb/>
            cause be complex, what order should be observed in our con­ <lb/>
            duct of it, and what oral or written evidence, of any kind <lb/>
            should be set forth in our regular pleading, or reserved.‡ <lb/>
            This is the virtue as it were of a general, dividing his forces <lb/>
            to meet the various events of war, retaining part to garrison <lb/>
            ortresses or defend cities, and distributing other parts to <lb/>
            collect provisions, to secure passes, and to act by land or by sea <lb/>
            as occasion may require. 14 But such merits in oratory he <note type="footnote"> * Compare iii. 3, 9. + See v. 12, 14. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Reserved for the altercation or discussion, as I suppose. See b. <lb/>

            only will display, to whom all the resources of nature, learning, <lb/>
            and industry, shall be at hand. Let no man expect, therefore, <lb/>
            to be eloquent only by the labour of others. Let him who <lb/>
            would be an orator be assured that he must study early and <lb/>
            late; that he must reiterate his efforts; that he must grow <lb/>
            pale with toil; he must exert his own powers, and acquire his <lb/>
            own method; he must not merely look to principles, but must <lb/>
            have them in readiness to act upon them ; not as if they had <lb/>
            been taught him, but as if they had been born in him. 15. <lb/>
            For art can easily show a way, if there be one ; but art has <lb/>
            done its duty when it sets the resources of eloquence before us; <lb/>
            it is for us to know how to use them.</p>
          <p>16. There remains then only the arrangement of parts; <lb/>
            and in the parts themselves there must be some one thought <lb/>
            first, another second, another third, and so on ; and we must <lb/>
            take care that these thoughts be not merely placed in a <lb/>
            certain order, but that they be also connected one with another, <lb/>
            cohering so closely that no joining may appear between them; <lb/>
            so that they may form a body, and not a mere collection of <lb/>
            members, 17. This object will be attained, if we take care <lb/>
            to observe what is suitable for each place, and study to bring <lb/>
            together words that will not combat but embrace each other. <lb/>
            Thus different things will not seem hurried together from dis­ <lb/>
            tant parts, all strangers one to another, but will unite themselves, <lb/>
            in a sure bond and alliance, with those that precede and those <lb/>
            that follow; and our speech will appear not merely a combination <lb/>
            of phrases, but all of a piece. But I am perhaps proceeding <lb/>
            too far, as the transition from one part to another beguiles me; <lb/>
            and I am gliding imperceptibly from the rules for arrangement <lb/>
            into those for elocution, on which the next book shall formally <lb/>
            enter.</p><pb n="71"/>

          <p>A plain and simple method of teaching to be preferred, § 1—5. Be­ <lb/>
            capitulation of the precepts given in the preceding parts of the <lb/>
            work, 6—12. Style and delivery require more ability and study <lb/>
            than other parts of oratory, 13—15. Excellence in them attained <lb/>
            by study and art, 16, 17. Yet a speaker may be too solicitous <lb/>
            about his language, 18—26. Necessity of practice, 27—30. We <lb/>
            must not always be striving for something greater and higher, 31 <lb/>
            —33.</p>
          <p>I. IN the observations which are thrown together in the last <lb/>
            five books, is comprehended the method of inventing, and of <lb/>
            arranging what we invent; and though to understand this <lb/>
            method thoroughly and in all its parts is necessary to the <lb/>
            attainment of the height of oratorical skill, yet to beginners <lb/>
            it is fit that it be communicated rather in a shorter and <lb/>
            simpler way. 2. For otherwise learners are apt to be deterred <lb/>
            by the difficulties of a study so various and complicated; or <lb/>
            their faculties, at an age when they require to be strength­ <lb/>
            ened, and to be fostered with some degree of indulgence, are <lb/>
            debilitated by being devoted to a task too burdensome for <lb/>
            them ; or they think that, if they acquire skill in these matters <lb/>
            only, they are sufficiently qualified to become truly eloquent; <lb/>
            or, again, as if they were bound to certain fixed laws of <lb/>
            speaking, they shrink from every attempt to do anything for <lb/>
            themselves.. 3. Hence it has happened, as some think, that <lb/>
            those who have been the most diligent writers of rules on the <lb/>
            art, have been farthest from attaining true eloquence.† Yet it <lb/>
            is necessary to point out a way to those who are entering on <lb/>
            the study; but that way should be plain to be pursued, and <lb/>
            easy to be shown. Let the able teacher, therefore, such as I <lb/>
            conceive in my mind, choose the best precepts out of all that <lb/>
            have been given, and communicate at first only such as he <lb/>
            approves, without occupying his time in refuting those of an <lb/>
            opposite kind. Pupils will follow where the master leads, <lb/>
            and, as their minds are strengthened by learning, their judg <lb/>
            ment will also increase. 4. Let them suppose at first that there <lb/>
            is no other road than that by which they are conducted, and <note type="footnote"> * Comp. v. 10, 101. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Comp. ii. 15, 35; iii. 1, 18. </note> <pb n="72"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            qiscover afterwards that it is the best. The principles, how <lb/>
            ever, which writers, by a pertinacious adherence to their <lb/>
            respective opinions, have rendered embarrassing, are in them. <lb/>
            selves by no means obscure or hard to be understood. 5. In <lb/>
            the whole treatment of this art, accordingly, it is more <lb/>
            difficult to decide what to teach, than to teach it when a <lb/>
            decision is made upon it; and in these two departments, <lb/>
            especially, invention and arrangement of matter, there are but <lb/>
            very few general rules, and if be, who is under instruction, <lb/>
            shows no repugnance or inability to attend to them, he will <lb/>
            find the way open to the acquirement of everything else.</p>
          <p>6. I have already spent much labour on this work, with a <lb/>
            view to show that oratory is skill in speaking well; that it is <lb/>
            useful; that it is an art, and a virtue;* that its subjects are <lb/>
            everything on which an orator may be required to speak; <lb/>
            that those subjects lie mostly in three species of oratory, the <lb/>
            demonstrative, the deliberative, and the judicial; that all <lb/>
            speech consists of matter and words; that, as to matter, we <lb/>
            must study invention, as to words, elocution, and as to both <lb/>
            arrangement; all which particulars memory must guard and <lb/>
            delivery recommend. 7. I showed that the duty of an orator <lb/>
            was comprised in the three arts of persuading, exciting, and <lb/>
            pleasing; that, for persuading, statement and argument are <lb/>
            most efficient, and for exciting, appeals to the feelings, which <lb/>
            may be dispersed through the whole of a speech, but should <lb/>
            be used chiefly at the beginning and the end ; while to please, <lb/>
            though it depends on both matter and words, belongs chiefly <lb/>
            to elocution. 8. I observed that some questions are indefinite, <lb/>
            others definite, or limited to the consideration of persons, <lb/>
            places, and occasions ; that in regard to every thing there are <lb/>
            three points to be considered, whether it is, what it is, and <lb/>
            of what nature it is. To these remarks I added that demon­ <lb/>
            strative oratory consists in praising and blaming ; that, in <lb/>
            speaking of a person's character, we must notice what was <lb/>
            done by the person himself of whom we speak, and what took <lb/>
            place after his death,† and that this kind of oratory was em­ <lb/>
            ployed about the honourable and the useful. 9. To delibe­ <lb/>
            rative oratory I observed that a third part t is added, do. <note type="footnote"> <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="INTRODUCTION.]."/><lb/>
            pendent on conjecture, as when we inquire whether that, <lb/>
            which is the subject of our deliberation, is possible, and <lb/>
            whether it is likely to happen. In this department of oratory <lb/>
            too, I said that it ought above all to be considered what is the <lb/>
            character of the speaker, before whom, and on what subject, he <lb/>
            speaks. As to judicial causes, I remarked that some depend <lb/>
            on one point, some on several; that in some a mere attack or <lb/>
            defence is sufficient; and that all defence consists either in <lb/>
            denial, (which is of two kinds, as we may dispute whether the <lb/>
            fact in question really happened or whether that which happened <lb/>
            was of the nature attributed to it,) or in justification, or in <lb/>
            exception.* 10. I added that questions in a cause relate <lb/>
            either to something done, or something written ; that in regard <lb/>
            to anything done, we consider its probability, its nature,! and <lb/>
            its quality, and in respect to anything written, the meaning or <lb/>
            intention of the words; in contemplating which, the nature <lb/>
            of whole causes, criminal and civil,‡ has to be regarded; all <lb/>
            of which§ are included under the heads of letter and intention, <lb/>
            syllogism, ambiguity, or contradictory laws. 11. I stated, <lb/>
            moreover, that in every judicial cause there are five parts; <lb/>
            that the judge is to be conciliated in the exordium ; that the <lb/>
            cause is set forth in the statement of facts, supported by <lb/>
            evidence, and overthrown by refutation ; and that the memory <lb/>
            is to be refreshed, or the feelings excited, in the peroration. <lb/>
            12. To this I added the topics for argument and addresses to <lb/>
            the passions, and showed the means by which judges must be <lb/>
            roused, appeased, or amused.∥ Last of all was subjoined the <lb/>
            method of division. But let him who shall read this work for <lb/>
            improvement feel assured that the course of proceeding laid <lb/>
            down in it is one in which nature ought to do much of <note type="footnote"> strative or epideictic kind, namely, concerning what is honourable and <lb/>

            herself even without learning; so that the various heads of <lb/>
            which I have spoken should seem not so much to have been <lb/>
            invented by teachers, as to have been noticed by them <lb/>
            according as they presented themselves.</p>
          <p>13. What is to follow requires more labour and care, since <lb/>
            I have now to treat of the art of elocution, which is, as all <lb/>
            orators are agreed, the most difficult part of my work; for <lb/>
            Marcus Antonius, of whom I have spoken above,. when he <lb/>
            said that he had seen many good speakers, but none of them <lb/>
            truly eloquent, understood that it is sufficient for a good <lb/>
            speaker to say just what is proper, but to speak in an ornate <lb/>
            style belongs only to the most eloquent. 14. If such <lb/>
            excellence, accordingly, was found in no speaker down to his <lb/>
            time, and not even in himself or in Lucius Crassus, it is <lb/>
            certain that it was wanting in them and in preceding speakers, <lb/>
            only because it was extremely difficult of acquirement. Cicero <lb/>
            himself, indeed, is of opinion, that invention and arrangement <lb/>
            are in the power of any sensible man, but eloquence only in <lb/>
            that of the complete orator; and it was on this account that <lb/>
            he gave his chief attention to the rules for that accomplish­ <lb/>
            ment. 15. That he acted rightly in doing so, is shown by the <lb/>
            very name of the art of which we are speaking; for eloqui, <lb/>
            " to speak forth," is to express whatever has been conceived in <lb/>
            the mind, and to communicate it fully to the hearers; an art, <lb/>
            without which all preceding attainments are useless, like a <lb/>
            sword sheathed and clinging to its scabbard. 16. Eloquence,, <lb/>
            therefore, requires the utmost teaching; no man can attain it <lb/>
            without the aid of art; study must be applied to the acquire­ <lb/>
            ment of it; exercise and imitation must make it their object ; <lb/>
            our whole life must be spent in the pursuit of it; it is in this <lb/>
            that one orator chiefly excels another; it is from this that <lb/>
            some styles of speaking are so much better than others. 17. <lb/>
            For we are not to suppose that the Asiatics†, or other speakers <lb/>
            in any way faulty, were unable to invent matter or to arrange <note type="footnote"> * The last place in which he mentioned Antonius was vii. 3, 16. <lb/>
            This well-known saying of his is to be found in Cic. do Drat. i. 21; <lb/>

            it; or that those whom we call dry* were void of understand­ <lb/>
            ing or perspicacity in their pleadings; but the truth is the <lb/>
            the first wanted judgment and moderation in expressing them <lb/>
            selves, and the second energy; and hence it is evident, that <lb/>
            in expression lie the faults and excellences of oratory.</p>
          <p>18. Yet it is not to be understood that regard is to be paid <lb/>
            only to words, for I must meet and stop those in the very <lb/>
            vestibule as it were, who would take advantage of what I have <lb/>
            just admitted, and who, neglecting to attend to the study of <lb/>
            things, which are the nerves of all causes, consume their lives <lb/>
            in an empty application to words, making it their object to <lb/>
            attain elegance, which is, indeed, in my judgment, an excellent <lb/>
            quality in speaking, but only when it comes naturally, not <lb/>
            when it is affected. 19. Bodies that are in health, with the <lb/>
            blood in a sound state, and strengthened by exercise, have <lb/>
            their beauty from the same causes from which they have their <lb/>
            vigour,! for they are well-complexioned, of a proper tension, <lb/>
            and with muscles fully developed; but if a person should <lb/>
            render them artificially smooth, and paint and deck them in <lb/>
            an effeminate fashion, they would be made eminently repulsive <lb/>
            by the very labour bestowed in beautifying them. 20. A <lb/>
            becoming and magnificent dress, as it is expressed in the <lb/>
            Greek verse,‡ adds dignity to men; but effeminate and lux­ <lb/>
            urious apparel, while it fails to adorn the person, discovers the <lb/>
            depravity of the mind. In like manner the transparent and <lb/>
            variegated style of some speakers deprives their matter, when <lb/>
            clothed in such a garb of words, of all force and spirit.</p>
          <p>I would, therefore, recommend care about words, and the <lb/>
            utmost care about matter. 21. The best words generally <lb/>
            attach themselves to our subject, and show themselves by their <note type="footnote"> * Aridos.] He seems to mean some who wished to be called Attics, <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            own light; but we set ourselves to seek for words, as if they <lb/>
            were always hidden, and trying to keep themselves from being <lb/>
            discovered. We never consider that they are to be found <lb/>
            close to the subject on which we have to speak, but look for <lb/>
            them, in strange places, and do violence to them when we <lb/>
            have found them. 22. It is with a more manly spirit that <lb/>
            Eloquence is to be pursued, who, if she is in vigour through­ <lb/>
            out her frame, will think it no part of her study to polish her <lb/>
            nails and smooth her hair.*</p>
          <p>23. It generally happens that the more attention is paid to <lb/>
            such niceties, the more oratory is deteriorated; t for the best <lb/>
            expressions are such as are least far-fetched, and have an air <lb/>
            of simplicity, appearing to spring from truth itself. Those <lb/>
            which betray care, refuse to appear otherwise than artificial <lb/>
            and studied; they fail to exhibit grace, and do not produce <lb/>
            conviction; besides that t they obscure the sense, and choke <lb/>
            the crop as it were, with a superabundance of herbage. 24. <lb/>
            What may be said simply, we express paraphrastically, from <lb/>
            fondness for words; what has been told sufficiently, we repeat; <lb/>
            what may be clearly signified in one word, we envelope in a <lb/>
            multitude; and we often prefer to intimate our thoughts rather <lb/>
            than express them. Indeed no natural expression now satis­ <lb/>
            fies us, since none appears elegant that another speaker has <lb/>
            used. 25. We borrow tropes or metaphors from the poets <lb/>
            most corrupt in taste, and think that we are witty only when <lb/>
            there is need of wit to understand us. Yet Cicero § had <lb/>
            plainly enough told us, that to depart from the ordinary style <lb/>
            of language, and from the practice sanctioned by universal <lb/>
            reason, is, in speaking, even the greatest of faults. 26. But <lb/>
            Cicero, forsooth, was a harsh and unpolished orator ; and we, <lb/>
            to whom all that nature dictates is contemptible, and who <lb/>
            seek, not ornament, but meretricious finery, know how to <lb/>
            speak better than he; as if there were any excellence in words <lb/>
            except as far as they agree with things; and if we are to make <note type="footnote"> * CapiUum reponere.] When thrown into disorder by the animation <lb/>

            it the object of our whole life, that our words may be nice, and <lb/>
            splendid, and ornate, and properly arranged, the whole fruit <lb/>
            of our studies comes to nothing. 27. Yet we see most of our <lb/>
            speakers hesitating about every word, seeking for expressions, <lb/>
            and weighing and measuring them when they are found. <lb/>
            Even if the sole object of their solicitude were that they <lb/>
            might always use the best words, yet their unhappy care <lb/>
            would deserve to be execrated, as it retards the course of their <lb/>
            speech, and, from hesitation and diffidence, extinguishes the <lb/>
            ardour of imagination. 28. He is but a wretched, and, I may <lb/>
            say, a poor orator, who cannot endure to lose a single word. Yet <lb/>
            not a single word, assuredly, will he lose, who shall first of all <lb/>
            have learned the true principles of eloquence, and shall, by a <lb/>
            long and judicious course of reading, have acquired a copious <lb/>
            supply of words, and attained the art of arranging them; and who, <lb/>
            besides, shall have made himself master of his stores by con­ <lb/>
            stant exercise, so that they may always be at hand and before <lb/>
            his eyes. 29. To him who shall have done this, things and <lb/>
            their names will present themselves at once; but for such <lb/>
            excellence there is need of previous study, and of ability <lb/>
            acquired, and, as it were laid up; for anxiety in seeking, <lb/>
            judging, and comparing words, should be used while we are <lb/>
            learning, not after we have become speakers. Otherwise, as <lb/>
            men who have not secured a fortune have recourse to occa­ <lb/>
            sional expedients, so such speakers, from not having previously <lb/>
            studied sufficiently, will be at a loss for expressions. 30. But <lb/>
            if resources for speaking have been acquired beforehand, they <lb/>
            will be ready for our use, not seeming merely to answer <lb/>
            exigencies, but to attend on our thoughts, and to follow them <lb/>
            as a shadow follows the substance.</p>
          <p>31. Yet in this kind of care we should set bounds to ourselves ; <lb/>
            for when our words are good Latin, significant, elegant, and <lb/>
            properly arranged, why should we labour for anything more ? <lb/>
            But some speakers make no end of dissatisfaction with them. <lb/>
            selves, and of hesitating at almost Avery syllable; speakers <lb/>
            who, when they have found the best terms, are anxious for <lb/>
            something still more antique, far-fetched, and surprising; and <lb/>
            who do not understand that in a speech of which the language <lb/>
            is much extolled, the sense is too little regarded.</p>
          <p>32. Let the greatest possible care, then, be bestowed on expres <lb/>
            sion, provided we bear in mind that nothing is to be done for <pb n="78"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            the sake of words, as words themselves were invented for the sake <lb/>
            of things, and as those words are the most to be commended <lb/>
            which express our thoughts best, and produce the impression <lb/>
            which we desire on the minds of the judges. 33. Such words <lb/>
            undoubtedly must make a speech both worthy of admiration <lb/>
            and productive of pleasure ; but not of that kind of admiration <lb/>
            with which we wonder at monsters ; or of that kind of pleasure <lb/>
            which is attended with unnatural gratification, but such as is <lb/>
            compatible with true merit and worth.</p>

          <p>Style depends on the judicious choice of words, and the judicious com­ <lb/>
            bination of them. Necessity of studying to speak pure Latin.</p>
          <p>1. WHAT the Greeks, then, call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕράσις</foreign>, we call in Latin <lb/>
            elocutio, "elocution." We judge of it in regard to words <lb/>
            taken either singly or in conjunction. In reference to words <lb/>
            considered singly, we must take care that they be Latin, <lb/>
            intelligible, elegant, and appropriate to that which we wish to <lb/>
            express; in regard to words in conjunction, we must see that <lb/>
            they be correct, well arranged, and diversified occasionally with <lb/>
            figures. 2. What was necessary to be said, however, on the <lb/>
            subject of speaking in pure Latin and with correctness, I <lb/>
            stated in the first book,. when I was treating on grammar. <lb/>
            But there I only observed that words should not be impure; <lb/>
            here it will not be improper to intimate that they should have <lb/>
            nothing provincial or foreign about them; for we may find <lb/>
            many authors t not deficient in the arts of style, who, we should <lb/>
            say, express themselves rather affectedly than in pure Latin; <lb/>
            as the Athenian old woman called Theophrastus, a man other­ <lb/>
            wise of great eloquence, a stranger, from observing his affected <lb/>
            use of a single word, and being questioned on the subject, <lb/>
            replied that she had discovered him to be a foreigner only from <lb/>
            his speaking in a manner too Attic.‡ 3 In Livy, again, a <note type="footnote"> * C. 4—6. </note><note type="footnote"> + As Tertullian, Apuleius, Capella, Macrobius. Pithœus. </note><note type="footnote"> t Quintilian relates this anecdote more fully than Cicero, Brut. a. <lb/>

          <p>Propriety of words; words are proper in more than one sense, § 1—3. <lb/>
            A word which may not be exactly proper, is not always to be <lb/>
            condemned as improper, 4— 6. Some words may be proper, and <lb/>
            yet have no oratorical merit, 7, 8. The excellence of significancy, <lb/>
            9—11. Concerning obscurity, 12,13. Arises from the use of unusual <lb/>
            words, or from faulty composition, 14—16. From circumlocution, <lb/>
            17, 18. From desire for brevity, 19—21. Perspicuity the chief <lb/>
            excellence of language, 22—24.</p>
          <p>1. Perspicuity in words arises from a certain propriety; <lb/>
            but the word propriety itself is taken in more than one sense; <lb/>
            for its first acceptation signifies the exact term for a thing, <lb/>
            which term we shall not always use; for we shall avoid such <lb/>
            as are obscene, or offensive, or mean. 2. Mean terms are <lb/>
            such are beneath the dignity of a subject, or of the persons to <lb/>
            whom we address ourselves. † But in avoiding meanness some <lb/>
            speakers are in the habit of running into a very great error, as <lb/>
            they shrink from all terms that are in common use, even <lb/>
            though the necessity of their subject calls for them ; as he, <lb/>
            for example, who, in pleading a cause, spoke of an Iberian <lb/>
            shrub, of which he himself would alone have known the mean­ <lb/>
            ing, had not Cassius Severus, in derision of his folly, observed <lb/>
            that he meant to say Spanish broom. 3. Nor do I see why an <lb/>
            eminent orator should have thought that duratos muria pisces, <lb/>
            “ fishes preserved in pickle," was more elegant than the very <lb/>
            word which he avoided.‡ But in that sort of propriety, which <lb/>
            uses the exact word for everything, there is no merit; though <lb/>
            that which is contrary to it is a fault, and is called with <note type="footnote"> * I. 5, 56. </note><note type="footnote">t Ordinis.] I follow Rellin's interpretation of this word. The <lb/>
            expression, as Spalding remarks, should have been more full. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Namely Salsamenta. It is not known who either cf these orators <lb/>
            was. </note> <pb n="80"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            us improprium, and in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄϰϱυον</foreign>, "impropriety," as in <lb/>
            Virgil,* tantum sperare dolorem, " to hope so great pain." 4. <lb/>
            Or the expression in the speech of Dolabella,t which I have <lb/>
            found corrected by Cicero, mortem ferre; or such as are <lb/>
            now extolled by some people, decernere, verba ceciderunt.‡ <lb/>
            Yet a word which is not proper will not necessarily be charge <lb/>
            able with the fault of impropriety; because, above all, there <lb/>
            are many things, both in Greek and Latin, that have no <lb/>
            proper term. 5. He who hurls jaculum, “ a javelin," is said <lb/>
            jaculari, but he who hurls pilum, “ a lance," or sudes, “ a <lb/>
            stake," finds no word peculiarly assigned to the act; and <lb/>
            though it is manifest that lapidare means “ to throw stones," <lb/>
            the throwing of clods or tiles has no peculiar term. Hence <lb/>
            what is called catachresis, the abuse of words, becomes neces­ <lb/>
            sary. 6. Metaphor, too, in which much of the ornament of <lb/>
            speech consists, applies words to things to which they do not <lb/>
            properly belong. Hence the propriety of which we are speak <lb/>
            ing, relates, not to a word absolutely, but to the sense in which <lb/>
            it is used, and is to be estimated, not by the ear, but by the <lb/>
            mind.</p>
          <p>7. In the second place, when several things come under the <lb/>
            same term, that is called the proper sense of the term from which <lb/>
            all the other senses are derived ; as the word vertex signifies <lb/>
            water whirling round, or whatever is whirled round in a <lb/>
            similar manner; hence, from the twisting round of the hair, <lb/>
            it means the top of the head ; and, from its application to the <lb/>
            head, it came to signify the highest peak of a hill. We very <lb/>
            rightly call all these things vertices, but properly that to which <lb/>
            it was first applied. So it is with soleœ and turdi, names of <lb/>
            fishes. § <note type="footnote"> * An. iv. 419. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero was his instructor in the art of speaking, as he was Cicero's <lb/>
            in the ars cœnandi. Ep. ad Div. ix. 16; compare Quint. xi. 11, 6.— <lb/>
            In what sense the words mortem ferre were ased by Dolabella, no critic <lb/>
            has been able to decide. I suppose the ferre was used with the same <lb/>
            kind of impropriety as sperare by Virgil. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ We should attempt in vain to find out the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκυϱολογία</foreign> in these <lb/>
            words. Conjectures have been offered, but without foundation. <lb/>
            Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> § The solea, “ sole," is a flat fish, named from its similarity to the <lb/>
            sole of the foot; the turdus was a fish found about rocks, and was so <lb/>
            named from some resemblance to the thrush. Turnebus. Perhaps the <lb/>
            resemblance was in colour. </note> <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><pb n="81"/>
            </p>
          <p>8. There is also a third sort of propriety, the reverse of the <lb/>
            second, when a thing, common to many purposes, has a pecu­ <lb/>
            liar sense as applied to one of them; as a funeral song is <lb/>
            called nœmia,* and a general's tent augurale.† Also, a term <lb/>
            which is common to many things, may be applied in a pre- <lb/>
            eminent sense to some one of them; as we say “ the city," for <lb/>
            Rome, "venales" for newly-purchased slaves, and “Corinthian” <lb/>
            for Corinthian brass; though there are many other cities, <lb/>
            many other things to which venales may be applied, and there <lb/>
            are Corinthian gold and silver as well as brass. But in such a <lb/>
            use of terms there is no peculiar exhibition of the ability of <lb/>
            the orator. 9. There is a kind of propriety, however, which is <lb/>
            greatly to be admired, and for which anything is extolled that <lb/>
            is said with peculiar effect, that is, with the utmost possible <lb/>
            significancy; as Cato said that Julius Cœsar applied himself <lb/>
            soberly to overthrow the republic ;‡ or as Virgil§ says deductum <lb/>
            carmen, “ a humble strain," and Horace acrem tibiam, "a shrill <lb/>
            pipe," and Hannibalem dirum, “ dire Hannibal.”∥ ] 0. Under <lb/>
            this kind of propriety is mentioned by some the appositeness <lb/>
            of characteristic words, which are called epithets, as dulce <lb/>
            musturn, " sweet new wine," and Cum dentibus albis, " with <lb/>
            white teeth. ”¶ Of this species of propriety I shall speak in <lb/>
            another place.** Terms that are happily applied in metaphor <lb/>
            are also frequently called proper. 11. Sometimes, too, a term <lb/>
            that is eminently characteristic of a person is called proper to <lb/>
            him ; thus Fabius, among his many military virtues, was <lb/>
            called Cunctator, “ the Delayer." <note type="footnote"> * Nœnia was properly any rude and trifling song, but was at length <lb/>
            peculiarly restricted to the sense of funeral dirge. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote">t Various things were done in the general's tent, but it bad its <lb/>
            name from augurium, "augury," because the auspices were taken <lb/>
            there. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Suetonius, in his Life of Julius Caesar, c. 53, says that he used to <lb/>
            drink but little wine, and that Cato said he was the only man who <lb/>
            applied himself soberly to overthrow the government. The word <lb/>
            sober was intended by Cato as very expressive, denoting all the care, <lb/>
            meditation, and forethought that are observable in sober persons. <lb/>
            Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> § Eel. vi. 5. Deductum means tenue, humile, below the dignity of <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Words that signify more than they actually express, might <lb/>
            seem to be fitly mentioned under the head of perspicuity, as <lb/>
            they assist the understanding; but I would rather place <lb/>
            emphasis among the ornaments of speech, because it does not <lb/>
            merely tend to make what is said understood, but causes more <lb/>
            to be understood than what is said.</p>
          <p>12 On the other hand, obscurity arises from the adoption of <lb/>
            1 words remote from common use; as, for example, if a person <lb/>
            should search into the commentaries of the pontiffs, the most <lb/>
            ancient treaties, and the writings of obsolete authors,. and <lb/>
            make it his object that what he extracted from thence should <lb/>
            not be understood. By such means some affect a character <lb/>
            for erudition, endeavouring to prove themselves the only <lb/>
            persons who comprehend certain subjects. 13. Words, too, <lb/>
            that are more familiar to certain districts than to others, or <lb/>
            peculiar to certain arts, produce obscurity, as, the wind Atabu­ <lb/>
            lus,t the ship Saccaria;‡ and In malaco sanum;§ such expres­ <lb/>
            sions must either be avoided before a judge who is ignorant of <lb/>
            their meaning, or must be explained, as is the case with terms <lb/>
            that are called homonyma; as with regard to the word Taurus, <lb/>
            for example, it cannot be understood, unless it be specified <lb/>

            the name of a man, or the root of a tree.∥</p>
          <p>14. Yet still greater obscurity arises in the construction <lb/>
            f and concatenation of words, and there are still more sources of <lb/>
            it. Let our periods, therefore, never be so long that attention <note type="footnote"> * Comp. i. 6, 40 ; Cic. de Orat. ii. 12; Hor. Epist. ii. 1, 23. At the <lb/>

            cannot sustain itself throughout them; nor so clogged by <lb/>
            transpositions of phrases, that the end of the sense is not to <lb/>
            be discovered till we reach the end of a hyperbaton.* A still <lb/>
            worse fault than these is a confused mixture of words, as in <lb/>
            the verse, <lb/>
            Saxa meant Itali mediis quæ in fluctibus aras,† <lb/>
            Rocks which th' Italians altars call, amid <lb/>
            The waves.</p>
          <p>15. By parenthesis, also, (which both orators and historians <lb/>
            frequently use, to interpose some remark in the middle of a <lb/>
            period,‡) the sense is generally embarrassed, unless what is <lb/>
            inserted be very brief. Thus Virgil, in the passage where he <lb/>
            describes a young horse, after having said, <lb/>
            Nec vanos horret strepitus, <lb/>
            Nor dreads he empty noises, <lb/>
            and after having interposed some remarks in another form,§ <lb/>
            returns, at the fifth verse following, to his first thought, <lb/>
            Tum si qua sonum procul arma dedêre, <lb/>
            Stare loco nesCit, <lb/>
            Then, if but distant arms give forth a clang, <lb/>
            How to stand still he knows not.</p>
          <p>16. But above all we must avoid ambiguity, not only that <lb/>
            species of it of which I have spoken above,|| and which ren­ <lb/>
            ders the meaning doubtful, as Chremetem audivi percussisse <lb/>
            Demean, but also that sort which, though it cannot perplex <lb/>
            the sense, yet, as far as words are concerned, runs into the <lb/>
            same fault with the other; for instance, if a person should <lb/>
            say, visum a se hominem librum scribentem; for though it is <lb/>
            certain that the book was being written by the man, yet the <lb/>
            speaker would have put his words badly together, and ren­ <lb/>
            dered them ambiguous as far as was in his power.</p>
          <p>17. In some writers, also, there are clouds of empty words; <note type="footnote"> * See c. 6, sect. 62. </note><note type="footnote">t An. i. 109. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Quintilian at once describes and exemplifies the parenthesis. <lb/>

            for white they shrink from common forms of expression, and <lb/>
            are attracted by a fancied appearance of beauty, they involve <lb/>
            all their thoughts, which they are unwilling to express straight­ <lb/>
            forwardly, in verbose circumlocutions, and joining one of these <lb/>
            tissues of words to another of a similar character, and mixing <lb/>
            up others with them, they extend their periods to a length to <lb/>
            which no breath can hold out. 18. Some labour even to <lb/>
            attain this fault, a fault by no means of recent date; as I find <lb/>
            in Livy * that there was a teacher in his day who exhorted his <lb/>
            scholars to obscure what they said, using the Greek word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σϰότισον</foreign> : and from whom, I should suppose, proceeded that <lb/>
            extraordinary eulogium, So much the better; even I myself <lb/>
            cannot understand it.</p>
          <p>19. Some, again, too studious of brevity, exclude from their <lb/>
            periods words necessary, even to the sense; and, as if it were <lb/>
            7 enough for themselves to know what they wish to say, are <lb/>
            regardless how far it concerns others to understand them; for <lb/>
            my own part, I call that composition abortive, which the <lb/>
            reader has to understand by the exertion of his own ability ;t <lb/>
            others, interchanging words perversely, secure the same fault <lb/>
            through the aid of figures. 20. But the worst kind of ob­ <lb/>
            scurity is that which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδιανόητον</foreign>, that is, when <lb/>
            words that are plain in one sense, have another sense con­ <lb/>
            cealed in them; as Conductus est cæcus secus viam stare ;‡ and <lb/>
            as he who tore his body with his teeth is represented in the <lb/>
            schools, supra se cubâsse, as having lain upon himself.§ 21. Such <lb/>
            ingenious and daring phraseology is thought eloquent because <lb/>
            of its ambiguity; and there is an opinion now prevalent with <lb/>
            many, that they ought to think that only elegantly and ex­ <lb/>
            quisitely expressed which requires to be interpreted. But <lb/>
            it is pleasing also to certain hearers, who, when they find <lb/>
            out the meaning of it, are delighted with their own pene­ <note type="footnote"> * In the letter, doubtless, which is mentioned ii. 5, 20. </note><note type="footnote"> t Not through the perspicuity of the writer or speaker.

            tration, and applaud themselves as if they had not heard <lb/>
            but invented it.</p>
          <p>With me, however, let the first virtue of composition be <lb/>
            perspicuity; let there be proper words, and a clear order; let <lb/>
            not the conclusion of the sense be too long protracted; and let <lb/>
            there be nothing either deficient or superfluous. Thus will our <lb/>
            language both deserve the commendation of the learned, and <lb/>
            be intelligible to the unlearned.</p>
          <p>These observations refer to perspicuity in our words; for <lb/>
            how perspicuity in our matter is to be secured, I have shown <lb/>
            in my rules concerning the statement of cases.* 23. But the <lb/>
            case is similar with regard to both; for if we say neither less <lb/>
            nor more than we ought, nor anything ill-arranged or indistinct, <lb/>
            what we state will be clear, and intelligible even to the mode­ <lb/>
            rately attentive hearer. We must bear in mind, indeed, that <lb/>
            the attention of the judge is not always so much on the alert <lb/>
            as to dispel of itself the obscurity of our language, and to <lb/>
            throw the light of his intellect on our darkness, but that he is <lb/>
            often distracted by a multiplicity of other thoughts, which will <lb/>
            prevent him from understanding us, unless what we say be so <lb/>
            clear that its sense will strike his mind as the rays of the sun <lb/>
            strike the eyes, even though his. attention be not immediately <lb/>
            fixed upon it. 24. We must, therefore, take care, not merely that <lb/>
            he may understand us, but that he may not be able not to <lb/>
            understand us. It is for this reason that we often repeat what <lb/>
            we fancy that those who are trying the cause may not have <lb/>
            sufficiently comprehended; using such phrases as, That part <lb/>
            of Cur cause, which, through my fault, has been stated but <lb/>
            obscurely, etc., on which account I shall have recourse to <lb/>
            plainer and more common language; since, when we pretend, <lb/>
            occasionally, that we have not fully succeeded, the admission <lb/>
            is sure to be well received from us. <note type="footnote"> * Book iv. a. 2. </note></p><pb n="86"/>

          <p>1. I COME now to the subject of embellishment, in which <lb/>
            doubtless, more than in any other department of oratory, the <lb/>
            speaker is apt to give play to his fancy. For the praise of <lb/>
            such as speak merely with correctness and perspicuity is but <lb/>
            small; since they are thought rather to have avoided faults <lb/>
            than to have attained any great excellence. 2. Invention of <lb/>
            matter is often common to the orator and to the illiterate <lb/>
            alike ; arrangement may be considered to require but mode­ <lb/>
            rate learning; and whatever higher arts are used, are generally <lb/>
            concealed, or they would cease to deserve the name of art; <lb/>
            and all these qualities are directed to the support of causes <lb/>
            alone. But by polish and embellishment of style the orator <lb/>
            recommends himself to his auditors in his proper character ; <lb/>
            in his other efforts he courts the approbation of the learned, <lb/>
            in this the applause of the multitude. 3. Cicero, in pleading the <lb/>
            cause of Cornelius,* fought with arms that were not only stout, <lb/>
            but dazzling; nor would he, merely by instructing the judge, <lb/>
            or by speaking to the purpose and in pure Latin and with <lb/>
            perspicuity, have caused the Roman people to testify their <note type="footnote"> * See iv. 3,13. ' </note> <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/> <lb/>
            admiration of him not only by acclamations, but even tumults <lb/>
            of applause. It was the sublimity, magnificence, splendour, <lb/>
            and dignity of his eloquence, that drew forth that thunder of <lb/>
            approbation. 4. No such extraordinary commendation would <lb/>
            have attended on the speaker, if his speech had been of an <lb/>
            every-day character, and similar to ordinary speeches. I even <lb/>
            believe that his audience were insensible of what they were <lb/>
            doing, and that they gave their applause neither voluntarily <lb/>
            nor with any exercise of judgment, but that, being carried <lb/>
            away by enthusiasm, and unconscious of the place in which <lb/>
            they stood, they burst forth instinctively into such transports <lb/>
            of delight.</p>
          <p>5. But this grace of style may contribute in no small degree <lb/>
            to the success of a cause ; for those who listen with pleasure <lb/>
            are both more attentive and more ready to believe; they arc <lb/>
            very frequently captivated with pleasure, and sometimes hur­ <lb/>
            ried away in admiration. Thus the glitter of a sword strikes .: <lb/>
            something of terror into the eyes, and thunderstorms them­ <lb/>
            selves would not alarm us so much as they do if it were their <lb/>
            force only, and not also their flame, that was dreaded. 6. Cicero, <lb/>
            accordingly, in one of his letters to Brutus,* makes with good <lb/>
            reason the following remark: That eloquence which excites no <lb/>
            admiration, I account as nothing. Aristotle,t also, thinks <lb/>
            that to excite admiration should be one of our greatest objects.</p>
          <p>But let the embellishment of our style (for I will repeat <lb/>
            what I said‡) be manly, noble, and chaste; let it not affect <lb/>
            effeminate delicacy, or a complexion counterfeited by paint, <lb/>
            but let it glow with genuine health and vigour. 7. Such <lb/>
            is the justice of this rule, that though, in ornament, vices <lb/>
            closely border on virtues, yet those who adopt what is <lb/>
            vicious, disguise it with the name of some virtue. Let no one <lb/>
            of those, therefore, who indulge in a vicious style, say that I <lb/>
            am an enemy to those who speak with good taste. I do not <lb/>
            deny that judicious embellishment is an excellence., but I do <lb/>
            not allow that excellence to them. 8. Should I think a piece <lb/>
            of land better cultivated, in which the owner should show mo <lb/>
            lilies, and violets, and anemones, and fountains playing, than <lb/>
            one in which there is a plentiful harvest, or vines laden with <note type="footnote"> * Now lost: see ii. 20, 9. </note><note type="footnote"> t Rhet. iii. 2, 5 ; see also Longinus, sect. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See the introduction to this book, sect. 19. </note> <pb n="88"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            grapes? Should I prefer barren plane trees, or clipped myr­ <lb/>
            tIes, to elms embraced with vines, and fruitful olive-trees? <lb/>
            The rich may have such unproductive gratifications; but what <lb/>
            would they be, if they had nothing else ?</p>
          <p>9. Shall not beauty, then, it may be asked, be regarded in the <lb/>
            planting of fruit-trees ? Undoubtedly ; I would arrange my <lb/>
            trees in a certain order, and observe regular intervals between <lb/>
            them. What is more beautiful than the well-known quin­ <lb/>
            cunx,* which, in whatever direction you view it, presents <lb/>
            straight lines? But a regular arrangment of trees is of <lb/>
            advantage to their growth, as each of them then attracts an <lb/>
            equal portion of the juices of the soil. 10. The tops of my <lb/>
            olive, that rise too high, I shall lop off with my knife; it will <lb/>
            spread itself more gracefully in a round form, and will at the <lb/>
            same time produce fruit from more branches. The horse that <lb/>
            has thin flanks is thought handsomer than one of a different <lb/>
            shape, and is also more swift. The athlete, whose muscles <lb/>
            have been developed by exercise, is pleasing to the sight, and <lb/>
            is so much the better prepared for the combat. 11. True <lb/>
            beauty is never separate from utility.! But to perceive this <lb/>
            requires but a moderate portion of sagacity.</p>
          <p>What is of more importance to be observed, is, that the <lb/>
            graceful dress of our thoughts is still more becoming when <lb/>
            varied with the nature of the subject. Recurring to our first <lb/>
            division, we may remark that the same kind of embellish­ <lb/>
            ment will not be alike suitable for demonstrative, deliberative, <lb/>
            and judicial topics. The first of these three kinds, adapted <lb/>
            only for display, has no object but the. pleasure of the audience; <lb/>
            and it accordingly discloses all the resources of art, and all <lb/>
            the pomp of language; it is not intended to steal into the <lb/>
            mind, or to secure a victory, but strives only to gain applause <lb/>
            and honour. 12. Whatever, therefore, may be attractive in <lb/>
            conception, elegant in expression, pleasing in figures, rich in <lb/>
            metaphor, or polished in composition, the orator, like a dealer, <lb/>
            as it were, in eloquence, will lay before his audience for them <lb/>
            to inspect, and almost to handle; for his success entirely con­ <note type="footnote"> * See Virgil, Georg. ii. 277, 283; Cicero do Senect. c. 17 ; Xen. <lb/>

            cerns his reputation, and not his cause. 13. But when a <lb/>
            serious affair is in question, and there is a contest in real <lb/>
            earnest, anxiety for mere applause should be an orator's last <lb/>
            concern. Indeed no speaker, where important interests are <lb/>
            involved, should be very solicitous about his words. I do not <lb/>
            mean to say that no ornaments of dress should be bestowed on <lb/>
            such subjects, but that they should be as it were more close­ <lb/>
            fitting and severe, and thus display themselves less; and they <lb/>
            should be, above all, well adapted to the subject. 14. In deli­ <lb/>
            berations the senate expects something more elevated, the <lb/>
            people something more spirited; and, in judicial pleadings, <lb/>
            public and capital causes require a more exact style than ordi­ <lb/>
            nary ; but as for private causes, and disputes about small sums, <lb/>
            which are of frequent occurrence, simple language, the very <lb/>
            reverse of that which is studied, will be far more suitable for <lb/>
            them. Would not a speaker be ashamed to seek the recovery <lb/>
            of a petty loan in elaborate periods ? Or to display violent <lb/>
            feeling in speaking of a gutter? Or to perspire over a suit <lb/>
            about taking back a slave ?+</p>
          <p>15. But let us pursue our subject; and, as the embellish­ <lb/>
            ment, as well as the perspicuity of language, depends either <lb/>
            on the choice of single words, or on the combination of several <lb/>
            together, let us consider what care they require separately, <lb/>
            and what in conjunction. Though it has been justly said that <lb/>
            perspicuity is better promoted by proper words, and em­ <lb/>
            bellishment by such as are metaphorical, we should feel <lb/>
            certain, at the same time, that whatever is improper cannot <lb/>
            embellish. 16 But as several words often signify the same <lb/>
            thing, (and are called synonymous,) some of those words will <lb/>
            be more becoming, or sublime, or elegant, or pleasing, or of <lb/>
            better sound, than others; for as syllables formed of the better <lb/>
            sounding letters are clearer, so words formed of such syllables <lb/>
            are more melodious ; and the fuller the sound of a word, the <lb/>
            more agreeable it is to the ear; and what the junction of <note type="footnote"> *Circa stillicidia.] See Cicero Orat. c. 21. From the ancient writers <lb/>
            it would appear that there were constant lawsuits about stillicidia. <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            syllables effects, the junction of words effects also, proving <lb/>
            that some words sound better in combination than others.</p>
          <p>17, But words are to be variously used. To subjects of a <lb/>
            repulsive character words that are harsh in sound are the <lb/>
            more suitable. In general, however, the best words, con­ <lb/>
            sidered singly, are such as have the fullest - or most agreeable <lb/>
            sound. Elegant, too, are always to be preferred to coarse <lb/>
            words; and for mean ones there is no place in polished style. <lb/>
            18. Such as are of a striking or elevated character are to be <lb/>
            estimated according to their suitableness to our subject. <lb/>
            That which appears sublime on one occasion, may seem tumid <lb/>
            on another; and what appears mean when applied to a lofty <lb/>
            subject, may adapt itself excellently to one of an inferior <lb/>
            nature. In an elevated style a low word is remarkable, and, <lb/>
            as it were, a blemish ; and in like manner a grand or splendid <lb/>
            word is unsuited to a plain style, and is in bad taste, as being <lb/>
            like a tumour on a smooth surface.</p>
          <p>19. Some words are to be estimated, not so much by reason, <lb/>
            as by taste; as in the phrase, <lb/>
            — Cœsd jungebant feedera porsâ, ‡ <lb/>
            which the invention of a word has rendered elegant; for if <lb/>
            porco had been used, it would have been mean. In others the <lb/>
            reason for their use is plain. We lately laughed, and with <lb/>
            justice, at a poet who said <lb/>
            Prœtextam in cistâ mures rosere camilli,‡ <lb/>
            The dwarfish mice the gown within the chest <lb/>
            Had gnawed; <lb/>
            20. but we admire the expression of Virgil, <lb/>
            Saepe exiguus mus,§ <lb/>
            Oft has the tiny mouse, &amp;c.; <note type="footnote"> * Maximè exclamant.] That is, are vocalissima, maximè sonora. <lb/>
            Capperonier. Compare ix. 4, 137. </note><note type="footnote"> t Æn. viii. 641. But the word porca occurs in Horace, Od. iii. 23, <lb/>
            4; also in Cato R. R. 134; and Cicero de Leg. ii. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Who the poet was, is unknown. Spalding. Burmann and Fac­ <lb/>
            ciolati seem rightly to suppose that the writer used camiUi for " little," <lb/>
            as Camillus sometimes signified a little boy. Gesner and Spalding <lb/>
            take it as the genitive of the proper name Camillus. But if it were <lb/>
            so, there would be ground for comparison between the unknown <lb/>
            poet's verse and that of Virgil. </note><note type="footnote"> § Georg. i. 181. </note> <pb n="91"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/><lb/>
            far the epithet exiguus, happily applied,- causes us not to <lb/>
            expect too much; the singular number, also, is preferable to <lb/>
            the plural; and the monosyllabic termination, which is uncom­ <lb/>
            mon, gives additional beauty. Horace has accordingly imitated <lb/>
            Virgil in both these points : <lb/>
            — Nascetur ridiculus mus,† <lb/>
            A paltry mouse will be produced.</p>
          <p>21. Our language indeed is not always to be elevated, <lb/>
            but sometimes to be depressed. Humility in our words <lb/>
            sometimes gives of itself greater force to what we say. When <lb/>
            Cicero, in speaking against Piso, exclaims, “ When your whole <lb/>
            family is drawn in a tumbril," does he not seem to have pur­ <lb/>
            posely adopted a mean word, and to have thrown, by the use <lb/>
            of it, increased contempt on the man whom he wished to <lb/>
            humble ? And in another place he says, “ You present your <lb/>
            head to your adversary, butting with him.”‡ 22. From such <lb/>
            sources come jokes that please the illiterate ; as these in <lb/>
            Cicero, “ The little boy, that slept with his elder sister;”§ <lb/>
            " Cneius Flavius, who put out the eyes of the crows ;”|| and, in <lb/>

            aptum, but appositum is useless when epitheton precedes. Perhaps it <lb/>

            might be done in the courts. See Livy, ix. 46. " To put out the eyes <lb/>
            of crows," says Philander, " signified to defeat cunning men, (that is, <lb/>
            in this case, the lawyers,) by cunning." It was a proverbial expression, <lb/>
            as appears from Macrobius, Sat. vii. 5, tamquam cornix cornici oculos <lb/>

            Such humiliation of style is however still more remarkable in <lb/>
            our school declamations, and, when I was a boy, such expres­ <lb/>
            sions as “ Give your father bread," and, in reference to the <lb/>
            same person, " You keep even a dog," used to be extolled.† <lb/>
            23. But the practice, though frequently the cause of laughter <lb/>
            is dangerous, especially in the schools, ‡ and more than ever at <lb/>
            the present time, when the exercise of declamation, being <lb/>
            greatly at variance with reality, suffers from a ridiculous <lb/>
            fastidiousness about words, and has excluded from its lan­ <lb/>
            guage a great portion of the Latin tongue.</p>
          <p>24. Words are proper,§ newly coined, or metaphorical. To <lb/>
            proper words antiquity adds dignity; for old words, such as <lb/>
            every writer would not think of using, render language more <lb/>
            majestic and venerable ; and of this kind of ornament Virgil, <lb/>
            an author of extremely fine taste, has pre-eminently availed <lb/>
            himself. 25. The words olli, and quianam, and mis,|| and <lb/>
            pone,¶ strike the reader of his poetry, and throw over it that <lb/>
            authority of antiquity, which is so highly pleasing in pictures, <lb/>
            and is unattainable by art. But we must use such words with <lb/>
            moderation, and not extract them from the remotest darkness <lb/>
            of past ages. Satis is old enough; what necessity is there, I <lb/>
            would ask, for substituting oppid<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign>, of which preceding writers, <lb/>
            even in our own day, made use occasionally ? I suspect that <lb/>
            nobody would now allow us to use it; antigerio** assuredly, of <lb/>
            which the signification is the same, no writer would use, unless <lb/>
            he wished to make himself remarkable. 26. What need is <note type="footnote"> * Of the speech for Varenus only some fragments remain; it is <lb/>

            short, almost all our language has undergone change. 27 <lb/>
            Some old words, however, still appear more pleasing from their <lb/>
            antiquity ; some are at times adopted from necessity, as <lb/>
            nuncupare and fari; and many others may be introduced with <lb/>
            a little venturesomeness, provided that no affectation be appa­ <lb/>
            rent in the use of them ; a fault which Virgil ridicules with <lb/>
            wonderful effect in the following epigram : <lb/>
            28. Corinthiorum amator iste verborum, <lb/>
            Thucydides Britannus, Atticœ febres, <lb/>
            Tau Gallicum, min, al, spinœ male illisit. <lb/>

          <p>29. The person on whom it was made was Cimber, by whom <lb/>
            it was signified in the words of Cicero, Germanum Cimber <lb/>
            occidit, || that his brother was killed. Sallust is also attacked <lb/>
            in an epigram equally well known : <lb/>
            Et verba antiqui multum furate Catonis, <lb/>
            Crispe, Jugurthinæ conditor histories ; <lb/>
            " And thou, 0 Crispus, the author of the history of Jugurtha; <note type="footnote"> * Yet ærumnæ is used by Cicero and Ovid, as Burmann remarks. </note><note type="footnote"> t Horridum reor.] “ I know not," says Burmann, " whether we <lb/>

            several times by Cicero, Ovid, and Virgil; but perhaps Quintilian's <lb/>
            "horridum " refers to the sound of the canine letter at the beginning <lb/>

            Ausonius's Grammaticomastix, 349. Corinthian words in the first <lb/>
            verse are supposed by Spalding and others to mean “ scarce words,* <lb/>
            outré and far-fetched, in allusion to Corinthian brass. Thucydides <lb/>
            Britannus, as Gesner says, seems to indicate that Cimber wrote some­ <lb/>
            thing about Britain, perhaps in a style meant to emulate that of <lb/>
            Thucydides. Atticæ febres Spalding supposes to mean feverish attempts <lb/>
            at Attic eloquence. The last line, “ So he mixed all those words for <lb/>
            his brother, is an allusion to the poison which he is said to have <lb/>

            an offensive kind of affectation; it is easy to any one; and it is <lb/>
            so much the worse, as he who indulges in it- will not suit his <lb/>
            words to his matter, but will seek extraneous matter to which <lb/>
            his obsolete words may be applied.</p>
          <p>To invent words, as I observed in the first book,! has been <lb/>
            more largely allowed to the Greeks, who have not hesitated to <lb/>
            form words significant of certain sounds and impressions on <lb/>
            the senses,‡ using a liberty like that with which the earliest <lb/>
            inhabitants of the earth gave appellations to things. 31. But <lb/>
            our countrymen, though they have made some few attempts in <lb/>
            composition and derivation, have scarcely attained full success <lb/>
            in their efforts. I remember that when I was very young, it <lb/>
            was a subject of discussion between Pomponius§ and Seneca <lb/>
            even in their prefaces,|| whether gradus eliminate " advances <lb/>
            his steps over the threshold,”¶ was a proper expression. But <lb/>
            our forefathers did not hesitate to say expectorat ;** and <lb/>
            exanimat is certainly of the same stamp. 32. Of derivation and <lb/>
            formation there are such examples as beatitas and beatitudo in <lb/>
            Cicero,†† which he himself indeed considers harsh, but thinks <lb/>
            that they may grow less repulsive by use. Certain derivatives <lb/>
            have been formed, too, not only from common words, but from <lb/>
            proper names, as SuUaturit by Cicero, ‡ ‡ and Fimbriatum and <lb/>
            Figulatum by Asinius Pollio.§§ 33. Many new words have <note type="footnote"> * Rei studiosus.] For rei Spalding very justly supposes that we <lb/>

            but recently come into use, since Messala first used reatus, "the <lb/>

            sense of “ witty," Cicero thought new; for, in a letter to <lb/>

            favorem; in consilium advocabo, and in a letter to Appius <lb/>

            " compliance," was first used by Terence; § and Cæcilius <lb/>
            says that the expression albenti cœlo, " the heaven growing <lb/>
            clear," originated with Sisenna.|| Hortensius appears to have <lb/>
            first used cervix in the singular ;¶ for the ancients have it in the <lb/>
            plural. We may, therefore, make attempts; for I do not agree <lb/>
            with Celsus, who does not admit that words may be invented <lb/>
            by the orator. 36. Since,-when some words, as Cicero <lb/>
            says,** are primitive, that is, used in their original sense, and <lb/>
            others derived, or formed from the primitive,—though it may <lb/>
            not be allowable for us to coin new words, different from those <lb/>
            which the first men, however barbarous, invented, yet at what <note type="footnote"> * Ex Græco formata.] Formed after the manner of the Greeks, of <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            time did it cease to be allowable to derive, vary, and compound <lb/>
            words, a privilege which was surely granted to the immediate suc­ <lb/>
            cessors of the first men ? 37. If we ever think, moreover, that <lb/>
            we are coining a word too venturously, we may defend it with <lb/>
            some apologetical phrase, as, that I may so express myself; if I <lb/>
            may be allowed so to speak; in some way; permit me to use the <lb/>
            word; a mode of excuse that may be serviceable when we <lb/>
            use expressions which are too daringly metaphorical,! and <lb/>
            which can hardly be hazarded with safety ; for it will thus be <lb/>
            evident, from our very caution, that our judgment is not at <lb/>
            fault. In regard to this point there is a very elegant Greek <lb/>
            saying, in which we are directed <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̩̃ ὑπεζοη̩̃</foreign>, <lb/>
            “ to be the first to blame our own hyperbole." t</p>
          <p>38. A metaphorical use of words cannot be commended <lb/>
            except in the contexture of discourse.</p>
          <p>Enough, then, has been said of words considered singly, <lb/>
            which, as I showed in another place, have no beauty in <lb/>
            themselves ; yet they are not inelegant unless when they are <lb/>
            below the dignity of the subject on which we have to speak ; <lb/>
            always excepting the expression of obscenities by their exact <lb/>
            terms. 39. Let those attend to this remark, who think that <lb/>
            obscene expressions need not be avoided, because there is no <lb/>
            word indecent in itself,|| and because, as they say, whatever <lb/>
            indecency there is in any act, the idea of it is still conveyed to <lb/>
            the intellect under whatever other phraseology it may be <lb/>
            veiled. For my own part, satisfied with the observance of <lb/>
            Roman modesty, I shall, as I have already replied to such <lb/>
            reasoners,¶ vindicate decorum by silence.</p>
          <p>40. Let us then proceed to consider the nature of connected <lb/>
            discourse, the embellishment of which requires, above all, <lb/>
            attention to two points ; what language we conceive in our <lb/>
            minds, and how we express it. In the first place, we must <lb/>
            settle what we would wish to amplify or extenuate; what we <lb/>
            would express vehemently or calmly, floridly or austerely, <lb/>
            verbosely or concisely, roughly or mildly, grandly or simply, <lb/>
            impressively or attractively. 41. We must also consider with <lb/>
            what kind of metaphors or other figures, with what thoughts, <note type="footnote"> * Compare c. 2, sect. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero de Orate iii. 41.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/><lb/>
            in what style, and with what arrangement of matter, we may <lb/>
            be likely to effect the object which we wish to accomplish.</p>
          <p>But in attempting to show by what means a style may be <lb/>
            rendered elegant, I shall first touch on the faults which are <lb/>
            opposed to elegance ; for the beginning of excellence is to be <lb/>
            free from error. 42. We must first of all, then, not expect that <lb/>
            a style will be elegant which is not appropriate. What Cicero. <lb/>
            calls appropriate is that kind of style which is neither more <lb/>
            nor less in any respect than is becoming; not that it should <lb/>
            not be neat and polished, (for that is a part of elegance,) but <lb/>
            because wherever there is excess there is faultiness. 43. He <lb/>
            would accordingly have authority in the words, and thoughts <lb/>
            that are either impressive in themselves, or suited to the <lb/>
            opinions and manners of the audience. For if these particulars <lb/>
            be observed, we may adopt those forms of expression by which <lb/>
            be considers that style is rendered ornate, select terms, meta­ <lb/>
            phorical and hyperbolical phrases, epithets, repetitions,† syno­ <lb/>
            nymes, and all such phraseology as is not unsuitable to the subjest <lb/>
            of our speech, or to the representation of things.‡</p>
          <p>44. But since I have undertaken first to point out faults. <lb/>
            let me observe that one sort of fault is that which is called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαϰέμϕατον</foreign>: whether the words which we use have by bad <lb/>
            custom been distorted to an obscene meaning, as ductare <lb/>
            exercitus§ and patrare bellumll have been, by those who laugh, <lb/>
            please the gods, at phrases which Sallust used in their pure and <lb/>
            antique sense; (and I consider that the blame lies, therefore, not <lb/>
            with writers but with readers; 45. yet such expressions are to <lb/>
            be avoided, inasmuch as we have perverted pure words through <lb/>
            corruption of morals, and we must yield even to prevailing vices;) <lb/>
            or whether the junction of two words suggests by its sound <lb/>
            something obscene, as, for instance, if we say cum hominibus <note type="footnote"> * Orat. Partite c. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t Duplicia ] Words doubled by the figure which the grammarians <lb/>
            call epizeuxis, occidi, occidi, Ah Corydon, Corydon, &amp;c. Compare b. a. <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            notis loqui, unless the word hominibus be placed between cum <lb/>
            and notis, we appear to fall into that which requires some pre­ <lb/>
            fatory excuse ;* for the last letter of the preceding syllable <lb/>
            cum, which cannot be pronounced without the lips meeting <lb/>
            together, either obliges us to pause most unbecomingly, or, if it <lb/>
            be united with the following letter n, partakes of the objection­ <lb/>
            able sound of it.t 46. There are other junctions of words that <lb/>
            produce a similar effect, but it would be tedious to specify <lb/>
            them, and, in doing so, I should dwell upon the fault which I <lb/>
            say should be avoided. Let me observe, however, that the <lb/>
            division of a word sometimes gives the same offence to <lb/>
            modesty; as in the use of the nominative case of intercape­ <lb/>
            dinis.‡ 47. Nor is such misrepresentation made of what is <lb/>
            written only; for many readers will try, unless we are very <lb/>
            cautious, to intimate that something of an obscene nature is <lb/>
            suggested, (like him in Ovid, <lb/>
            Quœque latent, meliora putat, <lb/>
            Whate'er is hid, he more attractive deems,) <lb/>
            and to extract from words which are as free from indecency <lb/>
            as possible, some reason for a charge of indecency. Thus <lb/>
            Celsus finds the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαϰέμϕατον</foreign> in the words of Virgil, <lb/>
            Incipiunt agitata tumescere;§ <lb/>
            out if we allow this to be the case, it is not safe to say <lb/>
            anything.</p>
          <p>48. The next fault to unseemliness of expression is that of <lb/>
            meanness, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταπείνωσις</foreign>, and by which the <lb/>
            greatness or dignity of a thing is depreciated, as Saxea est <lb/>
            verruca in summa mantis vertice, " It is a stone wart on the top <lb/>
            of the mountain's head." To this fault the opposite in nature, <lb/>
            but equal in departure from judgment, is to apply to little <lb/>
            things terms of extravagant meaning, unless to excite laughter <lb/>
            be our object in doing so. We should not, therefore, call a <lb/>
            parricide a vicious man, nor a man attached to a harlot, a <note type="footnote"> * In prœfanda.] This is Spalding's reading. Some copies have in <lb/>
            prœfata, that is, " into the faults before mentioned." </note><note type="footnote"> t See the same objection to saying cum nobis mentioned by Cicero <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/><lb/>
            villain ; for the former appellation expresses too little, and the <lb/>
            latter too much. 49. From such errors in judgment compo­ <lb/>
            sition is rendered dull or mean, or dry, or flat, or disagreeable, <lb/>
            or slovenly ; faults which are easily understood by reflecting <lb/>
            on the opposite excellences; for the first is opposed to the <lb/>
            spirited, the second to the elegant, the third to the rich, and <lb/>
            the others to the cheerful, attractive, and correct.</p>
          <p>50. We must also avoid the fault called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μείωσις</foreign>, “ dimi­ <lb/>
            nution," when something is wanting to an expression, so that <lb/>
            it is not sufficiently full; though this indeed is rather a fault <lb/>
            of obscurity than of neglect of ornament in style. But when <lb/>
            diminution is adopted by writers designedly, it is called a <lb/>
            figure, as is the case with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταυτολογία</foreign>, " tautology,” that is, the <lb/>
            repetition of the same word or phrase. 51. The latter, <lb/>
            though not wholly avoided even by the best authors, may yet <lb/>
            be considered a fault; but it is one into which Cicero. him­ <lb/>
            self often falls, through inattention to such petty carefulness; <lb/>
            as in the words, Non solum illud judicium judicii simile, <lb/>
            iudices, non fuit, “ Not only that judgment, judges, was not <lb/>
            like a judgment." Sometimes it is called by another name, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπανάληψις</foreign> and is also numbered among the figures, of which <lb/>
            I shall give examples in that part of my workt where the <lb/>
            beauties of style are to be noticed.</p>
          <p>52. A worse fault than this is <foreign xml:lang="grc">όμοιολογία</foreign>, “ sameness of <lb/>
            style," which relieves the weariness of the reader with no <lb/>
            gratification from variety, but is all of one complexion, by <lb/>
            which it is fully proved to be deficient in oratorical art; and, <lb/>
            from the tameness of its thoughts and figures of speech, as <lb/>
            well as from the monotony of its phraseology, it is most dis­ <lb/>
            agreeable not only to the mind but also to the ear. 53. We <lb/>
            must beware too of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαϰϱολογία</foreign>, that is, the use of more words <lb/>
            than is necessary, as in Livy,‡ Legati, non impetratâ pace, <lb/>
            retro domum, unde venerant, abierunt, “ The ambassadors, not <lb/>
            having obtained peace, returned back home, from whence <lb/>
            they had come." But periphrasis, which is akin to macrology, <lb/>
            is thought a beauty.</p>
          <p>Another fault is <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλεονασμός</foreign>, “ pleonasm," when a sentence <note type="footnote"> *Pro Cluent. c. 35. </note><note type="footnote">t B. ix. c. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Spalding observes that neither he nor any other commentator has­ <lb/>
            been able to find these words in Livy ; but that Facciolati refers to two <lb/>
            passages very similar in expression, xxiv. 20 and 40. </note> <note type="footnote"> H a </note> <pb n="100"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            burdened with superfluous words, as I saw with my eyes ; foi <lb/>
            Isaw is sufficient. 54. Cicero humorously corrected a fault of <lb/>
            this kind in Hirtius, who having said, in a declamation against <lb/>
            Pansa,* that a son had been borne ten months by his mother in <lb/>
            her womb, What, exclaimed Cicero, do other women bear their <lb/>
            children in their cloaks ? t Sometimes. however, that kind of <lb/>
            pleonasm, of which I gave an example just before, is used for <lb/>
            the purpose of affirming more strongly; as, <lb/>
            Vocemque his auribus hausi,‡ <lb/>
            And with these very ears his voice I heard.</p>
          <p>55. But such addition will be a fault whenever it is useless and <lb/>
            redundant, not when it is intended. There is also a fault <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱιεϱγία</foreign>, superfluous operoseness, if I may so express <lb/>
            myself, differing from judicious care, just as a fidgetty man <lb/>
            differs from an industrious one, or as superstition from re­ <lb/>
            ligion; and, to make an end of my remarks on this point, <lb/>
            every word that contributes neither to the sense nor to the <lb/>
            embellishment of what we write, may be called vicious.</p>
          <p>56. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καϰόζηλον</foreign>, injudicious affectation, is a fault in every <lb/>
            kind of style; for whatever is tumid, or jejune, or luscious, or <lb/>
            redundant, or far-fetched, or unequal, may come under this <lb/>
            term; all, indeed, that goes beyond excellence, all that is <lb/>
            produced when imagination is not guided by judgment, and <lb/>
            is misled by the appearance of some fancied beauty, may be <lb/>
            characterized as affected; a fault which is the worst of all <lb/>
            faults in oratory; for other faults are merely not avoided, but <lb/>
            this is pursued. But it lies wholly in language. 57. Faults in <lb/>
            matter are, that it is void of sense, or common, or contradictory, <lb/>
            or redundant; corruption of style arises chiefly from the use or <lb/>
            words that are improper, superfluous, or obscure in meaning, or <lb/>
            from feebleness in composition, or puerile seeking for similar or <lb/>
            equivocal expressions. 58. But all affectation is something <lb/>
            false, though everything false is not affectation. To be affected <lb/>
            in style is to speak otherwise than nature directs, or than is <lb/>
            proper, or to use more words than are sufficient. Language <note type="footnote"> * When they were declaiming with Dolabella and others under the <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/><lb/>
            is corrupted in as many ways as it is improved. But on this <lb/>
            head I have spoken more fully in another work ;* it is noticed <lb/>
            also frequently in this, and will be noticed occasionally here­ <lb/>
            after ; for, in speaking of ornament, I shall speak from time <lb/>
            to time of such faults as border on excellences, and are to be <lb/>
            avoided.</p>
          <p>59. The following blemishes also spoil the beauty of com­ <lb/>
            position : Want of proper arrangement, which the Greeks call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνοιϰονόμητον</foreign>: unskilful use of figures, which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">άσχή­ <lb/>
            αατον</foreign>: inelegant junction of words or phrases, which they term <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαϰοσύνθετον</foreign>. Of arrangement, however, I have already treated ;t <lb/>
            of figures and composition I shall treat hereafter. ‡ Another <lb/>
            kind of fault which the Greeks notice is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰοινισμός</foreign> the com­ <lb/>
            pounding of a style from different dialects; as, for example, if <lb/>
            a writer should mix Doric, Ionic, and Æolic words with Attic. <lb/>
            60. A fault similar to this in our writers, is to mix grand <lb/>
            words with mean, old with new, such as are poetical with such <lb/>
            as are common. This produces such a monstrosity as Horace <lb/>
            imagines at the commencement of his book on the Art of <lb/>
            Poetry, <lb/>
            Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam <lb/>
            Jungere si velit, <lb/>
            If to a human head a horse's neck <lb/>
            A painter chose to join, <lb/>
            and to add other parts from different animals.</p>
          <p>61. Ornament is something superadded to perspicuity and <lb/>
            propriety. The first two steps towards it consist in a <lb/>
            vigorous conception and expression of what we wish to say; <lb/>
            the third requisite is, to render what we have conceived and <lb/>
            expressed more attractive, and this is what we properly call <lb/>
            embellishment. Let us, therefore, number <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνάϱγεια</foreign>, which I <lb/>
            noticed in my directions respecting narration,§ among the <lb/>
            ornaments of style, because distinctness, or, as some call it, <lb/>
            representation, is something more than mere perspicuity; for <lb/>
            while perspicuity merely lets itself be seen, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνάϱγεια</foreign> forces <lb/>
            itself on the reader's notice. 62. It is a great merit to set <lb/>
            forth the objects of which we speak in lively colours, and <lb/>
            so that they may as it were be seen ; for our language is not <note type="footnote"> * On the Causes of the Corruption of Eloquence; see b. vi., Introd. </note><note type="footnote"> t B. vii. </note><note type="footnote">‡ a ix. chit. 1, 2, 8, 4. </note><note type="footnote"> § IV. 2, 63.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            sufficiently effective and has Lot that absolute power which it <lb/>
            ought to have, if it impresses only the ears, and if the judge <lb/>
            feels that the particulars, on which he has to give a decision, <lb/>
            are merely stated to him, and not described graphically, or dis­ <lb/>
            played to the eyes of his mind. 63. But as this art of depiction <lb/>
            is contemplated by writers under several heads, I shall divide <lb/>
            it, not indeed into all the parts which they specify, and of <lb/>
            which the number is ambitiously augmented by some of them, <lb/>
            but into the principal, on each of which I shall say something.</p>
          <p>There is, then, one kind, by which the whole figure of an <lb/>
            object is painted as it were in words: <lb/>
            Constitit in digitos extemplo arrectus uterque,* <lb/>
            Forthwith erect upon their toes both stood, <lb/>
            with the other particulars described, which set before us the <lb/>
            appearance of the contending champions with such exactness, <lb/>
            that it could not have been plainer even to the spectators <lb/>
            themselves. 64. In this quality of style, as in all others, <lb/>
            Cicero displays the highest excellence. Is any one so incapa­ <lb/>
            ble of conceiving images of objects, that, when he reads the <lb/>
            description in the oration against Verres,t The prætor of the <lb/>
            Roman people, with sandals, with a purple cloak after the Greek <lb/>
            fashion, and a tunic reaching to his feet, stood upon the shore <lb/>
            leaning on a courtezan, he does not seem to behold the very <lb/>
            aspect and dress of the man, and even to imagine for himself <lb/>
            many particulars that are not expressed ? 65. I, for my part, <lb/>
            seem to myself to see his countenance, the look of his eyes, <lb/>
            he repulsive dalliance of him and his mistress, and the tacit <lb/>
            lisgust, and shrinking modesty, of those who witnessed the <lb/>
            scene.</p>
          <p>66. Sometimes the picture, which we endeavour to exhibit, is <lb/>
            made to consist of several particulars, as is seen in the same <lb/>
            orator (for he alone affords examples of every excellence in <lb/>
            embellishment) in the description of a luxurious banquet: I <lb/>
            seemed to myself to see some entering, others going out, some <lb/>
            totteringfrom the effects of wine, some yawning from yesterday's <lb/>
            carousal. The ground was polluted, muddy with spilt wine, and <lb/>
            covered with faded garlands and fish-bones.‡ What more <note type="footnote"> 0 Æn. v. 426. </note><note type="footnote">† V. 33; see Quint. xi. 3, 90. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ From a speech of Cicero in defence of Gallius, when he was accused <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/><lb/>
            could a person who had entered the place have seen? 67. It <lb/>
            is thus that commiseration for captured cities is excited; foi <lb/>
            though he who says that a city is captured, doubtless compre <lb/>
            hends under that expression all the circumstances with which <lb/>
            such a calamity is attended, yet this short kind of announcement <lb/>
            makes no impression on the feelings. 68. If you expand, <lb/>
            however, what was intimated in the single word, there will be <lb/>
            seen flames spreading over houses and temples; there will be <lb/>
            heard the crash of falling edifices, and a confused noise of <lb/>
            various outcries; there will be seen some fleeing, and others <lb/>
            clinging in the last embrace of their relatives; there will be the <lb/>
            lamentations of women and children, and old men preserved <lb/>
            by an unhappy fate to see that day; 69. there will be the <lb/>
            pillaging of profane and sacred treasures ; the hurrying of <lb/>
            soldiers carrying off their booty and seeking for more; pri­ <lb/>
            soners driven in chains before their captors; mothers struggling <lb/>
            to retain their infants ; and battles among the conquerors <lb/>
            wherever the plunder is most inviting. For though, as I said, <lb/>
            the idea of the city being taken includes all these circum­ <lb/>
            stances, yet it is less impressive to tell the whole at once than <lb/>
            to specify the different particulars; and the particulars we <lb/>
            shall succeed in making vivid if we but give them a <lb/>
            resemblance to truth. 70. We may also invent some circum­ <lb/>
            stances, such as are likely to occur on such occasions.</p>
          <p>A similar vividness will be given to description by the <lb/>
            mention of adjuncts or consequences; as, <lb/>
            Mihi frigiduM horror <lb/>
            Membra quatit, gelidusque coit formidine sanguis,* <lb/>
            A shiv'ring horror shakes <lb/>
            My limbs, and my cold blood congeals with fear; <lb/>
            — Trepidæ matres pressers ad pectora natos,† <lb/>
            Trembling mothers clasp'd <lb/>
            Their infants to their breasts.</p>
          <p><unclear>71</unclear>. To the attainment of this excellence, (an excellence, in <lb/>
            my opinion, of the highest order,) the way is very easy. We <lb/>
            must look to nature, and follow her. All eloquence relates to <lb/>
            the transactions of human life; every man refers what he hears <lb/>
            to himself; and the mind easily admits what it recognizes as <lb/>
            true to nature. <note type="footnote"> * An. iii. It. </note><note type="footnote">t Æn. vii. 518 </note></p><pb n="104"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/>72. To throw light upon descriptions similes have been very <lb/>
            happily invented ; some of which, as they strengthen proof, <lb/>
            are numbered among arguments; others are adapted to give a <lb/>
            lively representation of things ; and it is this sor <lb/>
            applicable to the present head of our subject <lb/>
            Inde lupi ceu <lb/>
            Raptores atrd in nebulâ,* <lb/>
            Thence like rav'ning wolves, <lb/>
            In a dark mist, <lb/>
            and <lb/>
            Avi similis, quæ circum litora, circum <lb/>
            Piscosos scopulos, humilis volat aequora juxta, t <lb/>
            — Like the bird that flies <lb/>
            Around the shores, around the fishy rocks, <lb/>
            Low, near the sea.</p>
          <p>78. In the use of this kind of illustration we must take the <lb/>
            greatest care that what we introduce by way of similitude may <lb/>
            not be obscure or unknown ; for that which is offered as an <lb/>
            illustration of something else, ought to be plainer than that <lb/>
            which it is meant to illustrate. Similes of the following kind <lb/>
            we may accordingly leave to the poets: <lb/>
            Qualis ubi hybernam Lyciam, Xanthique fluenta <lb/>
            Deserit, aut Delon maternam invisit Apollo;‡ <lb/>
            As when Apollo wintry Lycia quits <lb/>
            And Xanthus' stream, or visits Delos' isle, <lb/>
            His birth-place.</p>
          <p>74. It would not become an orator to demonstrate something <lb/>
            plain by a reference to something obscure. But that kind of <lb/>
            simile also, of which I spoke in treating of arguments,§ con­ <lb/>
            tributes to the ornament of style, and helps to render it <lb/>
            sublime, or florid, or attractive, or striking. The more <lb/>
            distant, indeed, is the subject from which any illustration is <lb/>
            drawn, the more novelty it has, and the more surprise it <lb/>
            causes. 75. Such as the following may seem common, adapted <lb/>
            only to aid in enforcing conviction: As ground is made better <lb/>
            and more fertile by culture, so is the mind by learning: and, <lb/>
            As surgeons amputate limbs rendered useless by disease, so <lb/>
            base and mischievous persons, though intimately allied to us by <lb/>
            blood, must be cut off from our society, This from the speech <note type="footnote"> * Æn. ii. 355. </note><note type="footnote">+ Æn. iv. 254. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Æn. iv. 143. </note><note type="footnote">§ a v. c. 11. </note> <pb n="105"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/><lb/>
            for Archias* is more sublime; Stones and deserts reply to the <lb/>
            voice ; fierce wild beasts are often moved, and stand still, at <lb/>
            the song of the poet, etc. 76. This kind of similes is often <lb/>
            greatly abused by the licentiousness of declaimers; for they <lb/>
            adopt such as are false; and they do not apply them fairly to <lb/>
            the things to which they wish them to seem applicable. An <lb/>
            example of both faults is afforded in some that were every <lb/>
            where repeated when I was a young man: Of great rivers the <lb/>
            sources are navigable; and, The generous tree bears fruit as <lb/>
            soon as it springs up.</p>
          <p>77. In every comparison, either the simile precedes and the <lb/>
            subject of it follows, or the subject precedes and the simile <lb/>
            follows. But sometimes the simile stands by itself and is <lb/>
            unconnected ; sometimes, as is preferable, it is joined with the <lb/>
            object of which it is the representation, resemblances in the <lb/>
            one answering to resemblances in the other; an effect which <lb/>
            what we call redditio contraria, and the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνταπόδοσις</foreign>, <lb/>
            produces. 78. The simile which I mentioned just above, pre­ <lb/>
            cedes the subject: <lb/>
            Inde lupi ceu <lb/>
            Raptores atrd in nebula. <lb/>
            that in the first book of the Georgics,† after the long com­ <lb/>
            plaint concerning civil and foreign wars, follows its subject: <lb/>
            Ut quum carceribus sese effudêre quadrigœ, <lb/>
            Addunt in spatia ; et frustra retinacula tendens <lb/>
            Fertur equis auriga, nec audit currus habenas. <lb/>
            As when the chariots from the barriers start, <lb/>
            And speed athwart the plain; the charioteer, <lb/>
            Tight'ning in vain the curb, is borne away <lb/>
            By his own steeds, nor heeds the car the rein.</p>
          <p>But this simile is without any <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνταπόδοστς</foreign>. 79. Such mutual <lb/>
            correspondence, however, brings under the eye as it were both <lb/>
            objects of comparison, and displays them together. I find <lb/>
            many noble examples of it in Virgil; but I must take them <lb/>
            from the orators in preference. Cicero, in his speech for <lb/>
            Muræna,‡ says, As they say that those, among the Greek <lb/>
            musicians, who cannot become players on the lyre, may become <lb/>
            players on the flute, so we see that those who cannot becoma <note type="footnote"> 0 C.S. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Ver. 512. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ C. 18. </note> <pb n="106"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            orators betake themselves to the study of the law. 80. There is <lb/>
            is another example in the same speech,., animated with a spirit <lb/>
            almost of poetry, and with an antapodosis, which renders it <lb/>
            more effective as an embellishment: For as tempests are often­ <lb/>
            times excited by the influence of some particular sign in the <lb/>
            heavens, and oftentimes arise suddenly, without any assignable <lb/>
            cause, and from some undiscoverable origin, so in regard to <lb/>
            such a tempest of the people at the comitia, though we may often <lb/>
            understand by what influence it has been raised, yet its origin is <lb/>
            often so obscure, that it seems to have arisen without any cause <lb/>
            at all, 81. There are also short similes of this kind; as, <lb/>
            Wandering through the woods after the manner of wild beasts; <lb/>
            and that of Cicero in reference to Clodius,† From which trial <lb/>
            he escaped naked, as from a house on fire. But similes like <lb/>
            these will occur to the recollection of every one, from every­ <lb/>
            day conversation.</p>
          <p>With this kind of simile is connected the power of setting <lb/>
            a thing before the eye, not only with plainness, but concisely <lb/>
            and quickly. 82. Brevity, indeed, to which nothing is <lb/>
            wanting, is justly extolled, but that kind of brevity which <lb/>
            says nothing more than is necessary, (the Greeks call it <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογία</foreign>, and it shall be noticed among the figures of speech, ‡) <lb/>
            is less deserving of commendation. Yet it is very happy <lb/>
            when it comprises much in few words, as in the phrase of <lb/>
            Sallust, Mithridates cohere ingenti, perinde armatus, " Mithri­ <lb/>
            dates, of vast stature, and suitably armed.”§ But obscurity <lb/>
            attends on those who attempt such conciseness injudiciously.</p>
          <p>83. A beauty akin to the preceding, but of higher merit, is <lb/>
            emphasis, which intimates a deeper meaning than the words <lb/>
            used actually express. There are, however, two kinds of it; <lb/>
            one which signifies more than is said; the other which signi­ <lb/>
            fies something that is not said. 84. Of the former kind there <lb/>
            is a specimen in Homer,|| where Menelaus says, that the <lb/>
            Greeks descended into the horse; for by that one word he <lb/>
            shows the vastness of the horse ; and there is a similar speci­ <lb/>
            men in Virgil, <note type="footnote"> * C. 17. </note><note type="footnote">t See iii. 7, 2. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote">‡ IX. 3, 50. </note><note type="footnote"> § From Sallust's History. Burmann gives a similar phrase from <lb/>
            Florus, iii. 2, 3. Atrox cœlum, perinde ingenia. </note><note type="footnote"> || Odyss. xi. 522. But the words are those of Ulysses, as Spaldinp <lb/>
            observes, not of Menelaus. </note> <pb n="107"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/><lb/>
            Demussum lapri per funem, <lb/>
            Descending by a rope let down, <lb/>
            for thus also the height of the horse is signified. Virgil, too, <lb/>
            when he says that the Cyclops lay stretched through the cave,† <lb/>
            measures the prodigious bulk of his body by the space of <lb/>
            ground that it occupied. 85. The latter kind consists either <lb/>
            in the entire suppression of a word in what we say, or in the <lb/>
            omission of it at the close. As to the suppression of a word or <lb/>
            thought, Cicero has given an instance of it in his speech for <lb/>
            Ligarius.‡ But if, Cæssar, in your present height of power you <lb/>
            had not so much clemency in your own disposition as you have; <lb/>
            in your own disposition, I say; I know how I am expressing <lb/>
            myself; for he suppresses that which we nevertheless under­ <lb/>
            stand, that there were not wanting men to incite him to <lb/>
            cruelty. An omission at the close is by which, <lb/>
            as it is a figure, will be noticed in its proper place. § <lb/>
            86. There is emphasis also in many common expressions; as, <lb/>
            You must be a man ; and, He is but a mortal ;|| and, We must <lb/>
            live.¶ So like is nature in general to art.</p>
          <p>It is not enough, however, for eloquence to set forth the sub­ <lb/>
            jects of discussion clearly and vividly; but there are many and <lb/>
            various modes of embellishing language. 87. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϕέλεια</foreign> of <lb/>
            the Greeks, "simplicity" pure and unaffected, carries with it <lb/>
            a certain chaste ornament, such as is so much liked in women ; <lb/>
            and there is a certain pleasing delicacy of style that arises <lb/>
            from a nicety of care about the propriety and significancy of <lb/>
            words. Of copiousness there is one kind that is rich in <lb/>
            thought, and another that abounds with flowers. 88. Of force <lb/>
            there is more than one species; for whatever is complete in <lb/>
            its kind, has its proper force. Its chief manifestation, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δείνωσις</foreign>, "vehemence" in exaggerating an indignity ; <lb/>
            in regard to other subjects a certain depth; in conceiving <lb/>
            images of things, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασία</foreign>; in fulfilling as it were a proposed <lb/>
            work, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξεργασία</foreign>; to which is added <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεξεργαία</foreign>, a repetition of <lb/>
            the same proof, or superabundant accumulation of argument. <lb/>
            89. Allied to these qualities is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέγεια</foreign>, which has its name <note type="footnote"> * An. iL 262. </note><note type="footnote">t An. iii. 631. </note><note type="footnote">‡ C. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> § IX. 2, 54; 3, 60. </note><note type="footnote">|| An excuse for faults. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ Vivendum est.] That is, genio indulgendum; we must make the <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            from action, and of which the chief virtue is to prevent what is <lb/>
            said from being ineffective. There is also a kind of bitter <lb/>
            force, which is commonly employed in invective, as in the <lb/>
            question of Cassius,* What will you say when I shall invade <lb/>
            your domain, that is, when I shall teach you that you do not <lb/>
            know how to revile ? A sort of sharp force, also, as in the <lb/>
            saying of Crassus,† Should I consider you a consul, when you <lb/>
            do not consider me a senator ? But the chief power of an orator <lb/>
            lies in exaggeration and extenuation. Each has the same <lb/>
            number of expedients, on a few of which I shall touch; those <lb/>
            which I omit will be of a similar character. 90. But they all <lb/>
            have their sources in matter or in words. Of the invention <lb/>
            and arrangement of matter, however, I have already treated ; <lb/>
            my present business is to show how expression may contribute <lb/>
            to elevate or depress a subject.</p>

            3—9. By comparison, 10—14. By reasoning and inference, 15— <lb/>
            25. By an accumulation of terms or particulars, 26, 27. Modes <lb/>
            of extenuation are similar, 28. Hyperbole, 29.</p>
          <p>1. THE first mode of amplifying or extenuating, then, lies <lb/>
            in the nature of the term which we apply to anything, as <lb/>
            when we say, that a man who was beaten, was murdered; that <lb/>
            one who is disingenuous, is a thief; or, on the other hand, that <lb/>
            one who beat another, touched him, or that one who wounded <lb/>
            another, hurt him. Of both there is an example in one pas­ <lb/>
            sage of the speech for Cælius; ‡ If a woman, being a widow, <lb/>
            lives freely ; being bold, lives without restraint; being rich, <lb/>
            lives luxuriously ; being wanton, lives like a courtezan ; should <lb/>
            I, if a man salutes her somewhat familiarly, consider him as an <lb/>
            adulterer? 2. For he calls a woman who was rather immodest, <note type="footnote"> * We can scarcely doubt that Cassius Severus is meant. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t Lucius Licinius Crassus, the celebrated orator, uttered th se <lb/>
            words in the senate, when he repulsed the lictor that Philippic sent <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.IV.]."/><lb/>
            a courtezan; and says, that he who had been long connected <lb/>
            with her, saluted her somewhat familiarly. This sort of am <lb/>
            plification becomes stronger and more remarkable, when the <lb/>
            terms of larger meaning are compared with those for which <lb/>
            we substitute them; thus Cicero says in his speech against <lb/>
            Verres,* We have brought before your tribunal, not a thief, <lb/>
            but an open robber; not a simple fornicator, but a violator of <lb/>
            all chastity; not a person guilty only of sacrilege, but an <lb/>
            open enemy to everything sacred and religious; not a mere <lb/>
            assassin, but a most cruel executioner of our countrymen and <lb/>
            allies. 3. By the first term much is signified; by the second <lb/>
            still more.</p>
          <p>I see that amplification, however, is effected chiefly in four <lb/>
            ways; by augmentation, by comparison, by reasoning, and by <lb/>
            accumulation.</p>
          <p>Augmentation is most effective, when even things of which <lb/>
            we speak as inferior to others, are made to seem of importance. <lb/>
            This may be done either by one step or by several. By <lb/>
            augmentation we reach, not only the highest point, but some <lb/>
            times, as it were, beyond that point. 4. To exemplify all <lb/>
            these remarks a single instance from Cicero† will suffice: It <lb/>
            is an offence to bind a Roman citizen, a crime to scourge him, <lb/>
            almost treason to put him to death ; and what shall I say that <lb/>
            it is to crucify him ? 5. For had the Roman citizen only been <lb/>
            scourged, Cicero would have exaggerated the guilt of Verres <lb/>
            one degree, by saying, that even a less kind of punishment <lb/>
            than scourging was an offence; and bad he only been put to <lb/>
            death, the guilt would have been aggravated by another de­ <lb/>
            gree; but after having said, that to put him to death was <lb/>
            almost treason, a crime than which there is no greater; Cicero <lb/>
            adds, what shall I say that it is to crucify him ? When he <lb/>
            had come to that crime, which is the greatest of all, words <lb/>
            were necessarily wanting to express anything beyond it. 6. <lb/>
            An advance, beyond what seems highest, may also be made in <lb/>
            another way; as in what Virgil says concerning Lausus: <lb/>
            Quo pulchrior alter <lb/>
            Non fuit, excepto Laurentis corpore Ttwni,‡ <lb/>
            Than whom <lb/>
            Was none more beautiful, except the form <lb/>
            Of the Laurentian Turnus. <note type="footnote"> * L 3. </note><note type="footnote">t In Verr. v. 56. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Æn. vii. 649. </note> <pb n="110"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/>To say, than whom was none more beautiful, was to go ap­ <lb/>
            parently as high as possible, but something was afterwards <lb/>
            added. 7. There is also a third way, in which we do not <lb/>
            advance by steps, there being no more and most, but proceed <lb/>
            at once to something than which nothing greater can be <lb/>
            named : You killed your mother ; what shall I say more; you <lb/>
            killed your mother.* For this is a kind of augmentation, to <lb/>
            represent anything as so great that it cannot be augmented <lb/>
            8. Language is amplified less evidently, but perhaps for that <lb/>
            very reason more effectively, when, without any breaks, but in <lb/>
            one continuous series and course, something always follows <lb/>
            greater than what goes before; thus Cicero† reproaches Antony <lb/>
            with his vomiting, In an assembly of the people of Rome, when <lb/>
            holding a public office, when master of the horse. Every par­ <lb/>
            ticular is an advance on that which precedes: To vomit from <lb/>
            excessive drinking would have been of itself disgusting, even <lb/>
            if not before a public assembly; it would have been disgusting <lb/>
            before a public assembly, even if not of a whole people; <lb/>
            before a whole people, even if not the people of Rome; even <lb/>
            if he had held no office, or not a public office, or not that of <lb/>
            master of the horse. 9. Another speaker might have dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished these steps, and dwelt upon each of them; Cicero <lb/>
            hastens to the summit at once, and gains it, not by climbing, <lb/>
            but at the utmost speed.</p>
          <p>But as this kind of amplification looks always to something <lb/>
            higher, so that which is made by comparison seeks to raise <lb/>
            itself on something lower. For by elevating that which is <lb/>
            beneath, it must of necessity exalt that which is placed above. <lb/>
            10. Thus Cicero, in the passage just quoted, says, If this had <lb/>
            happened to you at a banquet, and over those immense cups oj <lb/>
            yours, who would not have thought it disgraceful ? But when <lb/>
            it occurred before an assembly of the Roman people, etc. And <lb/>
            in one of his speeches against Catiline.‡ If, assuredly, my <lb/>
            slaves feared me, as all your fellow-citizens fear you, I should <lb/>
            think that I must quit my house. 11. Sometimes, by mentioning <lb/>
            an instance of something similar, we may make that which we <lb/>
            wish to exaggerate appear greater: thus Cicero, in his speech <note type="footnote"> * As no authors name is attached to this example, we may suppose <lb/>
            It to be Quintilian's own. Spalding. Some would refer it to the case <lb/>
            of Orestes. </note><note type="footnote"> t Philipp. ii. 25. </note><note type="footnote">t In Cat. i. 7. </note> <pb n="111"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.IV.]."/><lb/>
            for Cluentius,* having related that a woman of Miletus had <lb/>
            received a bribe from the heirs in reversion to cause abortion <lb/>
            in her own person, exclaims, Of how much greater punishment <lb/>
            is Oppianicus deserving for a crime of a similar nature ! The <lb/>
            woman of Miletus, in doing violence to her own body, tortured <lb/>
            only herself; Oppianicus effected a like object by violence and <lb/>
            torture to the body of another. 12. Nor let any one think that <lb/>
            this sort of amplification, though of a like character, is the <lb/>
            same with the mode of proceeding in regard to arguments,† <lb/>
            where the greater is inferred from the less; for in the one <lb/>
            case to prove is the object, in the other to magnify; as, in <lb/>
            regard to Oppianicus, the purpose of the comparison is not to <lb/>
            show that he committed a crime, but that he committed a <lb/>
            greater crime than another person. 13. In the two cases, how­ <lb/>
            ever, though different, there is a certain affiinity; and I shall <lb/>
            therefore have recourse to the same example of which I made <lb/>
            use in the other place,: though not for the same purpose; <lb/>
            for what I have here to show is, that, for the sake of ampli­ <lb/>
            fication, not only a whole is compared with a whole, but parts <lb/>
            uitA parts ; as in this passage :§ Did that illustrious man, and <lb/>
            chief pontiff, Publius Scipio, kill, in his private character, <lb/>
            Gracchus, when he was making only moderate changes in the <lb/>
            commonwealth, and shall we consuls bear with Catiline, who is <lb/>
            seeking to devastate the whole earth with fire and sword ? <lb/>
            14. Here Catiline is compared to Gracchus; the commonwealth <lb/>
            to the whole world; the moderate change to slaughter, fire, <lb/>
            and devastation; a man in his private character with the <lb/>
            consuls ; and if a speaker should wish to dilate on these points <lb/>
            severally, each would furnish ample matter for the purpose.</p>
          <p>15. As to the amplifications which I said were made by <lb/>
            reasoning, let us consider whether I designated them by <lb/>
            a sufficiently appropriate term ; though I am not indeed very <lb/>
            anxious as to that point, provided that the thing itself be clear <lb/>
            to those who wish to understand it. I have, however, adopted <note type="footnote"> * C. 11. </note><note type="footnote">t V. 10, 86. </note><note type="footnote"> t Where Quintilian had introduced this example about Scipio <lb/>
            Nasica, no commentator seems to have tried to discover. It is not in <lb/>
            the passage of the fifth book, to which I have just referred. But as <lb/>
            Quintilian made no division of chapters, and did not bear very exactly <lb/>
            in mind the different parts into which he distributed hie subjects, <unclear>hi</unclear> <lb/>
            might have intended to refer to v. 13, 24. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> I Cicero in Cat. i. 1, </note> <pb n="112"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            that term, because this sort of amplification is introduced in <lb/>
            one place and produces its effect in another; so that one <lb/>
            thing is magnified in order that another may be corroborated; <lb/>
            and thence we arrive by reasoning at that which is the object <lb/>
            of our amplification. 16. For instance, Cicero,. designing <lb/>
            to reproach Antony with his wine-bibbing and vomiting, says, <lb/>
            You, with such a throat, with such sides, with such strength in <lb/>
            your whole body, fit for a gladiator, etc. What has the <lb/>
            mention of the throat and sides to do with the intoxication ? <lb/>
            It is by no means without effect; for, looking to their capacity, <lb/>
            we may estimate how much wine he swallowed at the marriage <lb/>
            of Hippia, which be could not bear and carry off even with that <lb/>
            strength of body fit for a gladiator. If, therefore, one thing is <lb/>
            concluded from another, the term reasoning is neither improper <lb/>
            nor extraordinary ; and it is a term which I have introduced <lb/>
            for the same reason among the states.* 17. So likewise <lb/>
            amplification arises from ensuing circumstances, as, in the case <lb/>
            of Antony, such was the force of the wine bursting from <lb/>
            him, that it produced no trifling effect, or inclination to <lb/>
            vomit, but an absolute necessity of doing so, where it least of <lb/>
            all became him ; and the food which he cast up was not fresh, <lb/>
            as sometimes happens, but such aa remained in his stomach <lb/>
            from the feast of the preceding day. 18. Circumstances that <lb/>
            have preceded an act, too, lead to a similar conclusion ; for <lb/>
            when Æolus, at the request of Juno, <lb/>
            cavum conversâ cuspide montem <lb/>
            Impulit in latus; ac venti,velut agmine facto <lb/>
            Qua data porta, ruunt,‡ <lb/>
            turn'd his spear, and struck <lb/>
            The hollow mountain's side, and forth the winds <lb/>
            Rush, as in banded throng, where'er a way <lb/>
            Was giv'n, <lb/>
            it is signified how great a tempest would follow. 19. Is it not <lb/>
            amplification by reasoning, also, when we purposely extenuate <lb/>
            the most atrocious crimes, (which we ourselves have previously <lb/>
            represented as meriting the utmost detestation,) in order that <lb/>
            the charges which are to follow may appear more enormous ? <lb/>
            This is done by Cicero,§ when he said, These are but trifling <lb/>
            charges against such a criminal. The captain of a vesselfrom <note type="footnote"> * Cicero Philipp. ii. 25. </note><note type="footnote">+ IIL 6, 1 </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Æn. i. 8. </note><note type="footnote">S In Verr. -. 44. </note> <pb n="113"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.IV.]."/><lb/>
            a most honourable city, purchased exemption from the terror oj <lb/>
            scourging with a sum of money; to allow him to do so was <lb/>
            humanity in Verres. Another, that he might not be beheaded <lb/>
            sacrificed also a sum of money; this was but an ordinary <lb/>
            occurrence. 20. Has not Cicero used amplification from <lb/>
            reasoning, in order that the audience might estimate how <lb/>
            enormous what was to be inferred must be, when such trans. <lb/>
            actions, compared with it, were humane and ordinary? In <lb/>
            this manner one thing is frequently enhanced by a reference <lb/>
            to another; as when the merit of Scipio is magnified by <lb/>
            dwelling on the military excellences of Hannibal; and when <lb/>
            we extol the bravery of the Gauls and Germans, in order that <lb/>
            the glory of Julius Cæsar may appear the greater.</p>
          <p>21. It is also a kind of amplification, when something is <lb/>
            said of one thing with reference to another, with a view to <lb/>
            which, however, it does not appear to be said. The chiefs of <lb/>
            Troy thought it nothing discreditable that the Greeks and <lb/>
            Trojans should endure so many calamities for so long a period <lb/>
            for the sake of the beauty of Helen ;* how great, then, must <lb/>
            that beauty be supposed to have been! It is not Paris, who <lb/>
            carried her off, that says this; nor any young man ; nor one <lb/>
            of the multitude; but old men, the wisest of the people, the <lb/>
            counsellors of Priam. 22. And even the king himself, exhausted <lb/>
            by a ten years' siege, deprived of so many children, with utter <lb/>
            destruction hanging over him, he, to whom it might have been <lb/>
            thought that that face, which had been the cause of so many <lb/>
            tears, would have been odious and detestable, not only listens <lb/>
            patiently to this remark, but calling her “ daughter," places her <lb/>
            at his side, and even exculpates her, and denies that she is <lb/>
            the cause of his misfortunes. 23. Nor does Plato, in his <lb/>
            Symposium,† when he represents Alcibiades as confessing, on <lb/>
            his part, how he wished to have been treated by Socrates, appear <lb/>
            to have given this account in order to blame Alcibiades, but <lb/>
            in order to show the incorruptible morality of Socrates, which <lb/>
            could not be shaken even by the obvious advances of the most <lb/>
            attractive of mankind. 24. It is thus, too, that the extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary stature of the ancient heroes is left to be inferred by us <lb/>
            from the weapons which they used; as instances, may be <lb/>
            mentioned the shield of Ajax,‡ and the spear of Achilles § <note type="footnote"> * Hom. II. ii. 156. </note><note type="footnote">t Sect. 41. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ II. vii. 21. </note><note type="footnote">§ II. xvi 140. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            Of this kind of artifice Virgil has admirably availed himself <lb/>
            in his description of the Cyclops ;* for how huge must we con­ <lb/>
            ceive the body to be, the hand of which trunca pinus regit, “ a <lb/>
            pine-tree lopped of its branches supports ?” How great also <lb/>
            must have been the size of Demoleos, when two men, with their <lb/>
            united efforts, could scarcely support his coat of mail on their <lb/>
            shoulders, and yet he, clad in it, <lb/>
            —— cursu palantes Troas agebat, <lb/>
            The scattere'd Trojans at full speed pursued!</p>
          <p>25. Cicero himself, again, could hardly have imagined any­ <lb/>
            thing so descriptive of the luxury of Mark Antony as he <lb/>
            intimates when he says,‡ You might have seen the couches of <lb/>
            slaves in their bed-rooms, decked with Pompey’s purple quilts. <lb/>
            Slaves in their bed-rooms use purple quilts, and those the <lb/>
            quilts of Pompey; nothing stronger can be said; and yet we must <lb/>
            consider that there was infinitely greater extravagance in the <lb/>
            master than in his slaves. 26. This species of amplification <lb/>
            is of a similar nature with what is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμϕσις</foreign>: but the one <lb/>
            suggests an inference from a word, the other from a thing; <lb/>
            and the latter is as much more effective than the former as <lb/>
            things are more impressive than words.</p>
          <p>There remains to be noticed under amplification the accu­ <lb/>
            mulation of a number of words or thoughts having the same <lb/>
            signification ; for though they do not ascend by steps, yet they <lb/>
            are heaped up, as it were, by coacervation. 27 What did your <lb/>
            sword do, Tubero, that was drawn in the field of Pharsalia ? <lb/>
            At whose body was the point of it aimed ? What was the object <lb/>
            of your appearance in arms ? To what were your thoughts, <lb/>
            your eyes, your hands, directed? What ardour inspired your <lb/>
            breast ? What did you wish or desire ? § This is similar to <lb/>
            what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">συναθροισμός</foreign>: but in the Greek there is <lb/>
            an amassing of many things; in the other figure there is an <lb/>
            aggregation of particulars relating to one. This kind of ampli­ <lb/>
            ficatiop is often produced by a series of words rising higher <lb/>
            and higher in meaning; as,* There was present the door­ <lb/>
            keeper of the prison, the prœtor’s executioner, the death and <lb/>
            terror of the allies and citizens of Rome, the lictor Sextius.</p>
          <p>28. The art of extenuation is nearly similar; for there <note type="footnote"> * Æn. iii. 659. </note><note type="footnote">t An. v. 260. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Philipp. iL 27. </note><note type="footnote"> § Cicero pro Ligario, c. 3. </note><note type="footnote">|| Cicero in Very.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.V.]."/><lb/>
            are as many steps when we go up as when we go down. I <lb/>
            shall content myself, therefore, with one example of it, taken <lb/>
            from that passage where Cicero speaks thus of a speech of <lb/>
            Rullus :* Some few, however, who stood nearest to him, sus­ <lb/>
            pected that he wished to say something about the Agrarian lar. <lb/>
            If this is considered to signify that the speech was not under­ <lb/>
            stood, it is extenuation ; if that it was obscure, it is exagge­ <lb/>
            ration.</p>
          <p>I know that hyperbole may also be thought by some a <lb/>
            species of amplification; for it either magnifies or diminishes; <lb/>
            but as the meaning of hyperbole is larger than that of ampli­ <lb/>
            fication, it must be reserved for consideration under the head <lb/>
            of tropes.† Of these I should proceed to treat at once, if they <lb/>
            were not a form of speech distinct from other forms, consisting <lb/>
            in words used, not in their proper, but in a metaphorical sense. <lb/>
            Let me grant a little indulgence, therefore, to a desire which <lb/>
            is almost universal, and not omit to speak of that ornament of <lb/>
            style‡ which most regard as the principal and almost only <lb/>
            one.</p>

          <p>1. THE ancient Latins called whatever they conceived in the <lb/>
            mind, sententia, " a thought." This acceptation of the word <lb/>
            is not only very common among orators, but retains some hold <lb/>
            of a place in the intercourse of ordinary life. For when we <lb/>
            are going to take an oath, we speak ex animi nostri sententiâ, <lb/>
            " from the thought of our mind," and when we congratulate <lb/>
            our friends, we express ourselves ex sententiâ, " from our <note type="footnote"> * Cicero de Lege Agr. ii. 5. </note><note type="footnote">+ C. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t Quintilian means sententiæ, of which he is going to speak in the <lb/>
            next chapter. The obscurity in the text is probably caused by some <lb/>
            nutilation of it, as Spalding observen. </note> <note type="footnote"> 12 </note> <pb n="116"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            thoaght.”* Not unfrequently, however, they spoke of utter­ <lb/>
            ing their sensa; as to the word sensus, it seems to have <lb/>
            applied by them only to the bodily senses. 2. But a custom has <lb/>
            now become prevalent of calling the conceptions of the mind <lb/>
            sensus, and those striking thoughts, which are introduced <lb/>
            chiefly at the close of periods, sententiæ. Such thoughts were <lb/>
            far from being common among the ancients, but in our day are <lb/>
            used to excess. I think it necessary for me, therefore, to say <lb/>
            a few words concerning the different kinds of them, and the <lb/>
            methods in which they may be used.</p>
          <p>3. Though they all come under the same appellation, those <lb/>
            that are properly called sententiæ are the most ancient of their <lb/>
            kind; the Greeks call them <foreign xml:lang="grc">γώμαι</foreign>, and they received their <lb/>
            name, both in Greek and Latin, from their similarity to <lb/>
            counsels or decrees. The word is one of general meaning <lb/>
            and reference ; and a sententia may be deserving of praise in <lb/>
            itself, without being applied to any particular subject. Some­ <lb/>
            times it relates merely to a thing; as, nothing contributes so <lb/>
            much to popularity as goodness; sometimes to a person, as that <lb/>
            saying of Domitius Afer, A prince who would look into all <lb/>
            things, must of necessity overlook many things.† 4. Some <lb/>
            have called it a part of an enthymeme,‡ and some the beginning <lb/>
            or end of an epicheireme; and it sometimes is so, but not <lb/>
            always. It is remarked with more truth, that it is sometimes <lb/>
            simple, as in the two examples which I have just given; <lb/>
            sometimes accompanied with a reason ; as, For in all disputes, <lb/>
            he that is the stronger, even though he receive the injury, <lb/>
            appears, because his power is greater, to have inflicted it;§ and <lb/>
            sometimes double, as <lb/>
            Obsequium amicos, veritas odium pant,|| <lb/>
            Obsequiousness makes friends, plain truth breeds hate.</p>
          <p>5. Some have even made ten kinds, but in a way in which <lb/>
            many more might be made, distinguishing them into sententiæ <lb/>
            of interrogation, of comparison, of negation, of similitude, of <lb/>
            admiration, etc.; for a thought might thus have a name from <note type="footnote"> * See Cicero de Orat. it 64. </note><note type="footnote"> t Necesse habet multa ignoscere.] Ignosœre for ignoro, non credere. <lb/>
            Burmann. </note><note type="footnote"> t See v. 10, 14. Aristot. Rhet. ii. 21, 2. </note><note type="footnote"> § Sallust, Jug. c. 10. </note><note type="footnote">U Terence, Andr. i. 1, 41. </note> <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.V.]."/> <lb/>
            every form of language. One of the most remarkable kinds is <lb/>
            that which consists in an opposition of particulars : <lb/>
            Mors misera non est; aditus ad mortem at miser,* <lb/>
            Death is not grievous, but th' approach to death.</p>
          <p><unclear/> ,. Sometimes thoughts are enunciated in a direct manner : <lb/>
            Tam deest avaro quod habet, quàm quod non habet <lb/>
            The miser wants as much that which he has, <lb/>
            As that which he has not, <lb/>
            but they receive additional force from a change in the form of <lb/>
            expression; as, <lb/>
            Usque ade<foreign xml:lang="grc">ό</foreign>ne mori niserum est ? ‡ <lb/>
            Is it then such a grievous thing to die ? <lb/>
            For this is more spirited than the direct expression, D ath is <lb/>
            not grievous. The same effect may be produced by the adap­ <lb/>
            tation of a general sentiment to a particular case ; thus Medea <lb/>
            in Ovid, instead of saying in a direct manner, Nocere facile est, <lb/>
            prodesse difficile, “It is easy to do harm, difficult to do good," <lb/>
            expresses herself with more animation thus : <lb/>
            Servare potui: perdere ac possim rogas ? § <lb/>
            I have had power to save, and do you ask <lb/>
            Whether I can destroy ?</p>
          <p>7. Thus Cicero || makes a personal application of a common <lb/>
            thought: Your height of fortune, Cæsar, carries with it nothing <lb/>
            greater than the power, and nothing better than the will, to save as <lb/>
            many persons as possible; attributing that to Cæsar which <lb/>
            belonged properly to the circumstances in which Cræsar was <lb/>
            placed. But in the use of such sentiments, we must take <lb/>
            care, as we must indeed with regard to all thoughts, that they <lb/>
            be not too frequently introduced, or be evidently inapplicable, <lb/>
            (as is the case with many that are used by some speakers, <lb/>
            who call them <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαθολιϰά</foreign>, and utter all that make for their <lb/>
            cause as incontrovertible,) and that they be not employed <lb/>
            everywhere, or put into the mouth of all characters indiscrimi­ <lb/>
            nately. 8. For they are more suitable to persons of authority, <lb/>
            whose character may give weight to what they say. Who <note type="footnote"> * Whence this verse comes, is uncertain. Gallæus observes that it <lb/>
            is cited by Lactantius, iii. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> t From Publius Syrus. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Virg. Æn. xii. 646 </note><note type="footnote"> § From Ovid's lost play of Medea. </note><note type="footnote">|| Pro Lig. c. 12. </note> <pb n="118"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            indeed would listen patiently to a boy, or a young man, or a <lb/>
            person of no estimation, if he spoke decisively, or uttered <lb/>
            precepts with the air of a master ?</p>
          <p>9. Whatever we conceive in the mind, also, is an enthymeme, <lb/>
            but that which is properly called so, consists of two thoughts <lb/>
            in opposition, because it seems to be as pre-eminent among <lb/>
            other thoughts as Homer among poets and Rome among cities. <lb/>
            Of this enough has been said in the part where I spoke of ar­ <lb/>
            guments.* 10. It is not, however, always used for the purpose <lb/>
            of argument, but sometimes merely for embellishment ; as, <lb/>
            Shall the language of those, Cæsar, whose impunity is an <lb/>
            honour to your clemency, incite you to cruelty ?† Cicero adds <lb/>
            this question, not because it contains a new reason, but <lb/>
            because it had been already shown, by other arguments, how <lb/>
            unjust such conduct would be; 11. and it is subjoined at the close <lb/>
            of the period by way of epiphonema, not as a proof, but as a <lb/>
            triumphant blow to the adverse party ; an epiphonema being, <lb/>
            as it were, the concluding attestation to something already <lb/>
            related or proved ; as in Virgil, <lb/>
            Tantæ molis erat Romanam, condere gentem,t <lb/>
            Such was the task to found the Roman state ! <lb/>
            Or as in the words of Cicero,§ The young man, being of <lb/>
            honourable disposition, chose rather to incur danger, than to <lb/>
            endure what was disgraceful.</p>
          <p>IS. There is also to be noticed what is called by the <lb/>
            moderns <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμα</foreign>: a term which may be taken as implying any <lb/>
            thought whatever ; but our rhetoricians have distinguished by <lb/>
            it that which they do not express, but wish to be understood; as <lb/>
            in what was said to the young man, whom his sister had several <lb/>
            times redeemed || when he had enlisted among the gladiators, <lb/>
            and who brought an action against her under the lex talionis, <lb/>
            because she had cut off his thumb while he was asleep, You <lb/>
            deserved, exclaimed she, to have your hand whole ; intimating, <lb/>
            that he deserved to be all his life a gladiator. 13. What is <lb/>
            called a clausula, too, requires to be mentioned; and if it be <note type="footnote"> * V. 10, 2. See Cicero, Topic. c. 13. </note><note type="footnote">+ Cicero Pro Lig. c, 4. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ An. L 33. </note><note type="footnote">§ Pro Mil. c. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> || Gesner refers us to Lipsius, Saturn. ii. 3, 5, where it is shown, by <lb/>
            many instances, that even free citizens used to hire themselves to the <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.V.]."/><lb/>
            in the sense of what we term a conclusion, it is proper, and, in <lb/>
            some places, necessary; as, You must, therefore, make confession <lb/>
            concerning your own conduct, before you blame anything in that <lb/>
            of Ligarius * But our modem speakers use it in another sense, <lb/>
            and intimate that every thought at the conclusion of a period <lb/>
            should fall pointedly on the ear. 14. They think it unbecom­ <lb/>
            ing, and almost a crime, to take breath at any passage which <lb/>
            is not intended to call forth acclamations. Hence those small <lb/>
            witticisms, uttered in bad taste, and forced into the service of <lb/>
            the subject; for there cannot be as many happy thoughts as <lb/>
            there must be conclusions to periods.</p>
          <p>15. The following kinds of sententiae among the modems <lb/>
            may also be noticed. That which consists in something <lb/>
            unexpected; as the retort of Vibius Crispus† to a man who, - <lb/>
            when he was walking about the forum in a coat of mail, pre­ <lb/>
            tended that he did so from fear: Who, exclaimed Crispus, <lb/>
            has given you permission to be so much in fear ? Or as the <lb/>
            remarkable address of Africanus‡ to Nero on the death of his <lb/>
            mother, Your Gallic provinces, Cæsar, entreat you to bear your <lb/>
            good fortune with firmness. 16. Others consist in some indi­ <lb/>
            rect allusion ; as, when Domitius Afer was pleading for <lb/>
            Cloantilla, whom Claudius had pardoned when she was accused <lb/>
            of having buried her husband, who had been killed among the <lb/>
            rebels, he remarked in his peroration, addressing himself to <lb/>
            her sons, Nevertheless, young men, do not fail to bury your <lb/>
            mother.§ IT. Some are aliunde petita, that is, transferred <lb/>
            from one thing to another; as Crispus, in pleading for Spatale, <lb/>
            whose lover, after making her his heiress, had died at the age <lb/>
            of twenty-two, exclaimed, 0 youth of extraordinary forethought, <lb/>
            who thus gratified himself ! || 18. A mere repetition makes some <note type="footnote"> * Pro Lig. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote">t V. IS, 48. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ I have no doubt that Julius Africanus the orator is meant; see <lb/>
            x. 1, 118; xii. 10, 10 : also Tacitus Dial. de Orat. c. 15. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> § The sons themselves, therefore, appear to have accused their <lb/>
            mother, and Domitius' admonition about filial piety appears to have <lb/>
            been to this effect: Do not fear the displeasure of Cæsar for burying <lb/>
            your mother, for he loves affection, and has pardoned your mother for <lb/>
            burying her husband contrary to the law; filial piety will please him <lb/>
            more than your unnatural accusation. But as we have no knowledge <lb/>
            of the affair from any other quarter, I offer this explanation only as <lb/>
            conjecture. Gesner. </note><note type="footnote"> || The meaning of this exclamation is not apparent. Gallæus supposes <lb/>
            that he had gratified himself by squandering all his property in his </note> <pb n="120"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            of these sententiæ, ; as that of Seneca in the letter which Nero <lb/>
            sent to the senate after killing his mother, wishing to make it <lb/>
            appear that he had been in great danger, That I am safe, nei­ <lb/>
            ther, as yet, do I believe, nor do I rejoice. But this is better <lb/>
            when it is strengthened by an opposition of clauses ; as, I <lb/>
            know where to flee, but whom to follow I do not know* Why <lb/>
            need I add that the miserable man, though he could not speak. <lb/>
            could not hold his peace ?† 19. It is most striking, however, <lb/>
            when it is vivified by some comparison : as in the remark of <lb/>
            Trachalus against Spatale, Do you desire, therefore, 0 ye laws, <lb/>
            most faithful guardians of chastity, that tenth parts of estates <lb/>
            should be awarded to wives, and fourth parts to mistresses ? ‡</p>
          <p>Of such kinds of sententiæ, however, some may deserve to <lb/>
            be called good, and some bad. SO. Those are always bad <lb/>
            that are mere plays on words, as, Conscript Fathers, for I must <lb/>
            commence thus, to remind you of what is due to fathers,. <lb/>
            A still worse kind, as it is more false and far-fetched, is such <lb/>
            as that which was attributed to the gladiator, (whom I men­ <lb/>
            tioned just above,) as a retort to his sister, I have fought to my <lb/>
            finger.§ 21. But perhaps the most execrable of all is when <note type="footnote"> short life; and most other commentators have adopted this explana­ <lb/>
            tion. But Spatale, from sect. 19, seems to have been claiming property <lb/>
            that he had left behind him. The gratification seems rather to refer <lb/>
            to the appointing of Spatale to be his heiress. </note><note type="footnote"> * Cicero ad Att. viii. 7 ; comp. vi. 3, 109. </note><note type="footnote"> + Pithœus, on this passage, cites from a letter of St. Jerome to <lb/>

            poterat. Quintilian's quotation, therefore, seems to come from the <lb/>
            speech of Cicero against Piso, out of a part of it which is defective. <lb/>
            Certainly the words refer to some Piso. Gesner. No nearer approach <lb/>
            has been made to an explanation of the passage. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ By the lex Julia et Papia Poppcea, it was appointed that to a wife, <lb/>

            whom refer to this passage of Quintilian. In sect. 17 the lover appears <lb/>

            supported by an epigram attributed to Martial, Spectac. xxix. 5, Lex <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.V.]."/><lb/>
            ambiguity in the words is joined with something that conveys <lb/>
            a false notion as to the matter. I remember, when I was a <lb/>
            young man, hearing a famous pleader, who had given a mother <lb/>
            some splinters of bone, picked out of a wound in her son's <lb/>
            head,. merely for the sake of a sententia, exclaim, Unhappy <lb/>
            woman, you have not yet conveyed your son to his funeral pile, <lb/>
            and yet you have collected his bones. 22. Thus many delight even <lb/>
            in the pettiest attempts at wit, which, if examined, are merely <lb/>
            ridiculous, but which, when first produced, please the hearer <lb/>
            with a show of ingenuity. For example, there is an imaginary <lb/>
            case in the schools of a man who, having been shipwrecked, <lb/>
            after being previously ruined by the barrenness of his grounds, <lb/>
            banged himself; and it is said of him, Let him whom neither <lb/>
            earth nor sea sustains, hang in the air. 23. A similar witticism <lb/>
            was made on the young man that I mentioned above,† to whom, <lb/>
            when he was tearing his flesh, his father gave poison: He who <lb/>
            eats that, ought to drink this. To a luxurious man, also, who is <lb/>
            said to have pretended a resolution to die by hunger, the <lb/>
            admonition was offered, Make a rope for yourself; you have <lb/>
            reason to be angry with your throat; or take poison; a toper <lb/>
            ought to die drinking. 24. Some are mere inanity, as that of <lb/>
            the declaimer exhorting the generals of Alexander to bury <lb/>
            him in the ashes of Babylon, and exclaiming, I celebrate the <lb/>
            obsequies of Alexander, and will any one behold them from the <lb/>
            window of his house ? as if the absence of spectators from win­ <lb/>
            dows were more to be deplored than anything else relating to <lb/>
            the ceremony. Some are extravagant; as what I heard a <lb/>
            speaker say of the Germans, I know not where their head is <lb/>
            placed ;‡ and of a brave man, He repelled wars with his shield. <note type="footnote"> queror until the other acknowledged himself defeated, sublato digito, by <lb/>
            holding up his finger. This explanation is favoured, observes Spalding, <lb/>
            by a note of the Scholiast on Persius, v. 119, Tractum à gladiatoribus, <lb/>
            qui victi, ostensione digiti veniam à populo postulabant, though the <lb/>
            Scholiast utterly mistook the sense of his author in the verse. But in <lb/>
            ad digitum pugnavi in Quintilian there is some play upon the word <lb/>
            digitus which we do not understand. However the meaning may be <lb/>
            something like, " I have fought to the last," “ 1 have fought as long as <lb/>
            I could." </note><note type="footnote"> * See vi. 1, 30. </note><note type="footnote">t C. 2, sect. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Caput nescio ubi impositum.] This is generally supposed to refer <lb/>

            25. But there would be no end, if I were to attempt to enu­ <lb/>
            merate all the species of tasteless witticisms.</p>
          <p>Let us rather attend to a point which is of more impor­ <lb/>
            tance. There are two different opinions respecting sententiæ; <lb/>
            that of those who set the highest value on them ; and that of <lb/>
            those who entirely reject them. With neither of these <lb/>
            opinions do I exactly concur. 26. If brilliant thoughts are <lb/>
            too crowded, they interfere one with another; as in crops of <lb/>
            corn, and fruits on trees, nothing can grow to its just size that <lb/>
            wants space in which to expand itself. Nor does a figure in a <lb/>
            picture, which has no shade surrounding it, stand out in relief; <lb/>
            and accordingly painters, when they combine several objects <lb/>
            in the same piece, keep them distinct by intervening spaces, <lb/>
            that shadows may not fall on the objects. 27. This pursuit of <lb/>
            fine thoughts, also, makes style too curt; for every thought <lb/>
            makes as it were a stand, as being complete in itself; and <lb/>
            after it there must necessarily be the commencement of <lb/>
            another sentence. Hence language is rendered too uncon­ <lb/>
            nected, and being composed. not of members, but of bits,* has <lb/>
            no proper construction ; for these round and polished portions <lb/>
            refuse to unite with each other. 28. The complexion, too, of <lb/>
            the style, is variegated with spots, which, however brilliant, are <lb/>
            of many and diverse hues; and, although a band and deco­ <lb/>
            rations of purple, put on a dress in their proper place, give a <lb/>
            radiance to it, yet certainly a garment bedecked with various <lb/>
            patches would be becoming to nobody. 29. However, there­ <lb/>
            fore, such ornaments may seem to glitter and stand out, as it <lb/>
            were, in composition, yet we may well compare them, not to <lb/>
            the light of flame, but to sparks appearing among smoke : for <lb/>
            they would not be noticed if the whole composition were <lb/>
            luminous, any more than the stars are seen in the light of the <lb/>
            sun ; and the eloquence that tries to raise itself, as it were, <lb/>
            with frequent little bounds, presents an unequal and broken <lb/>
            surface to the view, neither gaining the admiration paid to <lb/>
            lofty objects, nor exhibiting the attractions of level ground. <lb/>
            30. To this is to be added another evil, that the speaker who <lb/>
            is always bunting for striking thoughts, must necessarily pro­ <lb/>
            duce many that are trifling, vapid, and impertinent; for he <lb/>
            can make no proper distinction where he is overwhelmed with <note type="footnote"> * Non membri8, sed frustis collata.] The same expression is used iv <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.V.]."/><lb/>
            numbers. Hence you may witness, among such orators, even <lb/>
            the division of their subject set off with the air of a fine <lb/>
            thought, as well as their arguments, if they be delivered at the <lb/>
            close and fall of a period. 31. You, yourself an adulterer, <lb/>
            have killed your wife; I could not have tolerated your conduct, <lb/>
            even if you had but divorced her, is with them a mode of division; <lb/>
            and, Would you be convinced that the philtre was poison ? The <lb/>
            man would be now alive, if he had not drunk it, is a form of <lb/>
            argument. Most of them, indeed, may be said not to utter <lb/>
            fine thoughts, but to utter everything as if it were a fine <lb/>
            thought.</p>
          <p>32. Some, again, make the contrary practice their study, <lb/>
            shunning and shrinking from all such charms of composition, <lb/>
            and approving nothing but what is plain, and humble, and <lb/>
            without effort. Thus, while they are afraid that they may <lb/>
            sometimes fall, they are always creeping on the ground. But <lb/>
            what crime do they suppose that there is in producing a fine <lb/>
            thought ? Does it not strike the judge ? Does it not recom­ <lb/>
            mend the speaker? 33. It is a fashion of speaking, they reply, <lb/>
            which the orators of antiquity did not follow. How far back <lb/>
            in antiquity, let me ask them, do they refer us? If to a <lb/>
            remote period, Demosthenes produced many fine thoughts, <lb/>
            such as no one had produced before him. If to a more recent <lb/>
            period, how, let me ask, can they approve even Cicero, when <lb/>
            they think that there ought to be no deviation from the <lb/>
            manner of Cato and the Gracchi? Before the Cato and the <lb/>
            Gracchi, too, there was a still plainer way of speaking. 34. <lb/>
            For my own part, I consider such ornaments of style to be the <lb/>
            very eyes, as it were, of eloquence; but I should not wish <lb/>
            eyes to be spread over the whole body, lest other members <lb/>
            should be obstructed in their functions; and, if I were com­ <lb/>
            pelled to make a choice, I should prefer the rudeness of the <lb/>
            ancients to the affectation of the moderns. But a middle <lb/>
            course is open between them; as, in our mode of living and <lb/>
            dress, a certain elegance may be observed which is free from <lb/>
            blame. Let us add, therefore, as far as we can, to the merits <lb/>
            of our style; but let it be our first care to avoid faults, lest, <lb/>
            while we wish to be better than the ancients, we make our­ <lb/>
            selves merely unlike them.</p>
          <p>33. I shall now proceed to the consideration of tropes, <lb/>
            which I mentioned as the next head of my subject. The <pb n="124"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            illustrious orators of our times call them <unclear>motus</unclear>, " movements"* <lb/>
            or “changes.” Rules concerning them the grammarians <lb/>
            generally deliver; but when I was speaking of their duties,! 1 <lb/>
            delayed entering on this head, because, as it refers to the <lb/>
            embellishment of style, it seemed to me that it would demand <lb/>
            more attention, and that it should be reserved for a more <lb/>
            important place in my work.</p>

          <p>1. A trope is the conversion of a word or phrase, from its <lb/>
            'proper signification to another, in order to increase its force.‡ <lb/>
            Concerning tropes grammarians have carried on interminable <lb/>
            disputes among themselves and with the philosophers; dis­ <lb/>
            putes as to what genera there are of them, what species, what <lb/>
            number, and which are subordinate to others. 2. For myself, <lb/>
            omitting all such subtilties as useless to form an orator, I <lb/>
            shall speak only of those tropes which are most important and <lb/>
            most in use; and in regard to these, too, I shall content <lb/>
            myself with observing, that some are adopted for the <lb/>
            purpose of adding to significance, others for the sake <lb/>
            of ornament; that some take place in words used properly, <lb/>
            and others in words used metaphorically is and that tropes <lb/>
            occur, not only in single words, but also in thoughts, and in the <note type="footnote"> * Because they move a word, as it were, from its proper signification <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VI.]."/><lb/>
            structure of composition.* 3. Those, therefore, appear to me <lb/>
            to have been in error, who thought that there were no tropes <lb/>
            but when one word is put for another; nor am I insensible, <lb/>
            that in the tropes which are used with a view to significance, <lb/>
            there is also embellishment; but the reverse is not the case, <lb/>
            as there are some that are intended for embellishment only.</p>
          <p>4. Let us commence, however, with that species of trope, <lb/>
            which is both the most common and by far the most beautiful, <lb/>
            I mean that which consists in what we call translatio, and the <lb/>
            Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταϕοϱά</foreign>, " metaphor."</p>
          <p>Metaphor is not only so natural to us, that the illiterate <lb/>
            and others often use it unconsciously, but is so pleasing and <lb/>
            ornamental, that, in any composition, however brilliant, it will, <lb/>
            always make itself apparent by its own lustre. 5. If it be <lb/>
            but rightly managed, it can never be either vulgar, or mean, <lb/>
            or disagreeable. It increases the copiousness of a language, <lb/>
            by allowing it to borrow what it does not naturally possess; <lb/>
            and, what is its greatest achievement, it prevents an appel­ <lb/>
            lation from being wanting for anything whatever. A noun or <lb/>
            a verb is accordingly transferred, as it were, from that place <lb/>
            in the language to which it properly belongs, to one in which <lb/>
            there is either no proper word, or in which the metaphorical <lb/>
            word is preferable to the proper. 6. This change we make, <lb/>
            either because it is necessary, or because it adds to signifi­ <lb/>
            cance, or, as I said,† because it is more ornamental. Where <lb/>
            the transference produces no one of these effects, it will be <lb/>
            vicious.</p>
          <p>From necessity the rustics speak of the gemma,‡ “ bud,” of <lb/>
            the vines, (for how else could they express themselves ?) and <lb/>
            say that the corn thirsts, and that the crops suffer. From <lb/>
            necessity we say, that a man is hard, or rough, because there <lb/>
            is no proper term for us to give to these dispositions of the <lb/>
            mind. 7. But we say that a man is inflamed with anger, burning <lb/>
            with desire, and has fallen into error, with a view to signifi­ <lb/>
            cance or force of expression, for none of these phrases would <lb/>
            be more significant in its own words than in those adopted <note type="footnote"> * Some tropes take place in single words, as metaphor, synecdoche, <lb/>
            metonymy, &amp;c.; others in thoughts or sentences, as allegory, periphrasis, <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            metaphorically.* The expressions, luminousness of language, <lb/>
            illustrious birth, storms of public assemblies,t thunderbolts oj <lb/>
            eloquence, are used merely for ornament; and it is thus that <lb/>
            Cicero‡ calls Clodius in one place a source, and in another a <lb/>
            harvest and foundation, of glory to Milo. 8. Some things also, <lb/>
            which are unfit to be expressed plainly, are intimated meta­ <lb/>
            phorically, as, <lb/>
            Hoc faciunt, nimio ne luxu obtusior usus <lb/>
            Sit genitali arvo, et sulcos oblimet inertes ; § <lb/>
            “ This they do, lest by too much indulgence the action of the <lb/>
            genital field should grow too unenergetic, and obstruct the <lb/>
            inert furrows." On the whole, the metaphor is a short com­ <lb/>
            parison ; differing from the comparison in this respect, that, <lb/>
            in the one, an object is compared with the thing which we <lb/>
            wish to illustrate; in the other, the object is put instead <unclear>of</unclear> <lb/>
            the thing itself. 9. It is a comparison, when I say that a man <lb/>
            has done something like a lion; it is a metaphor, when I say <lb/>
            of a man that he is a lion.</p>
          <p>Of metaphors in general there seem to be four kinds ; the <lb/>
            first, when one sort of living thing is put for another; as, in <lb/>
            speaking of a driver of horses, <lb/>
            —— gubernator magnâ contorsit equum vi,|| <lb/>
            The steersman turn'd his horse with mighty force; <lb/>
            or as Livy¶ says that Scipio used to be barked at by Cato <lb/>
            10. The second, when one inanimate thing is put for <lb/>
            another; as, <lb/>
            Classique immittit habenas, <unclear/>** <lb/>
            He gives his fleet the reins. <lb/>
            The third, when inanimate things are put for things having <lb/>
            life, as, <lb/>
            Ferro, non fato, mærus Argivûm occidit, †† <lb/>
            By steel, not fate, the wall of Greece fell down; <note type="footnote"> * That is, each of those phrases would be less significant, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> t Comp. sect. 48. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Pro Mil. c. 3. </note><note type="footnote">§ Virgo Georg. iii. 135. </note><note type="footnote"> || Whence this verse comes is unknown.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VI.]."/><lb/>
            and the fourth, when things having life are put for things <lb/>
            inanimate, <lb/>
            ——— sedet inscius alto <lb/>
            Accipiens sonitum saxi de vertice pastor. <lb/>
            The shepherd sits amaz'd, <lb/>
            Listening the sound from the high mountain's head.</p>
          <p>11. From the last kind of metaphor, when inanimate things are <lb/>
            exalted by a bold and daring figure, and when we give energy <lb/>
            and feeling as it were to objects that are without them, <lb/>
            extraordinary sublimity is produced ; as in Virgil, <lb/>
            Pontem indignatus A raxes, t <lb/>
            Araxes that disdain'd a bridge; <lb/>
            12. in Cicero,f What was your drawn sword, Tubero, doing in the <lb/>
            field of Pharsalia ? At whose body did its point direct itself ? <lb/>
            What was the meaning of your arms ? Sometimes this beauty <lb/>
            is doubled, as in Virgil, <lb/>
            Ferrumque armare veneno,§ <lb/>
            To arm the steel with poison, <lb/>
            for to arm with poison, and to arm steel, are both metaphors. <lb/>
            13. These four might be distinguished into more species ; as <lb/>
            a word may be taken from one sort of rational animal and ap. <lb/>
            plied metaphorically to another, and the same may be done <lb/>
            with regard to irrational animals; and, in like manner, we may <lb/>
            apply a metaphor from the rational to the irrational, or from <lb/>
            the irrationalto the rational; and from the whole of a thing to <lb/>
            a part, or from the part to the whole. But I am not now <lb/>
            giving directions to boys, or supposing that my readers, when <lb/>
            they understand the genus, cannot master the species.</p>
          <p>14. But as a moderate and judicious use of metaphors <lb/>
            adorns language, so a too frequent introduction of them <lb/>
            obscures it, and renders the perusal of it fatiguing ; while a <lb/>
            continuous series of them runs into allegory and enigma. <lb/>
            Some metaphors, too, are mean, as that which I recently <lb/>
            mentioned,|| There is a wart of stone, etc. 15. Some are <lb/>
            repulsive; for though Cicero uses the expression sentina <lb/>
            reipublicæ, “ sink of the commonwealth," with great happi­ <lb/>
            ness, to signify a herd of bad characters, yet I cannot for that <note type="footnote"> * Æn. ii. 307.

            reason approve of the saying of an old orator, Persecuisti <lb/>
            reipublicae vomicas, “ You have lanced the ulcers of the COIn. <lb/>
            mon wealth." Cicero* himself excellently shows that we must <lb/>
            take care that a metaphor be not offensive; such as (for I <lb/>
            will use his own examples) that the republic was castrated by <lb/>
            the death of Africanus, or that Glaucia was the excrement of the <lb/>
            senate ; 16. that it be not too great, or, as more frequently hap­ <lb/>
            pens, too little for the subject; and that it be not inapplicable; <lb/>
            faults of which he who knows that they are faults will find <lb/>
            numerous examples. But an excess, even of good metaphors, <lb/>
            is vicious, especially if they be of the same kind. 17. Some <lb/>
            are harsh, that is, based on a resemblance not sufficiently <lb/>
            close, as " The snows of the head,”† and, <lb/>
            Jupiter hibernas cand nive conspuit Alpes,‡ <lb/>
            Jove o'er the Alps spits forth the wintry snows.</p>
          <p>But the greatest source of error in regard to this subject is, <lb/>
            that some speakers think whatever is allowed to poets, (who <lb/>
            make it their sole object to please, and are obliged by the <lb/>
            necessity of the metre to adopt many metaphorical expres­ <lb/>
            sions,) is permissible also to those who express their thoughts <lb/>
            in prose. 18. But I, in pleading, would never say the <lb/>
            shepherd of the people on the authority of Homer, nor speak of <lb/>
            birds rowing with their wings, though Virgil,§ in writing of <lb/>
            bees and of Dædalus, has used that phrase with great hap­ <lb/>
            piness ; for a metaphor ought either to occupy a place that is <lb/>
            vacant, or, if it takes possession of the place of something <lb/>
            else, to appear to more advantage in it than that which it <lb/>
            excludes.</p>
          <p>1 9. What I say of metaphor may be applied, perhaps with <lb/>
            more force, to synecdoche ; for metaphor has been invented for <lb/>
            the purpose of exciting the mind, giving a character to things, <lb/>
            and setting them before the eye; synecdoche is adapted to give <lb/>
            variety to language, by letting us understand the plural from <lb/>
            the singular, the'whole from a part, a genus from the species, <lb/>
            something following from something preceding; and vice versâ; <lb/>
            but it is more freely allowed to poets than to orators. SO. For <note type="footnote"> * Do Orate in. 41. </note><note type="footnote">t Capitis nives.] Her. Od. iv. 13, 12. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Hor. Sat. ii. 5,41. A verse from Furius Bibaculus, as the Scholiast <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VI.]."/> <lb/>
            prose, though it may admit mucro, “ a point,” for a sword, and <lb/>
            tectum, " a roof," for a house, yet it will not let us say puppis, <lb/>
            “ a stern," for a ship, or quadrupes, “ a quadruped," for a horse. <lb/>
            But it is liberty with regard to number that is most admissible in <lb/>
            prose; thus Livy often says, Romanusprælio victor, " The Roman <lb/>
            was victorious in the battle," when he means the Romans ; and <lb/>
            Cicero, on the other hand, writes to Brutus,* Populo imposui­ <lb/>
            mus et oratores visi sumus, “ We have imposed on the <lb/>
            people, and made ourselves be thought orators," when he <lb/>
            speaks only of himself. 21. This mode of expression not only <lb/>
            adorns oratorical speeches, but finds its place even in common <lb/>
            conversation. Some say that synecdoche is also used, when <lb/>
            we understand something that is not actually expressed in the <lb/>
            words employed, as one word is then discovered from another; <lb/>
            but this is sometimes numbered among defects in style <lb/>
            under the name of ellipsis ; as, <lb/>
            Arcades ad portas ruere ;† <lb/>
            Th' Arcadians to the gates began to rush ; <lb/>
            22. I consider it rather a figure; and among figures it shall be <lb/>
            noticed.‡ But from a thing actually expressed another may <lb/>
            be understood; as, <lb/>
            Aspice aratrajugo referunt suspensa juvenci,§ <lb/>
            Behold the oxen homeward bring their ploughs <lb/>
            Suspended from the yoke, <lb/>
            whence it appears that night is approaching. I know not <lb/>
            whether this mode of expression be allowable to an orator, <lb/>
            unless in argumentation, when one thing is shown to indicate <lb/>
            another. But this has nothing to do with elocution.</p>
          <p>23. From synecdoche metonymy is not very different. It is <lb/>
            the substitution of one word for another ;|| and the Greek <lb/>
            rhetoricians, as Cicero¶ observes, call it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπαλλαγή</foreign>. It indi­ <lb/>
            cates an invention, by the inventor, or a thing possessed, by <lb/>
            the possessor. Thus Virgil says, <lb/>
            Cererem corruptam undis,** <lb/>
            Ceres by water damaged, <note type="footnote"> * In a letter now lost. See c. 3, sect. 34. </note><note type="footnote">t Æn. xi. 142. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ IX. 3, 58. </note><note type="footnote">§ Virg.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            and Horace, <lb/>

            Terrâ Neptunus classes Aquilonibus arcet. <lb/>
            Neptune, receiv'd <lb/>
            Within the land, from north winds shields the fleets. <lb/>
            The reverse! would be offensive.</p>
          <p>24. It is of great importance, however, to consider how far <lb/>
            the use of the trope is permitted to the orator ; for though we <lb/>
            daily hear Vulcan used for fire, though it is elegant to say <lb/>
            vario Marte pugnatum for the fortune of the battle was various, <lb/>
            and though it is more becoming to say Venus than coitus, yet <lb/>
            to use Bacchus and Ceres for wine and bread would be more <lb/>
            venturesome than the severity of the forum would allow. <lb/>
            Thus, too, custom permits us to signify that which is contained <lb/>
            from that which contains it; as well-mannered cities, a cup was <lb/>
            drunk, a happy age; but the opposite mode of expression <lb/>
            scarcely any one would use but a poet; as, <lb/>
            Proximus ardet <lb/>
            Ucalegan, ‡ <lb/>
            Ucalegon burns next.</p>
          <p>25. It may perhaps be more allowable, however, to signify from <lb/>
            the possessor that which is possessed; as, a man is eaten up, <lb/>
            when his estate is squandered. But of metonymy of this sort <lb/>
            there are numberless forms. 26. We adopt it when we say <lb/>
            that sixty thousand were killed by Hannibal at Cannæ; § when we <lb/>
            say Virgil for Virgil’s poetry; when we say that provisions, which <lb/>
            have been brought, have come; that a sacrilege has been found <lb/>
            out, instead of the person who committed it; and that a sol­ <lb/>
            dier has a knowledge of arms instead of a knowledge of the <lb/>
            military art. 27. That kind of metonymy, too, by which we <lb/>
            signify the cause from the effect, is very common both among <lb/>
            .toets and orators. Thus the poets have, <lb/>
            Pallida mors aquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, || <lb/>
            Pale death, with equal foot, knocks at the gate <lb/>
            Of poor man's cottage, &amp;c. <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Hor. A. P. 63. </note><note type="footnote"> t That is, if we were to say the sea for Neptune.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VI.]."/><lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            Pallentesque habitant morbi, trutisque senectus,* <lb/>
            And pale diseases dwell, and sad old age; <lb/>
            and an orator will speak of rash anger, cheerful youth, and <lb/>
            slothful inactivity.</p>
          <p>28. The following kind of trope† has also some affinity with <lb/>
            the synecdoche. When I say vultus hominis, “ the looks of a <lb/>
            man," I express in the plural that which is singular ; yet I do <lb/>
            not make it my object that one may be understood out of <lb/>
            many, (for my meaning is evident,) but make an alteration <lb/>
            only in the term. When I call, also, gilded ceilings golden <lb/>
            ceilings, I deviate a little, as the gilding is but a part, from the <lb/>
            truth. To notice all such expressions, however, would be too <lb/>
            trifling an employment, even for those who are not forming an <lb/>
            orator.</p>
          <p>29. Antonomasia, which for a proper name substitutes <lb/>
            something equivalent, is very common among the poets, and <lb/>
            is sometimes effected by an epithet, which, ‡ when the name to <lb/>
            which it is applied is set aside, is a sufficient substitute for it, <lb/>
            as Tydides, elides, for Diomede and Achilles ; sometimes by <lb/>
            specifying some remarkable characteristic of a person; as, <lb/>
            Divûm pater atque hominum rex, <lb/>
            The father of the gods and king of men; <lb/>
            sometimes by mentioning some act by which a person is dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished ; as, <lb/>
            Thalamo quæ fixa reliquit <lb/>
            Impius, § <lb/>
            The arms which in the chamber fix’d <lb/>
            He, impious, left.</p>
          <p>30. Among prose writers, though there is not much use of this <lb/>
            phraseology, yet there is some; for, though they would not <lb/>
            say Tydides and Pelides, yet they would say impius, by itself, <lb/>
            for an impious man; and they do not hesitate to say the destroyer <lb/>
            of Carthage and Numantia for Scipio, and the prince of <lb/>
            Roman eloquence for Cicero. He himself has certainly taken <note type="footnote"> * An. vi. 275. </note><note type="footnote"> t Est etiam huic tropo.] Spalding is doubtless right in referring huic <lb/>
            to what follows, hie being similarly used in iv. 1, 48; v. 10, 83. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The text has quia, but Spalding admonishes us to read quod, </note><note type="footnote"> I Æn. if. 495. </note> <note type="footnote"> It 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            such liberty: You do not commit many faults, said the old <lb/>
            master to the hero ;* where the name of neither is expressed, <lb/>
            but both are understood.</p>
          <p>31. Onomatopæia, that is, the making of words, which was <unclear/> <lb/>
            ounted by the Greeks among the greatest merits, is scarcely <lb/>
            permitted to us. Many words, indeed, were thus made by <lb/>
            those who formed the language at first, with a view to adapt <lb/>
            the sound to the impressions produced by the things signified; <lb/>
            hence mugitus, “ lowing," sibilus, “ hissing." murmur, “ mur­ <lb/>
            mur," had their origin. 32. But now, as if everything that <lb/>
            was possible in that way had been accomplished, we do not <lb/>
            dare to produce a new word, though many that were formed by <lb/>
            the ancients are daily falling out of use. We scarcely allow <lb/>
            ourselves to venture on what are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱαγόμενα</foreign> words that <lb/>
            are derived, in whatever way, from others in common use; <lb/>
            such as Sullaturio, “ to desire to act like Sulla," proscripturio, <lb/>
            “ to desire to proscribe," and laureati pastes, for “ posts <lb/>
            decked with laurel," are regarded as of the same nature. 33. The <lb/>
            word evaluit was successfully introduced; but vio for eo “ to <lb/>
            go," was an unfortunate experiment. In regard to the Greek <lb/>
            words obelisco coludumo, ‡ and others, we are forbidden to <lb/>
            make harsh junctions, but we appear to look with satisfaction <lb/>
            on septentriones. §</p>
          <p>34. The more necessary, therefore, is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατάχϱησις</foreign>, which we <lb/>
            properly call abusio, and which adapts, to whatever has no <lb/>
            proper term, the term which is nearest; as, <lb/>
            Equum divinâ Palladis arte <lb/>
            Ædificant,|| <lb/>
            A horse they build by Pallas' art divine; <lb/>
            and, among the tragic poets, Now a lion will bring forth; but <lb/>
            a lion will be a father. 35. There are a thousand examples <lb/>
            of the kind. ruses are called acetabula, whatever they <note type="footnote"> * Cicero pro Muræn. c. 29. Manutius, in a note on the passage, <lb/>
            intimates that Chiron and Achilles are meant. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero ad Attic. ix. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Both these words are corrupt, and no satisfactory emendations <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VI.]."/> <lb/>
            contain ; boxes, pyxides,* of whatever material they are made; <lb/>
            and he who kills his mother or brother is called parricida. <lb/>
            All these catachreses are to be considered distinct from the <lb/>
            metaphor; for catachresis is used where a term is wanting; <lb/>
            metaphor, where another term is in use. The poets are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed, even in speaking of things that have their own proper <lb/>
            names, to use, catachrestically, proximate terms in preference; <lb/>
            a practice which is rarely adopted in prose. 36. Some also <lb/>
            will say that there is a catachresis when we use virtus for rash <lb/>
            valour, or liberalitas for luxury; but such misapplications are <lb/>
            distinct from the catachresis, for in them it is not one word, <lb/>
            but one thing that is put for another; since no one thinks <lb/>
            that luxury and liberality mean the same thing; but one calls <lb/>
            the thing, whatever it is, luxury, and another liberality, <lb/>
            though neither has any doubt about the distinctness of their <lb/>
            signification.</p>
          <p>37. Of tropes which modify signification, there remains to <lb/>
            be noticed the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετάληψις</foreign> or transsumptio, which makes a way, <lb/>
            as it were, for passing from one thing to another; a trope <lb/>
            which is very rarely used, and is extremely liable to objection, <lb/>
            but which is not uncommon among the Greeks, who call <lb/>
            Chiron the Centaur, and term <foreign xml:lang="grc">νήσοι ὀξει̑αι</foreign>, “ sharp-pointed <lb/>
            iblands," <foreign xml:lang="grc">θοαί</foreign>, “swift.”† Who would bear with us, if we should <lb/>
            call Verres Bus, " Hog," or Lælius Doctus, " Learned ?” 38. <lb/>
            For metalepsis is of such a nature, that it is an intermediate <lb/>
            step, as it were, to that which is metaphorically expressed, <lb/>
            signifying nothing in itself, but affording a passage to some <lb/>
            thing. It is a trope that we affect rather that we may seem <lb/>
            to be acquainted with it, than one of which we ever stand in <lb/>
            need. The most common example of it is, cano, canto, dico, <lb/>
            canto being intermediate, between cano and dico. ‡ 39. I <note type="footnote"> * Pyxis was properly a box made of boxwood ; from <foreign xml:lang="grc">πύξος</foreign>, buxus. </note><note type="footnote"> † Odyss. xv. 298, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νήσοισιν ἐπιπρόεηκε θοῃ̃σιν</foreign>. The islands are the <lb/>
            Echinades. Both the Scholiast and Strabo observe that <foreign xml:lang="grc">θοσί</foreign>, “ quick," <lb/>
            is here used for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀξει̃αι</foreign>, "sharp," in reference to the sharp-pointed <lb/>
            promontories or rocks. Apollonius Rhodius uses <foreign xml:lang="grc">θοὸς</foreign> several times in <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            shall dwell no longer upon it, for I see but little use in it, <lb/>
            except, as I said, where one thing is to lead to another.</p>
          <p>40. Other tropes are used, not for the sake of adding to sig­ <lb/>
            nificancy, but for ornament,* such as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίθετον</foreign>, † which we <lb/>
            rightly call appositum; by some it is termed sequens. The <lb/>
            poets use it with more frequency and freedom than writers of <lb/>
            prose; for it is sufficient for them that it suits the word to <lb/>
            which it is applied; and we accordingly do not find fault with <lb/>
            their albi dentes, “ white teeth," and humida vina, " liquid <lb/>
            wine." But an epithet in a writer of prose, if nothing is <lb/>
            added to the meaning by it, is a redundancy. Something <lb/>
            is added to the meaning, if that which said is less without it, <lb/>
            as, 0 abominable wickedness! 0 disgraceful licentiousness! <lb/>
            4 '. But ornamental epithets are most effective when they are <lb/>
            metaphorical; as unbridled desire, ‡ mad piles of building.§ The <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίθετον</foreign> is usually made a trope by the addition of something else <lb/>
            to it, as, in Virgil, Turpis egestas, " base poverty," and Tristis <lb/>
            senectus, "sad old age.”|| But such is the nature of this <lb/>
            ornament, that style, without epithets, appears bare and as it <lb/>
            were graceless, yet is overburdened with them if they be too <lb/>
            numerous. 42. For thus it becomes heavy and embarrassed, <lb/>
            so that you would pronounce it, if used in pleadings, like an <lb/>
            army with as many sutlers as soldiers, the number of which is <lb/>
            doubled but not the strength. However not merely single <lb/>
            epithets, but several together, are often used ; as, <lb/>
            Conjugio Anchisa Veneris dignate superbo,¶ <lb/>
            Cura deûm, bis Pergameis erepte ruinis, <lb/>
            Anchises, with the stately honour grac'd <lb/>

            monwealth, the tempests of the waves for civil wars, and the <lb/>
            harbour for peace and concord. 45. Similar is the exclama­ <lb/>

            " I had indeed heard that your Menalcas had preserved by his <lb/>
            verses all those parts where the hills begin to recede, and to <lb/>
            bend down their summit with a gentle slope, as far as the <lb/>
            water, and the top of the old beech, now broken." 47. For <lb/>
            in these verses all is expressed in unallegorical words, except <lb/>
            the name, by which it is not the shepherd Menalcas, but <lb/>
            Virgil, that is to be understood. Prose frequently admits the <lb/>
            use of such allegory, but rarely pure; it is generally mixed <lb/>
            with plain phraseology. It is pure in the following passage of <lb/>
            Cicero :f For I wonder, and am concerned, that any man <lb/>
            should be so eager to destroy another by his words, as even to <lb/>
            make a leak in the ship in which he himself is sailing. 48. <lb/>
            Of the mixed, which is most frequent, this is an example:‡ <lb/>
            I indeed always thought that other tempests and storms were to <lb/>
            be borne by Milo only amid the waves of popular assemblies; if he <lb/>
            had not added only amid the waves of popular assemblies, it <lb/>
            would have been pure allegory, but he has thus rendered it <lb/>
            mixed. In this sort of language the beauty proceeds from <lb/>
            the metaphorical. words, and the intimation of the sense from <lb/>
            the natural ones.</p>
          <p>49. But by far the most ornamental kind of language is <lb/>
            that in which the graces of the three figures comparison, <lb/>
            allegory, and metaphor, are united. § What sea, what Euripus, <lb/>
            do you suppose to be affected with so many motions, such great <lb/>
            and such various agitations, changes, fluctuations, as the dis­ <lb/>
            turbances and tumults which the proceedings of the comitia <lb/>
            present ? The intermission of one day, or the interval of one <lb/>
            night, often throws everything into confusion, and sometimes the <lb/>
            lightest breath of rumour changes the opinion of the whole <lb/>
            assembly. 50. Care, as in this passage, is, above all things, <lb/>
            to be taken, that, with whatever kind of metaphor we begin, <lb/>
            we conclude with the same; but many speakers, after <lb/>
            commencing with a tempest, end with a fire or the fall of a <lb/>
            bui'ding; an incongruity which is most offensive. <note type="footnote"> It Virgo EcL ix. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> t It is uncertain, says Spalding, to what production of Cicero this <lb/>

          <p>51. Allegory is frequently used by the commonest minds, <lb/>
            and in daily conversation. Those expressions in pleading <lb/>
            causes, to set foot to foot, to aim at the throat, and to draw blood, <lb/>
            are allegorical, and, though now so trite, are not displeasing. <lb/>
            Novelty and variety in style are indeed pleasing; and what <lb/>
            is surprising is, on that account, the more agreeable. But, in <lb/>
            our pursuit of novelty, we have lost all sight of moderation, <lb/>
            and have disfigured the beauties of style by excessive affec­ <lb/>
            tation.</p>
          <p>52. There is allegory in examples, if they are not given <lb/>
            with an explanation accompanying them; as, Dionysius is at <lb/>
            Corinth, is a saying which all the Greeks use, and to which <lb/>
            many similar might be mentioned. An allegory that is very <lb/>
            obscure is called an enigma, which is, in my opinion, a fault <lb/>
            in style, if to speak with perspicuity is a virtue. The poets <lb/>
            however use it: <lb/>
            Die quibus in terris, et eris mihi magnus Apollo, <lb/>
            Tres pateat cœli spatium non amplius ulnas.* <lb/>
            “ Say in what lands, and thou shalt to me be a great Apollo, <lb/>
            the breadth of the sky extends not more than three ells." 53. <lb/>
            Sometimes also orators; as Cælius says, Quadrantariam <lb/>
            Clytæmnestram, et in triclinio Coam, et in cubiculo Nolam, " A <lb/>
            farthing Clytæmnestra, a Coan in the dining-room, and a <lb/>
            Nolan in the chamber.”† Some such enigmas are now solved, <lb/>
            and were, when they were uttered, easier to be interpreted; <note type="footnote"> * Virgil. Eel. ii. 104. </note><note type="footnote"> t These words were directed against Clodia the wife of Metellus, as <lb/>
            appears from the speech of Cicero in defence of Cælius. She was <lb/>
            called Clytæmnestra, as being supposed to have killed her husband. <lb/>
            Spalding. The epithet quadrantaria is one of contempt, insinuating <lb/>
            that her favours were to be had at the lowest possible rate. She is <lb/>
            called a “Coan,” in allusion, doubtless, to coitus; and a “Nolan,” <lb/>
            probably, in reference to the women of Nola, who were said ore <lb/>
            morigerari, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λεσιάζιν</foreign>; at least, says Spalding, such is the opinion of <lb/>
            Florens Christianus ad Aristoph. Vesp. 1337. G. J. Vossius, Orat. iv. <lb/>
            11, 15, p 206, thinks that nola is from nolo, quasi amatores luderet, in <lb/>
            triclinio dicens se velle, sed in cubiculo, cum ad rem ventum esset, nolle; <lb/>
            but this interpretation is incompatible with quadrantaria. Whether <lb/>
            we should read Nolanam for Nolam may be a question; all the manu­ <lb/>
            scripts appear to have Nolam. The French translator in Didot’s <lb/>
            " Collection des Auteurs Latins" renders the passage, " Une Clytem­ <lb/>
            nestre des rues, qui est à table tine femme de Cos, et au lit une femme <lb/>
            de Nole." </note> <pb n="138"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            but they are enigmas nevertheless, and cannot be understood <lb/>
            unless they are interpreted.</p>
          <p>54. In the other kind of allegory, in which what is ex­ <lb/>
            pressed is quite contrary to what is meant, there is irony, <lb/>
            which our rhetoricians call illusio, and which is understood, <lb/>
            either from the mode of delivery, the character of the speaker, <lb/>
            or the nature of the subject; for if any of these be at variance <lb/>
            with the words, it is apparent that the intention is different <lb/>
            from the expression. 55. It is the case, indeed, with regard <lb/>
            to most tropes, that it is requisite to consider what is said <lb/>
            and of whom, because it is doubtless allowable, as is observed <lb/>
            elsewhere,. to censure with pretended praise, and to praise <lb/>
            under the appearance of censure. An example of the first is, <lb/>
            Caius Verves, the city prætor, that upright and careful man, <lb/>
            had no entry in his register of this second choosing of judges,† <lb/>
            Of the second, We pretended to be orators, and imposed upon <lb/>
            the people.‡ 56. Sometimes it is with derision that the con­ <lb/>
            trary to what we wish to be understood is uttered; as Cicero, <lb/>
            in speaking against Clodius,§ says, your integrity, believe me, <lb/>
            has cleared you ; your modesty has rescued you; your past <lb/>
            life has saved you.</p>
          <p>57. There is, besides, another use of allegory, in enabling <lb/>
            us to speak of melancholy things in words of a more cheering <lb/>
            nature, or to signify our meaning, for some good purpose, in <lb/>
            language at variance with it; ..... . ∥ these we have <lb/>
            already specified. If any one does not know by what names <lb/>
            the Greeks call them, let him be informed that they arc <lb/>
            termed <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαϱϰασμό, ὰστε</foreign>ï<foreign xml:lang="grc">μς, ὰντίφϱασις, παϱοιμία</foreign>. 58. There <lb/>
            are, however, some rhetoricians who say that these are not <lb/>
            species of allegory, but tropes ; and they support their opinion <lb/>
            by a very forcible reason ; namely, that allegory is obscure, but <lb/>
            that in all these modes of speaking what we mean is clearly <lb/>
            apparent. To this is added the consideration that a genus, <lb/>
            when distinguished into species, has nothing peculiar to <lb/>
            itself, as tree is distinguished into pine, olive, cypress, etc., <note type="footnote"> * VI. 2,15,16. </note><note type="footnote">t Cicero pro Cluent. c. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> t See sect. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> § A passage from a lost speech of Cicero, made, without doubt, <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.VI.]."/><lb/>
            without retaining any peculiarity to itself; but allegory has <lb/>
            something peculiar; and how could this be the case, if it were <lb/>
            not itself a species ? But whether it be a species or a genus <lb/>
            is of no moment in respect to the use of it.</p>
          <p>59. To the four forms just enumerated is to be added <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυκτηριομός</foreign>, a kind of derision which is dissembled, but not <lb/>
            altogether concealed.</p>
          <p>When that is said in many words which might be said in <lb/>
            one, or certainly in fewer, the Greeks call the figure <foreign xml:lang="grc">περί­ <lb/>
            φρασις</foreign>, “ a circuitous mode of speaking," which is sometimes <lb/>
            necessary, especially when it veils what cannot be plainly <lb/>
            expressed without offence to decency; as in the phrase of <lb/>
            Sallust ad requisite naturœ, “ for the necessities of nature."*</p>
          <p>60. Sometimes its object is merely ornament, as is very <lb/>
            common among the poets : <lb/>
            Tempus erat, quo prima quies mortalibus ægris <lb/>
            Incipit, et dono divum gratissima serpit,†</p>
          <p>" It was the time at which the first sleep commences to <lb/>
            weary mortals, and by the kindness of the gods spreads itself <lb/>
            most gratefully." 61. It is also not uncommon among orators, <lb/>
            but always of a more restricted nature; for whatever might be <lb/>
            stated more briefly, but is for the sake of ornament expressed <lb/>
            more fully, is <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίφρασις</foreign>, to which the Latin name circumlo­ <lb/>
            cutio has been given ; a term indeed not very proper for <lb/>
            designating a beauty of style. But as this figure, when it <lb/>
            gives embellishment to language, is called periphrcuris, so, <lb/>
            when it has a contrary effect, it is termed <foreign xml:lang="grc">περισσολογία</foreign>, “ re­ <lb/>
            dundancy of words," for whatever is not of service, is hurtful</p>
          <p>62. Hyperbaton, also, that is, <unclear>arbitransgressio</unclear>, “ transpo­ <lb/>
            sition of words,” as the harmony and beauty of composition‡ <lb/>
            often require it, we rank, not improperly, among the excel­ <lb/>
            lences of language. For speech would often become rough and <lb/>
            harsh, lax and nerveless, if words should be ranged exactly in <lb/>
            their original order, and if, as each presents itself, it should <lb/>
            be placed side by side of the preceding, though it cannot be <lb/>
            fairly attached to it. 63. Some words and phrases must, <note type="footnote"> * Supposed to be a fragment of Sallust's History. </note><note type="footnote"> t Æn. ii. 268. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The text has comparationis, but we should doubtless read, as <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            therefore, be kept back, others brought forward, and, as in <lb/>
            structures of uuhewn stones, each must be put in the place <lb/>
            which it will fit; for we cannot hew or polish them, in order <lb/>
            that they may close and unite better, but we must use them <lb/>
            as they are and find suitable places for them. 64. Nor can <lb/>
            anything render style harmonious, but judicious changes in <lb/>
            the order of words. It was for no other reason if. that those <lb/>
            four words in which Plato states, in the most noble of his <lb/>
            works, that he had gone down to the Piræeus,† were found <lb/>
            written several ways on his tablets, than because he was <lb/>
            trying to make order contribute as much as possible to <lb/>
            harmony. ‡ 65. When hyperbaton takes place only in two words, <lb/>
            it is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναστϱοϕή</foreign>, or reversio, as mecum, secum, or as, among <lb/>
            orators and historians, Quibus de rebus. But what properly <lb/>
            takes the name of hyperbaton, is the removal of a word to a <lb/>
            distance from its natural place with a view to elegance; as, <lb/>
            Animadverti, judices, omnem accusatoris orationem in duas <lb/>
            divisam esse partes; for in duas partes divisam esse was the <lb/>
            natural order, but would be harsh and inelegant. 66. The <lb/>
            poets, indeed, besides transposing words, also divide them ; as, <lb/>
            Hyperboreo septem subjecta trioni ;§ <lb/>
            a liberty which prose does not tolerate. But the reason for <lb/>
            which such a division of a word is called a trope, is, that <lb/>
            the sense cannot be ascertained but by uniting the two separate <lb/>
            parts ; 67, otherwise, when no alteration is made in the sense, <lb/>
            and the structure only is varied, it may rather be called a <lb/>
            verbal figure ; and many writers diversify their language by <lb/>
            long byperbata of this kind. What inconveniences arise from <lb/>
            confusion of figures, I have noticed in the proper place.∥</p>
          <p>To hyperbole, as being a bolder sort of ornament. I have <lb/>

            Geminique minautur <lb/>
            In cœlum, scopuli,† <lb/>
            Two rocks rise threateningly towards the sky; <lb/>
            or we exaggerate one thing by reference to another; as, <lb/>
            Credas innare revulsas <lb/>
            CycladaSy,‡ <lb/>
            You would have thought the Cyclades uptorn <lb/>
            Were floating on the deep; <lb/>
            69. or by comparison; as, <lb/>
            Fulminis odor alis,§ <lb/>
            Swifter than the wings <lb/>
            Of lightning ; <lb/>
            or by something of a characteristic nature : <lb/>
            Illa vel intactæ segetis per summa volaret <lb/>
            Gramina, nee cursu teneras læsisset aristas,∥ <lb/>
            She o'er the rising tops of untouch'd corn <lb/>
            Would fly, nor in her course the tender ears <lb/>
            Would hurt; <lb/>
            or by a metaphor, as in the word volaret, “ would fly." 70. <lb/>
            Sometimes, too, one hyperbole is increased by the addition of <lb/>
            another, as Cicero, in speaking against Antony,¶ says, What <lb/>
            Charybdis was ever so voracious ? what Charybdis, do I say ? <lb/>
            If such a monster ever existed, it was but one animal, but the <lb/>
            whole ocean, by Hercules, would scarcely have been able, as it <lb/>
            seems to me, to have swallowed up so many things, so widely <lb/>
            dispersed, and lying in places so distant, in so short a space of <lb/>
            time! 71 But I have noticed, as I think, an exquisite figure <lb/>
            of this kind in Pindar, the prince of lyric poets, in the book <lb/>
            which he has called <unclear/>*<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υμνοι</foreign> : for he says, that the impetuosity <lb/>
            of Hercules in attacking the Meropes, who are said to have <lb/>
            dwelt in the island of Cos, was comparable neither to fire, nor <lb/>
            wind, nor the sea, but to lightning, as if other objects were <note type="footnote"> * Cicero Philipp. ii 25. </note><note type="footnote">t Æn. i. 162. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Æn. viiL 691. </note><note type="footnote">§ Æn. v. 319. </note><note type="footnote"> ∥ Æn. vii. 808. </note><note type="footnote">¶ Philipp. ii. 27. </note> <pb n="142"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.VIII."/><lb/>
            insufficient, and lightning only suitable, to give a notion of his <lb/>
            rapidity.. 72 This Cicerot †may be thought to have imitated, <lb/>
            when he said of Verres, There arose in Sicily, after a long <lb/>
            interval of time, not a Dionysius, nor a Phalaris, (for that <lb/>
            island, in days of old, produced many cruel tyrants,) but a <lb/>
            monster of a new kind, though endued with that ferocity which is <lb/>
            said to have prevailed in those parts; since I believe that no <lb/>
            Charybdis or Scylla was ever so destructive to ships in those <lb/>
            seas as he was. 73. There are also as many modes of ex­ <lb/>
            tenuating as of magnifying: Virgil says of a flock of lean <lb/>
            sheep, <lb/>
            Vix ossibus hœrent, ‡ <lb/>
            They scarcely hang together by their bones. <lb/>
            Or, as Cicero says, in a book of jests, <lb/>
            Fundum Varro vocal, quem possim mittere fundâ, <lb/>
            Ni tamen exciderit quà cava funda patet.§ <lb/>
            But even in the use of the hyperbole some moderation must <lb/>
            be observed; for though every hyperbole is beyond belief, it <lb/>
            ought not to be extravagant; since, in no other way do writers <lb/>
            more readily fall into <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαϰοζηλία</foreign>, "exorbitant affectation." 74. I <lb/>
            should be sorry to produce the vast number of absurdities that <lb/>
            have sprung from this source, especially as they are by no <lb/>
            means unknown or concealed. It is sufficient to remark, that <lb/>
            the hyperbole lies, but not so as to intend to deceive by lying; <lb/>
            and we ought, therefore, the more carefully to consider, how <lb/>
            far it becomes us to exaggerate that in which we shall not be <note type="footnote"> * This work of Pindar is lost. Burmann observes that there are <lb/>

            doubtful, for it appears to have been inserted by Aldus Manutius <lb/>
            merely on conjecture; some manuscripts have veto, others vecto, others <lb/>

            believed. It very often raises a laugh; and if the laugh <unclear>bo</unclear> <lb/>
            on the side of the speaker, the hyperbole gains the praise of <lb/>
            wit, but, if otherwise, the stigma of folly. 75. It is in common <lb/>
            use, as much among the unlearned as among the learned; <lb/>
            because there is in all men a natural propensity to magnify or <lb/>
            extenuate what comes before them, and no one is contented <lb/>
            with the exact truth. But such departure from the truth is <lb/>
            pardoned, because we do not affirm what is false. 76. In a <lb/>
            word, the hyperbole is a beauty, when the thing itself, of <lb/>
            which we have to speak, is in its nature extraordinary; for we <lb/>
            are then allowed to say a little more than the truth, because <lb/>
            the exact truth cannot be said; and language is more efficient <lb/>
            when it goes beyond reality than when it stops short of it. <lb/>

            them, 4—6. Name not of great importance, 7—9. The word <lb/>
            Figure is taken by some in a more extended, by others in a more <lb/>
            confined, sense, 10—14. Two kinds of figures, those of thought <lb/>
            and those of words, 15—18. Of figures of thought, 19—21 <lb/>
            Some make them too numerous, 22—24. Quotation from Cicero <lb/>
            de Oratore, 26—36. Another from Cicero's Orator, 37—45.</p>
          <p>1. As I have treated, in the preceding book, concerning <lb/>
            tropes, there now follows that part of my work which relates <lb/>
            to figures, (they are in Greek called <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήματα</foreign>,) and which is <lb/>
            by the nature of the subject connected with what goes before; <lb/>
            for many have considered that figures are tropes; because, <lb/>
            whether tropes take their name from being formed in a par­ <lb/>
            ticular way, or from making changes in language, (whence <lb/>
            they are also called motus,*) it must be acknowledged that <lb/>
            both those peculiarities are found equally in figures. 2. The <lb/>
            ase of them is also the same; for they add force to our <lb/>
            thoughts, and confer a grace upon them. Nor have authors <lb/>
            been wanting to give tropes the name of figures, among whom <lb/>
            is Cams Artorius Proculus.† 3. The resemblance between <lb/>
            them is indeed so striking, that it is not easy for every one to <lb/>
            tell the difference; for though some species of both are <lb/>
            evidently distinct, (even while there still remains a general <lb/>
            similarity in their nature, inasmuch as they both deviate from <lb/>
            simple and direct language for the purpose of adding to the <lb/>
            beauties of style,) yet others are divided by a very narrow <lb/>
            boundary, as irony, for example, which is numbered as well <lb/>
            among figures of thought as among tropes ;‡ while as to peri­ <lb/>
            phrasis, and hyperbaton, and onomatopœia, even eminent <lb/>
            authors have called them figures of speech rather than tropes.</p>
          <p>4. The difference between them, therefore, requires the <note type="footnote"> * See viii. 5, 35. </note><note type="footnote"> f Of this writer, supposing the name to be correct, the learned <lb/>
            know nothing, unless he be the Artorius mentioned by Festus under <lb/>

            refers us. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> a V. 10, 44. </note> <pb n="145"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I.]."/><lb/>
            more carefully to be specified. A TROPE, then, is an expres­ <lb/>
            sion turned from its natural and principal signification to <lb/>
            another, for the purpose of adorning style; or, as most of the <lb/>
            grammarians define it, an expression altered from the sense in <lb/>
            which it is proper to one in which it is not proper. A FIGURE <lb/>
            (as is indicated by its very name) is a form of speech differing <lb/>
            from the common and ordinary mode of expression.* 5. In <lb/>
            tropes, accordingly, some words are substituted for others, <lb/>
            as in metaphor, metonymy, antonomasia, metalepsis, synec­ <lb/>
            doche, catachresis, allegory, and, generally, in hyperbole, <lb/>
            which has place, however, both in matter and in words. <lb/>
            Onomatopœia is the coining of a word, which word is then <lb/>
            put for some other word or words which we should have used <lb/>
            if we had not coined it. 6. Periphrasis, though it commonly <lb/>
            fills up the place of the term instead of which it is used, <lb/>
            employs several words for one. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίθετον</foreign>, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            generally partakes of the antonomasia, becomes, by union with <lb/>
            it, a trope.. In the hyperbaton there is a change of order, <lb/>
            and many, therefore, exclude that kind of figure from among <lb/>
            tropes ; it transfers, however, a word, or part of a word,† from <lb/>
            its own place to another. 7. Nothing of this sort is necessary <lb/>
            to figures ; for a figure may consist of natural words arranged <lb/>
            in their common order. As to irony, how it comes to be <lb/>
            sometimes a trope, and sometimes a figure, I shall explain in <lb/>
            the proper place ;‡ for I allow that the two appellations are <lb/>
            applied to it indifferently, and I am aware what complicated <lb/>
            and subtle disputations the question about the name has <lb/>
            originated; but they have no relation to my present object; <lb/>
            and it is of no importance how a trope or a figure is termed, <lb/>
            provided it be understood of what use it is in style. 8. The <lb/>
            nature of things is not changed by a change in their appella­ <lb/>
            tions ; and as men, if they take a name different from that <lb/>
            which they had, are still the same persons, so the forms of <lb/>
            expression, of which we are speaking, whether they be called <lb/>
            tropes or figures, are still of the same efficacy, for their use <lb/>
            does not consist in their name but in their influence ; just as <lb/>
            in regard to the state of a cause, it is of no consequence <note type="footnote"> * We speak in a trope, and adopt the antonomasia, when we use <lb/>
            Pelides, for example, by itself, for Achilles. If we use the two in con­ <lb/>
            junction, Achilles Pelides, " Achilles, son of Peleus," Pelides is but an <lb/>
            epitheton. See viii. 6, 29; vi. 3, 69. </note><note type="footnote"> t As in the verse of Virgil cited viii. go <unclear>66</unclear>. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ C. 2, sect. 44. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            whether we call it the conjectural, or the negative, or one about <lb/>
            fact, or the existence of a thing,- provided we understand that the <lb/>
            question is the same. 9. It will, therefore, be best, in respect <lb/>
            to forms of speech, to adopt the terms generally received, and <lb/>
            to endeavour to comprehend the thing, by whatever name it <lb/>
            be called. It is to be observed, however, that the trope and <lb/>
            the figure often meet in the same sentences; for style is <lb/>
            diversified as well by metaphorical words, as by words in their <lb/>
            natural sense.†</p>
          <p>10. But there is no small disagreement among authors, as <lb/>
            to what is the exact sense of the word figure, and how many <lb/>
            genera of figures there are, and how many and what species. <lb/>
            We must, therefore, first of all consider what we are to under­ <lb/>
            stand by the word figure; for it is used in two senses; <lb/>
            signifying, in the one, any form of words, whatever it may be, <lb/>
            as bodies, of whatever they be composed, have some certain <lb/>
            shape ; in the other, in which it is properly termed a figure, <lb/>
            any deviation, either in thought or expression, from the <lb/>
            ordinary and simple method of speaking, as our bodies assume <lb/>
            different postures when we sit, lie, or look back. 11. When, <lb/>
            therefore, a speaker or writer uses constantly, or too frequently, <lb/>
            the same cases, or tenses, or numbers, or even feet, we gene­ <lb/>
            rally admonish him to vary his figures in order to avoid <lb/>
            uniformity. 12. In using this expression, we speak as if all <lb/>
            language had its figure; as also when we say that cursitare is <lb/>
            of the same figure as lectitare, that is, is formed in the same <lb/>
            way. If we adopt the first and general sense, then, there <lb/>
            will be no part of language that is not figured; and if we con­ <lb/>
            fine ourselves to that sense, we must consider that Apollodorus <lb/>
            (if we trust the report of Cæcilius) justly thought that precepts <lb/>
            on this head would be numberless. 13. But if particular <lb/>
            habits, and, as it were, gestures of language, are to receive this <lb/>
            designation, that only must here be regarded as a figure, which <lb/>
            deviates, by poetical or oratorical phraseology, from the simple <lb/>
            and ordinary modes of speaking. Thus we shall be right in <lb/>
            saying that one sort of style is or destitute of <lb/>
            figures, (and this is no small fault,) and another <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσχημάτιστον</foreign>, <lb/>
            or diversified with figures. 14. This sense of the word, <lb/>
            however, Zoilus ‡ limited too narrowly, for he thought that <note type="footnote"> * See iii 6, 15, 39. </note><note type="footnote">+ Comp. sect. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The same Zoilus that assailed Homer. He wrote on rhetoric, <lb/>
            grammar, and various other subjects. </note> <pb n="147"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I.]."/><lb/>
            only a figure In which something is pretended to be said <lb/>
            different from what is really said, and I know that the word <lb/>
            figure is vulgarly taken in this sense; whence certain subjects <lb/>
            for exercise in oratory, of which I shall speak a little farther <lb/>
            on, are called figurative * Let the definition of a figure, then, <lb/>
            be a form of speech artfully varied from common usage.</p>
          <p>15. Some rhetoricians have thought that there was but one <lb/>
            kind of figures ; though they were led to adopt that opinion by <lb/>
            different considerations ; for some said that all figures lay in <lb/>
            words, because a change in the words produced a change also <lb/>
            in the thought; others said that they all lay in the thought, <lb/>
            because it is to thoughts that words are adapted. 16. But <lb/>
            with both these parties there is evident sophistry; for the <lb/>
            same things are constantly expressed in different ways, and <lb/>
            the thought remains the same while the language is altered ; <lb/>
            and a figure of thought may be expressed in various figures of <lb/>
            words ; for the one figure lies in a conception of the mind, and <lb/>
            the other in the expression of that conception; but they are <lb/>
            frequently found in union ; as in the sentence, Jamjam, <lb/>
            DolabeUa, neque me tui, neque tuorum liberûm, &amp;c., " Now, <lb/>
            Dolabella, I have no pity for you, or for your children," &amp;c.† <lb/>
            For the conversion of the address from the judge to Dolabella‡ <lb/>
            lies in the thought; jamjam and liberûm are figures of words.</p>
          <p>17. It is admitted, then, as far as I know, among most authors, <lb/>
            that there are two kinds of figures, those of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διανοία</foreign>, that is, of <lb/>
            thought, mens, sensus, or sententiæ, for they are designated by all <lb/>
            those terms, and those of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέζις</foreign>, that is, of words, or diction, or <lb/>
            expression, or language, or speech, for they have various <lb/>
            names, and it is of no consequence by which name we call <lb/>
            them. 18. Cornelius Celsus, however, adds to figures of <lb/>
            speech and thoughtfigures of complexion,∥ allowing himself to <note type="footnote"> * In which there is something ironical, simulatory, or dissimulatory. <lb/>

            he swayed, assuredly, by too great fondness for novelty; for <lb/>
            who can suppose that such a man, learned in other respects, <lb/>
            did not see that figures of complexion must be figures of <lb/>
            thought?† Figures, therefore, like every part of language <lb/>
            must necessarily lie either in thought or in words.</p>
          <p>19. But as it is the order of nature that we should conceive <lb/>
            moughts in the mind before we enunciate them, I must <lb/>
            accordingly speak first of those figures that relate to thought; <lb/>
            figures of which the influence is so extensive and so various, <lb/>
            that it makes itself apparent, with the utmost conspicuousness, <lb/>
            in every part of oratory; for though it may seem to be of <lb/>
            little importance in establishing a proof in what figure our <lb/>
            arguments are advanced, yet figures make what we say proba­ <lb/>
            ole, and penetrate imperceptibly into the mind of the judge. <lb/>
            20. Indeed, as, in a passage of arms, itis easy to see, parry, <lb/>
            and ward off direct and undisguised strokes,‡ while side-blows <lb/>
            and feints are less observable, and as it is a proof of art to aim <lb/>
            at one part when you intend to hit another, so that kind of <lb/>
            oratory which is free from artifice can fight only with its own <lb/>
            mere weight and force, but such as disguises and varies its <lb/>
            attacks can assail the flank or rear of an enemy, can turn <lb/>
            aside his weapons, and deceive him as it were with a nod. <lb/>
            21. Over the feelings nothing has greater power; for if the <lb/>
            look, the eyes, the gesture of a speaker has a powerful effect <lb/>
            on the mind, how much more influence must the air, as it <lb/>
            were, of his speech have, when adapted to make the impres­ <lb/>
            sion which he desires ? But the greatest power of figures is <lb/>
            shown in rendering oratory attractive, either by giving plausi­ <lb/>
            bility to the character of the speaker, by securing favour to his <lb/>
            cause, by relieving weariness with variety, or by presenting <lb/>
            certain points in a more becoming or safe light.</p>
          <p>22. Before I proceed, however, to show what kinds of <lb/>
            figures are applicable to particular subjects, I must observe <lb/>
            that they are far from being so numerous as many writers <lb/>
            represent them; for all those names of figures, which it <lb/>
            is so easy for the Greeks to invent, have no influence with <lb/>
            me. 23. First of all, therefore, those who think that there <lb/>
            are as many figures as there are affections of the mind, are <lb/>
            to be utterly disregarded; not because an affection of the <note type="footnote">t Colores et sententias sensûs esse.] These words seem to be in soma <lb/>
            way : corrupt. Some editions have <unclear>sensuura</unclear>, by which nothing is <unclear>gained</unclear>. </note><note type="footnote"> See note on v. 13. 54. </note> <pb n="149"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="C.2.]."/><lb/>
            mind is not a certain condition of it, but because a figure <lb/>
            (of which we now speak, not in its general, but in its re­ <lb/>
            stricted sense,) is not a mere expression of any condition of <lb/>
            the mind whatever. To testify anger, therefore, in speaking, <lb/>
            or grief, or pity, or fear, or confidence, or contempt, is not to <lb/>
            use a figure, any more than to advise, or threaten, or entreat, <lb/>
            or excuse. 24. But what deceives those who do not consider <lb/>
            the question sufficiently, is, that they find figurative expres­ <lb/>
            sions in all such modes of thought, and produce examples of <lb/>
            them from speeches; a task by no means difficult, since there <lb/>
            is no part of oratory which is not open to figures; but it is <lb/>
            one thing to admit afigure and another to be a figure ; for I shall <lb/>
            not shun the frequent repetition of the same word for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of thoroughly explaining the thing. 25. My opponents, <lb/>
            I know, will point to figures in orators expressing anger, or <lb/>
            pity, or entreaty; but to be angry, or to pity, or to entreat, will not <lb/>
            for that reason be a figure. Cicero, indeed, includes all the <lb/>
            embellishments of oratory under this head, adopting, as I con­ <lb/>
            eider, a kind of middle course; not intimating, on the one <lb/>
            hand, that all sorts of phrases are to be regarded as figures, nor, <lb/>
            on the other, those only which assume a form at variance with <lb/>
            common usage ; but making all such expressions figurative as <lb/>
            are most brilliant, and most effective in impressing an au­ <lb/>
            dience. This judgment of his, which he has delivered in two <lb/>
            of his works, I subjoin word for word, that I may not with­ <lb/>
            hold from the reader the opinion of that eminent author.</p>
          <p>26. In the third book De Oratore,* is the following passage: <lb/>
            “ But with regard to the composition of words, when we <lb/>
            have acquired that smoothness of junction, and harmony of <lb/>
            numbers, which I have explained, our whole style of oratory <lb/>
            is to be distinguished and frequently interspersed with bril­ <lb/>
            liant lights, as it were, of thoughts and of language. 27. For <lb/>
            the dwelling on a single circumstance has often a considerable <lb/>
            effect; and a clear illustration, and exhibition of matters to <lb/>
            the eye of the audience,! almost as if they were transacted <lb/>
            before them. This has wonderful influence in giving a repre­ <lb/>
            sentation of any affair, both to illustrate what is represented. <lb/>
            and to amplify it; so that the point which we magnify may <lb/>
            appear to the audience to be really as great as the powers of <lb/>
            our language can represent it. Opposed to this is rapid <lb/>
            transition over a thing, which may often be practised. There <note type="footnote"> * a 52. 52. </note><note type="footnote">t Quint. ix. 2, 40. </note> <pb n="150"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            is also signification that more is to be understood than you <lb/>
            have expressed, distinct and concise brevity, and extenuation; <lb/>
            28. and, what borders upon this, ridicule, not very different <lb/>
            from that which was the object of Cæsar's* instructions; and <lb/>
            digression from the subject, and, when gratification has thus <lb/>
            been afforded, the return to the subject ought to be happy and <lb/>
            elegant: proposition of what you are about to say, transition <lb/>
            from what has been said, and return to the subject; repetition; <lb/>
            apt conclusion of reasoning; 29. exaggeration or surpassing of <lb/>
            the truth for the sake of amplification or diminution; interro <lb/>
            gation, and, akin to this, as it were, consideration or seeming <lb/>
            inquiry, followed by the delivery of your own opinion; and <lb/>
            dissimulation, the humour of saying one thing and signifying <lb/>
            another, which steals into the minds of men in a peculiar <lb/>
            manner, and which is extremely pleasing when it is well <lb/>
            managed, not in a vehement strain of language, but in a <lb/>
            conversational style; 30. also doubt, and distribution; and <lb/>
            correction of yourself, either before or after you have said a <lb/>
            thing, or when you repel any thing from yourself; there is <lb/>
            also premunition, with regard to what you are going to prove; <lb/>
            there is the transference of blame to another person; there is <lb/>
            communication or consultation, as it were, with the audience <lb/>
            before whom you are speaking; imitation of manners and <lb/>
            character, either with names of persons or without, which is a <lb/>
            great ornament to a speech, and adapted to conciliate the <lb/>
            feelings even in the utmost degree, and often also to rouse <lb/>
            them; 31. the introduction of fictitious characters, the most <lb/>
            heightened figure of exaggeration; there is description; <lb/>
            falling into a wilful mistake; excitement of the audience to <lb/>
            cheerfulness; anticipation; comparison and example, two <lb/>
            figures which have a very great effect; division; interruption; <lb/>
            contrast; t suppression; commendation; 32. a certain freedom <lb/>
            and even uncontrolledness of language for the purpose of exagge­ <lb/>
            ration; anger; reproach; promise; deprecation; beseeching; <lb/>
            slight deviation from your intended course, but not like <lb/>
            digression, which I mentioned before; expurgation; concilia­ <lb/>
            tion; attack; wishing; execration. 33. Such are the figures <lb/>
            in which thoughts give lustre to speech. <note type="footnote"> * One of the speakers in Cicero De Oratore ; see b. ii. c. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> f Contention Ellendt, on Cicero de Oratore, supposes that by this <lb/>
            word some species of comparison is meant. Turneb' s thinks that it <lb/>
            in equivalent to the Greek <unclear>δεινωσι</unclear>, “vehemence." </note></p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.I.]."/><pb n="151"/>
            
          <p>" Of words themselves, as of arms, there is a sort of <lb/>
            threatening and attack for use, and also a management for <lb/>
            grace. For the reiteration of words has sometimes a peculiar <lb/>
            force, and sometimes elegance; as well as the variation or <lb/>
            deflexion of a word from its common signification; and the <lb/>
            frequent repetition of the same word in the beginning, and <lb/>
            recurrence to it at the end, of a period ; forcible emphasis on <lb/>
            the same words; conjunction ;* adjunction; progression ;t a <lb/>
            sort of distinction as to some word often used; the recall of a <lb/>
            word; the use of words also which end similarly, or have <lb/>
            similar cadences, or which balance one another, or which cor­ <lb/>
            respond to one another. 34. There is also a certain gradation, <lb/>
            a conversion,‡ an elegant transposition of words; there is anti­ <lb/>
            thesis, asyndeton, declination,§ reprehension,|| exclamation, dimi­ <lb/>
            nution;¶ and the use of the same word in different cases; the <lb/>
            referring of what is derived from many particulars to each <lb/>
            particular singly; reasoning subservient to your proposition, <lb/>
            and reasoning suited to the order of distribution; concession; <lb/>

            the figures, and others like these, or there may even be more, <lb/>
            which adorn language by peculiarities in thought and in <lb/>
            structure of style."</p>
          <p>Most of these forms of language, though not all, are men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the Orator,§ and with somewhat greater distinctness; <lb/>
            for, after having spoken of figures of speech and thought, he <lb/>
            adds a third division, relating, as he says, to other virtues, as <lb/>
            they may be called, of style :</p>
          <p>37. “Those other illuminations, so to speak, which are derived <lb/>
            from the arrangement of words, add great splendour to lan­ <lb/>
            guage ; for they are like what are called, in the full decoration <lb/>
            of a theatre or forum, the insignia, or ‘ most striking objects,' <lb/>
            not as being the only ornaments, but as being more remarkable <lb/>
            than any of . the others. 38. Such is the effect of what are <lb/>
            called illuminations, and, as it were, insignia, of language; <lb/>
            for the mind of the hearer is necessarily struck when words are <lb/>
            repeated and reiterated, or reproduced with a slight change; or <lb/>
            when several sentences are begun or ended, or both, with the <lb/>
            same word; or when the same word or phrase is doubled, <lb/>
            either in the body or at the close of a sentence; or when <lb/>
            one word constantly recurs, but not in the same sense; or <lb/>
            when words are used in the same cases and with the same ter­ <lb/>
            minations; 39. or when words of a contrary sense are in various <lb/>
            ways opposed; or when the force of the language advances <lb/>
            upwards step by step; or when conjunctions are omitted, and <lb/>
            several words or phrases are uttered without connexion; or <lb/>
            when we pass over some points, and explain why we do so ; or <lb/>
            when we correct ourselves, with an air of censure; or when <lb/>
            any exclamation, of surprise or complaint, is used; or when <lb/>
            the cases of the same word are frequently changed.</p>
          <p>40. “But the figures of thought are of a much higher cha­ <lb/>
            racter ; and. as Demosthenes uses them very frequently, there <lb/>
            are some who think it is from them that his eloquence receives <lb/>
            its greatest excellence; for scarcely any subject, indeed, is <lb/>

            thought; and, to say the truth, to speak like an orator is <lb/>
            nothing else than to illumine all our thoughts, or at least the <lb/>
            greater part of them, with some appearance of brilliancy. <lb/>
            41. But as you, Brutus,* have a thorough knowledge of the <lb/>
            varieties of thoughts, why should I give names or examples ? <lb/>
            Only let the subject be noted in your memory.</p>
          <p>" The orator, therefore, whom we desire to see, will speak in <lb/>
            such a way as to present one and the same thing under <lb/>
            different aspects; and to rest and dwell upon the same <lb/>
            thought. 42. Often, too, he will speak so as to extenuate <lb/>
            some point; often so as to throw ridicule on something; or so <lb/>
            as to decline and turn aside his course of thought from his <lb/>
            object; to state what he designs to say; to pronounce a <lb/>
            conclusive decision when he has dispatched any point; to <lb/>
            retrace his steps occasionally, and repeat what he has said ; <lb/>
            to wind up a course of argumentation with fresh proofs; to <lb/>
            press his adversary with questions ; to reply to questions put <lb/>
            as it were by himself; to intimate that he is to be understood <lb/>
            and regarded as meaning something different from what he <lb/>
            says; 43. to express doubt what he should say in preference <lb/>
            to something else, and how he should say it; to divide his <lb/>
            matter into heads; to omit or disregard some points that he <lb/>
            has specified ; to fortify some by anticipation; to throw blame <lb/>
            upon his adversary for the very things for which he himself <lb/>
            is censured ; to seem to consult, at times, with his audience, <lb/>
            and occasionally even with his opponent; 44. to describe <lb/>
            the characters and conversations of men; to introduce dumb <lb/>
            objects as speaking; to divert the attention from the subject <lb/>
            which is under discussion ; to excite the audience, frequently, <lb/>
            to mirth and laughter; to obviate objections that he sees <lb/>
            likely to arise; to compare similar cases; to adduce ex­ <lb/>
            amples; to make distinctions of persons, attributing one <lb/>
            thing to one, and another to another; to check the interrup <lb/>
            tions of his adversary ; to observe that he is silent on certain <lb/>
            particulars ; to show on what points the judge must be on his <lb/>
            guard ; to hazard at times the boldest assertions ; to manifest <lb/>
            even anger; to utter reproaches now and then ; to use depre­ <lb/>
            cation and entreaty; to remove unfavourable impressions; to <lb/>
            digress a little from his subject ;f to utter wishes or execra­ <note type="footnote"> * To whom Cicero'a Orator is addressed. </note><note type="footnote"> + Ut aproposito declinet aliquantulum.] A repetition apparently made by <lb/>

            by his eloquence, before the eyes of his hearers ; he will <lb/>
            amplify it beyond what can possibly have taken place; what <lb/>
            he intimates will often be more than what he says ; he will <lb/>
            often assume cheerfulness, and indulge in an imitation of life <lb/>
            and nature. By such means (for you see as it were a forest* <lb/>

          <p>Quintilian makes figures less numerous than Cicero and some other <lb/>
            writers, § 1—5. Of interrogation, 6—15. Of prolepsis or antici. <lb/>
            pation, 16—18. Doubt, 19. Communication or pretence of con­ <lb/>
            sultation with the audience, 20—24. Permission, 25. Modes of <lb/>
            simulation, 26—29. Of personification, 30—33. Pretended <lb/>
            writings, and parodies, 34, 35. Other fiction of persons, 36, 37. <lb/>
            Apostrophe, 38, 39. Vivid or representative narration and <lb/>
            description, 40—43. Irony, 44—53. Aposiopesis, 54—57. Of <lb/>
            imitation of other persons’ manner, and some other figures, 58— <lb/>
            63. Emphasis, 64. Of figuratæ controversiæ, causes in which <lb/>
            figurative language is adopted, 65, 66. Such language is used <lb/>
            when it is unsafe to speak plainly, 67—75. When respect for <lb/>
            some person puts a restraint on the speaker, 76—95. Or where a <lb/>
            fairer opportunity for speaking is sought, 96—99. Comparison, <lb/>
            100, 101. Other figures mentioned by different writers, 101—107.</p>
          <p>1. HE, therefore, who shall think proper to consider the figures <lb/>
            of words and thought in a more extensive sense than I myself <lb/>
            contemplate them, will have something to follow; nor would <lb/>
            I venture to say that anything can be offered on the subject <lb/>
            better than what Cicero has stated ; but I would wish him to <lb/>
            read Cicero's remarks with a reference to my views; for I <lb/>
            purpose to treat only of those figures of thought which deviate <lb/>
            from common modes of expression; a method which has been <lb/>
            adopted, I observe, by many extremely learned men. 2. All <lb/>
            those embellishments of language, however, even such as are <lb/>
            of a different kind, are such necessary qualities of oratory, <lb/>
            that a speech could scarcely be imagined to be produced <lb/>
            without them ; for how can a judge be instructed, if there be <note type="footnote"> * Silvam.] I have translated this word “forest.” There may be an <lb/>
            allusion to the sort of silva mentioned in x. 3. 17. </note> <pb n="155"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/><lb/>
            wanting lucid explanation, statement, offer of proofs, definition <lb/>
            of the point in question, distinction, exposition of the speaker's <lb/>
            own opinion, just conclusion from arguments, anticipation of <lb/>
            objections, comparisons, examples, digestion and distribution of <lb/>
            matter, occasional interruption of our opponent, restraint on <lb/>
            him when he interrupts ourselves, assertion, justification, de­ <lb/>
            structive attacks? 3. What could eloquence do at all, if the <lb/>
            privileges of amplification and extenuation were withheld from <lb/>
            it ? amplification, which gives an intimation of more than has <lb/>
            been expressed, that is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔμϕασις</foreign>, and which allows us to go <lb/>
            beyond and exceed reality; extenuation, which includes dimi­ <lb/>
            nution and palliation. What strong impressions on the <lb/>
            feelings would be made, without boldness of speech, without <lb/>
            giving the rein to passion, without invectives, wishes, and impre­ <lb/>
            cations ? Or what gentler impressions, unless they be promoted <lb/>
            by recommendation of ourselves to our hearers, by conciliating <lb/>
            their good-will, and exciting them to cheerfulness ? 4. What <lb/>
            pleasure could be afforded, or what indication even of mode­ <lb/>
            rate learning, by a speaker, if he knew not how to enforce <lb/>
            some points by repetition, and others by dwelling upon them; <lb/>
            how to make a digression, and return to his subject; how to <lb/>
            remove a charge from himself, and transfer it to another; and <lb/>
            -how to judge what particulars should be omitted, or represented <lb/>
            as important ? In such arts consists the life and energy of <lb/>
            oratory; and, if they be taken from it, it is spiritless, and <lb/>
            wants as it were a soul to animate its body. 5. But these <lb/>
            qualities ought not only be found in eloquence, but also to be <lb/>
            variously dispersed throughout it, that they may charm the <lb/>
            auditor with every kind of melody, such as we perceive pro­ <lb/>
            duced from musical instruments. These excellences, how­ <lb/>
            ever, generally present themselves obviously; they do not <lb/>
            disguise, but manifest themselves. Yet they admit, as I <lb/>
            said,. of figures, as may be sufficiently proved from the figure <lb/>
            of which I shall immediately proceed to speak.</p>
          <p>6. What is more common than interrogare, “to ask,” or <lb/>
            percontari, "to question?” for we use both terms indifferently, <lb/>
            though one seems to apply properly to mere desire of informa­ <lb/>
            tion, and the other to that of establishing proof. But the <lb/>
            thing itself, by whatever name it be distinguished, is suscepti­ <lb/>
            ble of many varieties of figure. Let us begin with those by <lb/>
            which proof, to which I have given the first place, is rendered <note type="footnote"> * C. 1. sect. 24 </note> <pb n="156"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            more strong and efficacious.* 7. It is a simple interrogation to <lb/>
            say, <lb/>
            Sed vos qui tandem ? quibus aut venistis ab oris ?t <lb/>
            But who are you, or from what coasts arriv'd ? <lb/>
            But it is an interrogation with a figure, when it is adopted, <lb/>
            not for the sake of seeking information, but in order to attack <lb/>
            the person interrogated ; for example, What was your drawn <lb/>
            sword doing, Tubero, in the field of Pharsalia ?‡ and, How <lb/>
            long, I pray, Catiline, will you abuse our patience ? Do you <lb/>
            not see that your machinations are discovered?§ and so on, <lb/>
            through the whole of the passage. 8. How much more ani­ <lb/>
            mated is such a mode of expression than to say, You abuse <lb/>
            Cur patience a long time; your machinations are discovered. <lb/>
            We sometimes ask, also, concerning what cannot be denied; <lb/>
            as, Has Caius Fidiculanius Falcula, I pray, been brought to <lb/>
            judgment ! || Or when to find an answer is difficult; as we <lb/>
            say in common conversation, How? How is it possible? Or <lb/>
            to throw odium on the person to whom we address ourselves; <lb/>
            as Medea says in Seneca, Quas peti terras jubes ? “What <lb/>
            land do you command me to seek ?” 9. Or to excite pity; as <lb/>
            Sinon in Virgil, <lb/>
            Heu quæ me tellus, inquit, quæ me æquora possunt <lb/>
            Accipere t ** <lb/>
            Alas ! what land, he cries, what seas, can now <lb/>
            Receive me ? <lb/>
            Or to press our opponent, and deprive him of all ground for <lb/>
            pretending not to understand us; as Asinius Pollio said, <lb/>
            Do you hear? We are attacking the will of a madman, I say, <lb/>
            not of a person who merely failed in his duty. 10. Interro­ <lb/>
            gation is indeed subservient to various purposes. It assists <lb/>
            in expressing indignation : <note type="footnote"> * Incipiamus enim ab iis quibus acrior et vehementior fit probatio, <lb/>
            quod primo loco posui.] A passage about which I know not what reader <lb/>
            will satisfy himself. The words quod primo loco posui are supposed by <lb/>
            Spalding to refer to sect. 2, where to prove to the judge, and convince <lb/>
            him, seems to be spoken of as the chief object of oratory, but he <lb/>
            remarks that others might choose rather to refer them to interrogare. <lb/>
            Capperonier, for probatio, has inserted in his text rogatio, but oral io, <lb/>
            which had also suggested itself to him, was surely preferable. </note><note type="footnote"> + An. i. 369. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Cic.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/><lb/>
            Et quisquam numen Junonis adoret ? * <lb/>
            And will any one adore <lb/>
            The deity of Juno ? <lb/>
            And wonder: <lb/>
            — Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, <lb/>
            Auri sacra fames ? t <lb/>
            To what dost thou not mortal breasts impel, <lb/>
            O direful thirst of gold ?</p>
          <p>1 ]. Sometimes it is a more spirited form of command ; as. <lb/>
            Non arma expedient, totâque ex urbe sequentur ? ‡ <lb/>
            Will they not arms prepare, and forth pursue <lb/>
            From all the city ? <lb/>
            Sometimes we ask ourselves ; as in Terence, <lb/>
            Quid igitur faciam ? § <lb/>
            What shall I do, then ?</p>
          <p>12. A figure is sometimes adopted, too, in a reply; as <lb/>
            when a person asks a question about one thing, and a reply is <lb/>
            made to him about another more to the respondent's purpose. <lb/>
            This may be done, for example, with the view of aggravating <lb/>
            a charge ; as when a witness against an accused person, being <lb/>
            asked, Whether he had been beaten with a stick by the accused, <lb/>
            replied, Although I was innocent || or with the view of <lb/>
            eluding a charge ; which is a more frequent case ; as when the <lb/>
            question is, I ask whether you have killed a man, and the <lb/>
            reply given is, A robber; or, Have you seized upon an estate ? <lb/>
            My own.¶ 13. Or an answer may be given in such a way <lb/>
            that defence may precede confession; as in Virgil's Bucolics,** <lb/>
            where one shepherd says to another, <lb/>
            Non ego te vidi Damonis, pessime, caprum <lb/>
            Excipere insidiis ? <lb/>
            Did I not see you, rascal, catch a goat <lb/>
            Of Damon's in a snare ? <lb/>
            the reply is, <lb/>
            An mihi cantando victus non redderet ille I <lb/>
            Did he not, overcome in song, refuse <lb/>
            To give it me ?</p>
          <p>14. Similar to this kind of answer is dissimulation, which is <lb/>
            used only to excite laughter, and has consequently been <note type="footnote"> * Æn. i. 48. </note><note type="footnote">t Æn. iii. 56. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ An. iv. 592. </note><note type="footnote">§ Eun. i. 1, 1. </note><note type="footnote"> || The same example is given by Julius Rufinianus, c. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> It Compare vi. 3, 74.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            noticed in its proper place ;* for if it be used seriously, it has <lb/>
            the effect of a confession.</p>
          <p>The practice also of questioning and replying to one's self is <lb/>
            generally not unpleasing; as Cicero does in his speech for <lb/>
            Ligarius, † Before whom, then, do I say this? Before him, <lb/>
            assuredly, who, at a time when he had a full knowledge of <lb/>
            what I have just said, nevertheless broug ht me back, even before <lb/>
            he had seen me, to my country ? 15. In his speech for Cælius.‡ <lb/>
            he adopts another mode, that of supposing a question: Some <lb/>
            one will say, Is this your moral discipline ? Do you thus <lb/>
            instruct youth ? &amp;c., and he then replies, I, judges, if any <lb/>
            man was ever of such strength of mind, and so naturally dis­ <lb/>
            posed to virtue and chastity, &amp;c. Another method is, when <lb/>
            you have asked a person a question, not to wait for an answer, <lb/>
            but immediately to add one yourself; as, Was a house wanting <lb/>
            to you ? But you had one. Was ready money superabundant <lb/>
            with you ? But you were in want.§ This figure some call per <lb/>
            suggestionem, " by way of hypobole, or intimation."</p>
          <p>16. Interrogation is also made by comparison; as, which of <lb/>
            the two, then, will more easily give a reason for his opinion?|| <lb/>
            And in other ways, sometimes concisely, sometimes at greater <lb/>
            length, sometimes on one point, sometimes on several.</p>
          <p>But what has a wonderful effect in pleadings is anticipation, <lb/>
            which is called by the Greeks and by which we <lb/>
            prevent objections that may be brought against us. It is <lb/>
            used, not sparingly, in other parts of a speech, but is of the <lb/>
            greatest effect in the exordium. 17. Though there is in <lb/>
            reality but one kind of it, yet it includes several species ; for <lb/>
            there is præmunitio, " precaution," as in the speech of Cicero <lb/>
            against Quintus Cæcilius,** when he premises, that having <lb/>
            always before defended, he is now proceeding to accuse; there is <lb/>
            a sort of confession, as that of Cicero, in his pleading for Rabi­ <lb/>
            rius Posthumus,tt whom he acknowledges to be blamable <lb/>
            in his opinion, for having entrusted money to king Ptolemy; <lb/>
            there is a sort of prefatory statement, as, I will say, not for <lb/>
            the purpose of aggravating the charge,‡ ‡ &amp;c.; there is a kind of <note type="footnote"> * VI. 3, 68. By dissimulation is meant replying in such a way as to <lb/>
            seem not to understand the speaker. </note><note type="footnote">t C. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ C. 17. </note><note type="footnote">§ Cic.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/><lb/>
            self-correction, as, I entreat you to pardon me if I have gone <lb/>
            too far; and there is also, what is very frequent, a species of <lb/>
            preparation, when we state at some length, either why we are <lb/>
            going to do something, or why we have done it. 18. The <lb/>
            force or propriety of a word, too, is sometimes established by <lb/>
            prolepsis; as, Though that was not the punishment, but the <lb/>
            prohibition, of crime;* or by correction, as, Citizens, citizens, <lb/>
            I say, if I may call them by that name.t</p>
          <p>19. Doubt also may give an air of truth to our statements, <lb/>
            as when we feign, for example, to be at a loss where to begin, <lb/>
            or where to end, or what to say in preference to something else, <lb/>
            or whether we ought to speak at all. Of examples of such hesi­ <lb/>
            tation all speeches are full; but one will suffice : Indeed,‡ as <lb/>
            far as concerns myself, I know not whither to turn. Can I <lb/>
            deny that there was an ill report of the judges having been <lb/>
            bribed ? 20. This figure may likewise refer to the past, for we <lb/>
            may pretend that we have been in doubt.</p>
          <p>There is no great difference between doubt and that <lb/>
            sort of figure called communication, which we use either <lb/>
            when we consult, as it were, our opponents, as Domitius <lb/>
            Afer in pleading for Cloantilla,§ In her agitation, she <lb/>
            knows not what is permitted to her as a woman, nor what <lb/>
            becomes her as a wife. Perhaps chance has thrown tou in the <lb/>
            way of the unhappy woman in her anxiety; what advice do <lb/>
            you, her brother, and you, thefriends of herfather, offer? 21. <lb/>
            Or when we pretend to deliberate with tile judges, which is a <lb/>
            very common artifice, saying, what do you advise ? or, I ash <lb/>
            you yourselves what ought to have beendone. Thus Cato|| <lb/>
            exclaims, I pray you, if you had been in that situation, what <lb/>
            else would you have done ? and in another place, Suppose that <lb/>
            it were a matter of concern to you all, and that you had been <lb/>
            appointed to manage the affair. 22. But sometimes, in such <lb/>
            communications, we subjoin something unexpected, which is in <lb/>
            itself a figure ; as Cicero, in speaking against Verres,¶ said, <lb/>
            What then ? What do you think that he has committed ? Some <lb/>
            theft, perhaps, or some robbery ? and then, when he had kept <note type="footnote"> similar in the speech for Milo, a. 10: Dicam enim non derivandi <lb/>
            criminis causâ. Gesner. </note><note type="footnote"> * From a lost speech of Cicero. </note><note type="footnote">t Cic. pro Huræn. c. 37. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Cic. pro Cluent. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote">§ See viii. 5, 16. </note><note type="footnote"> || Ut Cato, Cedo, &amp;c.] Spalding thinks that the word Cato may be <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            the minds of the judges for a long time in suspense, added <lb/>
            something far more atrocious. This figure Celsus calls sustenta­ <lb/>
            tio* " suspension." 23. It is, however, of two kinds; for <lb/>
            frequently, on the other hand, when we have raised an expec­ <lb/>
            tation of something enormous, we stoop to something that is <lb/>
            either of little moment or not at all criminal. But as this is not <lb/>
            always done by communication, others have given the figure <lb/>
            the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παςάδοξον</foreign>, or surprise. 24. Let me add, that I <lb/>
            do not agree with those who think that even when we speak <lb/>
            of something suprising having happened to ourselves, our lan­ <lb/>
            guage is figurative ; as in what Pollio says, I never imagined <lb/>
            it would come to pass, judges, that, when Scaurus was accused, <lb/>
            I should have to entreat that interest may have no influence <lb/>
            on his trial.</p>
          <p>25. The source of what we call permission is almost the <lb/>
            same as that of communication, We are said to use this <lb/>
            figure, when we leave something to be settled by the judges <lb/>
            themselves, or sometimes even by the opposite party ; as <lb/>
            Calvus said to Vatinius,: Assume a bold face, and say that <lb/>
            you are more worthy to be made prætor than Cato</p>
          <p>26. As to the figures which are adapted for exciting the feel­ <lb/>
            ings, they consist chiefly in simulation; for we feign that we <lb/>
            are angry, and that we rejoice, or fear, or wonder, or grieve, <lb/>
            or feel indignant, or wish, or are moved by other similar affec­ <lb/>
            tions. Hence the expressions, Liberatus sum; respiravi,§ <lb/>
            " I am freed, I have recovered my spirits Bene habet, " It <lb/>
            is well;" Quœ amentia est hœc? " What madness is this?" <lb/>
            O tempora, 0 mores !|| " 0 times, 0 manners!" Miserum me! <lb/>
            consumptis enim lacrymis infixus tamen pectori haeret dolor ,¶ <lb/>
            " Wretched that I am! for, though my tears are exhausted, <lb/>
            grief yet remains fixed in my heart," And, <lb/>
            Magnæ nunc hiscite terræ !** <lb/>
            Gape now, 0 earth profound !</p>
          <p>27. This some call exclamation, and number among verbal <lb/>
            figures. When such exclamations, however, arise from sincere <lb/>
            feeling, they are not figurative in the sense of which I am <lb/>
            speaking; but, when they are fictitious, and the offspring of art, <lb/>
            they must indisputably be regarded as figures. The same <note type="footnote"> * As a translation of the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐποχή</foreign>.

            may be said of that freedom of speech which Comificius calls <lb/>
            licentia, and the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">πας̓ς̔ηϭία</foreign> : for what can be less figu­ <lb/>
            rative than plain and sincere speech; but under the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of it there frequently lurks flattery. 28. Thus when <lb/>
            Cicero says in his speech for Ligarius,* After the war had been <lb/>
            commenced, Cæsar, and even almost brought to a conclusion, I, <lb/>
            without being driven by any compulsion, but of my own pur­ <lb/>
            pose and will, set out to join that party which had taken up <lb/>
            arms against you, he not only looks to the interest of Ligarius, <lb/>
            but bestows the highest possible praise on the clemency of the <lb/>
            conqueror. 29. But in the question,† What other object had we <lb/>
            in view, Tubero, but that we might possess the same power which <lb/>
            Caesar now possesses ? he represents, with admirable art, the <lb/>
            cause of both parties as good, while he thus conciliates him <lb/>
            whose cause was in reality bad.</p>
          <p>A- figure which is still bolder, and requires, as Cicero thinks,‡ <lb/>
            greater force, is the personation of characters, or prosopopœia. <lb/>
            30. This figure gives both variety and animation to eloquence, <lb/>
            in a wonderful degree. By means of it, we display the thoughts <lb/>
            of our opponents, as they themselves would do in a soliloquy ; <lb/>
            but our inventions of that sort will meet with credit only so <lb/>
            far as we represent people saying what it is not unreasonable <lb/>
            to suppose that they may have meditated; and so far as we <lb/>
            introduce our own conversations with others, or those of others <lb/>
            among themselves, with an air of plausibility, and when we <lb/>
            invent persuasions, or reproaches, or complaints, or eulogies, or <lb/>
            lamentations, and put them into the mouths of characters likely <lb/>
            to utter them. 31. In this kind of figure it is allowable even to <lb/>
            bring down the gods from heaven, and evoke the dead ;§ and <lb/>
            cities and states are gifted with voices. There are some, <lb/>
            indeed, who give the name of prosopopœiæ only to those figures <lb/>
            of speech in which we represent both fictitious beings and <lb/>
            speeches, and prefer calling the feigned discourses of men <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάλογοι</foreign>, " dialogues;" some of the Latins have applied to <lb/>
            them the term sermocinatio. 32. For my own part, I have <lb/>
            included both, according to the received practice, under the <lb/>
            same designation; for assuredly a speech cannot be conceived <lb/>
            without being conceived as the speech of some person. But <lb/>
            when we give a voice to things to which nature has not given <lb/>
            a voice, our figure may be softened in such a way as this :|| <note type="footnote"> * C. 3. </note><note type="footnote">t Cic. pro Ligur. c. 4. </note><note type="footnote">1 Orat c. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"><unclear/> I IV. 1, 28. </note><note type="footnote">it Cic. <unclear>Cztil</unclear>. i. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            For if my country, which is far dearer to me than my life, <lb/>
            if all Italy, if the whole republic, should thus address me, <lb/>
            Marcus Cicero, what are you doing ? &amp;c. Another prosopopœia, <lb/>
            in the same speech, is of a bolder nature: * Your country, <lb/>
            Catiline, thus pleads, and as it were tacitly addresses you: No <lb/>
            great wickedness has arisen, for several years past, but by your <lb/>
            means. 33. We also pretend at times, and with good effect, <lb/>
            that the images of things and persons are before our eyes,† and <lb/>
            that their voices sound in our ears, and affect to wonder that <lb/>
            the same appearances are not perceptible to our opponents or <lb/>
            to the judges; as when we say, It seems to me, or, Does it not <lb/>
            seem to you ? But great power of eloquence is necessary for <lb/>
            such efforts; for what is naturally fictitious and incredible <lb/>
            must either make a stronger impression from being beyond the <lb/>
            real, or be regarded as nugatory from being unreal.</p>
          <p>34. But as speeches are often imagined, so also are writings. <lb/>
            Thus Asinius Pollio suggests an imaginary will in pleading <lb/>
            for Liburnia: Let my mother, who was most dear to me and my <lb/>
            greatest delight, who lived for me, and gave me life twice in the <lb/>
            same day, &amp;c., inherit none of my property.‡ This is itself a <lb/>
            figure, and is doubly so when, as in this case, it is framed in <lb/>
            imitation of another document; 35. for a will had been read <lb/>
            on the other side in this form, Let Publius Novanius Gallio, <lb/>
            to whom, as my greatest benefactor. I desire and owe everything <lb/>
            good, and in consideration of his eminent affection towards me, <lb/>
            (several other particulars being also added,) inherit all my pro­ <lb/>
            perty. This partakes of the nature of parody, a term derived <lb/>
            from the modulation of tunes in imitation of other tunes, but <lb/>
            applied, catachrestically, to imitation in verse or prose. 36. <lb/>
            We also frequently conceive imaginary beings, as Virgil per­ <lb/>
            sonifies Fame,§ Prodicus (as is said by Xenophon,||) Pleasure <lb/>
            and Virtue, and Ennius Death and Life, whom he represents <lb/>
            in one of his Satires as engaging in combat. An imaginary <note type="footnote"> * Cic. Catil. i. 7. </note><note type="footnote">t Ante oculos esse rerum, personarum, vocum imagines fingimus.] The <lb/>
            expression vocum imagines esse ante oculos may easily be turned into <lb/>
            ridicule; but I have no doubt that it is Quintilian's; and let it, though <lb/>
            a catachresis, be pardoned by every Aristarchus who is not unreason­ <lb/>
            ably disposed to cavil. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This " twice " is inexplicable, as the speech is lost, and is nowhere <lb/>
            else mentioned, as Gesner and Manutius believe. The words in the <lb/>
            text, says Gesner, are meant to expose the. folly of those who could <lb/>
            credit that a mother so much beloved by her son was disinherited by <lb/>
            him. </note><note type="footnote">§ Æn. iv. ] 74 </note><note type="footnote">U Mem. Soc. ii. l. </note> <pb n="163"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/><lb/>
            speech is sometimes given, too, to a person not specified, as, <lb/>
            " Here somebody says," or,,, Somebody may say." 37. A speech <lb/>
            may also be given without mention of any person; as, <lb/>
            Hic Dolopum manus, hie sœvustendebat Achilles,* <lb/>
            Here lay the force of the Dolopians, here <lb/>
            The fierce Achilles. <lb/>
            This is effected by a union of figures, since to prosopopœia is <lb/>
            added the figure of speech which is called per detractionem, or <lb/>
            ellipsis, for all allusion as to who made the speech is omitted. <lb/>
            The prosopopœia sometimes assumes the appearance of narra­ <lb/>
            tion;† whence oblique speeches are found among the histo­ <lb/>
            rians ; as in the beginning of the first book of Livy, That <lb/>
            cities also, as well as other things, spring from humble origins, <lb/>
            and that those which the gods and their own valour support, <lb/>
            acquire at length great power and a great name.</p>
          <p>38. The diversion of our speech from the judge, also, a figure <lb/>
            which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποϭτςοϕή</foreign>, has an extraordinary effect, whether <lb/>
            in attacking our adversary, as, What was that sword of yours <lb/>
            doing, Tubero, in the field of Pharsalia ? ‡ or in digressing to <lb/>
            make some invocation, as, For I call upon you, 0 Alban hills <lb/>
            and groves!§ or in imploring aid, in order to throw odium on <lb/>
            the opposite party; as, 0 Porcian laws! 0 Sempronian laws !|| <lb/>
            39. But whatever draws away the hearer from the subject in <lb/>
            question is called apostrophe; as, <lb/>
            Non, ego cum Danais Trojanam exscindere gentem <lb/>
            Aulide juravi, ¶ <lb/>
            I did not swear at Aulis with the Greeks <lb/>
            T' uproot the Trojan race. <lb/>
            This is done by means of many and various figures; for <lb/>
            example, when we feign that we expected something else, or <lb/>
            that we feared something more considerable, or that some <lb/>
            point may seem of greater importance to the judges, being <lb/>
            but imperfectly informed on it, than it really is. Such is the <lb/>
            object of the exordium of the speech for Gæl ius.</p>
          <p>40. But as to the figure which, as Cicero says,** sets things <lb/>
            before the eyes, it is used, when a thing is not simply mentioned <note type="footnote"> * An. ii. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> t This happens when the historian continues his narrative in such a <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            as having been done, but is mentioned with a representation <lb/>
            how it was done, not merely in a general way, but in all its <lb/>
            attendant circumstances. This figure I have noticed in the <lb/>
            , preceding book* under evidentia, or "illustration," and Celsus <lb/>
            has given it that name; by others it is called hypotyposis, which <lb/>
            means a representation of things so fully expressed in words <lb/>
            that it seems to be seen rather than heard: t He himself, <lb/>
            inflamed with wickedness and fury, came into the forum; his <lb/>
            eyes glared; cruelty showed itself over his whole countenance. <lb/>
            4 J. Ncr do we imagine only what has been done, or is done, <lb/>
            but also what is likely to be, or might have been. Cicero <lb/>
            gives an admirable example of this in his speech for Milo,‡ <lb/>
            where he depicts what Clodius would have done if he had <lb/>
            secured the prætorship. But this transmutation of times,§ <lb/>
            (which is properly called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετάϭταϭις</foreign>,) was very cautiously used <lb/>
            in hypotyposis by the old orators; for they introduced it with <lb/>
            some such observations as these: Imagine that you behold; as <lb/>
            Cicero says, These things, which you have not seen with your <lb/>
            eyes, you may represent to yourselves in your minds. 42. But <lb/>
            our modern speakers, and especially our declaimers, indulge <lb/>
            their imaginations more boldly, and not without some anima­ <lb/>
            tion ; as Seneca, for example, in that case || of which the sub­ <lb/>
            stance is that a father killed his son and his son's step-mother, <lb/>
            having surprised them in adultery, another son of his conduct­ <lb/>
            ing him to the place where they were; Lead me, the father is <lb/>
            made to say, I follow; take my aged hand, and direct it wherever <lb/>
            you please. 43. And a little afterwards the son is represented <lb/>
            as exclaiming, See what Tou have long refused to believe. As <lb/>
            for me, I cannot see; night and the thickest darkness comes <lb/>
            over my eyes. Such a figure is of too bold a character; for the <lb/>
            case does not seem to be stated, but to be acted. 44. Under <lb/>
            hypotyposis is also included, by some writers, the luminous <lb/>
            and vivid description of places; but others call it topographia</p>
          <p>As to <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰςωνεία</foreign>, I have found some authors who call it <lb/>
            ditsimulation,¶ but as the whole force of this figure does not <lb/>
            appear to be sufficiently indicated by that name, I shall con­ <lb/>
            tent myself, as in regard to most other figures, with the Greek <note type="footnote"> * C. 3, sect. 68. </note><note type="footnote">t In Verr. v. 62. </note><note type="footnote">‡C. 32. </note><note type="footnote"> § A transition from the present so as to give a representation of the <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/><lb/>
            term. That <foreign xml:lang="grc">είςωνεία</foreign>, then, which is called a figure, differ <lb/>
            but little, as to kind, from that which is called a trope; for in <lb/>
            both the contrary to what is said is to be understood ; but for <lb/>
            him who considers the various species of them, it will be <lb/>
            easy to see that they are distinct. 45. In the first place, the <lb/>
            trope is less disguised; and though it expresses something <lb/>
            different from what it means, yet it can hardly be said to pretend <lb/>
            anything different; for all that accompanies it is generally <lb/>
            plain; as in what Cicero says of Catiline,* Being repulsed by <lb/>
            him, you betook yourself to your accomplice, that excellent <lb/>
            man Marcus Marcellus. Here the irony lies only in two words, <lb/>
            and, therefore, it is a very short trope. 46. But in irony con­ <lb/>
            sidered as a figure, there is a disguise of the speaker's whole <lb/>
            meaning ; a disguise rather perceptible than ostentatious ; for, <lb/>
            in the trope, some words are put for others, but, in the figure, <lb/>
            the sense of a passage in a speech, and sometimes the whole <lb/>
            configuration of a cause, is at variance with the air of our <lb/>
            address ; nay, even the whole life of a man may wear the <lb/>
            appearance of a continued irony, as did that of Socrates; for <lb/>
            he was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴςων</foreign> because he assumed the character of an <lb/>
            ignorant man, and affected to be the admirer of other men's <lb/>
            wisdom. Thus, as a continued metaphor constitutes an <lb/>
            allegory, so a continuation of ironical tropes forms the figure <lb/>
            irony.</p>
          <p>47. Some kinds of this figure, however, have no affinity <lb/>
            with tropes ; as, in the first place, that which has its name <lb/>
            from negation, and which some call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίφςαϭις</foreign> :t as, I will not <lb/>
            proceed with you according to the rigour of the law ; I will not <lb/>
            insist upon a point which 1 should perhaps carry ;‡ and, Why <lb/>
            should I mention his decrees, his plunderings, the rights of <lb/>
            inheritance to property resigned to him, or of which he forcibly <lb/>
            possessed himself? and, I say nothing of that injury committed <lb/>
            through lust;§ and, I do not even produce the evidence which has <lb/>
            been given concerning the seven hundred thousand sesterces; and, <lb/>
            I could say, etc. 48. Such kinds of irony we carry sometimes <note type="footnote"> * In Cat. l. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> t A figure of thought, when we say that we do not Ray a thing, and <lb/>
            yet say it at the same time. Julius Rufinianus, c. 12. See viii. 6, 57. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Cicero in Verr. v. 2. But Quintilian quotes from memory. <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            through entire divisions of a speech; thus Cicero. says, If 1 <lb/>
            were to treat this matter as if I had a charge to overthrow, 1 <lb/>
            should express myself at greater length. Irony is also used <lb/>
            when we assume the air of persons commanding or permitting <lb/>
            something, in such a way as this: <lb/>
            I. sequere Italiam ventis,† <lb/>
            Go with the winds, and seek your Italy.</p>
          <p>49. Or when we allow to our adversaries qualities which we <lb/>
            should be unwilling to see recognized in them; and this kind <lb/>
            of irony is more cutting when those qualities are in ourselves <lb/>
            and are not in our adversaries: <lb/>
            Meque timoris <lb/>
            Argue tu, Drance, quando tot cædis acervos <lb/>
            Teucrorum tua dextra dedit.‡ <lb/>
            Me of cowardice, <lb/>
            Drances, do thou accuse, when thy right hand <lb/>
            Such heaps of slaughtered Trojans shall have rais'd. <lb/>
            A similar effect is produced, though in a contrary way, when <lb/>
            we own as it were to faults from which we are free, and which <lb/>
            even touch our opponent: <lb/>
            Me duce Dardanius Spariam expugnavit adulter,§ <lb/>
            'Twas by my guidance Troy's adulterer <lb/>
            Fell foul of Sparta.</p>
          <p>50. Nor is this artifice of saying something contrary to <lb/>
            what you wish to be understood, used only with regard to per­ <lb/>
            sons, but may be extended also to things, as in the whole of <lb/>
            the exordium of the speech for Ligarius, and in those extenua­ <lb/>
            tions, Videlicet, 0 dii boni, "Forsooth, 0 good gods!" So <lb/>
            likewise in Virgil, <lb/>
            Scilicet is superis labor est !|| <lb/>
            That, doubtless, is a trouble to the gods !</p>
          <p>51. Another example is the well-known passage in the speech <lb/>
            for Oppius,¶ 0 wonderful love! 0 singular benevolence! &amp;c. <lb/>
            Not very different from irony are these three modes of speaking, <lb/>
            very similar to one another: the first, Confession, such as <lb/>
            will not hurt the party who makes it; as, You have, therefore, <note type="footnote"> * Pro Cluent. c. 60. </note><note type="footnote">t Æn. iv. 381. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Æn. ix. 884. </note><note type="footnote"> § Æn. x. 92.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/><lb/>
            Tubero, what is most to be desired by an accuser, a confession from <lb/>
            the accused;* the second, Concession, when we make a show of <lb/>
            admitting something unfavourable to us, through confidence in <lb/>
            our cause ; as The captain of a ship, from a most honourable city, <lb/>
            redeemed himself from the terror of a scourging by paying a sum <lb/>
            of money; it was kind in Verres to allow it ;† and, as it is <lb/>
            said, in the speech for Cluentius,‡ concerning popular feel­ <lb/>
            ing : Let it prevail in assemblies of the people, but let it have <lb/>
            no influence in courts of justice; the third, Acknowledgment, <lb/>
            as Cicero, in the same speech,§ acknowledges that the judges <lb/>
            had been bribed. 52. The last of these figures is more observable, <lb/>
            when we assent to something that is likely to prove in our <lb/>
            favour, but which nevertheless will not be so without some <lb/>
            error on the part of our adversary. Faults, too, that have <lb/>
            been committed by a person whom we accuse, we sometimes <lb/>
            affect to praise; as Cicero, in pleading against Verresll says <lb/>
            of the charge brought against him about Apollonius of Drepa­ <lb/>
            num, If you took anythingfrom him, I am even delighted at it, <lb/>
            and think that nothing better was ever done by you 53. Some­ <lb/>
            times also we exaggerate charges against ourselves, when we <lb/>
            might either refute or deny them; a practice which is too <lb/>
            frequent to render an example of it necessary. Sometimes, <lb/>
            again, by such exaggeration, we render charges against us <lb/>
            incredible; as Cicero, in his oration for Roscius,¶ speaking <lb/>
            of the enormity of parricide, which is sufficiently manifest of <lb/>
            itself, nevertheless exaggerates it by the power of his eloquence.</p>
          <p>54. The figure <foreign xml:lang="grc">άποϭιώπηϭνς</foreign>, which Cicero.. calls reticentia, <lb/>
            Celsus obticentia, and some authors interruptio, is used in <lb/>
            testifying something of passion or anger; as, <lb/>
            Quos ego—sed motos præstat comp nere fluctus, †† <lb/>
            Whom I—but better 'tis to tranquillize <lb/>
            The troubled waves; <lb/>
            or anxiety and conscientious hesitation; as, Would he have <lb/>
            dared to make mention of the law of which Clodius boasts <lb/>
            that he was the author, while Milo lived. I will not say while he <lb/>
            was consul ? for, with regard to all of us,-I cannot venture <note type="footnote"> * Cic. pro Ligar. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote">+ In Verr. v. 44.

            to say everything* &amp;c; a passage to which there is some­ <lb/>
            thing similar in the exordium of the speech of Demosthenes <lb/>
            for Ctesiphon ;† 55. Or it may be adopted for the purpose of <lb/>
            making a transition ; as, Cominius‡ however—but pardon me, <lb/>
            judges, &amp;c., where the figure digression also follows, (if indeed <lb/>
            digression ought to be reckoned among figures, for by some it <lb/>
            is considered as one of the divisions of a cause,§) and the <lb/>
            speech goes off into the praises of Pompey, who might, how­ <lb/>
            ever, have been praised without recourse being had to aposi­ <lb/>
            opesis. 56. As to the shorter kind of digression, it may be <lb/>
            made, as Cicero|| says, in various ways; but the two following <lb/>
            instances will suffice as examples: When Caius Varenus,¶ he <lb/>
            who was killed by the slaves of Ancharius, (to this point, <lb/>
            judges, pay, I beseech you, the most careful attention,) &amp;c.; <lb/>
            and, in the speech for Milo,** He regarded me with that sort of <lb/>
            look which he was accustomed to assume when he threatened <lb/>
            everybody with every kind of violence, &amp;c. 57. There is also a <lb/>
            kind of self-interruption, which is not indeed an aposiopesis, <lb/>
            so as to leave a speech unfinished, but a suspension of what <lb/>
            we are saying before we come to the natural termination of it, <lb/>
            as, I am too urgent, the young man seems to be moved; and, Why <lb/>
            should I say more ? you have heard the young man himself <lb/>
            speak.††</p>
          <p>58. The imitation of other persons' manners, which is <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠθοποι</foreign>ḯ<foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign>,‡‡ or, as others prefer, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμησις</foreign>, may be numbered <lb/>
            among the lighter artifices for touching the feelings; for it <lb/>
            consists mostly in mimicry; but it may be exhibited either in <lb/>
            acts or in words. That which consists in acts is similar to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύποτύωις</foreign> ;§§ of that which consists in words we may take the <lb/>
            following example from Terence :|| || ' <note type="footnote"> * This appears, says Gesner, to be a passage from the speech which <lb/>

            Hinc est abrepta: eduxit mater pro suâ : <lb/>

            I did not know, forsooth, what was your drift. <lb/>
            A little girl was stolen from hence; my mother <lb/>
            Brought her up as her own ; and she was call'd <lb/>
            My sister; I would fain lay hands on her, <lb/>
            To give her to her friends.</p>
          <p>59. But an imitation of our own sayings and doings is <lb/>
            sometimes adopted in narration, and is of a similar character, <lb/>
            except that it is more frequently intended for asseveration <lb/>
            than mere mimicry; as, I said that they had for accuser <lb/>
            Quintus Cæcilius -It</p>
          <p>There are other artifices, too, which are not only pleasing, <lb/>
            but are of great service in securing favourable attention to our <lb/>
            arguments, as well by the variety which they give, as by their <lb/>
            own nature; for, by making our speech appear plain and <lb/>
            unstudied, they render us objects of less suspicion to the judge <lb/>
            60. One of these is a repenting, as it were, of what we have <lb/>
            said, as in the speech for Cælius,† But why did I introduce <lb/>
            so grave a character? Of a similar nature, also, are the <lb/>
            expressions which we daily use. such as, Imprudens incidi,‡ <lb/>
            " I have hit upon the matter unawares;" or as we say <lb/>
            when we pretend to be at a loss, What comes next ? or, Have <lb/>
            not I omitted something ? or when we pretend to find some­ <lb/>
            thing suggested to us by the matter of which we are speaking ; <lb/>
            thus Cicero says, One charge of this sort remains for me to <lb/>
            notice, and, One thing is suggested to me by another. 61. By <lb/>
            such means, likewise, graceful transitions are effected ; (though <lb/>
            transition itself, be it observed, is not a figure;) as Cicero, <lb/>
            after relating the story of Piso, who had given orders, while <lb/>
            he was sitting on his judgment-seat, for a ring to be made for <lb/>
            him by a goldsmith, adds, as if reminded by the circumstance,§ <lb/>
            This ring of Piso has just put me in mind of something that <lb/>
            had entirely escaped me. From how many honest metesfingers <lb/>
            do you think that he has taken away gold rings ? &amp;c. Some­ <lb/>
            times we affect ignorance of some particular,|| But the arti <lb/>
            ficer of those statues, whom did they say that he was ? whom ? <lb/>
            You prompt me correctly—they said that it was Polycletus. 62 <note type="footnote"> * Cicero Divin. ir Cæcil. c. 2. </note><note type="footnote">t C. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Cic. in Verr. iv. 20. </note><note type="footnote">§ Cic. in Vent iT. 26. </note><note type="footnote"> || Cic. in Verr. iv. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            This kind of artifice may serve for mere purposes than one ; <lb/>
            for, by such means, we may, while we seem to be intent on <lb/>
            one object, accomplish another; as Cicero, in the present <lb/>
            instance, while he reproaches Verres with his inordinate rage <lb/>
            for statues and pictures, secures himself from being thought <lb/>
            to have a passion for them likewise. Demosthenes,* also, in <lb/>
            swearing by those who were killed at Marathon and Salamis, <lb/>
            makes it his object that he may suffer less odium for the dis­ <lb/>
            aster incurred at Chæronea. 63. It gives agreeableness to a <lb/>
            speech, moreover, to defer the discussion of some points, laying <lb/>
            them up as it were in the memory of the judge, and afterwards <lb/>
            to reclaim what we have deposited, to separate† certain par­ <lb/>
            ticulars by some figure, (for separation is not itself a figure,) <lb/>
            to bring others prominently forward, and to exhibit the sub­ <lb/>
            jects of our speech under various aspects; for eloquence <lb/>
            delights in variety; and as the eyes are more attracted by the <lb/>
            contemplation of diversified objects, so that is always more <lb/>
            gratifying to the mind to which it directs itself with the <lb/>
            expectation of novelty.</p>
          <p>64. Among figures is also to be numbered emphasis, which <lb/>
            is used when some latent sense is to be elicited from some <lb/>
            word or phrase ; as, in this passage of Virgil, <lb/>
            Non limit thalami expertem sine crimine vitam <lb/>
            Degere, more ferae ? ‡ <lb/>
            Might not I have lived <lb/>
            Free from the nuptial couch, without a crime, <lb/>
            Free, like the savage herd ? <lb/>
            for though Dido complains of marriage, yet her passion forces <lb/>
            us to understand that she thinks life without marriage to be a <lb/>
            life not for human beings, but for beasts. There is another <lb/>
            example of it, but of a different character, in Ovid, where <lb/>
            Zmyrna confesses to her nurse her passion for her father, in <lb/>
            these words: <lb/>
            0, dixit, felicem, conjuge matrem ! § <lb/>
            0 mother, happy in her spouse ! she cried. <note type="footnote"> * Do Coron. c. 60. </note><note type="footnote"> t Separare quæedam, schemate aliquo (non enim est ipsa per se iteratis <lb/>
            schema), &amp;c.] As separare and iteratio are inconsistent, Spalding pro­ <lb/>
            poses for separare to read bis ponere, but acknowledges that it scarcely <lb/>
            suits the style of Quintilian. I have followed Aldus in reading <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/></p>
          <p>65. Similar to this figure, or identical with it, is one o <lb/>
            which we make great use in the present day; for I must now <lb/>
            proceed to treat of a sort of figure which is extremely common, <lb/>
            and on which I believe it is earnestly expected that I should <lb/>
            make some observations; a figure in which we intimate, by <lb/>
            some suspicion that we excite, that something is to be understood <lb/>
            which we do not express; not however something contrary to <lb/>
            what we express, as in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰϱωνεία</foreign>, but something latent, and <lb/>
            to be discovered by the penetration of the hearer. This, as I <lb/>
            mentioned above,. is almost the only mode of expression that <lb/>
            is called, among our rhetoricians, a figure; and it is from the <lb/>
            frequent use of it that certain pleadings have the name of <lb/>
            figurative. 66. It may be adopted for one of three reasons ; <lb/>
            first, if it is unsafe to speak plainly; secondly, if it is unbe­ <lb/>
            coming to do so; and, thirdly, if recourse is had to the figure <lb/>
            merely for the purpose of ornament, and of giving more <lb/>
            pleasure, through novelty and variety, than would be felt if a <lb/>
            straightforward narration were offered.</p>
          <p>67. Of these three cases, the first is of common occurrence <lb/>
            in the schools; when conditions made by tyrants laying <lb/>
            down their power, and decrees of senates after a civil war, are <lb/>
            imagined, and it is a capital crime to reproach a person with <lb/>
            what is past; and what is not allowable in the forum, is con­ <lb/>
            sidered not to be admissible in the schools. But, in reality, <lb/>
            the declaimer has not the same need for figures as the orator; <lb/>
            for he may speak as plainly as he pleases against those <lb/>
            tyrants, provided that what he says be susceptible of another <lb/>
            interpretation, since it is danger only to himself, and not <lb/>
            offence to them, that he has to avoid; and if he can <lb/>
            escape all hazard through ambiguity of language, every one <lb/>
            will applaud his address. 68. But real pleadings have never <lb/>
            been attended with such necessity for silence, though they <lb/>
            sometimes require caution almost equal to it, and, indeed, are <lb/>
            much more embarrassing to the orator; I mean when persons <lb/>
            in power oppose him, without offence to whom his cause can­ <lb/>
            not be gained. 69. Hence he must proceed with greater care <lb/>
            and circumspection; for, if he offend, it makes no difference <lb/>
            how the offence is given, whether in a figure or otherwise; <lb/>
            and if a figure betrays itself, it ceases to be a figure. Accord­ <note type="footnote"> * See c. 1, Beet. 14. Of this sort of figure Dionysius of Halicar <lb/>
            nassus treats copiously do Arte Rhetoricâ, c. 8, 9. Spalding. </note> <pb n="172"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            ingly all this sort of artifice is rejected by some rhetoricians, <lb/>
            whether it be understood or not understood. But it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to be moderate in the use of such figures.</p>
          <p>In the first place, we may take care that they be not too <lb/>
            palpable; and they will not be so, if they are not formed of <lb/>
            words of doubtful or double meaning; like the equivocation <lb/>
            in regard to the daughter-in-law suspected of a criminal con­ <lb/>
            nexion with her father-in-Jaw, I married a wife, said her <lb/>
            husband, that pleased my father; 70. or what is much more <lb/>
            foolish, of ambiguous arrangements of words, of which there is <lb/>
            an example in the case in which a father, accused of having <lb/>
            dishonoured his virgin daughter, asks her at whose hands she <lb/>
            had suffered violence: who, says he, ill-treated you ? when she <lb/>
            replies, My father, do not you know?* 71. Let the matter <lb/>
            itself lead the judge to a suspicion of the truth; and let us <lb/>
            set aside other points, that it may appear the more evident; <lb/>
            to which end displays of feeling will greatly contribute, and <lb/>
            words interrupted by silence and hesitation. Thus it will <lb/>
            happen, that the judge himself will seek for the latent some­ <lb/>
            thing, which he perhaps would not believe if he heard it stated <lb/>
            plainly, but to which he will give credit when he thinks that <lb/>
            he has himself divined it.</p>
          <p>72. Figures, however, even if they be of the highest pos­ <lb/>
            sible excellence, ought not to be numerous, for they betray <lb/>
            themselves by multiplicity; and, while they are not less ob­ <lb/>
            jectionable, are less effective. Our forbearance to speak <lb/>
            plainly appears then to proceed, not from modesty, but from <lb/>
            distrust of our cause; in a word, the judge puts most trust in <lb/>
            our figures when he thinks that we are unwilling to express <lb/>
            ourselves undisguisedly. 73. I have, indeed, met with per­ <lb/>
            sons who could not be gained but by such artifice; and I was <lb/>
            once concerned in a cause (a thing of less frequent occurrence) <lb/>
            in which it was absolutely required. I defended a woman who <lb/>
            was accused of having produced a forged will as that of her <lb/>
            husband; and the heirs named in it were said to have given a <lb/>
            bond to the husband as he was at the point of death,† and the <lb/>
            latter allegation was true; for, as the wife could not be made <note type="footnote"> * The Latin is, Tu, pater, nescis ? which, as Spalding remarks, migh* <lb/>

            charge was easy, even if we had stated the matter boldly; but <lb/>
            the inheritance would thus have been lost to the woman. I <lb/>
            had to manage the matter, therefore, in such a way that the <lb/>
            judges might understand what had been done, and yet that <lb/>
            the informers! might be unable to take advantage of anything <lb/>
            that was said; and I was successful in both objects. This <lb/>
            affair I should not have mentioned, through fear of the im­ <lb/>
            putation of vanity, had I not wished to show that there may <lb/>
            be use for such figures, even in the forum. 75. Some things, <lb/>
            too, which we cannot prove, may advantageously be here and <lb/>
            there insinuated by a figure; for a hidden dart sometimes <lb/>
            sticks fast, and cannot be extracted for the very reason that it <lb/>
            is hidden; while, if you state the same things plainly, they <lb/>
            will be contradicted, and you will have to prove them.</p>
          <p>76. But when respect for a person stands in our way, (which <lb/>
            I mentioned as the second case,‡) we must speak with still <lb/>
            more caution, as respect is a stronger restraint on the in­ <lb/>
            genuous than fear. In such a case, the judge must think that <lb/>
            we hide what we know, and that we check our words when <lb/>
            bursting from us under the force of truth; for how much less <lb/>
            will those, against whom we speak, or the judges, or the <lb/>
            audience, dislike our figurative mode of attack, if they think <lb/>
            that we wish§ to say what we are saying? 77. Or what <lb/>
            difference does it make how we speak, if what we express, and <lb/>
            our feeling, be understood? Or what do we gain by speak­ <lb/>
            ing thus, but to make it evident that we are doing what we <lb/>
            feel should not be done ?|| Yet those times, in which I first <note type="footnote"> * She seems to have been barren, or childless, as is supposed by <lb/>

            began to teach rhetoric, suffered excessively from this fault; <lb/>
            for the declaimers spoke, at least willingly, only on such <lb/>
            causes as were attractive from their apparent difficulty, though <lb/>
            they were, in reality, much easier than many others. 78. A <lb/>
            straightforward kind of eloquence cannot recommend itself but <lb/>
            with the aid of the strongest power of mind; while doublings <lb/>
            and turnings are the resources of weakness; as those who <lb/>
            are but poor runners endeavour to elude their pursuers by <lb/>
            winding about. That figurative sort of oratory, which is so <lb/>
            much affected, is not very different from jesting; and it is an <lb/>
            assistance to it that the auditor delights to understand what <lb/>
            is insinuated, applauds his own penetration, and plumes him­ <lb/>
            self on another's eloquence. 79. Hence declaimers had recourse <lb/>
            to figures, not only when respect for some person was a <lb/>
            hindrance to plainness of speech, (in which case there is <lb/>
            oftener need of caution than of figures,) but made a place for <lb/>
            them even when they were useless or pernicious. Thus a <lb/>
            father, who had secretly put to death his son, as being guilty <lb/>
            of a criminal connexion with his mother, and who was accused <lb/>
            by his wife of having ill-treated her,. would be made to throw <lb/>
            out oblique insinuations, in figures, against his wife. 80. <lb/>
            But what could have been more scandalous in a man than to <lb/>
            have retained such a wife ? or what could be more absurd,! <lb/>
            than that he, who was brought under accusation because he <lb/>
            had suspected his wife of the most detestable guilt, should, by <lb/>
            the nature of his defence, confirm the guilt, which he ought <lb/>
            to have set himself to disprove?‡ Had those declaimers <lb/>
            conceived themselves in the place of the judges, they would <lb/>
            have perceived how little they would have endured pleading <lb/>
            of such a kind; and much less when abominable charges were <lb/>
            thrown out against parents.§ <note type="footnote">* This is the subject of the xvi.ith and xixth of the Declamations <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/></p>
          <p>81. Since we have fallen upon this subject, let us bestow a <lb/>
            little more consideration on the schools; for it is in them that <lb/>
            the orator is brought up; and on the manner in which he <lb/>
            declaims depends the manner in which he will plead. I must <lb/>
            speak, therefore, concerning those declamations, in which <lb/>
            most teachers have introduced, I do not say harsh figures, but <lb/>
            such as are contrary to the spirit of the cause. One case, <lb/>
            for example, is this : Let it be the lac that a person who is <lb/>
            found guilty of aspiring to tyranny be put to the torture, to <lb/>
            compel him to name his accomplices; and that his accuser be <lb/>
            allowed to choose whatever recompense he pleases: A son, who <lb/>
            had established such an accusation against his father, desires <lb/>
            that his father may not be put to the torture; the father opposes <lb/>
            his desire. 82. No declaimer, when pleading on behalf of the <lb/>
            father, has restrained himself from throwing out insinuations, <lb/>
            in figurative expressions,* against the son, intimating that the <lb/>
            father, if put to the torture, will name him among his <lb/>
            accomplices. But what is more preposterous than such a <lb/>
            course ? for when the judges understand the insinuations, the <lb/>
            father will either not be put to the torture, (if such be his <lb/>
            reason for wishing to be put to it,) or, if he is put to it, he <lb/>
            will not be believed. 83. But, it may be said, it is probable <lb/>
            that his object was to implicate his son ; perhaps so ; but he <lb/>
            should then have disguised it in order to succeed in it. But <lb/>
            what will it profit us (I speak in the person of the declaimers) <lb/>
            to have discovered that object, unless we make it known ? If, <lb/>
            then, a real cause of the kind were pleaded, should we, in <lb/>
            such a manner, bring to light that concealed object? Or what <lb/>
            if such is not the real object ? The guilty father may have <lb/>
            other reasons for opposing the desire of his son; he may <lb/>
            think that the law should be observed ; or he may be unwilling <lb/>
            to owe a favour to his accuser; or (what I should think most <lb/>
            probable) he may be resolved to assert his own innocence <lb/>
            under the torture. 84. To those, therefore, who plead in <note type="footnote"> general remark on the practice of the schools, where such attacks on <lb/>
            parents were allowed, and even often made. See vii. 4, t?8. Certainly <lb/>
            it is not apparent how, or by whom, both parents could be accused in <lb/>
            the case mentioned in the text. Spalding. </note> <note type="footnote"> * Nemo se tenuit agens pro patre; quin figuras in filium facertt.] By <lb/>
            figures, in this passage, are meant malignant allusions directed against <lb/>
            the son; as Suetonius, Vespas. c. 13, has causidicorum figuras for <lb/>
            craftv insinuations and <unclear>sarcasins</unclear>. Capperonier. </note> <pb n="176"/>

            such a way, not even the common excuse, that He who in­ <lb/>
            vented the case intended that mode of defence, will he any <lb/>
            support; for perhaps the inventor intended no such thing; <lb/>
            but suppose that he did intend it, are we, if he judged <lb/>
            foolishly, for that reason to plead foolishly? For my own <lb/>
            part, I think that in pleading even real causes, we should free <lb/>
            quently pay no attention to what the party going to law wishes</p>
          <p>85. It is also a common mistake in declaimers in this kind <lb/>
            of cases, to suppose that certain characters. say one thing <lb/>
            and mean another. A remarkable example of this occurs in <lb/>
            the case of the man who petitions for leave to put himself to <lb/>
            death :f A man who had given proofs of bravery on previous <lb/>
            occasions, and had, in a subsequent war, demanded to be ex­ <lb/>
            empted from service according to the law, because he was fifty <lb/>
            years of age, but, being opposed by his son, had been compellea <lb/>
            to take the field, deserted: his son, who distinguished himself by <lb/>
            his valour in that war, demands, in his right of option,‡ his <lb/>
            father's life: the father opposes the demand. Here, say the <lb/>
            declaimers, the father does not really wish to die, but merely <lb/>
            to throw odium on his son. 86. For myself, I laugh at the <lb/>
            fear which they manifest on his account, speaking as if they <lb/>
            themselves were in danger of death, and carrying their <lb/>
            terrors into their counsels, forgetful of the multitudes of <lb/>
            instances of voluntary deaths, and of the reason which a man <lb/>
            who was once brave, and has become a deserter, may have for <lb/>
            putting an end to his life. 87. But to particularize all that <lb/>
            would be against a cause § in any one instance would be <lb/>
            useless. I think that, in general, it is no business of a <lb/>
            pleader to prevaricate, || and I can form no conception of a <lb/>
            cause in which both parties have the same object in view ; nor <lb/>
            can I imagine a man so foolish, that, when he wishes to save <lb/>
            his life, he would rather ask for death absurdly, than forbear <lb/>
            to ask for it at all. 88. I do not, however, deny that there are <note type="footnote"> * Certain characters mentioned in the subjects for declamation. </note><note type="footnote"> t See vii. 4, 39. </note><note type="footnote">‡ See v. 10, 97. </note><note type="footnote"> § Contrarium.] Rationem dicendi, quae causæ ipsi noceat.

            honesty of purpose in pleading; and perhaps alludes to similarity of <lb/>
            object in the accu er and defendant; for, in this case, the son entreats <lb/>
            that his father's life may be spared; and the father makes the same <lb/>
            entreaty, as far as intention is concerned. Turnebus. </note> <pb n="177"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/><lb/>
            causes in which figures of this kind may have a place ; such, <lb/>
            for instance, as the following; A young man accused of <lb/>
            murder, as having killed his brother, seemed likely to be found <lb/>
            guilty; but hisfather stated in his evidence that the son had <lb/>
            committed the murder by his order: yet, when the son was <lb/>
            acquitted, the father disinherited him. In this case, the father <lb/>
            does not pardon his son entirely, yet he cannot openly retract <lb/>
            what he asserted in his evidence at first, and, though he does not <lb/>
            extend his severity beyond the punishment of disinheritance, <lb/>
            yet he does not hesitate to disinherit him; and figurative <lb/>
            insinuation has besides more effect on the side of the <lb/>
            father, and less on that of the son, than it ought fairly to <lb/>
            have.*</p>
          <p>89. A person, again, may not speak contrary to what he <lb/>
            wishes, yet he may wish something of more importance than <lb/>
            what he says ; as the disinherited son, who petitions his father <lb/>
            to take back another son whom he had exposed, and who had <lb/>
            been brought up by himself on paying for his maintenance, <lb/>
            would perhaps prefer that he himself should be reinstated in <lb/>
            his rights, yet he may be thought sincere in desiring what he <lb/>
            asks.</p>
          <p>90. There is also a sort of tacit insinuation, which we adopt <lb/>
            when rigid justice on our adversary is demanded by us from <lb/>
            the judge, and yet some hope of mercy is intimated; not <lb/>
            indeed openly, lest we should appear to make a promise, but <lb/>
            so as to afford some plausible suspicion of our intent. Examples <lb/>
            of this may be seen in many cases in the schools, and especially <note type="footnote"> * Et alioqui figura in patre plus facit quàm licet, in jilio minus.] The <lb/>
            meaning of these words is by no means clear, and Gedoyn has for that <lb/>
            reason not translated them. Capperonier and Gesner attempt to inter­ <lb/>
            pret them. Spalding. Gesner's interpretation is to this effect: " With <lb/>
            respect to the father, the figurative insinuation proves too much ; for <lb/>
            if the son, as is intimated, killed his brother of his own mere motion, <lb/>
            why does the father do nothing more than disinherit him ? With <lb/>
            regard to the son, it proves too little; for if, as is represented, he is <lb/>
            innocent of the murder, why is he disinherited ?” Capperonier's <lb/>
            explanation is of this nature: " If the father justifies himself for dis­ <lb/>
            inheriting his son, he intimates that the son killed his brother without <lb/>
            his father's order ; if the son merely pleads that he may not be dis­ <lb/>
            inherited, he makes the father guilty of no crime, when he might <lb/>
            insinuate that he himself did nothing but by the order of his father." <lb/>
            This attempt at explanation is less satisfactory than Gesner's. Alioqui, <lb/>
            says Spalding, is for insuper, præter reliqua, quibus hanc declamationem <lb/>
            defenderat, argumenta. </note> <note type="footnote"> IN </note> <pb n="178"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            in the following: Let there be a law that he who has dishonoured <lb/>
            a virgin is to be put to death, unless he obtains pardon from the <lb/>
            father of the virgin, as well as from his own father, within thirty <lb/>
            days after the commission of the crime: A man who has dis <lb/>
            honoured a virgin, after obtaining the forgiveness of her father, <lb/>
            cannot obtain that of his own, and charges him with being <lb/>
            insane. 91. In this case, should the father promise forgive­ <lb/>
            ness, the process is at an end; should he give no hope of it, <lb/>
            he would be thought, though not mad, yet certainly cruel, and <lb/>
            alienate the feelings of the judge. Porcius Latro, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, with great judgment, made the son say, Will you kill <lb/>
            me then, my father ? and the father reply, Yes, if I shall be <lb/>
            able.* The elder Gallic made the father express himself <lb/>
            more relentingly, and more in accordance with his own dispo­ <lb/>
            sition. Be resolute, my soul, be resolute; yesterday thou wast <lb/>
            more determined. 92. Similar to this sort of figures are those <lb/>
            so much celebrated among the Greeks, by which they give a <lb/>
            softer signification to that which would appear harsh. Thus <lb/>
            Themistocles is thought to have persuaded the Athenians to <lb/>
            commit their city to the care of the gods,† because it would <lb/>
            have been offensive to them to say abandon it. He, also, who <lb/>
            recommended that some golden statues of Victory should be <lb/>
            melted down for the expenses of a war, brought forward his <lb/>
            proposal in this form, that they should make a proper use of <lb/>
            their victories.‡ All that belongs to allegory is of a similar <lb/>
            nature, and consists in saying one thing, and intimating that <lb/>
            another is to be understood.</p>
          <p>93. It is also a matter of consideration how we ought to <lb/>
            reply to figures. Some rhetoricians have been of opinion that <lb/>
            they should always be laid open by the opposite party, as <lb/>
            morbid matter is cut out of the human body. This, indeed, <lb/>
            should be the course most frequently adopted ; for otherwise <lb/>
            the objections contained in them cannot be overthrown, <note type="footnote"> * We shall hardly discover what figure there is in this passage, as <lb/>

            Who it was that said this, is unknown. Spalding. Of a similar nature <lb/>
            was the remark of Duke Christian of Brunswick, who, having ordered <lb/>
            some silver statuettes of the apostles, which he had found at Paderborn, <lb/>
            to be coined into money, observed that the apostles were ordered by <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.II.]."/><lb/>
            especially when the matter in question lies in the very point <lb/>
            at which the tigures aim. But when they are mere vehicles <lb/>
            of invective, it is sometimes a mark of good judgment to affect <lb/>
            not to understand them. 94. If such figures, however, be too <lb/>
            numerous to allow us to avoid noticing them, we must call <lb/>
            upon our opponents to state plainly, if they have confidence <lb/>
            enough in their cause, the charge, whatever it may be, that <lb/>
            they are endeavouring to intimate in ambiguous expressions. <lb/>
            or to forbear at least from expecting that the judge will not <lb/>
            only comprehend, but even believe, that which they themselves <lb/>
            will not venture to express intelligibly 95. It is sometimes <lb/>
            of great effect, too, to pretend not to understand that a figure <lb/>
            is a figure; as in the case of him, (the story is well known,)* <lb/>
            who, when he had been addressed by the advocate of his <lb/>
            opponent in the words, Swear by the ashes of your patron, <lb/>
            replied that he was quite ready to do so ; and the judge <lb/>
            gravely accepted his proposal, though the advocate made great <lb/>
            opposition, and said that the use of figures would thus be <lb/>
            utterly abolished. It is, consequently, a necessary precept <lb/>
            that we must not use figures of that kind rashly.</p>
          <p>96. There is a thirdt kind of figure in which the object <lb/>
            sought is to add grace to style ; and which Cicero, ‡ therefore, <lb/>
            considers as not falling on the point in question between the <lb/>
            parties. Such is the remark which Cicero himself directs <lb/>
            against Clodius :§ By which means he, who was well acquainted <lb/>
            with all our sacrifices, thought that the gods might easily be <lb/>
            propitiated in his favour. 97. Irony is very common in obser­ <lb/>
            vations of this nature. But the far greatest proof of art is <lb/>
            given when one thing is intimated through another. Thus <lb/>
            a person engaged in a suit against a tyrant who had laid down <note type="footnote"> * It is mentioned by Seneca the father, Controv. iii. præf., and <lb/>
            Suetonius de Clar. Rhet. sub fin. But as the reading, in those authors, <lb/>
            is per patris cineres, instead of patroni cineres Spalding very justly <lb/>
            supposes that it should be the same in Quintilian. </note><note type="footnote"> t See sect. 66, 76. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ To what passage of Cicero Quintilian refers, other commentators <lb/>
            have thought themselves excused from attempting to specify, and I <lb/>

            lawful for me to speak against you, but do you speak against <lb/>
            me ; and you can; for I very lately had conceived the intention <lb/>
            of killing you.* 98. It is also a common practice, though not <lb/>
            much deserving of imitation, to employ an oath by way of <lb/>
            figure. Thus an advocate, speaking in behalf of a son who <lb/>
            had been disinherited, exclaimed, So may it be my fate to <lb/>
            die, having a son for my heir !† To swear at all, except <lb/>
            when it is absolutely necessary, is by no means becoming in a <lb/>
            man of sense ; and it was happily said by Seneca, that to <lb/>
            swear is the business, not of pleaders, but of witnesses.‡ Nor <lb/>
            does he, indeed, who swears for the sake of a little oratorical <lb/>
            flourish, deserve attention. To swear as well as Demosthenes, <lb/>
            to whom I alluded a little above, is a very different matter.</p>
          <p>99. By far the most trivial sort of figure is that which con­ <lb/>
            sists in a play upon a single word, though an example of it is <lb/>
            to be found in a remark of Cicero§ on Clodia: Præsertim quum <lb/>
            omnes amicam omnium potiùs quam cujusquam inimicam puta­ <lb/>
            verunt; “ Especially when everybody thought her rather the <lb/>
            friend of all men than the enemy of any man."</p>
          <p>100. As to comparison, I conceive, for my own part, that it is <lb/>
            not to be numbered among figures, as it is sometimes a sort of <lb/>
            proof,|| and sometimes the foundation of a cause ;¶ and as the <lb/>
            form of it is such as it appears in Cicero's speech for Muræna :** <lb/>
            You watch by night, that you may give answers to your clients ; <lb/>
            he, that he may arrive early at the place to which he is marching ; <lb/>

            him, &amp;c. 101. 1 am not sure whether it be not a verbal figure <lb/>
            rather than a figure of thought; the only difference being, that <lb/>

          <p>102. But in addition to the figures which Cicero calls illumi­ <lb/>
            nations of thought, the same Rutilius, following Gorgias, (not <lb/>
            the Leontine, but another who was his contemporary, and <lb/>
            whose four books he has condensed into one of his own.) and <lb/>
            Celsus, following Rutilius, enumerate many others ; 103. as <lb/>
            consummation " comprehension,” which Gorgias calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλλαγή</foreign>, <lb/>
            when several arguments are brought to establish one point; <lb/>
            consequens, " consequence," which he calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαϰολούθησις</foreign>, and <lb/>
            of which we have spoken* under the head of arguments ; col­ <lb/>
            lectio, “collection," which with him is <foreign xml:lang="grc">συλλογισμός</foreign> : threatening, <lb/>
            which he calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατάπληξις</foreign>, and exhortation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱαινετιϰόν</foreign>. But <lb/>
            every one of these is delivered in plain and simple language, <lb/>
            unless when it attaches to itself some one of the figures of <lb/>
            which we have been speaking. 104. Yet, besides these, Celsus <lb/>
            thinks that to except, to assert, to refuse, to excite the judge, to <lb/>
            use proverbs, or verses, or jests, or invectives, or invocations, to <lb/>
            aggravate a charge, (which is the same as <foreign xml:lang="grc">δείνωσις</foreign>.) to flatter, <lb/>
            to pardon, to express disdain, to admonish, to apologize, tc <lb/>
            entreat, to reprove, are figures. 105. He has the same opinion <lb/>
            too, regarding partition, and proposition, and distinction, and <lb/>
            affinity between tiro things, that is, the demonstration that <lb/>
            things which appear to be different may establish the same <lb/>
            fact; for example, that not he only is a poisoner who has <lb/>
            destroyed a man's life by giving him a potion, but he also who <lb/>
            has destroyed his understanding ; a point which depends on <lb/>
            definition. 106. To these Rutilius, or Gorgias, adds <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγϰαι̃ον</foreign>, <lb/>
            66 the representation of the necessity of a thing," <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάμνησις</foreign>, <lb/>

          <p>I. As to verbal figures, they have been perpetually subject <lb/>
            to change, and continue to be changed as custom exerts its <lb/>
            influence. When, accordingly, we compare the language of <lb/>
            our forefathers with our own, we are led to regard almost <lb/>
            every phrase that we use as figurative; for instance we say, <pb n="183"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH.III.]."/><lb/>
            hac re invidere. “ to grudge this thing," not as the <lb/>
            ancients said, and Cicero in particular, hanc rem; incumbere <lb/>
            illi, " to lean upon him," not in ilium; plenum vino, ,. full of <lb/>
            wine," not vini; huic adulari, " to flatter a person," not hunc; <lb/>
            and a thousand other examples might be given. I wish that <lb/>
            the worse may not have prevailed over the better.</p>
          <p>2. However this may be, verbal figures are of two kinds; one, <lb/>
            as they say, lies in the formation of phrases ; the other is to <lb/>
            be sought chiefly in the collocation of them ; and though both <lb/>
            kinds equally concern the art of oratory, yet we may call the <lb/>
            one rather grammatical and the other rhetorical.</p>
          <p>The first sort arises from the same source as solecisms; for <lb/>
            a figure of speech would be a solecism, if it were not inten­ <lb/>
            tional. but accidental.t 3. But figures are commonly sup­ <lb/>
            ported by authority, antiquity, custom, and sometimes by <lb/>
            some special reason. Hence a variation from plain and <lb/>
            direct phraseology is a beauty, if it has something plausible <lb/>
            on which it models itself. In one respect figures are of great <lb/>
            service, by relieving the wearisomeness arising from ordinary <lb/>
            and uniform language, and raising us above mere common <lb/>
            place forms of expression. 4. If a speaker use them mode­ <lb/>
            rately, and as his subject requires, his style will be more <lb/>
            agreeable, as with a certain seasoning sprinkled over it; but <lb/>
            he who affects them too much, will miss the very charm of <lb/>
            variety at which be aims. There are, however, some figures so <lb/>
            common, that they have almost lost their name, and conse­ <lb/>
            quently, however often they are used, they produce but little <lb/>
            effect upon ears accustomed to them. 5. As to such as are <lb/>
            less usual, and remote from everyday language, and for that <lb/>
            reason more elevated, though they produce excitement by <lb/>
            their novelty, they cause satiety if they are lavished in pro­ <lb/>
            fusion, and show that they did not present themselves to the <lb/>
            speaker, but were sought by him, and dragged forth and <lb/>
            collected from every place where they were concealed.</p>
          <p>6. Figures, then, may occur, with regard to nouns, in their <lb/>
            gender; for example, the phrases oculis capti talpae, " blind <note type="footnote"> * From several passages of Pliny the Younger, as well as from <lb/>
            Pliny the Elder, viii. 22, Lucan. vii. 798, Tacit Ann. i. 22, it appears <lb/>
            that the more recent writers preferred using the ablative where Cicero <lb/>
            and the older authors had always used the accusative. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t See i. 5, 58. </note> <pb n="184"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B.IX."/><lb/>
            molest and timidi damæ, “timid deer," are used by Virgil; <lb/>
            but not without reason, as both genders are signified under <lb/>
            one, and it is certain that there are male talpæ and damæ as <lb/>
            well as female.* Figures may also affect verbs, as fabricatus <lb/>
            est gladium,t “ he fabricated a sword,” punitus e8t inimicum,: <lb/>
            “ he punished his enemy." 7. This is the less surprising, as it <lb/>
            is not uncommon with us, in the use of verbs, to express what <lb/>
            we do by a passive form, as arbitror, " I think," suspicor, “I <lb/>
            suspect," and, on the other hand, to signify what we suffer by <lb/>
            an active form, as vapulo, “ I am beaten ; ” and hence there <lb/>
            are frequent interchanges of the two, and many things are <lb/>
            expressed in either form: as luxuriatur, luxuriat, "luxuri­ <lb/>
            ates," fluctuatur, fluctuate “ fluctuates," assentior, assentio, “ 1 <lb/>
            assent." 8. There may be also a figure in number, either <lb/>
            when the plural is joined with the singular, as, Gladio pugna­ <lb/>
            cissimi gens Romani, “ The Romans are a nation that fight <lb/>
            vigorously with the sword," gens being a noun of multitude; or <lb/>
            when a singular is attached to a plural, as, <lb/>
            Qui non risêre parentes, <lb/>
            Nec deus hunc mensâ, dea nec dignata cubili est,§ <lb/>
            “ Those who have not smiled on their parents, neither has a <lb/>
            god honoured him with his table, nor a goddess with her <lb/>
            couch," that is, among those who have not smiled, is he whom <lb/>
            a god has not honoured, &amp;c. 9. In a satire of Persius || we <lb/>
            have, <lb/>
            Et nostrum istud vivere triste <lb/>
            Aspexi, <lb/>
            “ And I saw that sad to live of ours," where he has used an <lb/>
            infinitive mood for a substantive, for he intends nostram vitam <lb/>
            to be understood. We also sometimes use a verb for a par­ <lb/>
            ticiple, as, <lb/>
            Magnum dot ferre talentum,¶ <lb/>
            “ He gives a great talent to carry,” ferre for ferendum; and a <lb/>
            participle for a verb, as Volo datum, “ I wish given," for Vole <lb/>
            dari “I wish to be given." 10. Sometimes it may even be <note type="footnote"> * Virgo Georg. i. 183; Ecl viii 28. </note><note type="footnote"> + Cicero pro Rabir.

            doubted on what solecism a figure borders, as in this ex. <lb/>

            Virtus est vitium fugere,* <lb/>
            “ To flee vice is virtue," for the author either interchanges <lb/>
            parts of speech, for Virtus est fuga vitiorum, “ Virtue is the <lb/>
            avoidance of vices," or alters a case, for Virtut is est vitium <lb/>
            fugere, “ It is the part of virtue to avoid vice;" but the form <lb/>
            which he himself adopts is much more spirited than either of <lb/>
            the others. Sometimes two or more figures are used together, <lb/>
            as Sthenelus sciens pugnæ,† “ Sthenelus skilful in fight," for <lb/>
            Scitus Sthenelus pugnandi. 11. One tense, too, is sometimes <lb/>
            put for another, as Timarchides negat esse ei periculum à <lb/>
            securi,‡ “ Timarchides says that he is in no danger of being <lb/>
            beheaded," the present being put for the preterperfect. And <lb/>
            one mood for another, as, <lb/>

            may particularly notice, is that which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτέϱωσις</foreign>, <lb/>
            to which what they term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξαλλαγή</foreign> is not very dissimilar. <lb/>
            There is an example in Sallust,|| Neque ea res falsum me <lb/>
            habuit, “Nor have my anticipations deceived me," and another <lb/>
            Duci probare.¶ In such figures brevity, as well as novelty, is <lb/>
            generally an object. Hence the same author has proceeded <lb/>
            so far as to say non pœniturum, “not about to repent," for non <lb/>
            acturum panitentiam; and visuros, “ about to see," for ad <lb/>
            videndum missos 13. These expressions he must have con­ <lb/>
            sidered as figures; whether they can now be called by that <lb/>
            name, may be a question; for they are received into common <lb/>
            use, and we are content with what is received, though it rest <lb/>
            oniy on the authority of the vulgar. Thus rebus agentibus,** <note type="footnote"> * Hor. Ep. i. 1, 41. </note><note type="footnote">t Hor.

            which Asinius Pollio condemns in Labienus,* has struggled <lb/>
            into use, as well as contumeliam fecit,† which is well known <lb/>
            to have been censured by Cicero, for in his days they said <lb/>
            affici contumeliâ. J 4. Another recommendation of figures is <lb/>
            that of antiquity, of which Virgil was an eminent lover: <lb/>
            Vel quum se pavidum contra mea jurgia jactat <lb/>
            Or when he shows himself afraid to meet <lb/>
            My charge; <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            Progeniem sed enim Trojano A sanguine duci <lb/>
            Audierat, <lb/>
            But she had heard a race would be deriv'd <lb/>
            From Trojan blood, <lb/>
            Similar phraseology is found in abundance in the old tragic <lb/>
            and comic poets. One word of the kind has remained in use, <lb/>
            enimvero, " for truly." 15. There is more of the same sort <lb/>
            in the same author ; as, <lb/>
            Nam quis te, juvenum confidentissime,–|| <lb/>
            For who bade thee, thou boldest of young men,— <lb/>
            for quis is usually set at the commencement of a phrase. And, <lb/>
            speaking of the Chimæra on the crest of Turnus, <lb/>
            Tarn magis ilia tremens, et tristibus effera flammis, <lb/>
            Quàm magis effuso crudescunt sanguine pugnæ,¶ <lb/>
            The more the fields of strife with bloodshed rage, <lb/>
            The more it trembles, and the fiercer glows <lb/>
            With issuing fires. <lb/>
            which is an inversion of the usual order, Quam magis œrumna <note type="footnote"> * Sec iv. 1, 11; i. 5, 8. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cic. Philipp. iii. 9. Gesner observes that facere contumeliam, was <lb/>

            a subject of doubt among the commentators. Budæus, in his Com­ <lb/>
            ment. Ling. Gr. p. 1454, supposes that vel is used for nam, expressing <lb/>
            indignant feeling. Burmann thinks that all the peculiarity is merely <lb/>
            a transposition for cum se vel pavidum. Gesner imagines that vel is for <lb/>
            etiam, ade<foreign xml:lang="grc">ό</foreign>, “ cum vi exaggerandi." Spalding thinks that in the abrupt <lb/>
            conciseness of the phraseology, when all that should follow the protasii <lb/>
            is left to be understood, vel quum has much of strangeness, which he <lb/>
            considers Quintilian justified in ascribing to antiquity. </note><note type="footnote"> § Æn. i. 19.

            tion presses, the more influence it has in prompting evil <lb/>
            deeds." 16. The ancients are full of such expressions; as <lb/>
            Terence at the beginning of the Eunuch, Quid igitur faciam ?† <lb/>
            " What then shall I do ? ”Allusit tandem leno.‡ Aud <lb/>
            Catullus, in his Epithalamium, has, <lb/>
            Duminnupta manct, dum cara suisest, <lb/>
            —— As long as she remains unwed, so long <lb/>
            She to her friends is dear, <lb/>
            the first dum signifying quoad, the second usque e<foreign xml:lang="grc">ό</foreign>. 17. In <lb/>
            Sallust are many phrases translated from the Greek, as Vulgus <lb/>
            amat fieri.|| " [Things which] the crowd likes to be done;" <lb/>
            also in Horace,¶ who was a great lover of Hellenisms, <lb/>
            Nec ciceris, nec longæ incidit avenæ, <lb/>
            Nor grudg'd him vetches, nor the long-shap'd oat; <lb/>
            and in Virgil, <lb/>
            Tyrrhenum navigat æquor,** <lb/>
            Sails the Tyrrhenian deep.</p>
          <p>18. It is now a common expression, too, in the public acts,†† <lb/>
            saucius pectus, "wounded in the breast." Under the same <lb/>
            head of figures fall the addition and abstraction of words. To <lb/>
            add a word more than is necessary may seem useless, but it is <lb/>
            often not without grace ; as, <lb/>
            Nam neque Parnassi vobis juga, nam neque Pindi,‡‡ <lb/>
            For neither have Parnassus' heights, nor those <lb/>
            Of Pindus, e'er detain'd you; <lb/>
            the second nam being superfluous. In Horace we have, <note type="footnote"> * Spalding supposes that these words are cited merely as an exem­ <lb/>
            plification of the usual order of Quàm and tam. Muretus thinks them <lb/>

            Fabricius, him, and Curius with his locksy <lb/>
            Unshorn. <lb/>
            As to suppressions of words, in the body of a sentence, they <lb/>
            ➚are either faulty or figurative; as, <lb/>
            Accede ad ignem, jam calesces plus satis,† <lb/>
            Approach the fire, and you will soon be warm'd <lb/>
            More than enough, <lb/>
            Plus satis being for plus quàm satis, one word only being <lb/>
            omitted. In other cases of suppression, a supply of many <lb/>
            words may be necessary. ‡ 19. Comparatives we very often use <lb/>
            for positives; thus a person will say that he is infirmior, <lb/>
            " weaker," that is, weaker than ordinary; and we are also in <lb/>
            the habit of opposing two comparatives to each other, instead <lb/>
            of a positive and comparative ; as, Si te, Catilina, comprehendi, <lb/>
            si interfici jussero, credo, erit verendum mihi, ne non hoc <lb/>
            potiùs omnes boni seriùs a me, quam quisquam crudeliùs <lb/>
            factum esse dicat.§ " If I should order you, Catiline, to be <lb/>
            seized, if I should order you to be put to death, I should have <lb/>
            to fear lest all good members of society should think that <lb/>
            such a course was adopted too late by me, rather than that <lb/>
            any one should consider it adopted with too much severity." <lb/>
            20. There are also such expressions as the following, which, <lb/>
            though not indeed of the nature of solecisms, put one number <lb/>
            for another, and are consequently to be in general reckoned <lb/>
            among tropes. || Thus we speak of a single person in the <lb/>
            plural: <note type="footnote"> * Her. Od. i. 12, 40. </note><note type="footnote">+ Terence, Eun. i. 2, 5. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Nam de alterd, quæ detractione, pluribus adjiciendum est.] Spalding <lb/>
            allows these words to be corrupt; Gesner thinks that something that <lb/>
            should follow them is lost out of the text. Gesner reads dicendum <lb/>
            with Regius, but very injudiciously, as it seems. Spalding proposes to <lb/>
            amend the passage thus : Nam ad alteram quidem detractionem pluribui <lb/>
            adjiciendum est ; observing that nam, as is often the case, refers t ) <lb/>
            something understood, as if Quintilian meant to say, " Defungar hoc <lb/>
            quàm brevissimo exemplo, ubi nihil deest nisi quàm, nam ad ceteram <lb/>

            Sed not immensum spatiis. confecimus æquor,* <lb/>
            But we have pass'd o'er plains immense in space; <lb/>
            Or of several persons in the singular: <lb/>
            Haud secus ac patriis acer Romania in armis, t <lb/>
            Like the fierce Roman in his country's arms.</p>
          <p>21. Of a different species, though the same in kind, are the <lb/>
            following instances: <lb/>
            Neve tibi ad solem vergant vineta cadentem, <lb/>
            Nor let your vineyards tow'rds the setting sun <lb/>
            Be spread; <lb/>
            Ne mihi tum molles sub divo carpere somnos, <lb/>
            Neu dorso nemoris libeat jacuisse per herb s,§ <lb/>
            Let me not then incline to court soft sleep <lb/>
            Beneath the open sky, or on the grass <lb/>
            To stretch, beside the grove; <lb/>
            for Virgil does not admonish one person in the first passage, <lb/>
            or himself alone in the second, but intends his precepts for <lb/>
            all. 22. We speak, too, of ourselves as if we were speaking <lb/>
            of others: Dicit Servius, "Servins asserts;" Negat Tullius ; <lb/>
            " Cicero denies;" and we speak in our person instead of <lb/>
            speaking in that of another ; and put one third person in place <lb/>
            of another. There is an example of both figures in the speech <lb/>
            for Cæcina : || Cicero, addressing Piso, the advocate of the <lb/>
            opposite party, says, Restituisse te dîxti? nego me ex edicto <lb/>
            prætoris restitutum esse; " Do you say that you reinstated me ? <lb/>
            I deny that I was reinstated by an edict of the prætor ;" but <lb/>
            it was Æbutius ¶ that said restituisse, and Cæcina that replied, <lb/>
            nego me ex edicto prætoris restitutum esse; and there is a <lb/>
            figure used in the word dîxti, from which a syllable is struck <lb/>
            out.</p>
          <p>23. Some other figures may be regarded as of the same <lb/>
            nature. One is that which we call <unclear>interpositioor</unclear> interclusio <lb/>
            and the Greeks parenthes <unclear>countenanced</unclear> remark <lb/>
            breaks the course of <unclear>adéed</unclear> any effect upon you?" <lb/>
            nim sæpissime loquit,<unclear/> the same word; as, Who called had <lb/>
            brought you back (Who produced them ? Appius.¶ This last <note type="footnote"> * Virgo Gear </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Georg. no Mil. c. 27. </note><note type="footnote">t Virgo Eel. ii. 69. </note><note type="footnote"> || C. 29.

            country," &amp;c. With this some join the hyperbaton,* which <lb/>
            they do not choose to number among tropes. 24. Another <lb/>
            is one which is similar to the figure of thought called apos­ <lb/>
            trophe ;t it does not affect the sense, but only the form of <lb/>
            expression; as, <lb/>
            Decios, Marios, magnosque Camillos, <lb/>
            Scipiadas duros bello, et te, maxime Cæsear,‡ <lb/>
            The Decii she <lb/>
            Marii, and great Camilli bore, the sons <lb/>
            Of Scipio, stern in war, and thee of all <lb/>
            The greatest, Cæsar.</p>
          <p>25, Of this there is a still more spirited example where the <lb/>
            poet is speaking of Polydore: <lb/>
            Fas omne abrumpit, Polydorum obtruncat, et auro <lb/>
            Vi potitur. Quid non mortaUa pectora cogis <lb/>
            Auri sacra fames. <lb/>
            He breaks all laws, kills Polydore, and grasps <lb/>
            The gold by force. To what dost thou not drive <lb/>
            The hearts of mortals, direful thirst of gold ? <lb/>
            Those who have distinguished small differences with particular <lb/>
            names, add the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετάβασις</foreign>,|| which they consider as a <lb/>
            different kind of apostrophe; as, <lb/>
            Quid loquor ? aut ubi sum ? ¶ <lb/>
            What am I saying ? Or where am I ?</p>
          <p>26. Virgil unites the parenthesis and apostrophe in this <lb/>
            passage: <lb/>
            Haud procul inde citœ Aetium in diversa quadrigœ <lb/>
            Distulerant, (at tu dictis, Albane, maneres,) <lb/>
            .aptabatque viri mendacis viscera Tullus.** <lb/>
            Not far from thence swift steeds had Metius rent <lb/>
            In diverse parts, (thou, Alban, shouldst have kept <lb/>
            Thy plighted faith ) and Tullus dragg'd abroad <lb/>
            The traitor's sever'd corpse.</p>
          <p>27 These figures very injudiciously, asse, whether they arise from <lb/>
            change, <unclear/> passage thus: Nam ad alterdiransposition, attract the <lb/>
            atter cendum est ;observing that nam, as suffer him to grow <unclear/> <lb/>

            expression; and they derive something of the pleasure which <lb/>
            they give from their resemblance to faults, as a little acidity <lb/>
            is sometimes gratefu- in cookery. This result will be pro­ <lb/>
            duced, if they are not extravagantly numerous, or if those of <lb/>
            the same kind are not thrown together, or introduced too <lb/>
            frequently; for rarity in their use, as well as diversity, will <lb/>
            prevent satiety.</p>
          <p>28. Those sorts of figures have a more striking effect, which <lb/>
            not only concern the form of expression, but communicate <lb/>
            grace and energy to the thoughts.</p>
          <p>Of these we may notice in the first place that which con­ <lb/>
            sists in addition. There are several kinds; for words are some­ <lb/>
            times repeated, either for the sake of amplification, as, I have <lb/>
            killed, I have killed, not Spurius Mælius,* &amp;c., where the first <lb/>
            " I have killed" merely asserts the act, the second confirms <lb/>
            the assertion. Or of expressing pity; as, <lb/>
            Ah Corydon, Corydon, &amp;c.†</p>
          <p>29. This figure is sometimes, too, employed for the sake of <lb/>
            extenuation, and by way of irony. Something similar to this <lb/>
            reiteration of a word, is the repetition of one after a parenthe­ <lb/>
            sis, which adds, however, force at the same time: I have seen <lb/>
            the property, unhappy that I am! (for though my tears are <lb/>
            spent, grief still dwells fixed in my heart,) the property, I say <lb/>
            of Cneius Pompey, subjected to the cruel voice of the public <lb/>
            crier.‡ You live, and live not to lay aside, but to increase your <lb/>
            audacity.§ 30. Sentences, again, are sometimes commenced, to <lb/>
            give them spirit and energy, with the same word ; as, Nihilne <lb/>
            te nocturnum presidium palatii, nihil urbis vigiliæ, nihil timor <lb/>
            populi, nihil consensus bonorum omnium, nihil hie munitissi­ <lb/>
            mus habendi senatûs locus, nihil horum ora vultusque moverunt ?|| <lb/>
            " Has not the nightly guard of the palatium, has not the <lb/>
            watch kept in the city, has not the fear of the people, has not <lb/>
            the unanimity of all men of honour, has not this fortified place <lb/>
            for assembling the senate, have not the countenances and looks of <lb/>
            those here present, produced any effect upon you ?" 31. Some­ <lb/>
            times they are ended with the same word ; as, Who called for <lb/>

            example, however, may be referred to another kind of figure,­ <lb/>
            in which the beginning and end of each phrase are alike: <lb/>
            Is who" and “ who," " Appius" and “ Appius." Of this figure <lb/>
            the following is an apt example : Who are they that have fre­ <lb/>
            quently broken treaties ? The Carthaginians .Who are they <lb/>
            that have waged war with the utmost cruelty ? The Carthagi­ <lb/>
            nians. Who are they that have devastated Italy ? The Car­ <lb/>
            thaginians. Who are they that importune to be forgiven ? <lb/>
            The Oarthaginians.† 32. In antitheses, also, or comparisons, <lb/>
            there is commonly a repetition of the first words of each <lb/>
            phrase alternately, so as to correspond; and I, therefore, said <lb/>
            just above ‡ that it was referable to this head rather than to <lb/>
            any other: You wake in the night, that tou may give answers <lb/>
            to your clients; he, that he may arrive early with his army at <lb/>
            the place whither he is marching. rou are aroused by the <lb/>
            crowing of cocks, he, by the sound of trumpets. You conduct <lb/>
            lawsuits, he draws up troops. You are on the watch lest your <lb/>
            clients should be disappointed, he, lest his towns or his camp <lb/>
            should be taken.§ 38. But not content with having produced <lb/>
            this beauty, the orator presents the same figure in a reverse <lb/>
            order: He knows and understands how the forces of the enemy <lb/>
            are to be kept at a distance; you, how the rain may be prevented <lb/>
            from annoying us.|| He exercises himself in extending bounda­ <lb/>
            ries, you, in settling them. 34. The middle may also be made <lb/>
            to correspond with the beginning; as, <lb/>
            Te nemus Anguitiœ, vitred te Fucinus undà, ¶ <lb/>
            Thee Anguitia’s grove deplor'd, <lb/>
            Thee, Fucinus, with crystal stream; <lb/>
            or with the end; as, Hœc navis onusta prœdâ Sicilsensi, quum <lb/>
            ipsa quoque esset ex prœdâ,** “This ship laden with Sicilian <lb/>
            spoil, being itself also a portion of the spoil." Nor will it be <lb/>
            doubted that by the same figure that which is in the middle <lb/>
            may be put both at the beginning and the end. The end may <lb/>
            also be made to correspond with the beginning; as, Many <note type="footnote"> * Which they call symploce.

            severe afflictions were found for parents, and for relatives many.* <lb/>
            35. There is, likewise another kind of repetition, which recurs <lb/>
            to things or persons mentioned before, and distinguishes <lb/>
            them: <lb/>
            Iphituc a Pelias <unclear>meciun</unclear>, quorum Iphitus œvo <lb/>
            Jam gravior, Pelias et vulnere tardus Ulivi ,† <lb/>
            Iphitus came, and Pelias came, with me; <lb/>
            Iphitus slow with age, and Pelias lame <lb/>
            As wounded by Ulysses. <lb/>
            This is what in Greek is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὲπάνοδος</foreign> : our writers term it <lb/>
            regressio. 36. Nor are the same words repeated only in the <lb/>
            same sense, but often in a different one, and in opposition ; as, <lb/>
            The dignity of the leaders was almost equal; but not equal, <lb/>
            perhaps, was that of those who followed them.‡ Sometimes <lb/>
            this kind of repetition is varied as to cases and genders; as, <lb/>
            Magnus est labor dicendi, magna res est, " Great is the labour <lb/>
            of eloquence; great is its importance." In Rutilius there is <lb/>
            an example of this in a longer period ;§ but the commencements <lb/>
            of the sentences are, Pater hie tuus ? Patrem nunc appellas ? <lb/>
            Patri tu filius es ? ‟ Is this your father ? Do you now call <lb/>
            him father? Are you to him as a son to a father ?" 37. By <lb/>
            a change of cases, too, is sometimes formed the figure which <lb/>
            they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολύπτμτον</foreign>.It is also formed in other ways.|| as in <note type="footnote"> * Cic. in Verr. v. 45. </note><note type="footnote">t An. ii. 435. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero pro Ligar. c. 6. The opposition is between par and non <lb/>
            par, “ equal and " not equal," but par is not in reality repeated in a <lb/>
            different sense. </note><note type="footnote"> § Et apud Rutilium longa <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιόδοις</foreign>.] Spalding adopts the reading <lb/>
            longa <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱιόδοις</foreign>, but longiore periodo, preferred by Gesner and most <lb/>
            other editors, is surely much better. Quintilian intimates that the <lb/>
            passage in Rutilius (i. 10) is so long that be will not give it <unclear>entire</unclear>. <lb/>
            The following is a translation of it: " Is this man to be deemed your <lb/>
            father, only that he may be thought to be obliged to support you in <lb/>
            your poverty ? Do you now call him your father whom you formerly <lb/>
            deserted, as if he had been a stranger, when he needed your aid ? Are <lb/>
            you a son to your father only that you may enjoy his wealth, wheu <lb/>
            you have acted as his most cruel enemy, to bring affliction on his old <lb/>
            age? Assuredly we beget children inconsiderately; for it is from <lb/>
            them that we derive most of our misery and dishonour." </note><note type="footnote"> H Constat et aliis etiam modis.] All the commentators pass these <lb/>
            words in silence except Spalding, who says that he can soc no sense in <lb/>
            them, unless we take modis in the sense of different parts of verbs, <lb/>
            referring to dandi, datum, datum, in the following quotation. But this <lb/>
            will hardly satisfy any rouder. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <pb n="194"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            Cicero's speech for Cluentius : * Quod autem tempus veneni <lb/>
            dandi ? Illo die ? In illâ frequentid ? Per quem porro <lb/>
            datum ? Unde simptum ? Quœ porro interceptio poculi ? cut <lb/>
            non de integro autem datum ? “ But what was the time at <lb/>
            which the poison was given? Was it on that day? Among <lb/>
            such a number of people ? By whose instrumentality, more­ <lb/>
            over, was it given ? Whence was it taken ? What was the <lb/>
            means of intercepting the cup ? Why was it not given a <lb/>
            second time ?" 38. Such a combination of different particu­ <lb/>
            lars Cæcilius calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταολή</foreign>, of which another passage from <lb/>
            the speech for Cluentiust may be given as an example ; it is <lb/>
            in reference to Oppianicus : Ilium tabulas publicas Larini <lb/>
            censorias corrupisse, decuriones universi judicaverunt; cum <lb/>
            illo nemo rationem, nemo rem ullam contrahebat; nemo illum <lb/>
            ex tam multis cognatis et affinibus tutorem unquam liberis suis <lb/>
            scripsit, “ That he falsified the public registers at Larinum, <lb/>
            the decuriones were unanimously of opinion; no man kept <lb/>
            any account, no man made any bargain with him; no man, of <lb/>
            all his numerous kinemen and connexions, ever appointed him <lb/>
            guardian to his children," and much more to the same <lb/>
            purpose</p>
          <p>39. As particulars are here thrown together, so, on the <lb/>
            other nand, they may be distributed, or, as Cicero,‡ I think, <lb/>
            calls it, dissipated; as, <lb/>
            Hic segetes, illic veniunt feliciùs uvœ, <lb/>
            Arborei fœtus alibi, &amp;c.§ <lb/>
            Here corn, there grapes, more gladly spring; elsewhere <lb/>
            The stems of trees, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>40. In Cicero is seen an example of a remarkable mixture cf <lb/>
            figures, in a passage in which the last word, after a long <lb/>
            interval, is repeated in correspondence to the first ; the <lb/>
            middle also is in accordance with the commencement, and the <lb/>
            conclusion with the middle : Vestrum jam hie factum deprehen­ <lb/>
            ditur, Patres Conscripti, non meum; ac pulcherrimum quidem <lb/>
            factum ; verum, ut dixi, non meum, sed vestrum ;|| “ Your <note type="footnote"> * C. 60.

            work now appears here, Conscript Fathers, not mine; and a <lb/>
            very honourable work, indeed, it is; but, as I said, it is not <lb/>
            mine, but yours." 41. This frequent repetition the Greeks call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλοϰή</foreign> :* it consists, as I said,† of a mixture of figures; a <lb/>
            letter to Brutus‡ affords an example of it: “When I had <lb/>
            returned into favour with Appius Claudius, and it was through <lb/>
            Cneius Pompey that I did return, and, accordingly, when <lb/>
            I had returned, ”&amp;c. 42. It may be formed also by a repetition <lb/>
            of the same words, in various forms, in the same sentence ; as <lb/>
            in Persius, <lb/>
            Usque adeone <lb/>
            Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter ?§ <lb/>
            Is. then, to know in thee <lb/>
            Nothing, unless another know thou know’st ? <lb/>
            and in Cicero,|| Neque enim poterat, indicio et his damnatis, qui <lb/>
            indicabantur; “ For neither could he, when those were found <lb/>
            guilty on information against whom information was given.". <lb/>
            43. But whole sentences, too, are sometimes ended with the <lb/>
            phrases with which they are commenced: He came from Asia. <lb/>
            Of how much advantage was even this ? But it was in the <lb/>
            character of a tribune of the people that he came from Asia. <lb/>
            When, however, the last word in a period is made to corre­ <lb/>
            spend with the first, another repetition of it may be given, as <lb/>
            to the sentence just quoted is added, However he came from <lb/>
            Asia. Sometimes a series of words may be repeated, and in <lb/>
            precisely the same order : What could Cleomenes do ? For I <lb/>
            cannot accuse any onefalsely. What, to much purpose could <lb/>
            Cleomenes do ? ¶ 44. The last word of the former of two sen­ <lb/>
            tences, and the first of the latter, are often the same ; a figure <lb/>
            which poets, indeed, use more frequently than prose writers: <note type="footnote"> allowing them to plead their cause. I suspect that the words come <lb/>
            from the speech of Cicero against Metellus, (see sect. 45, 49,) which he <lb/>
            delivered in the senate, and calls his Metellina oratio in a letter to <lb/>

          <p>But orators afford not unfrequent examples of it: Yet he lives <lb/>
            Lives? Nay, he even comes into the senate.t 45. Sometimes <lb/>
            (the remark is similar to what I said‡ in regard to the repeti <lb/>
            tion of words,) the beginnings and conclusions of phrases are <lb/>
            made to correspond with each other by means of words which, <lb/>
            though different, are yet of a similar signification. The be­ <lb/>
            ginnings, for example, thus: Dediderim periculis omnibus, <lb/>
            obtulerim insidiis, objecerim invidiœ :§ " I would have thrown <lb/>
            him into every kind of danger, I would have exposed him to <lb/>
            treachery, I would have consigned him to public odium." The <lb/>
            conclusions thus: Vos enim statuistis, vos sententiam dixistis, <lb/>
            vos judicâstis : " You determined, you gave your opinion, you <lb/>
            pronounced judgment." This some call <foreign xml:lang="grc">συωνυμία</foreign>, ∥others <lb/>
            disjunction; and both terms, though of different meaning, are <lb/>
            used with propriety; for it is a separation of words having the <lb/>
            same signification. Sometimes, again, words that have the <lb/>
            same signification are congregated :¶ Such being the case, Cati­ <lb/>
            line, go whither you had intended to go; depart at length from <lb/>
            the city; the gates are open ; commence your journey. 46. And <lb/>
            in another speech against Catiline, He is gone, he has departed, <lb/>
            he has sallied forth, he has escaped... This, in the opinion of <lb/>
            Cæcilius, is pleonasm, that is, language copious beyond what <lb/>
            is necessary, as in the words, <lb/>
            Vidi oculos ante ipse meos,‡ <lb/>
            I saw, myself, before my eyes, <lb/>
            for in vidi “I saw," is included ipse, “ myself." But such <lb/>
            phraseology, as I have remarked in another place, is, when <lb/>
            burdened with any useless addition, faulty ; when it adds <lb/>
            strength to the plain thought, as in this case, it is a beauty ; <lb/>
            for the several words vidi, ipse, and ante oculos, produce each <note type="footnote"> * Virgo Eel. x. 72. </note><note type="footnote">t Cicero in Cat. i. 1. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Sect. 30. </note><note type="footnote"> § Probably, says Spalding, this and the following quotation are frc m <lb/>

            its impression <unclear>in</unclear> the mind. 47. Why Cæcilius, then, should <lb/>
            have characterized it by such a term, I cannot tell ; for every <lb/>
            sort of reduplication, and repetition, and addition, might be <lb/>
            called pleonasm with just as much propriety. Not only words <lb/>
            of similar import, however, but also thoughts, are sometimes <lb/>
            accumulated; as, Perturbatio istum mentis, et quadam scelerum <lb/>
            offusa caligo, et ardentes Furiarum faces excitarunt .* “ Per­ <lb/>
            turbation of mind, darkness shed over him through his crimes, <lb/>
            and the burning torches of the Furies excited him." 48. <lb/>
            Words and phrases of different import are also thrown <lb/>
            together; as, Mulier, tyranni sœva crudelitas, patris amor, ira <lb/>
            præceps, temeritas, dementia, &amp;c. The woman. the savage <lb/>
            cruelty of the tyrant, his love for his father, violent anger, <lb/>
            rashness, madness," &amp;c. Another example is to be found in <lb/>
            Ovid, <lb/>
            Sed grave Nereidum numen, sed corniger A mmon, <lb/>
            Sed quas visceribus veniebat bellua ponti, <lb/>
            Exsaturanda meis, &amp;c. † <lb/>
            But the dread Nereids' power, but Ammon horrid, <lb/>
            But the dire monster from the deep that came, <lb/>
            To feed upon my vitals, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>49. I have found some authors call the following form <lb/>
            of sentence <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλοϰή</foreign> :‡ Quæro ab inimicis, sintne hœc investi­ <lb/>
            gata, comperta, patejacta, sublata, deleta, extincta per me ?§ <lb/>
            It I ask of my enemies whether it was not by my means that <lb/>
            these plots were investigated, discovered, exposed, overthrown, <lb/>
            destroyed, annihilated?" But with these authors I do not <lb/>
            agree, as the words form but one figure, though they are of a <lb/>
            mixed nature, partly of similar and partly of different signifi­ <lb/>
            cation; a union which they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλλαγή</foreign> : for investigate, <lb/>
            comperta, patefacta, state one thing, and sublata, deleta, <lb/>
            extincta, state another, the latter being similar one to another, <lb/>
            but dissimilar to the former. 50. We may observe, too, that <lb/>
            the last quotation, and the last but one, afford an example of <lb/>
            another figure, which, as it consists in the omission of con­ <lb/>
            junctions, is called dialysis, and is aptly used when we have to <note type="footnote"> * This quotation, and the following, appear to be from lost declama­ <lb/>

            brought before the senate; it was in the senate thai they were <lb/>
            arraigned, and so on through the whole of that passage. This <lb/>
            mode of oppression the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">βραυογία</foreign>,† which may <lb/>
            be regard ed as a conjunctive disjunction. 51. Opposed to this <lb/>
            is the figure which consists in superfluity of conjunctions; <lb/>
            the one is called asyndeton, the other polysyndeton, which <lb/>
            arises either from repetitions of the same conjunction, as, <lb/>
            Tectumquc, laremque, <lb/>
            Armaque, Amyclœumque canem, Cressamque pharetram, ‡<lb/>
            Both house, and household gods, and arms, <lb/>
            And Amyclæan dog, and quiver form'd <lb/>
            Of Cretan make; <lb/>
            52. or of different conjunctions, as <lb/>
            Arma virumque , <lb/>
            Multum ille et terris , <lb/>
            Malta, quoque .§ <lb/>
            53. In like manner adverbs and pronouns are also varied : <lb/>
            Hic ilium vitii juvenem <lb/>
            Bis senos cui nostra dies — <lb/>
            Hie mihi responsum primus dedit ile petenti.|| <lb/>
            But both the asyndeton and the polysyndeton are coacerva. <lb/>
            tions of words, the only difference being in the presence or <lb/>
            absence of conjunctions. 54. Writers have given them their own <lb/>
            names, which are various, as it suited the fancy of those who <lb/>
            invented them. The source of them, indeed, is the same, as <lb/>
            they render what we say more vivacious and energetic, exhibit­ <lb/>
            ing an appearance of vehemence, and of passion bursting forth <lb/>
            as it were time after time. <note type="footnote"> * By not being united into a body, but left separate. </note><note type="footnote"> t See viii. 3, 82. " Many suppose," says Turnebus, “ that we should <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>Gradation, which is Galled by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰλι̃μαξ</foreign>, is pro­ <lb/>
            duced by art less disguised, or more affected, and ought for <lb/>
            that reason to be less frequently used. 55. It lies too, in repe­ <lb/>
            tition, for it recurs to what has been said, and takes a rest, as <lb/>
            it were, on something that precedes, before it passes on to <lb/>
            anything else. An example of it may be translated from a <lb/>
            well-known Greek passage :* I not only did not say this, but <lb/>
            did not even write it; 1 not only did not write it, but took no <lb/>
            part in the embassy; I not only took no part in the embassy, <lb/>
            but used no persuasion to the Thebans. 56. A Latin example or <lb/>
            two, however, may also be added: Exertion gained merit to <lb/>
            Africanus, merit glory, and glory rivals it and, from Calvus, ‡<lb/>
            Trials for extortion have not, therefore, ceased more than those <lb/>
            for treason ; nor those for treason, more than those under the <lb/>
            Plautian law; nor those under the Plautian law more than <lb/>
            those for bribery; nor those for bribery more than those under <lb/>
            any other law. 57. Examples are also to be found in the <lb/>
            poets, as in Homer about the sceptre, which he brings down <lb/>
            from Jupiter to Agamemnon; and in a tragic poet of our <lb/>
            own,§ <lb/>
            Jove propagatus est, ut perhibent, Tantalus, <lb/>
            Ex Tantalo ortus Pelop8, ex Pelope autem satus <lb/>
            Atreus, qui nostrum porro propagat genus ; <lb/>
            From Jove, as they relate, sprung Tantalus ; <lb/>
            From Tantalus sprung Pelops, and from Pelops <lb/>
            Came Atreus, who is father of our race.</p>
          <p>58. As to figures which consist in the omission of a word or <lb/>
            words, they aim chiefly at the merit of brevity or novelty. <lb/>
            One of them is that which I delayed to consider till I should <lb/>
            enter upon figures, when I was speaking in the preceding book <lb/>
            about synecdoche,|| a figure in which any word that is omitted is <lb/>
            easily understood from the rest, as when Cælius says, in <lb/>
            speaking against Antonius,¶ Stupere gaudio Græcus, “ the <lb/>
            Greek began to be astonished with joy," for cæpit, “ began," is <lb/>
            readily understood. So Cicero writes to Brutus,** Sermo nullus <note type="footnote"> * Demosth. de Cor. p. 288 ed. Reisk. </note><note type="footnote"> + Whose words these are is unknown. They are cited ad Heronts <lb/>
            iv. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡From a speech of his against Vatinius, Aquil.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            scilicet, nisi de te; quid enim potius ? Tum Flavius, Crag <lb/>
            inquit, tabellarii, et ego ibidem has inter cænam exaravi,” <lb/>
            “ There is no talk, indeed, but of you; for what better can <lb/>
            there be ? Then Flavius says, To-morrow the couriers [will set <lb/>
            out,] and this letter I wrote there during supper." 59. Of a <lb/>
            similar character, in my opinion, are passages in which a word <lb/>
            or words are properly suppressed from regard to decency : <lb/>
            Novinus et qui te, transversa tuentibus, hircis, <lb/>
            Et quo, sed faciles Nymphæ riscre, sacello*</p>
          <p>60. Some regard this as an aposiopesis, but erroneously; for <lb/>
            what the aposiopesis suppresses, is uncertain, or requires to <lb/>
            be told by some addition to that which has been expressed; <lb/>
            but here only one word, which is well known, is wanting ; and <lb/>
            if this is aposiopesis, every omission of any word or phrase <lb/>
            whatever may be called by that name. 61. For my part, I do <lb/>
            not constantly call that an aposiopesis, in which anything what­ <lb/>
            ever is left to be understood ; as in the following words, which <lb/>
            Cicero has, in one of his letters, Data Lupercalibus, quo die <lb/>
            Antonius Cæsari, for he used no real suppression, nor intended <lb/>
            any jest, since nothing else could be understood but diadema <lb/>
            imposuit. “ Given on the Lupercalia, on the day on which <lb/>
            Antony put the diadem on Cæsar."</p>
          <p>62. A second† figure produced by omission, is that of whit h <lb/>
            I have already spoken,‡ and which consists in the elimination <lb/>
            of conjunctions.</p>
          <p>A third, which is called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνεζευγένον</foreign>, is that <lb/>
            by which several phrases or thoughts are referred in combina­ <lb/>
            tion to the same word, each of which, if set alone, would re­ <lb/>
            quire that nord for itself. This may be done, either by putting <lb/>
            the verb first, so that other portions of the sentence may look <lb/>
            back to it; as, Ficit pudorem libido, timorem audacia, rationem <lb/>
            amentia,§ “ Licentiousness overcame modesty, audacity fear, <lb/>
            madness reason;" or by putting it last, so that several par­ <lb/>
            ticulars may be brought as it were to a conclusion in it; Neque <lb/>
            enim is es, Catilina, ut te aut pudor unquam a turpitudine, aut <lb/>
            metus à periculo, aut ratio a furore revocaverit ;ll “ For neither <lb/>
            are you of such a character, Catiline, that either shame can <lb/>
            restrain you from dishonour, or fear from danger, or reason <note type="footnote"> * Virgo Eel. iii. 8. </note><note type="footnote">t See sect. 58. </note><note type="footnote">†‡ Sect. 50. </note><note type="footnote"> § Cicero pro Cluent. a. 6. </note><note type="footnote">|| Cicero in Catil. i. 9. </note> <pb n="201"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III]"/><lb/>
            from rage." 63 The verb may also be placed last, so that it <lb/>
            may suffice both for what precedes and what follows. The same <lb/>
            figure joins different sexes, too, as when we call a male and <lb/>
            female child, filii, and puts the singular for the plural, and the <lb/>
            plural for the singular. 64. But expressions of this kind are <lb/>
            so common, that they can hardly claim for themselves the <lb/>
            merit of figures. A figure is certainly used, however, when two <lb/>
            different forms of phrase are united; as <lb/>
            Sociis tunc arma capessant, <lb/>
            Edico, et dird bellum cum gente gerendum ;* <lb/>
            I order that my comrades seize their arms, <lb/>
            And war be waged with that dire progeny; <lb/>
            for though the part of the sentence that follows hellum ends with <lb/>
            a participle, the verb edico has an equal effect on both parts. <lb/>
            This sort of conjunction, which is not made for the purpose of <lb/>
            suppressing any word, but which unites two different things, the <lb/>
            Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">συοι</foreign>x<foreign xml:lang="grc">είωσις</foreign>. Another example of it is, <lb/>
            Tam deest avaro quod habit, quàm quod non habet,† <lb/>
            as To the miser is wanting as well what he has, as what he <lb/>
            has not." 65. To this figure they oppose distinction which <lb/>
            they call <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱαδιατολή</foreign>, and by which things that have some <lb/>
            similitude are distinguished; as, When you call yourself wise <lb/>
            instead of cunning, brave instead of presumptuous, frugal in­ <lb/>
            stead of miserly. Such designations, however, depend wholly <lb/>
            on definition, and I, therefore, doubt whether a sentence of <lb/>
            that kind can properly be called figurative. Of an opposite <lb/>
            sort is the figure which makes a short transition from one <lb/>
            thing to another of a different nature, as though they were <lb/>
            similar : ‡<lb/>
            Brevis esse laboro, <lb/>
            Obscurus fio.§ <lb/>
            I labour to be brief, I grow obscure.</p>
          <p>66. There remains to be noticed a third kind of figures. <note type="footnote"> * An. iii. 234. </note><note type="footnote">† See viii. 5, 6. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Quœ ex viciniâ transit ad diversa ut similia.] Quasi ista diversa essent <lb/>
            similia. Thus in the following example obscurity is considered as some­ <lb/>
            thing of a similar nature with brevity. But I have some doubt whether <lb/>
            the words ex viciniâ should not be expunged, as they occur again in <lb/>
            sect. 66, and may have been transferred by a transcriber from one <lb/>
            place to the other. They are certainly more necessary in sect. 66 than <lb/>
            here. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote">I Hor. Epiat. ad Pis. v. 26. </note> <pb n="202"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            which. by some resemblance, equality, or opposition of words, <lb/>
            attracts anâ excites the attention of the hearer. Of these is <lb/>
            the which is called by the Latins annominatio. <lb/>
            It is produced in more ways than one, but always depends on <lb/>
            some resemblance in a word that follows to a word that has <lb/>
            gone before. These words may be in different cases, as in <lb/>
            what Domitius Afer* says in his speech for Cloantilla: <lb/>
            Mulier omnium rerum imperita, in omnibus rebus infelix; "A <lb/>
            woman unskilled in everything, unhappy in everything." 67. <lb/>
            Or the same word may be rendered more significant by being <lb/>
            joined to another. Quando homo, hostis homo.† These ex­ <lb/>
            amples I have used for another purpose.‡ Such reduplication <lb/>
            of a word, however, is easy.§ But to this species of parono­ <lb/>
            masia is opposed that by which a word is proved to be false, <lb/>
            as it were, by a repetition of the same word ; as, Qua lex pri­ <lb/>
            vatis hominibus esse lex non videbatur, “ Which law did not <lb/>
            seem to be a law to private persons." 68. Similar to this is <lb/>
            the antanaclasis, the use of the same word in a contrary sense. <lb/>
            When Proculeius complained of his son that he was waiting <lb/>
            for his death, and the son said that he was not waiting for it; <lb/>
            Nay, rejoined Proculeius, I desire that you may wait for it. <lb/>
            Sometimes resemblance is sought, not in different senses of the <lb/>
            same word, but in two different words; as when we say that a <lb/>
            person whom we deem dignus supplicatione, " worthy of sup­ <lb/>
            plication on his behalf," should be treated as dignus supplicio, <lb/>
            “ worthy of punishment." 69. Sometimes, again, the same word <lb/>
            is used in a different signification, or varied only by the length­ <lb/>
            ening or shortening of a syllable; a practice which is con­ <lb/>
            temptible, however, even in jests, and I am surprised that it <lb/>
            should be noticed among rules. 70. The following examples of <note type="footnote"> * See c. 2. sect. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> + The commentators are all in doubt as to the meaning of these <lb/>
            words. They may be taken in the sense, " Since he is a man, he is an <lb/>
            enemy," and may then be supposed to have been uttered by Timon; <lb/>
            or they may be read interrogatively, as Tumebus suggests, and con­ <lb/>
            sidered to signify, " Since be is a man, can he be an enemy ?” </note><note type="footnote"> ‡Quibus exemplis sum in aliud usus.] "Perhaps," says Turnebus. <lb/>
            " Quintilian may have used these examples in another work." Spalding <lb/>
            thinks the passage mutilated. </note><note type="footnote"> § Sed in uno facilis est geminatio.] A friend of Gesner supposed <lb/>
            Quintilian to mean that a repetition of the same word in exactly the <lb/>
            same sense is easy to be understood, but that, if the sense is at aU <lb/>
            altered, the reader may be perplexed. </note> <pb n="203"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III]"/><lb/>
            it I give rather that they may be avoided than that they may <lb/>
            be imitated: Amari jucundum est, si curetur ne quid insit <lb/>
            amari: “ It is pleasant to be loved, if we take care that there <lb/>
            be no bitter in the love." Avium dulcedo ad avium ducit: <lb/>
            “ The sweet song of birds attracts to sequestered spots:" and <lb/>
            we find in Ovid, in a humorous passage, <lb/>
            Our ego non dicam, Furia, te furiam ?* <lb/>
            Why should not I thee, Furia, fury call !</p>
          <p>71. Cornificius calls this traduction, that is, the transition <lb/>
            from one signification to another: but it has most elegance <lb/>
            when it is employed in making exact distinctions; as, This <lb/>
            pest of the commonwealth might be repressed for a time, but not <lb/>
            suppressedfor ever; † and in the use of verbs, which are altered <lb/>
            in sense by a change in the prepositions with which they arc <lb/>
            compounded; as non emissus ex urbe, sed immissus in urbem <lb/>
            esse videatur:‡ "He may seem, not to have been sent out of <lb/>
            the city, but to have been sent into the city ?” The effect is <lb/>
            better and more spirited, when what is said is both figurative <lb/>
            in expression, and strong in sense, as, emit morte immortali­ <lb/>
            tatem, " He purchased immortality by death." 72. Such as the <lb/>
            following are frivolous: Non Pisonum, sed pistorum, “ Not of <lb/>
            the Pisos, but of the bakers;" Ex orators arator,§ “ From an <lb/>
            orator become a ploughman." But the most contemptible <lb/>
            plays on words are such as these: Ne patres conscripti vide­ <lb/>
            antur circumscripti ;ll Rar<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> evenit, sed vehementer venit. It - <lb/>
            is possible, however, that a bold and spirited thought may <lb/>
            receive some not unsuitable grace from the contrast of two <lb/>
            words not quite the same. 73. Why should modesty prevent <lb/>
            me from using an example from my own family ? My father, <lb/>
            in reply to a man that had said se immoriturum legationi, that <lb/>
            he would die on an embassy, on which he was going, rather <lb/>
            than not effect the object of it, and then returned, after the <lb/>
            lapse of a few days, without having succeeded, said, non exigo ut <note type="footnote"> * The commentators suspect that this line in from the epigrams of <lb/>

            immoriaris legationi, immorare, “ I do not ask that you should <lb/>
            die on an embassy, but at least dwell on it;" for the sense is <lb/>
            good, and the sounds of the two words, so different in mean­ <lb/>
            ing, have a pleasing correspondence, especially as they were <lb/>
            not sought, but, as it were, presented themselves, the speaker <lb/>
            using but one of his own, and receiving the other from the <lb/>
            person whom he addressed. 74. To add grace to style by <lb/>
            balanced antitheses, was a great object with the ancients; <lb/>
            Gorgias studied it immoderately, and Isocrates was extremely <lb/>
            devoted to it, at least in the early part of his life. Cicero had <lb/>
            great delight in the practice, but he set bounds to his indul­ <lb/>
            gence in it, (though it is not indeed unpleasing unless it <lb/>
            offend by excess,) and gave weight to what would otherwise <lb/>
            have been trifling by the importance of his matter. Indeed <lb/>
            affectation, which would in itself be dry and empty, seems, <lb/>
            when it is united with vigorous thoughts, to be not forced, but <lb/>
            natural.</p>
          <p>75. Of producing correspondences in words there are about <lb/>
            four modes. The first is, when a word is chosen by the <lb/>
            speaker that is similar in sound, or not very dissimilar, to <lb/>
            another word; as, <lb/>
            Puppesque tuæ, puberque tuorum ;* <lb/>
            and, Sic in hac calamitosâ famâ, quasi in aliquâ perniciossis­ <lb/>
            simâ flammâ;† and, non enim tarn spes laudanda, quàm res <lb/>
            est. Or they have at least a resemblance in termination; as, <lb/>
            non verbis, led armis. 76. This artifice also, whenever it is <lb/>
            combined with vigorous thought, is pleasing: as, Quantum <lb/>
            possis, in eo semper exrperire, ut prom. This is what is called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάϱισον</foreign>, as most authors have it; but Cleosteleus ‡thinks that <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάϱισον</foreign> consists in similarity in the members of sentences. <lb/>
            77. The second is, when two or more clauses terminate alike, the <lb/>
            same syllables § corresponding at the end of each, constituting <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">όμοιοτέλευτον</foreign>, the similar ending of two or more phrases; <lb/>
            as, Non modo ad salutem ejus extinguendam, sed etiam gloriam <lb/>
            per tales viros infringendam.|| Of this kind are what they <note type="footnote"> * An. i. 399. </note><note type="footnote">t Cicero pro Cluent. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote">‡Who is meant, has not yet been discovered. There is need of a <lb/>

            call <foreign xml:lang="grc">τζίϰωλα</foreign>, though these do not always exactly correspond <lb/>
            in termination: as, Vicit pudorem libido, timorem audacia, <lb/>
            rationem amentia* But such resemblance may be extended <lb/>
            to four members or even more. Each member may also con­ <lb/>
            sist of a single word ; as, <lb/>
            Hecuba, hoc dolet, pudd, pigel ; †<lb/>
            and Abiit, excessit, erupit, evasit.‡ 78. The third is that <lb/>
            which consists in a repetition of the same case, and is called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίμοιόπτωτον</foreign> : but it has not that name because it presents <lb/>
            similar endings, for that which lies in similar endings is <lb/>
            termed <foreign xml:lang="grc">όμοιοτέλευτον</foreign> : and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">όμοιόπτωτον</foreign> is only a resem­ <lb/>
            blance in cases, while the declensions of the words may be <lb/>
            different; and it is not seen only at the ends of phrases, <lb/>
            but may exhibit a correspondence either in beginnings <lb/>
            with beginnings, middles with middles, or terminations <lb/>
            with terminations: or there may even be an inter- <lb/>
            change, so that the middle of one phrase may answer to the <lb/>
            beginning of another, or the conclusion of one to the middle <lb/>
            of another; and indeed the resemblance may be maintained <lb/>
            in any way whatever. 79. Nor do the correspondent phrases <lb/>
            always consist of an equal number of syllables. Thus we see <lb/>
            in Domitius Afer, Amisso nuper infelicis aulæ si non præsidio <lb/>
            inter pericula, tamen solatio inter adversa. The best species <lb/>
            of this figure appears to be that in which the beginnings and <lb/>
            ends of the phrases correspond; as here, præsidio, solatio ;§ <lb/>
            and in which there is a similitude in the words, so that they <lb/>
            afford like cadences, and like terminations. 80. The fourth <lb/>
            kind is that in which there is a perfect equality in the clauses, <lb/>
            which is called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ον</foreign> ;as,|| Si, quantum, in <lb/>
            agro locisque desertis audacia potest, tantum in foro atque <lb/>
            judiciis impudentia valeret. " If impudence had as much power <lb/>
            in the forum and in courts of justice as boldness has in wilds <lb/>
            and desert places ;" (where there is both the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσόϰιωλον</foreign> and the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">όμοιόπτωτον</foreign> ; non minus nunc in causa cederet Aulus Cæcina <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            audaciæ " Aulus Cæcina, in the present cause, would give <lb/>
            way to the impudence of Sextus Æbutius not less than he <lb/>
            then yielded to his audacity in the commission of violence," <lb/>
            where there is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσόϰωλον, ὁμοιόπτωτον</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">όμοιοτέλευτον</foreign>. To this <lb/>
            figure is attached, also, that beauty which arises from the <lb/>
            figure in which I said* that words are repeated with a change <lb/>
            of case or tense ; as, Non minus cederet, quam cessit, "He <lb/>
            would yield no less than he has yielded." The <foreign xml:lang="grc">όμοιοτέλευτον</foreign> <lb/>
            and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταϱονομαϬία</foreign> may also be united, as Neminem alteri <lb/>
            posse dare in matrimonium, nisi penes quam sit patrimonium, <lb/>
            "No one could give to another in matrimony, except him in <lb/>
            whose hands is the patrimony"</p>
          <p>81. Contraposition, or, as some call it, contention, (it is <lb/>
            termed by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">άντίθετον</foreign>,) is effected in several ways; <lb/>
            for it occurs when single words are opposed one to another, as <lb/>
            in the example which I used a little above,! Vicit pudorem <lb/>
            libido, timorem audacia; or when two are opposed to two; as, <lb/>
            Non nostri ingenii, vestri auxilii est,‡" It depends not on our <lb/>
            ability, but your aid;" or when sentences are opposed to sen. <lb/>
            tences: as, Dominetur in concionibus, jaceat in judiciis.§ <lb/>
            82. With this species of antithesis is very properly joined <lb/>
            that which we have termed distinction: Odit Populus Roma. <lb/>
            nus privatam luxuriant, publicam magnijicentiam diligit,|| " The <lb/>
            Roman people detest private luxury, but love public magnifi­ <lb/>
            cence ;" and that in which words of similar termination, but <lb/>
            of dissimilar meaning, are placed at the end of different <lb/>
            clauses; as, Quod in tempore mali fuit, nihil obsit, quin, quod <lb/>
            in causd boni fuit, prosit, ¶ " So that what was unfortunate <lb/>
            in the time may not prevent what was good in the cause <lb/>
            from being of advantage." 83. Nor is the second term <lb/>
            always immediately subjoined to that to which it corresponds; <lb/>
            as in this passage, Est igitur, judices, non scripta, sed nata <lb/>
            lex** " It is a law, therefore, judges, not written for us, but <lb/>
            inherent in us by nature;" but, as Cicero says, ✝✝ there may <lb/>
            be a correspondence between several preceding and subsequent <lb/>
            particulars, as in the sequel of the passage to which I have <lb/>
            just referred, Quam non didicimus, accepimus, legimus, verùm <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 36, 66. </note><note type="footnote">t Sect. 62, 77. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Cic. pro Cluent. c1. </note><note type="footnote"> § Ibid. c. 2. </note><note type="footnote">II Cic. pro Muræn. c. 32. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ Cic. pro eluent. c. 29. </note><note type="footnote">** Cic. pro Milone, c. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> †† See c. 1, sect. 34. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            ex natureS ipsd accepimus, hausimus, expressimus, " A law <lb/>
            which we have not learned, or acquired, or read, but which <lb/>
            we have imbibed, and derived, and received from nature her­ <lb/>
            self." 84. Nor is that which is opposed to what precedes always <lb/>
            presented in the antithetic form ; as in these words, cited by <lb/>
            Rutilius Lupus,. Nobis primùm dii immortales fruges dede­ <lb/>
            runt; nos, quod soli accepimus, in omnes terras distribuimus: <lb/>
            " To us the immortal gods first gave corn ; that which we <lb/>
            alone received, we have distributed through every region of <lb/>
            the earth." 85. An antithesis is also produced with the aid <lb/>
            of that figure in which words are repeated with variations in <lb/>
            case or tense, and which is called by the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντιμεταολή</foreign> : <lb/>
            as, Non, ut edam, vivo; sed, ut vivam, edo; " I do not live that <lb/>
            I may eat, but eat that I may live." There is an example of <lb/>
            this in Cicero, which is so managed, that, though it exhibits a <lb/>
            change in cases, the two members have a similar ending: <lb/>
            Ut et sine invidid culpa plectatur, et sine culpâ invidia <lb/>
            ponatur,† " That both guilt may be punished without odium, <lb/>
            and odium may be laid aside without guilt." 86. The members <lb/>
            may also terminate with the very same word; as in what <lb/>
            Cicero says of Roscius,‡ Etenim, quum artifex ejusmodi sit, ut <lb/>
            solus dignus videatur esse qui scenam introeat, tum vir ejusmodi <lb/>
            sit, ut solus videatur dignus qui e<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> non accedat, " For, while <lb/>
            he is an actor of such powers that he alone seems worthy to <lb/>
            enter on the stage, he is a man of such a character that he <lb/>
            alone seems worthy to be exempted from entering on it." <lb/>
            There is also a peculiar grace in the antithetic opposition of <lb/>
            names ; as, Si consul Antonius, Brutus hostis; si conservator <lb/>
            reipublicæ Brutus, hostis Antonius;§ " If Antony is a consul. <lb/>
            Brutus is an enemy; if Brutus is a preserver of his ountry, <lb/>
            Antony is an enemy."</p>
          <p>87. I have now said more concerning figures than was per­ <lb/>
            haps necessary; yet there are some who will maintain that <lb/>
            such a phrase as, What I say is incredible, but true, is a figure, <lb/>
            and call it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθυποϕοϱά</foreign> :|| that, Somebody has borne this once, I <lb/>
            have borne it twice, I have borne it three times,** is also a <note type="footnote"> * B. ii. c. 16.

            too far, and return to my subject, is another, to be called <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̋ϕοδος</foreign>. *</p>
          <p>88. Some figures of words differ but very little from figures <lb/>
            of thought, as dubitatio, †" doubt;" for when it regards the <lb/>
            matter, it is to be numbered among figures of thought, and when <lb/>
            it concerns only words, among the other sort of figures; as <lb/>
            Sive me malitiam, sive stultitiam dicere oportet, " Whether I <lb/>
            ought to call this wickedness or folly." The same is the case <lb/>
            with respect to correction, for as doubt may refer to either <lb/>
            language or thought, so likewise may emendation. So. Some <lb/>
            think that this twofold nature of figures has place also in <lb/>
            personification, and that the figure in the following words is <lb/>
            verbal, Avarice is the mother of cruelty,‡ as well as in the <lb/>
            exclamation of Sallust against Cicero, O Romulus of Arpinum, § <lb/>
            and in the expression in Menander, Thriasian (Edipus.|| All <lb/>
            these points those writers have treated with great fulness, <lb/>
            who have not merely touched on them as portions of treatises, <lb/>
            but have dedicated whole books to this particular subject, as <lb/>
            Cæcilius, Dionysius, Rutilius, Cornificius, Visellius, and many <lb/>
            others ; but the glory of some living writers will not be inferior <lb/>
            to theirs. 90. Though I admit, however, that more figures of <lb/>
            speech may have been invented by certain of our rhetoricians, <lb/>
            yet I do not allow that they are better than those which have been <lb/>
            specified by eminent writers on the subject. Cicero, especially, <lb/>
            has mentioned many figures in his third book De Oratore, <lb/>
            which, by omitting them in his Orator, a work written subse­ <lb/>
            quently, he appears himself to have condemned. Some of <lb/>
            them, indeed, are figures of thought rather than of words, as <lb/>
            diminution, the introduction of something unexpected, imaged, ¶ <lb/>
            answering our own questions, digression, permission** antithesis, <note type="footnote">nobody thrice where the specification of the three persons, aliquis, <lb/>

            (for I suppose this to be the same as what is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">έναντιότης</foreign>,) <lb/>
            proof derived from the statements of the opposite party* 91. <lb/>
            Some, again, are not figures at all, as order, enumeration, and <lb/>
            circumscription, whether he understands, by the last word, a <lb/>
            thought concisely expressed, or definition, which, however, <lb/>
            Cornificius and Rutilius consider as a figure of speech. As to <lb/>
            elegant transposition of words, that is, hyperbaton, † which <lb/>
            Cæcilius also thinks a figure, it has been placed by me among <lb/>
            tropes. 92. Of immutation, though it is what Rutilius ‡ calls <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐλλοίωϬις</foreign>, the object is to show the difference between men. <lb/>
            things, and actions; and, if it be taken in an extended sense, <lb/>
            it is certainly not a figure ; if in a confined sense, it will he <lb/>
            mere antithesis; but if the term be intended to signify hypal­ <lb/>
            lage, enough has already been said of it.§ 93. What sort of a <lb/>
            figure, again, is reasoning subservient to your proposition? Is it <lb/>
            what Rutiliusll calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτιολογία</foreign> ? It may also be doubted whether <lb/>
            reasoning suited to the order of distribution, which is put by <lb/>
            Rutilius in the first place, ¶ is a figure. 94. Rutilius calls it <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προϬαπόδοις</foreign>, which, even if the propriety of the term be fully <lb/>
            admitted, must certainly relate to several propositions, because <lb/>
            reasoning is either immediately subjoined to each, as in Cains <lb/>
            Antonius: But neither do I dread him as an accuser, inasmuch <lb/>
            as I am innocent; nor do I fear him as a competitor, since I <lb/>
            anI, Antonius ; nor do I expect anything from him as consul, <lb/>
            since he is Cicero ; ** 95. or, after two or three points are laid <lb/>
            down, the reasoning applicable to each is given in the same <lb/>
            order; as in these words of Brutus respecting the dictatorship <lb/>
            of Pompey :tt For it is better to command no one than to be a <note type="footnote"> * See c. 1, sect. 35, seq. </note><note type="footnote"> t VIII. 6, 62, 65.

            slave to any one; for we may live honourably without command, <lb/>
            but in slavery there is no endurance of life. 96. But many <lb/>
            reasons are often subjoined to one observation; as in this <lb/>
            passage of Virgil, <lb/>
            Sire inde occultas vires, et pabula terræ <lb/>
            Pinguia concipiunt, sive illis omne per ignem <lb/>
            Excoquitur vitium, atque exudat inutilis humor; <lb/>
            Seu plures calor ille vias, et cœca relaxat <lb/>
            Spiramenta, novas veniat quà succus in herbas ; <lb/>
            Seu durat magis, et venas astringit hiantes.* <lb/>
            Whether from thence the lands a secret power <lb/>
            And fattening nurture gain ; or from their soil <lb/>
            Its whole corruption is by fire expelld, <lb/>
            And useless damp exudes; or whether pores <lb/>
            More numerous, and more passages unseen <lb/>
            The heat expands, by which the sap may pass <lb/>
            Up to the tender herb; or whether more <lb/>

            that which belongs to arguments, I shall pay them no <lb/>
            attention.</p>
          <p>100. Concerning what are really figures, too, I would <lb/>
            briefly remark, in addition, that though they are ornaments <lb/>
            to language when they are judiciously employed, they are <lb/>
            extremely ridiculous when introduced in immoderate pro­ <lb/>
            fusion. Some speakers, regardless of weight of matter or <lb/>
            force of thought, think that, if they can but distort empty <lb/>
            words into the guise of figures, they have attained the per­ <lb/>
            fection of art, and therefore never cease to string them <lb/>
            together, though it is as ridiculous to aim at the form of <lb/>
            eloquence without the substance, as it would be to study dress <lb/>
            and gesture for what is not a living body. 101. Even such <lb/>
            figures as are happily applied ought not to be too much <lb/>
            crowded. Changes of countenance, and expressive glances <lb/>
            of the eye, add great effect to pleading, but if a speaker should <lb/>
            be perpetually moulding his features into studied configura­ <lb/>
            tions, or should keep up a perpetual agitation in his forehead <lb/>
            and his eyes, he would only make himself a laughing-stock; <lb/>
            and language has, as it were, a certain natural appearance, and <lb/>
            though it ought not to appear torpid in immoveable rigidity, <lb/>
            it should yet generally be kept in that form which nature has <lb/>
            assigned it. 102. But what we ought chiefly to understand <lb/>
            in regard to pleading is, what places, persons, and occasions, <lb/>
            require ; for the greater part of figures are intended to please; <lb/>
            but when a speaker has to labour to excite emotions of indig­ <lb/>
            nation, hatred, or compassion, who would endure to hear him <lb/>
            raging, lamenting, or supplicating, in studied antitheses, <lb/>
            balanced clauses, and similar cadences ? Affected attention <note type="footnote"> * When we state the equity of our cause in as brief a form of <lb/>

          <p>Of composition, or cultivation of style; authority of Cicero acknow. <lb/>
            lodged, § 1, 2. Attention to composition too much discouraged <lb/>
            by some authors, 3, 4. In everything the powers of nature should <lb/>
            be cultivated to the utmost, 5—7. Union of power with grace, <lb/>
            8, 9. Excellence of style serves not only to please but to con­ <lb/>
            vince the hearer, 10—13. This may be proved by altering the <lb/>
            arrangement of words and phrases in elegant composition, 14, 15. <lb/>
            Style not neglected by the ancients, 16—18. Prose may be more <lb/>
            or less compact and studied, 19—21. Particulars that require <lb/>
            attention in it, 22. Of order, 23—31. Of junctions of words, <lb/>
            and of hiatus, 32—36. Of junctions of consonants and vowels, <lb/>
            and the repetition of syllables, 37—43. Of members and commas, <lb/>
            44. Of numbers or rhythm, 45. Difference between rhythm and <lb/>
            metre, 46—51. Of feet in prose; a remark of Cicero, 52—55. <lb/>
            How far number or rhythm should be studied in prose, 56. <lb/>
            Oratorical numbers or rhythm, 57—60. Attention to numbers <lb/>
            most requisite at the beginnings and ends of periods, 61—65. <lb/>
            What regard to be paid to the middle parts, 66—71. Of the <lb/>
            occurrence of verses, or parts of verses, in prose, 72—76. Every­ <lb/>
            thing that sounds like metre should be avoided, 77, 78. Of feet, 79 <lb/>
            —86. All kinds of feet must enter into prose composition, 87—89. <lb/>
            Are varied by union and division, 90, 91. The force and influence <lb/>
            of particular feet, 92 —94. Of the closing feet of periods, 95—109. <lb/>
            Of the fourth paeon, 110, 111. A speaker must not be too solicitous <lb/>
            about his measures, 112—115. The ear must judge; many things <lb/>
            cannot be taught by rule, 116—121. Of commata, 122, 123. Of <lb/>
            a period, and its members, 124—127. What kinds of sentences <lb/>
            are eligible for particular parts of speeches, and for particular <lb/>
            subjects, 128—130. What feet should prevail in certain sorts of <lb/>
            composition, 131—137. Composition and delivery must be alike <lb/>
            varied to suit different subjects, 138—141. A rough and forcible <lb/>
            style preferable to the smooth and nerveless, 142—145. Con. <lb/>
            eluding remarks, 146, 147.</p>
          <p>1. On composition I should not presume to write after <lb/>
            Cicero, (by whom I know not whether any part of oratory has <lb/>
            been more carefully treated,) had not men of his own age,* in <note type="footnote"> * One of those meant is Brutus; see ad Att. xiv. 20, xv. 1. Gesner. <lb/>
            See xii. 1, 22; 10, 12 ; also Dial de Orate c. 18. Spalding. </note> <pb n="213"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH IV]"/><lb/>
            letters which they addressed to himself, ventured to criticise <lb/>
            his style, and had not many writers, since his day, commu­ <lb/>
            nicated to the world many observations on the same subject <lb/>
            2. I shall however adhere to Cicero in general, and shall touch <lb/>
            but briefly on such points as are undisputed ; in some things I <lb/>
            shall perhaps dissent from him. But even when I offer my <lb/>
            own opinion, I shall leave my readers to form their own.</p>
          <p>3. I know that there are some who would repudiate all at­ <lb/>
            tention to composition, and who contend that unpolished lan­ <lb/>
            guage, such as it happens to present itself, is both more natural <lb/>
            and more manly. But if such persons say that that only is <lb/>
            natural which originally sprung from nature, and which pre­ <lb/>
            ceded culture, the whole art of oratory is at an end. 4. For <lb/>
            men of the earliest ages did not speak with our exactness and <lb/>
            care, nor had any knowledge of preparing an audience with an <lb/>
            exordium, enlightening them with statements of facts, convincing <lb/>
            them with arguments, and exciting them with appeals to their <lb/>
            feelings. They were ignorant of all these arts, and not of <lb/>
            composition merely; and if we ought to speak in no respect <lb/>
            better than they, huts should never have been relinquished for <lb/>
            houses, dresses of skins for decent apparel, or mountains and <lb/>
            forests for cities. 5. What art too, we may ask, came to per­ <lb/>
            fection at once ? What is not improved by culture ? Why <lb/>
            do we prune our vines ? Why do we dig about them ? Why <lb/>
            do we root out brambles from our fields, when the ground natu­ <lb/>
            rally produces them ? Why do we tame animals when they are <lb/>
            born untamed ? But, in truth, a thing is most natural, when <lb/>
            nature has allowed it to be brought into the best condition. <lb/>
            6. Should we say that what is unconnected is stronger than <lb/>
            what is compact and well-arranged ? If short feet, such as those <lb/>
            of Sotadic and Galliambic metre, and others that wanton with <lb/>
            almost equal licence in prose, diminish the force of our matter, <lb/>
            this is not to be imputed to too much care in composition. 7. As <lb/>
            the current of rivers is more forcible in a descending channel, <lb/>
            which offers no obstruction to their course, than amidst rocks that <lb/>
            oppose their broken and struggling waters, so language that is <lb/>
            properly connected, and flows on with a full <unclear>fidod</unclear>, is preferable <lb/>
            to that which is rugged and fragmentary. Why, then, should <lb/>
            they think that strength is relaxed by attention to beauty, <lb/>
            when nothing attains its full strength without art, and beauty <lb/>
            always accompanies art? 8. Do we not see that the spear, <pb n="214"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            which is hurled with tne greatest effect, is also hurled with <lb/>
            the most grace? The surer is the aim of those who direct <lb/>
            arrows from the bow, the finer are their attitudes. In passages <lb/>
            of arms, and in all the exercises of the palæstra, what blow is <lb/>
            successfully avoided or aimed by him whose movements have <lb/>
            not something artificial, and whose step is not assured by skill ? <lb/>
            9. Thoughts, in like manner, appear to me to be aimed and <lb/>
            impelled by studied composition, as javelins and arrows are <lb/>
            by the thong * or the bowstring. The most learned, indeed, <lb/>
            are of opinion that it is of the highest efficacy not only for <lb/>
            giving pleasure, but for producing conviction ; 10. because, in <lb/>
            the first place, nothing can fairly pass into the mind which <lb/>
            gives offence as it enters the ear, which is, as it were, the <lb/>
            vestibule of the mind ; and because, in the second place, we <lb/>
            are adapted by nature to feel pleasure in harmony ; otherwise, <lb/>
            it would be impossible for the notes of musical instruments, <lb/>
            which express nothing but meaningless sounds, to excite various <lb/>
            emotions in the hearer. 11. In the sacred games, the musi­ <lb/>
            cians do not excite and calm the mind with the same strains ; <lb/>
            they do not employ the same tunes when a warlike charge is <lb/>
            to be sounded, and when supplication is to be made on the <lb/>
            bended knee ; nor is there the same concert of signals when <lb/>
            an army is going forth to battle, as when notice is given to <lb/>
            retreat. 12. It was the custom of the disciples of Pythagoras, <lb/>
            when they awoke in the morning, to excite their minds with <lb/>
            the sound of the lyre, that they might be more alert for action; <lb/>
            and to soothe themselves with it before they lay down to sleep, <lb/>
            in order to allay any tumultuous thoughts that might have <lb/>
            disturbed them.</p>
          <p>13. If, then, there is such a secret force in mere melody <lb/>
            and modulation, there must surely be the utmost power in the <lb/>
            music of eloquence. As it makes a difference to a thought in <lb/>
            what words it is expressed, so it makes a difference to words in <lb/>
            what form they are arranged, either in the body of a sentence, <lb/>
            or in the conclusion of it. Some thoughts, indeed, that are <lb/>
            but of slight import, and expressed with but moderate force, <lb/>
            beauty in the language conveying them sets off and recom­ <lb/>
            mends. 14. In short, let the reader take to pieces any sentence <lb/>
            that he has thought forcibly, agreeably, or gracefully expressed, <note type="footnote"> * Amentis.] The Amentum was a thong attached to a javelin, that it <lb/>
            might be hurled with greater force. </note> <pb n="215"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH IV]"/><lb/>
            and alter the arrangement of the words, and all the force, <lb/>
            agreeableness, and grace, will at once disappear. Cicero * has <lb/>
            thus taken to pieces some of his own sentences in his Orator; <lb/>
            as, neque me divitiæ movent, quibus omnes Africanos et Lælios <lb/>
            multi venalitii mercatoresque superdrunt; and some of the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing periods; in which when you effect such disarrange­ <lb/>
            ment, you seem to throw, as it were, broken or ill-directed <lb/>
            weapons. 15. Cicero t also corrects a sentence which he <lb/>
            regards as having been composed inelegantly by Gracchus. <lb/>
            This was very becoming in him ; but for ourselves, we may <lb/>
            be content with the task of rendering compact what has pre­ <lb/>
            sented itself to us loosely while writing it. For as to seeking <lb/>
            examples of incorrectness, which every one may find in his <lb/>
            own compositions, to what profit would it be ? I consider it <lb/>
            quite enough to remark, that the more beautiful, in thought <lb/>
            and expression, are the sentences that we take to pieces, the <lb/>
            more their language appears disfigured ; for the faultiness in <lb/>
            arrangement is seen more clearly by the light of their brilliant <lb/>
            phraseology.</p>
          <p>16. At the same time that I admit, however, that the art <lb/>
            of composition, I mean the perfection of the art, was the last <lb/>
            that was attained by orators, I consider that it was counted - <lb/>
            among objects of study by the ancients as far as their skill had <lb/>
            then reached ; for not even Cicero himself, great as his autho­ <lb/>
            rity is, shall persuade me that Lysias, Herodotus, and Thucy <lb/>
            dides felt but little solicitude about it. 17. They perhaps <lb/>
            did not aim at the same sort of style as Demosthenes and <lb/>
            Plato, (who however were quite unlike each other,) for the <lb/>
            simple and delicate diction of Lysias was not to be vitiated by <lb/>
            the introduction of fuller periods, as it would have lost the <lb/>
            grace of its simple and unaffected colouring, which is seen in <lb/>
            him in its highest excellence; and it would have lost also the <lb/>
            credit which it commanded, as he wrote for others, and did <lb/>
            not speak himself, so that his orations were necessarily made <lb/>
            to appear plain and artless, a quality which is itself the effect <lb/>
            of art. 18. As to history, which ought to flow on in a continuous <lb/>
            stream, those clauses that break the course of oratory, those <lb/>
            breathing-places so necessary in spoken pleadings, and those <lb/>
            artificial modes of concluding and commencing sentences, <note type="footnote"> * Orat. o 70. The words are from his Oratio Corneliana. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ibid. </note> <pb n="216"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            would have been but ill-suited to it. In the speeches of the <lb/>
            historians, indeed, we may see something of similarity of ca­ <lb/>
            dence and antithetic arrangement. In Herodotus, assuredly, <lb/>
            his whole style, as I at least think, has a smooth flow, and <lb/>
            the very dialect which he uses has such a sweetness that it <lb/>
            appears to contain within it some latent rhythmical power. <lb/>
            19. But of the diversity in styles I shall speak hereafter. <lb/>
            At present, I shall notice some particulars that must first be <lb/>
            learned by those who would compose with success.</p>
          <p>There are, then, in the first place, two kinds of style; one <lb/>
            compact, and of a firm texture ; the other of a looser nature, <lb/>
            such as is used in common conversation and in familiar letters, <lb/>
            except when they treat of something above their ordinary sub­ <lb/>
            jects, as questions of philosophy, politics, and the like. 20. <lb/>
            In saying this, I do not mean to intimate that the looser sort <lb/>
            of style has not a certain measure, which is perhaps even more <lb/>
            difficult to be observed than that of the other kind; (for the <lb/>
            style of conversation and correspondence should not present <lb/>
            perpetual recurrences of hiatus between vowels, or be destitute <lb/>
            of rhythm,) but it does not flow in an unbroken stream, or <lb/>
            maintain an exact coherence, or attach phrase to phrase; so <lb/>
            that it has rather a lax connexion than none at all. 21. Such <lb/>
            simplicity of style is sometimes becoming in pleading causes <lb/>
            of an inferior kind; a simplicity which is not void of nume­ <lb/>
            rousness, but has it of a different sort from that of the higher <lb/>
            oratory, and dissembles it, or rather observes it less osten <lb/>
            tatiously.</p>
          <p>22. The more compact kind of style has three principal parts: <lb/>
            phrases, which are by the Greeks called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰόμματα</foreign> ; members, <lb/>
            or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰω̃λα</foreign>: and periods, for which the Latin term is ambitus, <lb/>
            circumductum, continuation or conclusio. But in all compo­ <lb/>
            sition there are three particulars necessary to be observed, <lb/>
            order, junction, and rhythm.</p>
          <p>23. Let us first, then, speak of order, regard to which is <lb/>
            to be had in the use of words both separate and in conjunction. <lb/>
            Words taken separately we call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσύνδετα</foreign>. In respect to these, <lb/>
            we must be cautious that they do not decrease in force, and <lb/>
            that a weaker be not subjoined to a stronger, as thief to temple­ <lb/>
            spoiler, or insolent fellow to robber ; for the sense ought to <lb/>
            increase and rise, as in the admirable words of Cicero,* You, <note type="footnote"> * Philipp. ii 25. </note> <pb n="217"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH IV]"/><lb/>
            with that throat, those sides, and that strength of your whole <lb/>
            frame suitable for a gladiator, &amp;c. ; since the words are suc­ <lb/>
            cessively of larger meaning; but if he had commenced with <lb/>
            the whole frame, he could not have proceeded with good effect <lb/>
            to the sides and the throat. There is also another sort of <lb/>
            order which we may call natural; thus we should say men and <lb/>
            women, day and night, rising and setting, rather than the reverse <lb/>
            way. 24. Some words, when their position is changed, become <lb/>
            superfluous, as in fratres gemini; for if gemini is put first, it <lb/>
            is not necessary to add fratres. The solicitude of certain <lb/>
            writers, who desired that nouns should be prefixed to verbs, <lb/>
            verbs to adverbs, nouns to adjectives and pronouns, was absurd ; <lb/>
            for the contrary is often done with the happiest effect. 25. It <lb/>
            is a proof of too great scrupulosity, also, to put that always <lb/>
            first which is first in the order of time; not that this order is <lb/>
            not frequently to be preferred, but because that which precedes <lb/>
            is often of the greater importance, and ought consequently to <lb/>
            be put after what is of less. 26. To close the sense with the <lb/>
            verb, is by far the best, if the composition will allow; for the <lb/>
            force of language lies in verbs. But if that order is attended <lb/>
            with harshness of sound, it must yield to a more harmonious <lb/>
            arrangement, as is very often the case among the most eminent <lb/>
            orators both Greek and Latin. Doubtless every verb that is <lb/>
            not at the end, causes a hyperbaton ; but this is admitted among <lb/>
            tropes and figures, which are considered as beauties. 27. Words <lb/>
            indeed are not arranged by feet, and may therefore be trans­ <lb/>
            ferred from one place to another, so as to be joined with those <lb/>
            to which they are most suitable ; as, in piling together unhewn <lb/>
            stones, their very irregularity suggests to what other stones <lb/>
            they may be applied, and where they may rest. The happiest <lb/>
            kind of composition, however, is that in which a judicious <lb/>
            order, proper connexion, and harmony of cadence, are found <lb/>
            combined. 28. But some transpositions are carried to too <lb/>
            great a length, as I have observed in the preceding books,* and <lb/>
            give rise at times to faults in construction, being adopted <lb/>
            merely in sport or wantonness ; as these phrases of Mæcenas, † <note type="footnote"> * See viii. 2, 14. But I wonder that he should have made so inde­ <lb/>

            Ne exequias quidem units inter miserrimos viderem meas. What <lb/>
            is the most objectionable in this passage, is, that the composition <lb/>
            is flighty upon a grave subject.</p>
          <p>29. There is sometimes an extraordinary force in some par <lb/>
            ticular word, which, if it be placed, in no very conspicuous <lb/>
            position, in the middle part of a sentence, is likely to escape <lb/>
            the attention of the hearer, and to be obscured by the words <lb/>
            surrounding it; but, if it be put at the end of the sentence, is <lb/>
            urged upon the hearer's notice, and imprinted on his mind; <lb/>
            as in the passage of Cicero, Ut tibi necesse esset in conspectu <lb/>
            populi Romani vomere postridie; “ That you were forced to <lb/>
            vomit in the sight of the people of Rome the following day.”* <lb/>
            30. Transfer the last word to some other place, and it will <lb/>
            have much less effect; for, standing at the conclusion, it forms <lb/>
            a point, as it were, to the whole sentence; adding, to the <lb/>
            disgraceful necessity of vomiting, (when the audience expected <lb/>
            nothing further,) the shamefulness of being unable to retain <lb/>
            meat on his stomach the following day.† 31. Domitius <lb/>
            Afer, again, used to put particular words at the end of his <lb/>
            sentences, merely for the purpose of giving roughness to his <lb/>
            style, especially in his exordia. Thus, in his speech for Clean <lb/>
            tilla, he says, Gratias agam continuo, “ I will thank you at <lb/>
            once," and in that for Lælia, Eis utrisque apud te judicem peri­ <lb/>
            clitatur Lœlia, “ By both of these Lælia is brought into danger <lb/>
            before you as judge." He was so little disposed to be studious <lb/>
            of the nice and delicate gratifications of melody, that, even <lb/>
            when harmony presented itself, he would put something in its <note type="footnote"> Mæcenas, see Meibom. Mæcen. cap. 23, whose notice, however, these <lb/>
            fragments escaped ; as well as another which is cited from his Sympo­ <lb/>

            corrected by Bentley on Hor. Od. iii. 21. Burmann. As Quintilian is <lb/>
            speaking of transposition, Spalding supposes that plurima, is to be <lb/>
            taken as an ablative case with awrora. For the same reason we may <lb/>
            suppose that fraxinos is to be taken with inter. For movit Spalding <lb/>
            supposes that we should read manet. The sense will then be something <lb/>
            like this: " [They] are red with the rays of the sun, and much light <lb/>
            from the east. The sacred water flows amidst the ash trees. I would <lb/>
            not, alone among the most miserable of men, see my own funeral <lb/>
            rites." The three fragments appear to be unconnected. </note><note type="footnote"> * Philipp. ii. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> t La houte de n'avoir pu digérer en vingt-quatre heures les viandes <lb/>

            way to interrupt it. 32. That ambiguity may be produced by <lb/>
            a faulty collocation of words, I suppose that nobody is ignorant. <lb/>
            These few remarks I thought it necessary to make respecting <lb/>
            order; for, if the order of a speaker's words be ill-judged, his <lb/>
            style, though it be on the whole compact and harmonious, will <lb/>
            nevertheless be justly characterized as deficient in elegance.</p>
          <p>The next particular is connexion, which has reference to <lb/>
            words, phrases, members and whole sentences; for all these have <lb/>
            beauties and faults dependent on combination.</p>
          <p>33. To proceed methodically, there are, in the first place, <lb/>
            some faults so palpable that they incur the reprehension even <lb/>
            of the illiterate; for instance, when two words, coming together, <lb/>
            produce, by the union of the last syllable of the former with <lb/>
            the first syllable of the latter, some offensive expression.* <lb/>
            In the next place there is the clashing of vowels; for, when <lb/>
            this occurs, the phrases gape, open, dispart, and seem to <lb/>
            labour. Long vowels, especially when they are the same, <lb/>
            have the very worst of sound in conjunction; but the hiatus <lb/>
            is most remarkable in such vowels as are pronounced with <lb/>
            a round or wide opening of the mouth.t 34. E has a flatter <lb/>
            and I a closer sound; and consequently any fault in the <lb/>
            management of them is less perceptible. The speaker who <lb/>
            shall put short vowels after long will give less offence, and still <lb/>
            less he who shall put short ones before long; but the least <lb/>
            offence of all is given by the concurrence of two short. In <lb/>
            fact, whenever vowels follow vowels, the collision of them will <lb/>
            be more or less harsh, in proportion as the mode in which they <lb/>
            are pronounced is more or less similar. 35. A hiatus of vowels, <lb/>
            however, is not to be dreaded as any great crime; and indeed <lb/>
            I know not whether too little or too much care in regard to it <lb/>
            be the worse. The fear of it must necessarily be a restraint <lb/>
            on an orators efforts, and divert his attention from points of <lb/>
            more consequence. As it is a mark of carelessness, therefore, <lb/>
            to be constantly running into this fault, so it is a sign of little­ <lb/>
            ness to be perpetually in dread of it; and it is not without <lb/>
            reason, that critics consider all the followers of Isocrates, and <lb/>
            especially Theopompus,‡ to have felt too much solicitude as tr <lb/>
            this particular 36. As for Demosthenes and Cicero, the) <note type="footnote"> * VIII. 3, 25. </note><note type="footnote">t Meaning the two vowels, O and A. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See Demetr. Phal. sect. 68; and Dionys. Hal. Epist. ad Pomp. d <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            paid it but moderate attention. Indeed, the amalgamation of <lb/>
            two vowels, which is called synalæpha, may render a period <lb/>
            smoother than it would be if every word retained its own <lb/>
            vowel at the end. Sometimes, too, a hiatus is becoming, and <lb/>
            throws an air of grandeur over what is said: as, Pulchra ora. <lb/>
            tione acta omnino jactare. Besides, syllables that are long in <lb/>
            themselves, and require a fuller pronunciation, gain something <lb/>
            from the time that intervenes, as if for taking a rest, between <lb/>
            the two vowels. 37. On this point I shall quote, with the <lb/>
            utmost respect, the words of Cicero :* The hiatus and concourse, <lb/>
            he says, of open vowels has something soft in it, indicating a <lb/>
            not unpleasing negligence, as if the speaker were more anxious <lb/>
            about his matter than about his words.</p>
          <p>But consonants also are liable to jar with one another in the <lb/>
            connexion of words, and especially such as are of a harsher <lb/>
            nature ; as S at the end of a word with X at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the following ; and the hissing is still more unpleasant <lb/>
            if two of these consonants clash together, as, Ars studiorum. t <lb/>
            38. This was Servius' reason, as I observed,: for cutting off the <lb/>
            the letter S whenever it terminated a word, and was followed <lb/>
            by another consonant; a practice which Lauranius § blames, <lb/>
            and Messala defends ; for they do not think that Lucilius re­ <lb/>
            tained the final S when he said, Serenus fuit, and Dignus <lb/>
            locoque; and Cicero in his Orator || states that many of the <lb/>
            ancients spoke in the same way. 39. Hence belligerare and <lb/>
            po'meridiem, and the Diee hanc of Cato the Censor, the letter <lb/>
            M being softened into E. Such modes of writing, when found <lb/>
            in old books, persons of little learning are disposed to alter; <lb/>
            and, while they think to censure the ignorance of transcribers, <lb/>
            expose their own. 40. But the same letter M, when it tennis <lb/>
            nates a word, and is in contact with a vowel at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the following word, so that it may coalesce with it, is, <lb/>
            though it is written, hardly expressed; as, Multum ille, Quan­ <note type="footnote"> * Orate c. 23. </note><note type="footnote"> t Pithœus supposes that we should read arx studiorum. </note><note type="footnote"> t No commentator has been able to find any mention of this Servius, <lb/>

            of Messala's contemporaries. </note><note type="footnote">|| C. 48. </note> <pb n="221"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH IV]"/><lb/>
            turn erat; sc that it gives the sound almost of a new letter <lb/>
            for it is not extinguished, but merely obscured, and is, as it <lb/>
            were, a mark of distinction between the two vowels to prevent <lb/>
            them from combining. 41. We must also take care that the <lb/>
            final syllables of a preceding word, and the initial syllables <lb/>
            of that which follows it, be not the same. That no one may <lb/>
            wonder at such an admonition, I may remark that there has <lb/>
            escaped even from Cicero, in a letter,* Res mihi invisæ visa <lb/>
            sunt, Brute, and in his verses, <lb/>
            0 fortunatam natam me contulI Romam. t</p>
          <p>42. A number of monosyllables, too, have a bad effect in suc­ <lb/>
            cession, because the language, from the many stops that it will <lb/>
            occasion, will seem to proceed by fits and starts. For the <lb/>
            same reason, also, a succession of short verbs and nouns <lb/>
            should be avoided; and, on the other hand, of long ones, <lb/>
            which make sentences heavy and slow. It is a fault moreover <lb/>
            of the same class, when words of similar cadence, and of similar <lb/>
            terminations and inflexions, are joined together. 43. Nor <lb/>
            is it proper that verbs should be joined to verbs, or nouns to <lb/>
            nouns, and the like, in a long succession, as even beauties <lb/>
            themselves will tire, unless they are aided by the charms of <lb/>
            variety.</p>
          <p>44. The connexion of members and phrases does not require <lb/>
            the same management as that of single words, (though the <lb/>
            beginnings and endings of them should harmonize,) but it <lb/>
            makes a great difference, as to composition, what is put first <lb/>
            or last. Thus in the words Vomens frustis esculentis gremium <lb/>
            suum et totum tribunal implevit, the proper gradation is <lb/>
            observed; but, on the other hand, (for I shall often use the <lb/>
            same examples for different purposes, that they may be the <lb/>
            more familiar,) in the phrases § Saxa atque solitudines voci <lb/>
            respondent, bestie sœpe immanes cantu flectuntur atque consis­ <lb/>
            tunt, there would be a better rise in the sense, if their order <lb/>
            were inverted, for it is a greater thing that rocks should be <lb/>
            moved than beasts ; yet gracefulness of structure has ordered <lb/>
            it the other way. <note type="footnote"> * Now lost. </note><note type="footnote">f See xi. 1, 24. Juvenal x. 122. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cic. Philipp. ii. 25. The words " the proper gradation is <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/></p>
          <p>45. But let us pass on to numbers; for all structure, and <lb/>
            measure, and connexion of words, is concerned either with <lb/>
            numbers, (by numbers I wish rhythm to be understood,) or <lb/>
            with metres, that is, certain dimensions of syllables.</p>
          <p>46. But though both rhythm and metre are composed of <lb/>
            feet, they have nevertheless several points of difference; for <lb/>
            rhythm, that is numbers, consists of lengths of times; metre, <lb/>
            besides length, requires the times to be in a certain order; <lb/>
            and thus the one seems to refer to quantity, the other to <lb/>
            quality. 47. Rhythm lies either in feet having two parts <lb/>
            equally balanced, as the dactyl, which has one long syllable <lb/>
            equal to two short; (there is, indeed, the same property in <lb/>
            other feet, but the name of dactyl- is the most common ;— <lb/>
            that a long syllable consists of two times, and a short syllable <lb/>
            of one, even children know ;—) or in feet that have one part <lb/>
            consisting of two times and another of three, as the first pæon, <lb/>
            which is formed of a long syllable and three short, or its <lb/>
            opposite, which is formed of three short syllables and one <lb/>
            long; (or in whatever other way three syllables opposed to two <lb/>
            make this sesquialteral proportion ;) or in feet in which the <lb/>
            one part is double of the other, as the iambus, which is formed <lb/>
            of a short and a long syllable, or the trochee which is the <lb/>
            reverse, 48. The same feet are used in metre, but there is <lb/>
            this difference, that it is of no moment to the rhythm whether <lb/>
            the dactyl has the first or last syllables short; for rhythm <lb/>
            measures merely the time, its object being that the space from <lb/>
            the raising to the lowering of the voice be the same. The <lb/>
            measure of verses is altogether different; for there an anapaest <lb/>
            or spondee cannot be put for a dactyl, nor can a pæon begin <lb/>
            or end with short syllables indifferently. 49. Not only, <lb/>
            indeed, does the regularity of metre refuse to admit one foot for <lb/>
            another, but it will not, possibly, admit even one dactyl or one <lb/>
            spondee for another.t Thus if, in the verse, <note type="footnote"> * Periods consisting chiefly of spondees and anapæsts are called <lb/>
            dactylic by the rhetoricians, the knowledge of whom has been well <lb/>

            Rhythm has indefinite space, metre definite ; metre runs in a <lb/>
            certain circle, rhythm flows on as it has commenced, as far <lb/>
            as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταβολή</foreign>,† or point of transition to another kind of <lb/>
            rhythm; metre is concerned only with words, rhythm is applied <lb/>
            even to the motions of the body. 51. Rhythm also more easily <lb/>
            admits blank times,‡ though these are found also in metre <lb/>
            There is, however, still greater licence in music,§ where <lb/>
            people measure time in their mind, and where they distinguish <lb/>
            intervals by certain marks, with a stroke of the foot or the <lb/>
            hand, and observe how many short notes such intervals contain, <lb/>
            whence the terms percussions <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετϱάσημοι</foreign>, " of four times," <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεντάσημοι</foreign>, “ of five times," and others still longer, for the <lb/>
            Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σημει̃ον</foreign> denotes one time. 52. In the structure of <lb/>
            prose the measure is more determined, and ought to be kept <lb/>
            more apparent to every hearer.</p>
          <p>Measure consists, accordingly, in metrical feet; and these <lb/>
            so readily present themselves in prose, that, in writing it, <lb/>
            verses of all kinds frequently escape us without our knowledge ; <lb/>
            and certainly || there is nothing written in prose that may not <lb/>
            be reduced into some sorts of verses or parts of verses. 53. <lb/>
            But I have met with grammarians so fastidious, that they <lb/>
            would force the syllables of prose composition into various <lb/>
            measures similar to the verses of lyric poets.¶ 54. Cicero, it is <lb/>
            true, observes in several places that the whole beauty of com­ <lb/>
            position consists in numbers, and is in consequence censured <lb/>
            by some writers, as if he wanted to bind prose down to <note type="footnote"> * Æn. x. 1. </note><note type="footnote">t See sect. 55. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Inania tempora.] What is meant by this expression will be better <lb/>

            asserts,. and Virgil who followed him, <lb/>

            I have the numbers, if I knew the words, <lb/>
            and Horace,‡ <lb/>
            Numerisque fertur <lb/>
            Lege solutus, <lb/>
            And rushes on in numbers freed from law.</p>
          <p>55. They attack, accordingly, that passage of Cicero,§ among <lb/>
            others, in which he says, that the thunderbolts of Demosthenes <lb/>
            would not have vibrated with so much force, if they had not <lb/>
            been hurled and impelled in numbers. If, by this expression, <lb/>
            he means impelled by rhythm, I am not of his opinion, for <lb/>
            rhythm, as I said,|| has no certain limit, nor any variety in <lb/>
            its course, but runs on to the end with the same elevations <lb/>
            and depressions with which it commenced. But prose will not <lb/>
            stoop to be measured by taps of the fingers. 56. This Cicerc <lb/>
            himself understood very well, for he frequently remarks, that <lb/>
            he desires prose to be numerous only so far that it should be <lb/>
            rather not (which would be a mark of ignorance and <lb/>
            barbarity,) than <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνϱυθμος</foreign> or poetical; just as we do not wish <lb/>
            men to be palæstritæ, and yet do not wish them to be such as <lb/>
            are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπάλαιστοι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>57. But the regular flow of a period, which results from the <lb/>
            combination of feet, requires some name. What name can be <lb/>
            better, then, than number, that is, oratorical number, as an <lb/>
            entbymeme is called an oratorical syllogism? For my own <lb/>
            part, that I may not fall under the censure which not even <lb/>
            Cicero has escaped,¶ I request that, wherever I use the term <lb/>
            number to signify, regular composition, and wherever I have <lb/>
            already used it in that sense, I may be considered to mean <lb/>
            oratorical number.</p>
          <p>58. As to collocation, its business is to connect words <lb/>
            already chosen and approved, and such as are, as it were, con­ <lb/>
            signed to it; for words rudely united are better than words <note type="footnote"> * Orat. c. 20. </note><note type="footnote">t Virgo Ecl. ix. 45. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Od. iv. 2, 11. </note><note type="footnote">§ Orate c. 70. </note><note type="footnote"> || Sect. 50.

            that are useless. Yet I would allow a speaker to select some <lb/>
            words, for the sake of euphony, in preference to others, pro­ <lb/>
            vided he select from such as are of the same signification and <lb/>
            force, and to add words, on condition that be does not add <lb/>
            such as are superfluous, and to take away, so that he does not <lb/>
            withdraw any that are necessary ; I would permit him also to <lb/>
            vary cases and numbers by means of figures, since variety, <lb/>
            which is frequently adopted for embellishing composition, <lb/>
            pleases even independently of anything else. 59. When <lb/>
            reason, too, pleads for one word, and custom for another, let <lb/>
            composition choose which of the two it thinks proper, vitavisse <lb/>
            or vitâsse, deprendere or deprehendere. Nor am I unwilling to <lb/>
            admit coalescence of syllables,- or anything that is not preju­ <lb/>
            dicial to the thought or the expression. 60. The triumph of <lb/>
            art, however, in this department, is to understand what word <lb/>
            is most suitable for any particular place; and he will construct <lb/>
            his sentences best who shall best observe this, though not <lb/>
            merely! with a view to structure.</p>
          <p>But the management of feet in prose, it should be observed, <lb/>
            is much more difficult than in verse; first, because a verse is <lb/>
            included in a comparatively small number of words, while <lb/>
            prose often runs in long periods; and, secondly, because verse <lb/>
            is always in some degree uniform, and flows in one strain, <lb/>
            while the language of prose, unless it be varied, offends by <lb/>
            monotony, and convicts itself of affectation. 61. Numbers, in­ <lb/>
            deed, are dispersed throughout the whole body, and, so to speak, <lb/>
            course, of prose; for we cannot even speak but in short and <lb/>
            long syllables, of which feet are composed. It is at the close <lb/>
            of periods, however, that regard to numbers is more requisite, <lb/>
            as well as more observable, than anywhere else; first, because <lb/>
            every body of thought has its limit, and requires a natural in­ <lb/>
            terval to separate it from the commencement of that which <lb/>
            follows; and, secondly, because the ear, having listened to a <lb/>
            continuous flow of words, and having been led on, as it were, <lb/>
            by the current of the speech, is better able to form a judg­ <lb/>
            ment when the stream comes to a stop, and gives time for <lb/>
            consideration. 62. There should be nothing, therefore, harsh <note type="footnote"> * See sect. 36. </note><note type="footnote"> t I read qui hoc non solùm componendi gratiâ facit. Rollm, Gedoyn, <lb/>
            and Spalding all saw the necessity of the non, though no one of them <lb/>
            ventured to insert it in his text. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="226"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            or abrupt in that part where the mind takes breath, as it were, <lb/>
            and is recruited. The close of the period is the natural <lb/>
            resting-place of the speech ; it is this that the auditor expects, <lb/>
            and it is here that approbation bursts forth into applause.</p>
          <p>The beginnings of periods demand a degree of care next to <lb/>
            that which is required for the close of them; for to them also <lb/>
            the hearer pays strict attention. 63. But the management of <lb/>
            them is less difficult; for they have no close connexion with <lb/>
            what precedes, but merely refer to it so far as to take a start­ <lb/>
            ing-point from it, with whatever descent towards the close; <lb/>
            though this descent must be graceful, for the close will lose all <lb/>
            its charms if we proceed to it by a rough path. Hence it <lb/>
            happens that, though the language of Demosthenes is thought <lb/>
            to be unobjectionably euphonious in the words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πϱω̃τον <lb/>
            μὲν ὦ ἄνδϱες Αθηναι̃οι, τοι̃ς θεοι̃ς εὔχομαι πα̃σι ϰαὶ πάσαις</foreign>, * " In <lb/>
            the first place, Athenians, I pray to all the gods and goddesses," <lb/>
            and in the phrase (which, as far as I know, has been disliked <lb/>
            by nobody but Brutus ,† and has satisfied every one else) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰἃν. <lb/>
            μήπω βάλλῃ μηδὲ τοξεύη̩</foreign>, “ even though he does not yet throw <lb/>
            or shoot," 64. the critics find fault with Cicero in regard to <lb/>
            Familiaris caeperat esse balneatori, “ he had begun to be familiar <lb/>
            with the bath keeper," and Non nimium dura archipiratæ, “ not <lb/>
            too severe to the private captain;" for though balneatori and <lb/>
            archipiratæ are terminations similar to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πα̃σι, ϰαὶ πάσαις</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδὲ τοξεύη̩</foreign>, yet the words of Demosthenes are more studied; <lb/>
            65. and there is something in the circumstance, too, that, in <lb/>
            Cicero, two feet are included in one word ; a peculiarity which, <lb/>
            even in verse, has much of nervelessness, not only when a <lb/>
            word of five syllables ends a verse, as fortissima Tyndarida­ <lb/>
            rum,‡ but even when the concluding word consists of but four, <lb/>
            as Apennino,§ armamentis,|| Orione.¶ 66. We must, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, take care not to use words of several syllables at the <lb/>
            close of a period.</p>
          <p>As to the middle parts of periods, we must not only take <lb/>
            care that they cohere, but that they be not drawling or prolix, <lb/>
            and also, what is a great vice of the present day, that they do <note type="footnote"> * De Coron. init. </note><note type="footnote"> + Where Brutus censured theMo words of the third Philippic we do <lb/>

            not, from being composed of a number of short syllables, pro­ <lb/>
            ceed by starts: as it were, and make a sound like that of chil­ <lb/>
            dren's rattles. 67. For though the beginnings and endings of <lb/>
            periods are of the most importance, inasmuch - as it is there <lb/>
            that the sense commences and concludes, yet there is also, here <lb/>
            and there, a stress in the middle parts, which causes a slight <lb/>
            pause, as the foot of a runner, though it does not stop, yet <lb/>
            leaves an impression. Hence, not only members and phrases <lb/>
            ought to be well begun and ended, but even in the parts which <lb/>
            are closely connected, and allow no respiration, there ought <lb/>
            still to be certain, almost imperceptible, rests. 68. Who can <lb/>
            doubt, for example, that there is but one thought in the fol <lb/>
            lowing words, and that they ought to be pronounced without <lb/>
            respiration, Animadverti, judices, omnem accusatoris orationem <lb/>
            in duas divisam esse partes ;†yet the first two words. the next <lb/>
            three, the two following, and the last three, have respectively, <lb/>
            as it were, their own numbers, which allow relief to the breath; <lb/>
            at least so it is thought by those who are studious of rhythm. <lb/>
            69. In proportion as these short divisions, too, are grave or <lb/>
            spirited, slow or quick, languid or lively, the periods composed <lb/>
            of them will be severe or effeminate, compact or lax.</p>
          <p>70. The ends of phrases, we may observe, appear sometimes <lb/>
            lame and loose, when they are considered as they stand by <lb/>
            themselves, but are upheld and supported by the words that <lb/>
            follow them; and thus that which would be faulty as a close <lb/>
            is corrected by continuation. The phrase Non vult populus <lb/>
            Romanus obsoletis criminibus accusari Verrem,‡ is harsh if <lb/>
            you stop at the end of it; but when it is joined to that which <lb/>
            follows, nova postulate inaudita desiderata (though disunited in <lb/>
            sense,) the course of the whole is unobjectionable. 71. The <lb/>
            words, Ut adeas, tantum dabis,§ would form a bad close, for <lb/>
            they are the ending of a trimeter iambic verse, but there <lb/>
            follows, ut cibum vestitumque inferre liceat, tantum, which, still <lb/>
            abrupt, is strengthened and supported by the conclusion, <lb/>
            nemo recusabat.</p>
          <p>72. The occurrence of a whole verse in prose has an ex­ <lb/>
            tremely bad effect, and even a part of one is unpleasing; <lb/>
            especially if the latter half of a verse presents itself at the <note type="footnote"> * The text has quoties, but we must read quatenus, as Spalding <lb/>
            remarks. </note><note type="footnote">t Cicero pro Cluent. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ In Verr. v. 44. </note><note type="footnote">§In Verr. v. 45. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            close, or the former half at the beginning of a period. As to <lb/>
            the reverse, it is often not without grace; for the first part of <lb/>
            a verse sometimes forms an elegant conclusion to a sentence, <lb/>
            provided it be confined to a few syllables, and chiefly those of <lb/>
            the iambic trimeter or tetrameter. 73. In Africâ fuisse is <lb/>
            the beginning of a senarius, and closes the first member of <lb/>
            the speech for Quintus Ligarius. Esse videatur, which is now <lb/>
            too much in use, is the beginning of an octonarius.* Of a like <lb/>
            nature, are the expressions of Demosthenes, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πα̃σι ϰαὶ πάσαις · <lb/>
            ϰαὶπα̃σιν ὑμι̃ν·ὂσην εὒνοιαν</foreign>, and throughout almost all the <lb/>
            exordium of the speech against Ctesiphon. 74. The ends of <lb/>
            verses, also, are very suitable for the commencements of <lb/>
            periods ; as Etsi vereor, judices,* and Animadverti, judices. t <lb/>
            But the beginnings of verses are not suitable for the begin­ <lb/>
            nings of periods; though Livy commences his history with <lb/>
            the commencement of a hexameter, Facturusne opera pre­ <lb/>
            tium sim ; for so he published it; and it is better so than as <lb/>
            it has been corrected.‡ 75. Nor are endings of verses proper <lb/>
            for the endings of periods; though Cicero says, Qu<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> me <lb/>
            vertam nescio,§ which is the end of an iambic trimeter. We <lb/>
            may call such a verse a trimeter or senarius indiscriminately; <lb/>
            for it has six feet and three percussions. The end of a hexa­ <lb/>
            meter forms a still worse conclusion; of which Brutus gives <lb/>
            an example in one of his letters,|| Neque illi malunt habere <lb/>
            tutores aut defensores, quanquam sciunt placuisse Catoni. <lb/>
            76. Iambic verses are less observable, because that kind of <lb/>
            verse is nearer akin to prose. Such verses, accordingly, often <lb/>
            escape us unawares; Brutus, through his very anxiety for <lb/>
            elegance in composition, makes them very frequently; Asinius <lb/>
            Pollio not seldom; and even Cicero himself, at times, as in <lb/>
            the commencement of his speech against Lucius Piso, Pro dii <lb/>
            . immortales, quis hie illuxit dies ? 77. But we must avoid with <lb/>
            equal care whatever is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ενϩυθμον</foreign>, or metrical, as in that of Sal­ <lb/>
            lust,¶ Falsb queritur de naturi sua ;for though prose should <note type="footnote"> * The tetrametar trochaic, which Cicero, Tusc. Disp. i. 44, calls sep. <lb/>

            be bound, it should nevertheless appear free. 78. Yet <lb/>
            Plato, though most careful in his composition, could not avoid <lb/>
            such faults at the very commencement of his Timæus ;* for <lb/>
            you may find there, first of all, the commencement of a hex­ <lb/>
            ameter verse; then you may form an Anacreontic, and, if you <lb/>
            please, a trimeter iambic, and what is called by the Greeks a <lb/>
            penthemimer, consisting of two feet and a half. All this is in <lb/>
            a very few words. There has also escaped from Thucydides† <lb/>
            a phrase of the softest kind of metre, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπὲϩἤμιυ Κα̃ϩες ἐϕάνησαν</foreign>,</p>
          <p>79. But since all prose, as I said,‡ consists of feet, I shall <lb/>
            add some remarks on them also; and as different names are <lb/>
            given them by different authors, we must settle, in the first <lb/>
            place, by what name each is to be called. On this head I <lb/>
            shall follow Cicero,§ (for he followed the most eminent of the <lb/>
            Greeks.) excepting that a foot, in my opinion, does not exceed <lb/>
            three syllables, though he admits the poeon and the dochmius, <lb/>
            of which the former extends to four and the latter to five feet; <lb/>
            but does not omit to notice, at the same time, that they are <lb/>
            regarded by some as numbers, not feet. 80. Nor is this <lb/>
            opinion unreasonable; for whatever exceeds three syllables <lb/>
            contains more than one foot. Since, then, there are four feet <lb/>
            that consist of two syllables, and eight of three, I shall call <lb/>
            that which consists of two long syllables, a spondee; that <lb/>
            which has two short, a pyrrhic (some call it a pariambus) ;|| <lb/>
            that which has a short and a long syllable, an iambus; the <lb/>
            contrary to it, formed of a long and a short, a choreus, not, as <lb/>
            others term it, a trochee. 81. Of those, again, which consist <lb/>
            of three syllables, that which is formed of a long and two <lb/>
            short, is universally called a dactyl; that which contains an <lb/>
            equal number of times, but in the reverse order, an anapæst <note type="footnote"> * The words are <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἷς, δύο, τρει̃ς· ὸ δὲ δὴ τέταρτος ἡμω̃ν, ὧφίλε</foreign>. <lb/>

              A short syllable between two long forms an amphimacer, out <lb/>
              the name more commonly given it is cretic. 82. A long syllable <lb/>
              between two short is called an amphibrachys; two long sylla­ <lb/>
              bles following a short, a bacchius; two long preceding a short <lb/>
              a palimbacchius. Three short syllables make a trochee, which <lb/>
              those who give the name trochee to the choreus, choose to call <lb/>
              a tribrach ; three long make a molossus. 83. Of these feet, <lb/>
              there is no one that has not a place in prose composition; but <lb/>
              such as are fuller in times, and stronger in long syllables, give <lb/>
              proportionably more weight to language ; short syllables give <lb/>
              it celerity and briskness. Each sort is useful in its proper <lb/>
              place; for gravity and slowness, when there is need of rapidity, <lb/>
              and quickness and precipitation, when there is need of solem­ <lb/>
              nity, are justly and equally reprehensible. 84. It may be of <lb/>
              importance to remark, also, that some long syllables are longer <lb/>
              than others, and some short syllables shorter than others; so <lb/>
              that, though no long syllables appear to have more than two <lb/>
              times, nor any short syllables less than one time, (and hence <lb/>
              all short syllables, and all long, when arranged in metre, are <lb/>
              accounted equal one to another respectively,) yet there are <lb/>
              almost imperceptible differences in them, some seeming to <lb/>
              contain more and some less. As to verses, they have their <lb/>
              own peculiarities, and in them, accordingly, some syllables <lb/>
              are common. 85 Nature,. indeed, allows a vowel to be <lb/>
              either short or long, as well when it stands alone, as when it <lb/>
              precedes two or three consonants ; but, in the measuring of <lb/>
              feet, a syllable that is short, with another that is short follow­ <lb/>
              ing it, but which has two consonants at the commencement, <lb/>
              becomes long; as, <lb/>

              86. A is short; and gre is short,. yet makes the syllable <lb/>
              preceding it long, and therefore communicates to it a portion <lb/>
              of its own time.t But how could it do so, unless it had <lb/>
              more time than the very shortest of syllables, such as it <lb/>
              would itself be if the consonants st were withdrawn ? As it <lb/>
              is, it lends one time to the syllable that goes before it, and <lb/>
              borrows one from that which follows it; and thus the two <lb/>
              syllables by nature short become possessed of four times by <lb/>
              position.</p>
          <p>87. But I wonder that certain writers, and some of the <lb/>
            greatest learning, should have entertained the opinion that <lb/>
            they ought to choose some feet for prose and reject others, as <lb/>
            if there were any foot that must not at times enter into prose <lb/>
            composition. Although, therefore, Ephorus ‡ delights in the <lb/>
            pæon, which was invented by Thrasymachus|| and approved by <lb/>
            Aristotle, and in the dactyl, as being happy compounds of <lb/>
            short and long syllables, while he shuns the spondee and the <lb/>
            trochee, objecting to the slowness of the one and the rapidity <lb/>
            of the other; 88. although Aristotle thinks the heroic foot, <lb/>
            that is, the dactyl, is more suitable for lofty subjects, and the <lb/>
            iambus for those of common life, and dislikes the trochee as too <lb/>
            flighty, giving it the name of a dancing measure ;§ and <lb/>
            although Theodectes and Theophrastus express similar opinions, <lb/>
            and, subsequently to them, Dionysius of Halicarnassus; 89. <lb/>
            yet the feet to which they object will force themselves upon <lb/>
            them in spite of their utmost efforts, and they will not be able <lb/>
            constantly to use their dactyl or their pæon, the latter of <lb/>
            which they commend most, because it rarely forms a verse. <note type="footnote"> * Short by nature only; by position it is long. Capperonier. </note><note type="footnote"> t The two syllables, as Quintilian afterwards says, become long, or <lb/>

            It is not, however, the mere choice of words, which cannot be <lb/>
            altered as to quantity, or made long or short like syllables in <lb/>
            music, that will render the recurrence of certain feet more OI <lb/>
            less frequent, but the arrangement and combination of them <lb/>
            after they are chosen.</p>
          <p>90. Most feet, indeed, arise from the connexion or separa <lb/>
            tion of words; hence different feet may be formed from the <lb/>
            same words ; and I remember that a poet, of no mean repute, <lb/>
            wrote, in sport, <lb/>
            Astra tenet cælum, mare classes, area messem, <lb/>
            a verse which, read backwards, becomes a Sotadic* verse. go <lb/>
            a trimeter iambic may be formed from a Sotadic read <lb/>
            backwards: <lb/>
            Caput exeruit mobile pinis repetita.</p>
          <p>91. Feet are consequently to be intermixed; and we must <lb/>
            take care that those which are of a pleasing kind form the <lb/>
            greater number, and that the less agreeable be hidden, as it <lb/>
            were, in a crowd of the better sort. The nature of letters and <lb/>
            syllables cannot be changed, but much effect may be produced <lb/>
            by studying that those may be associated which are best <lb/>
            adapted to each other. Long syllables, as I remarked, have <lb/>
            more impressiveness and weight; short ones more lightness. <lb/>
            Short syllables, if they are mixed with long, may be said to <lb/>
            run ; if they are continued in unbroken succession, to bound. <lb/>
            92. Feet that rise from short syllables to long are more <lb/>
            spirited in sound; those which descend from long to short, <lb/>
            more gentle. It is best to commence with long syllables ; but <lb/>
            we may sometimes commence very properly with short; as, <lb/>
            Novum crimen,† or, what is milder in sound, Animadverti, <lb/>
            judices,‡ words which are happily repeated at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the speech for Cluentius, since such a beginning has <lb/>
            something of similarity to partition, which requires speed. <lb/>
            93. The close of a period, too, may very well be composed of <note type="footnote"> * So called from Sotades, a poet who wrote much in it, and con. <lb/>

            long syllables; though short ones may also form a conclusion; <lb/>
            the length of the last syllable is regarded as indifferent. I <lb/>
            am not ignorant that a short syllable, at the end of a sentence, <lb/>
            is accounted as long, because the time in which it is deficient <lb/>
            is in some degree supplied from that'which follows it; but, <lb/>
            when I consult my own ears, I feel that it makes a great dif­ <lb/>
            ference whether the concluding syllable be really long, or only be <lb/>
            accepted as long. For example, the conclusion, Dicere incipi­ <lb/>
            entem timere,* is not so full in sound as Ausus est confiteri.t <lb/>
            94. Yet if it makes no difference whether the last syllable be <lb/>
            long or short, the same foot will close both; but to me the latter <lb/>
            has, I know not how, the air of sitting down, the former that <lb/>
            of merely stopping. Hence some have been induced to assign <lb/>
            three times to a long final syllable, in order that that time which <lb/>
            a short syllable following a long one takes from it, might be <lb/>
            added to the long syllable. Nor is it only of importance what <lb/>
            foot is last in the period ; it is also of consequence what foot <lb/>
            precedes the last. 95. It is not necessary, however, to take <lb/>
            account of more than three feet from the end, (and three are <lb/>
            not to be regarded unless they consist of fewer than three syl­ <lb/>
            lables, but poetical nicety is to be avoided,) or fewer than two; ‡<lb/>
            if we go further back, the result will be measure, not number. <lb/>
            But the one concluding foot may be a dichoreus, if that, indeed, <lb/>
            be one foot which consists of two chorei. 96. Or it may be <lb/>
            that pæon which consists of a choreus and a pyrrhic, and <lb/>
            which is thought peculiarly fit for the commencement of a <lb/>
            sentence ; or it may be the other pæon which is of a contrary <lb/>
            form, and which is deemed appropriate for the termination <lb/>
            of periods; and it is these two pæons that writers on rhetoric <lb/>
            generally mean when they speak of pæons ; though they call <lb/>
            other feet § consisting of three long syllables and one short <lb/>
            by that name, in whatever order the short syllables, and the <lb/>
            long one, occur. 97. Or it may be a dochmius, which is formed <lb/>
            of a bacchius and iambus, or an iambus and cretic, and which is <note type="footnote"> * Cic. pro Mil. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote">† Cic. pro Ligar. c. 1. </note><note type="footnote">‡ We may observe three dissyllabic feet from the end ; but not more <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            a firm and grave foot for the close of a period. Or it may be <lb/>
            a spondee, which Demosthenes has frequently used, and which <lb/>
            has great stability; and a cretic may very happily yrecede it, <lb/>
            as in these words, De quâ ego nihil dicam, nisi depellendt <lb/>
            criminis causa* This exemplifies what I said above,t that <lb/>
            it makes a great difference whether the two concluding <lb/>
            feet are contained in one word, or whether each consists of a <lb/>
            single word. Thus criminis causa is forcible; archipiratœ ‡ <lb/>
            soft; and the softness becomes still greater when a tribrach <lb/>
            precedes the spondee, as facilitates, temeritates. 98. For <lb/>
            there is a certain portion of time latent between the syllables <lb/>
            of a word when it is divided, as in the spondee which forms <lb/>
            the middle part of a pentameter, which, unless it consists of <lb/>
            the final syllable of one word, and the initial syllable of the <lb/>
            next, constitutes no part of a regular verse. To the spondee, <lb/>
            too, though with less effect, may be prefixed an anapæst, as, <lb/>
            Muliere non solùm nobili, verùm etiam notâ. 99. So the anapaest <lb/>
            and the cretic, as well as the iambus which is found in both, <lb/>
            but is shorter than either by a syllable, may very well precede <lb/>
            the spondee, for thus one short syllable will be prefixed to three <lb/>
            long. A spondee also may very properly go before an iambus, <lb/>
            as Iisdem in armis fui.§ A spondee and bacchius, too, may <lb/>
            be prefixed to the iambus, since the conclusion will then be <lb/>
            a dochmius, as In armis iisdem fui. 100. From what I have <lb/>
            just shown,|| it appears that a molossus is very suitable for <lb/>
            the conclusion, provided that it has a short syllable, belonging <lb/>
            to any foot whatever, before it; as, Illud scimus, ubicumque <lb/>
            sunt, esse pro nobis.¶ 101. If a pyrrhic precedes the spondee, <lb/>
            it will have less gravity ; as, Judicii Juniani ;** but the effect <lb/>
            will be still worse if a pæon precedes; as, Brute, dubitari †† <lb/>
            (unless we regard this rather as a dactyl and a bacchius). Twc <lb/>
            spondees can scarcely ever be used in succession. (such a <lb/>
            termination being remarkable even in a verse,) unless when <lb/>
            they may be made to consist, as it were, of three members ; <lb/>
            as, CUT de perfugis nostris copias comparat is contra nos ? <lb/>
            where we have one syllable, then two, and then one. 102. Nor <lb/>
            can a dactyl be properly prefixed to a spondee, because we dislike <note type="footnote"> * Cic. pro Gæl. a. 13. </note><note type="footnote">t Sect. 65. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Ibid. </note><note type="footnote">§ Cic. pro Ligar. c a. </note><note type="footnote"> || Sect. 99.

            the end of a verse at the end of a sentence in prose. The <lb/>
            bacchius may conclude a period, and may be doubled, as <lb/>
            Venenum timeres ;* and it likes a ohoreus and spondee to be <lb/>
            before it, as, Ut venenum timeres. The palimbacchius, also, <lb/>
            will form a very proper ending, unless we wish the last syllable <lb/>
            to be long; and it will take a molossus before it with very <lb/>
            good effect, as Civis Romanus sum,†or a bacchius, as, Quod <lb/>
            hie potest, nos possemus.‡ 103. But it is more proper to say <lb/>
            that these phrases are terminated by a choreus with a spondee <lb/>
            preceding, for the rhythm lies chiefly in the words Nos posse­ <lb/>
            mus, and Romanus sum. The dichoreus may also form a con <lb/>
            clusion, that is, the choreus or trochee may be doubled, a termi­ <lb/>
            nation which the Asiatics frequently use, and of which Cicero <lb/>
            affords us this example, Patris dictum sapiens temeritas filii <lb/>
            comprobavit.§ 104. The choreus will admit a pyrrhic before <lb/>
            it, as, Omnes prope cives virtute, gloriâ, dignitate superabat. <lb/>
            A dactyl, too, will form a good termination, or attention to <lb/>
            the last syllable may make it a cretic, as, Multerculâ nixus in <lb/>
            litore;|| and it will take before it, with very good effect, a <lb/>
            cretic or iambus, but not a spondee, and still less a choreus. <lb/>
            105. An amphibrachys forms a very good ending; as Quintum <lb/>
            Ligarium in Africâ fuisse; or we may prefer, by lengthening <lb/>
            the last syllable, to make it a bacchius. The tribrach is not a <lb/>
            very good ending, if the last syllable be accounted short, as it <lb/>
            certainly must sometimes be, or otherwise how could a <lb/>
            sentence end with a double trochee, which is a favourite <lb/>
            ending with many? 106. From the tribrach, by lengthening <lb/>
            the last syllable, is formed an anapæst ; and by prefixing to it <lb/>
            a long syllable it becomes a pæon, as, Si potero, and, Dixit <lb/>
            hoc Cicero,¶ and, Obstat invidia. But rhetoricians have con­ <lb/>
            signed the pæon to the beginnings of sentences. A pyrrhic <lb/>
            will form a conclusion with a choreus preceding it, for the two <lb/>
            form a pæon. But all terminations of periods formed of short <lb/>
            syllables, will have less weight than those that consist of long; <note type="footnote"> * Cic. pro Cæl. c. 14. </note><note type="footnote">+ Cic. in Verr. v. 62. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cic. pro Ligar. c. 4. </note><note type="footnote">§ Orat. c. 63. </note><note type="footnote"> || Cic. in Verr. v. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ Whether these phrases were made by Quintilian himself merely <lb/>

            nor are they eligible, except where rapidity of language is <lb/>
            required, and no stress is laid upon the close of the sense. <lb/>
            107. The cretic is excellent for the commencement of periods; <lb/>
            as, Quod precatus à this immortalibus sum,* and for termi <lb/>
            nations also. as, In conspectu populi Romani vomere postridie.† <lb/>
            From the last of these examples it appears how properly an <lb/>
            anapaest, or the pæon which is thought most suitable for con­ <lb/>
            clusions, may precede the cretic; and a double cretic may alsc <lb/>
            be used with very good effect, as Servare qudm plurimos.‡ <lb/>
            This is better than if a trochee were to precede the cretic, as <lb/>
            Non turpe duceret,§ where I shall suppose that the final <lb/>
            syllable is considered as long. 108. Let us, however, make it <lb/>
            Non turpe duceres. But in these words occurs the vacant <lb/>
            interval of which I spoke ;|| for we make a short pause <lb/>
            between the last word but one and the last, and lengthen the <lb/>
            last syllable of turpe by the break; otherwise an extremely <lb/>
            tripping kind of sound would be produced, like that of the end <lb/>
            of an iambic verse, Quis non turpe duceret ? So the phrase, <lb/>
            Ore excipere liceret,** if it be pronounced without a pause, forms <lb/>
            part of a free kind of verse,tt but uttered with certain inter­ <lb/>
            vals, and three commencements, as it were, it becomes full of <lb/>
            gravity.</p>
          <p>109. But in specifying the preceding feet, I do not lay <lb/>
            down a law that no others are to be used, but merely show <lb/>
            what effect is commonly produced by those which I have men­ <lb/>
            tioned, and what‡‡ I thought best, for the moment, in each <lb/>
            case. Let me add, that one anapaest following another pro­ <lb/>
            duces but an ill effect, as being the conclusion of a pentameter, <note type="footnote"> * Pro Muræn. init. </note><note type="footnote">t Cic.

            But it is not easy to determine. Spalding says that an Ionic a majore <lb/>
            is followed by an Ionic à minore, or third pæon; but these will not <lb/>
            constitute any exact part of a Sotadic verse. The reading in Cicero is <lb/>
            ore excipere sibi liceret, which is equally irreconcilable with the Sotadic. <lb/>
            In either way, however, the words end as a Sotadic, and Quintilian was <lb/>
            thinking perhaps rather of resemblance than of exactness of measure. <lb/>
            Spalding supposes that Quintilian quoted the words as they stood in <lb/>
            his copy of Cicero, as they are given in the same form by Sorvius on <lb/>
            Æn. iv. 685. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡‡ I tread et before quod, with Spalding, and non quidem for a <lb/>

            or the metre which takes its name from the anapaest ;* as, <lb/>
            Nam ubi libido dominatur, innocentiæ leve præsidium est for <lb/>
            the synalæpha makes the two syllables sound as one. 110. The <lb/>
            effect will be better if a spondee or a bacchius precede, as will <lb/>
            be the case if we transpose the concluding words of the phrase <lb/>
            just cited, and make it, leve innocentiæ presidium est. The <lb/>
            pæon which consists of three short and a long, has not, <lb/>
            (though in this respect I dissent from some great authors,) <lb/>
            many charms for me, for it is but an anapæst with a short <lb/>
            syllable prefixed, as, facilitas, agilitas. Why it pleased those <lb/>
            writers so much I do not understand; but possibly most of <lb/>
            those who liked it were men that fixed their attention rather <lb/>
            on the language of common life than on that of oratory.t 11 .. <lb/>
            It likes to have before it a pyrrhic or trochee, as, mea facilitas, <lb/>
            nostra facilitas ; and even if a spondee be put before it, the <lb/>
            conclusion§ will still be that of a trimeter iambic verse, as is <lb/>
            that of the pæon itself. The pæon which has the syllables in <lb/>
            the reverse order, is deservedly esteemed for the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of periods, for it has one syllable pronounced slowly and <lb/>
            three rapidly. Yet I think that there are others better than <lb/>
            it for that purpose.</p>
          <p>112, This subject, however, has not been introduced with <lb/>
            the intention that the orator, whose language ought to flow <lb/>
            onward in a continued stream, should waste his energies in <lb/>
            measuring feet and weighing syllables, for that-would be the <lb/>
            part of a mean mind, that occupies itself about trifles. 113 <lb/>
            He, indeed, who should devote himself wholly to that study, <lb/>
            would be unable to attend to things of more importance, but, <lb/>
            disregarding force and beauty of thought, would employ him­ <lb/>
            self, as Lucilius says,|| in arranging words like the parts of a <lb/>
            tesselated pavement, or mosaic work. Would not his ardour <lb/>
            be thus cooled, and his force checked, as delicate riders break <lb/>
            the pace of horses by shortening their steps ?¶ 114. Num­ <lb/>

            poured forth artlessly, originating in the measure of time by <lb/>
            the ear, and the observation of portions of language flowing <lb/>
            similarly; and it was not till after some time that feet were <lb/>
            invented. Practice in writing, accordingly, will qualify us <lb/>
            sufficiently for observing due numbers in prose, and enable us <lb/>
            to pour them forth in a similar way extemporaneously. 115. <lb/>
            Nor is it so much particular feet that are to be regarded, as <lb/>
            the general flow of the composition ; as those who make verses <lb/>
            contemplate, not merely the five or six parts of which their <lb/>
            lines are composed, but the whole sweep of their paragraphs. <lb/>
            Verse had its being before the art of versification, and hence <lb/>
            it is well said, <lb/>
            Fauni vatesque canebant. <lb/>
            The Fauns and prophets sang; <lb/>
            and the place, therefore, which versification holds in poetry, <lb/>
            composition holds in prose</p>
          <p>116. The great judge of composition is the ear, which is sensi <lb/>
            ble of what fills it, misses something in whatever is defective, <lb/>
            is offended with what is harsh, soothed with what is gentle, <lb/>
            startled by what is distorted, approves what is compact, marks <lb/>
            what is lame, and dislikes whatever is redundant and super <lb/>
            fluous. Hence, while the learned understand the art of corn <lb/>
            position, the unlearned enjoy pleasure from it. 117. But some <lb/>
            things cannot be taught by art; for instance, it is an excellent <lb/>
            precept that a case must be changed, if, when we have com­ <lb/>
            menced with it, it leads to harshness of construction; but can <lb/>
            it be shown by rule to what other case we must have re­ <lb/>
            course? A diversity of figures is often a support to com­ <lb/>
            position when it seems to flag; but of what figures, of speech, <lb/>
            of thought, or of both ? Can any certain directions be given <lb/>
            on such points? We must look to opportunity, and ask <lb/>
            counsel of the circumstances in which we are placed. 118 <lb/>
            The very pauses, which have a great effect in oratory, by what <lb/>
            judgment can they be regulated but that of the ear? Why <lb/>
            are some periods, that are conceived in few words, sufficiently <lb/>
            full, or even more than sufficiently, when others, comprised in <lb/>
            many, seem curt and mutilated? Why, in some sentences, <lb/>
            even when the sense is complete, does there appear to be still <lb/>
            something of vacancy? 119. Neminem vestrûm, says Cicero, <note type="footnote">* Cic. Orat. c. 51. By vates is meant augurs or any persona that <lb/>

            atque hanc opinionem populi Bomani fuisse.* “ I suppose <lb/>
            that no one of you is ignorant, judges, that it has been the <lb/>
            talk of the common people during several days past, and that <lb/>
            it has been the opinion of the people of Rome in general," <lb/>
            &amp;c. Why does he use hosce in preference to hos, for hos <lb/>
            would not be harsh ? I should perhaps be unable to assign <lb/>
            any reason, but I feel that Mace is the better. Why would it <lb/>
            not have been sufficient to say simply, sermonem vulgi fuisse ? <lb/>
            The structure and sense would have admitted it. I cannot <lb/>
            say; but, when I listen to the words, I feel that the period <lb/>
            would be unsatisfactory without a clause to correspond to that <lb/>
            which precedes. 120. It is to the judgment, therefore, that such <lb/>
            matters must be referred. A person may be unable, perhaps, to <lb/>
            understand exactly what is accurate and what is pleasing, yet be <lb/>
            may act better under the guidance of nature than of art; but <lb/>
            there is some degree of art in strict adherence to nature.</p>
          <p>121. What is undoubtedly the business of the orator, is to <lb/>
            understand on what subjects he must employ particular kinds <lb/>
            of composition. This embraces two points for consideration; <lb/>
            one having reference to feet; the other to periods composed <lb/>
            of feet.</p>
          <p>122. Of the latter I shall speak first I observed† that the <lb/>
            parts of language are commas, members, and periods. A comma, <lb/>
            according to my notion, is a certain portion of thought put into <lb/>
            words, but not completely expressed; by most writers it is called <lb/>
            a part of a member. The following examples of it Cicero‡ <lb/>
            affords us: Domus tibi deerat ? At hab bas. Pecunia supe­ <lb/>
            rabat? At egelas. " Was a house wanting to you? But <lb/>
            you had one. Was money superabundant with you? But <lb/>
            you were in want." A comma may consist merely of a single <lb/>
            word; as, Diximus, Testes dare volumus, “We said, We are <lb/>
            willing to produce witnesses;” where Diximus is a comma. <lb/>
            123. A member is a portion of thought completely expressed, <lb/>
            but detached from the body of the sentence, and establishing <lb/>
            nothing by itself. Thus, 0 callidos homines "0 crafty <lb/>
            men!" is a complete member, but, abstracted from the rest of <lb/>
            the period, has no force, any more than the hand, or foot, or <note type="footnote"> * Cic. in Verr. i. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> t Diximus ] We may refer, says Spalding, to sect. 60, 67, but I <lb/>
            rispect that Quintilian wrote dicimus. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Orat. 3. 67. </note> <pb n="240"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            head, separated from the human body. So, too, 0 rent excogi <lb/>
            tatam “ 0 matter well considered!" When, then, do such <lb/>
            members begin to form a body? When the conclusion is <lb/>
            added : as, Quem, quæso, nostrum fefellit, id vos ita esse factu­ <lb/>
            ros ? “To which of us, I pray, was it unknown that you <lb/>
            would act in this manner?" a sentence which Cicero thinks <lb/>
            extremely concise. Thus commas and members are generally <lb/>
            mixed, and necessarily require a conclusion. 124. To the <lb/>
            period Cicero. gives several names, ambitus, circuitus, com­ <lb/>
            prehensiO, continuation circum scriptio. There are two kinds of <lb/>
            it; one simple, when a single thought is expressed in a rather <lb/>
            full compass of words; the other consisting of members and <lb/>
            commas, which may contain several thoughts; as, Aderat <lb/>
            janitor carceris, et carnifex prætoris, &amp;c. J 25. A period <lb/>
            must have at least two members; the average number appears <lb/>
            to be four; but it frequently admits of more. Its proper <lb/>
            length is limited by Cicero t to that of about four iambic <lb/>
            trimeters, or the space between the times of taking breath. It <lb/>
            ought fairly to terminate the sense; it should be clear, that it <lb/>
            may be easily understood; and it should be of moderate <lb/>
            length, that it may be readily retained in the memory. A <lb/>
            member longer than is reasonable, causes slowness in a period ; <lb/>
            such as are too short, give it an air of instability. 126. When­ <lb/>
            ever we have to speak with spirit, urgency, and resolution, we <lb/>
            must speak in a mixture of members and commas; for such a <lb/>
            style is of vast force in pleadings; and our language should be <lb/>
            so nicely adapted to our matter that rough numbers should be <lb/>
            applied to rough subjects, and the hearer should be as strongly <lb/>
            affected as the speaker. 127. In stating facts, we may use chiefly <lb/>
            members, or distinguish our periods into longer divisions, <lb/>
            with a looser sort of connexion, except in those portions which <lb/>
            are introduced, not to inform, but to embellish, as the abduc­ <lb/>
            tion of Proserpine in one of the orations against Verres <lb/>
            for a gentle and flowing sort of composition is suitable for <lb/>
            such recitals. 128. Full periods are very proper for the <lb/>
            exordia of important causes, where it is necessary to excite <lb/>
            solicitude, interest, or pity. They are also adapted for moral <note type="footnote"> * Orat. c. 61. </note><note type="footnote"> t Orate c. 66, where, however, Cicero says hexameter, not iambics. <lb/>
            Spalding expresses surprise that Quintilian should have confounded <lb/>

            dissertations, and for any kind of amplification. A close style <lb/>
            is proper when we accuse; a more diffuse one when we eulogize; <lb/>
            and it is also of great effect in perorations. 129. But we are <lb/>
            to make it our great care that this copious kind of style may <lb/>
            be used when the judge not only thoroughly understands the <lb/>
            case, but is captivated with the eloquence of the pleadei, <lb/>
            resigns himself wholly to its influence, and is led away by the <lb/>
            pleasure which he experiences. History requires, not so <lb/>
            much studied numbers, as a certain roundness and connected­ <lb/>
            ness of style ; for all its members are attached, as it rolls and <lb/>
            flows along; as men, who steady their steps by taking hold ot <lb/>
            each others' hands, support and are supported. 130. All the <lb/>
            demonstrative kind of eloquence requires free and flowing num­ <lb/>
            bers ; the judicial and deliberative kinds, as they are various <lb/>
            in their matter, admit of proportionate variety in their style.</p>
          <p>I must now treat of the second division of the two which I <lb/>
            just now made.* Who doubts that some parts of a speech <lb/>
            are to be uttered with slowness, others with rapidity, some in <lb/>
            a lofty manner, others in a tone of argument, some in an <lb/>
            ornate style, others with an air of simplicity? 131. Who <lb/>
            doubts that long syllables are most suitable for grave, sublime, <lb/>
            and demonstrative subjects ? Calm topics require lengthening <lb/>
            of the vowels; sublime and showy ones., fulness in the pronuncia­ <lb/>
            tion of them ; topics of an opposite kind, such as arguments, <lb/>
            distinctions, jests, and whatever approaches nearer to common <lb/>
            conversation, demand rather short vowels. 132. As to the. <lb/>
            exordium, we may vary the style of it as the subject may <lb/>
            require; for I cannot agree with Celsus, who has given one <lb/>
            set form for this part, and says that the best model of an <lb/>
            exordium is to be found in Asinius : If, Cœsar,† from among all <lb/>
            men that are now alive, or that ever have lived, a judge could <lb/>
            be chosen for the decision of this cause, no one would be more <lb/>
            desirable for us than yourself. 133. I do not deny that this <lb/>
            commencement is excellently composed, but I cannot admit <lb/>
            that such a form of commencement should be observed in all <lb/>
            exordia; for the mind of the judge is to be influenced by <lb/>
            various means; sometimes we would wish to excite pity, <lb/>
            sometimes to assume an air of modesty, spirit, gravity, or <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 121. </note><note type="footnote"> t Augustus. But on what occasion the speech was delivered i <lb/>
            unknown. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <pb n="242"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            plausibility, sometimes to sway the judge to certain opinions, <lb/>
            or to exhort him to pay diligent attention to us. As these <lb/>
            objects are of various characters, each of them requires a <lb/>
            different sort of language. Has Cicero used the same kind <lb/>
            of rhythm in his exordia for Milo, for Cluentius, and for <lb/>
            Ligarius ?</p>
          <p>134. Statements of facts require slower, and, if I may use <lb/>
            the expression, more modest feet, and, in general, a mixture <lb/>
            of all kinds. The style of this part is commonly indeed grave, <lb/>
            but sometimes assumes elevation; its great object is to inform <lb/>
            the judge, and to fix particulars in his mind; and this is not <lb/>
            to be done by hasty speakers. To me it appears, that the <lb/>
            whole narrative part of a speech admits of longer members <lb/>
            than the other portions, but should be confined within shorter <lb/>
            periods.</p>
          <p>135. Arguments, too, that are of a spirited and rapid <lb/>
            description, will require feet suited to their qualities, but <lb/>
            among them they must not admit tribrachs, which will give <lb/>
            quickness, but not force; though they should be composed, <lb/>
            however, of short and long syllables, they should not admit <lb/>
            more long than short.*</p>
          <p>136. The elevated portions of a speech require long and <lb/>
            sonorous syllables; they like the fulness of the dactyl also, <lb/>
            and of the pæon, which, though it consists mostly of short syl­ <lb/>
            lables, is yet sufficiently strong in times. Rougher parts, on <lb/>
            the contrary, are best set forth in iambic feet, not only because <lb/>
            they consist of only two syllables, and, consequently, allow <lb/>
            of more frequent beats as it were, a quality opposed to calm­ <lb/>
            ness ; but because every foot rises, springing and bounding <lb/>
            from short to long, and is for that reason preferable to the <lb/>
            trochee, which from a long falls to a short. 137. The more <lb/>
            subdued parts of a speech, such as portions of the peroration, <lb/>
            call for syllables that are long indeed, but less sonorous.</p>
          <p>Celsus represents that there is a superior kind of compo­ <lb/>
            sition ;f but if I knew what it was I should not teach it, as it <note type="footnote"> * The text appears to be unsound here. I have given what seems <lb/>
            to be the sense. </note><note type="footnote"> t Superiorem compoaitionem.] " This," says Spalding, “ is sufficiently <lb/>
            obscure." None of the critics, indeed, know what to make of the <lb/>
            passage. Burmann does not venture on a conjecture. Gesner was half <lb/>
            inclined to read supiniorem, but this had been proposed even before <lb/>
            the time of Regius. who rejected it; and the occurrence of the word </note> <pb n="243"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH IV]"/> <lb/>
            must necessarily be dull and tame. Unless it arises of itself, <lb/>
            however, from the nature of our language and thoughts, it <lb/>
            cannot be sufficiently condemned.</p>
          <p>138. But, to make an end of this subject, we must form our <lb/>
            language to suit our delivery. Is not our manner, in the <lb/>
            exordium, generally subdued, unless, indeed, when, in making <lb/>
            an accusation, we must rouse the feelings of the judge, and <lb/>
            excite him to some degree of indignation? Are we not, in <lb/>
            narration, full and expressive; in argumentation, lively and <lb/>
            animated, and spirited even in our action? Do we not, in <lb/>
            moral observations and in descriptions, adopt a diffuse and <lb/>
            flowing style; and, in perorations, one that is submissive, and <lb/>
            sometimes, as it were, faltering? 139. Even the movements <lb/>
            of the body have their rhythm; and the musical science of <lb/>
            numbers applies the percussions of measured feet no less to <lb/>
            dancing than to tunes. Is not our tone of voice, and our <lb/>
            gesture, adapted to the nature of the subjects on which we <lb/>
            speak ? Such adaptation, then, is by no means wonderful in <lb/>
            the rhythm of our language, since it is natural that what is <lb/>
            sublime should march majestically, that what is calm should <lb/>
            advance leisurely, that what is spirited should run, and that <lb/>
            what is tender should flow. 140. Hence, when we think it <lb/>
            necessary, we affect even tumour, which is best accomplished <lb/>
            by the use of spondees and iambi: <lb/>
            En impero Argis: sceptra mihi liquit Pelops,† <lb/>
            Lo, I rule Argon: Pelops to me left <lb/>
            His sceptre.</p>
          <p>141. But the comic senarius,‡ which is called trochaic, runs <lb/>
            on rapidly by assuming several chorei, (which, by others, are <lb/>
            called trochees,) and pyrrhics; but what it gains in celerity it <lb/>
            loses in weight: <lb/>
            Quid igitur faciam ? Non eam, ne nunc quidem ? <lb/>
            What, therefore, shall I do ? . Not go ? Ev'n now ? § <note type="footnote">supina in a subsequent part of the sentence renders it quite inadmissi­ <lb/>
            ble. Spalding timidly suggests superbiorem, but this seems hardly <lb/>
            consistent with what Quintilian says of this species of composition. </note><note type="footnote"> IV. 3, 9. </note><note type="footnote"> t A verse from some old tragedy, quoted also by Seneca Ep. 80. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This passage is unintelligible as it stands.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B IX"/><lb/>
            But what is rough and contentious proceeds better, as I <lb/>
            said,* in iambic feet, even in verse: <lb/>
            Quis hoc potest videre ? quis potest pati ? <lb/>
            Nisi impudicus, et vorax, et alveo ? t <lb/>
            Who can endure to see, who suffer this, <lb/>
            Except a rake, a glutton, cormorant ?</p>
          <p>142. In general, however, if I were obliged to make a choice, I <lb/>
            should prefer language to be harsh and rough rather than <lb/>
            excessively delicate and nerveless, such as I see in many <lb/>
            writers; and, indeed, we grow every day more effeminate in <lb/>
            our style, tripping, as it were, to the exact measures of a <lb/>
            dance. ‡ 143. It is a sort of versification to lay down one law for <lb/>
            every species of composition; and it is not only a manifest <lb/>
            proof of affectation, (the very suspicion of which ought care­ <lb/>
            fully to be avoided,) but also produces weariness and satiety <lb/>
            from uniformity; the sweeter it is, the sooner it ceases to <lb/>
            please, and the speaker, who is seen to make such melody in <lb/>
            his study, loses all power of convincing, and of exciting the <lb/>
            feelings and passions; for the judge cannot be expected to <lb/>
            believe that orator, or to be filled with sorrow or indignation <lb/>
            under his influence, whom he observes to turn his attention <lb/>
            from his matter to niceties of sound. 144. Accordingly, some <lb/>
            of our composition should be purposely of a looser kind, so <lb/>
            that, though we may have laboured it most carefully, it may <lb/>
            appear not to have been laboured. But we must not cultivate <lb/>
            such studied negligence so far as to introduce extravagantly <lb/>
            long hyperbata,§ (lest we should make it evident that we <lb/>
            affect that which we wish to seem to have done without affect­ <lb/>
            ation,) nor must we, above all, set aside any apt or expressive <lb/>
            word for the sake of smoothness. 145. No word, in reality, will <lb/>
            prove so unmanageable, that it may not find a suitable place <lb/>
            in a period; but our object, to say the truth, in avoiding <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 136. </note><note type="footnote">+ Catullus, Cam. 26. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Syntonorum, modis saltitantes.] Syntona are supposed to be the <lb/>
            same as scabilla, a kind of musical instruments, which, when pressed <lb/>

            such words, is frequently not elegance, but ease, in compo <lb/>

            of composition more than the Greeks, though they have less <lb/>

            in Cicero, that he has differed in this respect from Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes. But the difference between the Latin and Greek <lb/>

          <p>Composition (for I hasten to put an end to a book that has <lb/>
            exceeded the limits prescribed to it) ought to be elegant, <lb/>
            pleasing, and varied. The particulars that require attention <lb/>
            in it are three, order, connexion, and rhythm. 147. The art <lb/>
            of it lies in adding, retrenching, and altering. The quality of <lb/>

            speak. The care required in it is great, but that devoted to <lb/>

            must be diligently concealed, in order that our numbers may <lb/>
            seem to flow from us spontaneously, and not to be forced or <lb/>

          <p>1. BUT these precepts of oratory, though necessary to be <lb/>
            known, are yet insufficient to produce the full power of elo­ <lb/>
            quence, unless there be united with them a certain efficient <lb/>
            readiness, which among the Greeks is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξις</foreign>, “ habit," and <lb/>
            to which I know that it is an ordinary subject of inquiry <lb/>
            whether more is contributed by writing, reading, or speaking. <lb/>
            This question we should have to examine with careful atten­ <lb/>
            tion, if we could confine ourselves to any one of those exer <lb/>
            cises ; 2. but they are all so connected, so inseparably linked, <lb/>
            with one another, that if any one of them be neglected, we <lb/>
            labour in vain in the other two ; for our speech will never <lb/>
            become forcible and energetic, unless it acquires strength from <lb/>
            great practice in writing, and the labour of writing, if left <pb n="247"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            destitute of models from reading, passes away without effect, <lb/>
            as having no director; while he who knows how everything <lb/>
            ought to be said, will, if he has not his eloquence in readi­ <lb/>
            ness, and prepared for all emergencies, merely brood, as it <lb/>
            were, over locked up treasure.</p>
          <p>3. Though some one quality, again, may be requisite above <lb/>
            others, it will not necessarily, for that purpose, be chief in <lb/>
            importance for forming the orator. For since the business <lb/>
            of the orator lies in speaking, to speak is doubtless necessary to <lb/>
            him before anything else; and it is evident that from speak­ <lb/>
            ing the commencement of the art arose; also that the next <lb/>
            thing in order is imitation ;* and, last of all, diligent exer­ <lb/>
            cise in writing. 4. But as we cannot arrive at the highest <lb/>
            excellence otherwise than by initial efforts, so, as our work <lb/>
            proceeds, those things which are of the greatest importance <lb/>
            begin to appear of the least.</p>
          <p>But I am not here saying how the orator is to be trained, <lb/>
            (for that has been told already, if not satisfactorily, at least as <lb/>
            well as I could,) but by what kind of discipline an athlete, <lb/>
            who has already learned all his exercises from his master, is <lb/>
            to be prepared for real contests. Let me, therefore, instruct <lb/>
            the student, who knows how to invent and arrange his matter, <lb/>
            and who has also acquired the art of selecting and disposing <lb/>
            his words, by what means he may be able to practise, in the <lb/>
            best and easiest possible manner, that which he has learned.</p>
          <p>5. Can it then be doubted, that he must secure certain <lb/>
            resources, which he may use whenever it shall be necessary ? <lb/>
            Those resources will consist in supplies of matter and of words. <lb/>
            6. But every cause has its own peculiar matter, or matter <lb/>
            common to it with but few others ; words are to be prepared <lb/>
            for all kinds of causes. If there were a single word for every <lb/>
            single thing, words would require less care, for all would then <note type="footnote"> * Imitationem ] It would appear, from the place which this word <lb/>
            occupies, that we ought to understand lectio, " reading,., though how <lb/>
            this can be included or implied in imitatio, I confess that I hardly <lb/>
            see. Yet no commentator has hesitated at the word. Perhaps, as the <lb/>
            reading of the best authors was adopted with a view to imitation, it <lb/>
            became customary for diligent attention to books to be called imitation. <lb/>
            Thus the work of Dionysius Halicarnassensis, in which he gave judg­ <lb/>
            ment on the ancient orators, and of which some portions only are left, <lb/>
            appears to have been entitled De Imitatione, under which designation <lb/>
            it is mentioned by the Scholiast on Hermogenes, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ μιμήσεως</foreign>. <lb/>

            at once present themselves with the things to be expressed. <lb/>
            . As some, however, are more appropriate, or more elegant, o <lb/>
            more significant, or more euphonious, than others, they ought <lb/>
            all, not only to be known, but to be kept in readiness, and, if <lb/>
            I may so express myself, in sight, so that, when they present <lb/>
            themselves to the judgment of the speaker, the choice of the <lb/>
            best of them may be easily made. 7. I know that some <lb/>
            make a practice of learning by heart such words as have the <lb/>
            same signification, in order that one word out of several may <lb/>
            the more readily occur to them, and that, when they have used <lb/>
            one of the number, they may, if it should be wanted again <lb/>
            within a short space of time, substitute for it, for the sake <lb/>
            of avoiding repetition, another from which the same thing <lb/>
            may be understood. But this is a childish practice, attended <lb/>
            with miserable labour, and productive of very little profit; for <lb/>
            the learner merely musters a crowd of words, to snatch from it <lb/>
            without distinction whichsoever first presents itself.</p>
          <p>8. By us, on the contrary, our stock of words must be pre <lb/>
            pared with judgment, as we have a view to the proper force of <lb/>
            oratory, and not to the volubility of the charlatan. But this <lb/>
            object we shall effect by reading and listening to the best <lb/>
            language ; for, by such exercise, we shall not only learn words <lb/>
            expressive of things, but shall learn for what place each word <lb/>
            is best adapted. 9. Almost all words, indeed, except a few that <lb/>
            are of indecent character, find a place in oratorical compo­ <lb/>
            sition ; and the writers of iambics,* and of the old comedy, <lb/>
            are often commended for the use of words of that description ; <lb/>
            but it is sufficient for us at present to look to our own work. <lb/>
            All sorts of words, then, except those to which I have alluded, <lb/>
            may be excellently employed in some place or other; for we <lb/>
            have sometimes occasion for low and coarse words; and such <lb/>
            as would seem mean in the more elegant parts of a speech, <lb/>
            are, when the subject requires them, adopted with propriety.</p>
          <p>10. To understand words thoroughly, and to learn not only <lb/>
            the signification of them, but their forms and measures,! and <note type="footnote"> * Inasmuch as the phallic verges were in iambic measure; as <lb/>

            to be able to judge whether they are adapted to the places to <lb/>
            which they are assigned, are branches of knowledge that we <lb/>
            cannot acquire but by assiduous reading and hearing, since we <lb/>
            receive all language first of all by the ear. Hence infants <lb/>
            brought up, at the command of princes,* by dumb nurses and <lb/>
            in solitude, were destitute of the faculty of speech, though they <lb/>
            are said to have uttered some unconnected words.</p>
          <p>11. There are, however, some words of such a nature that <lb/>
            they express the same thing by different sounds, so exactly <lb/>
            that it makes no difference to the sense which we use in <lb/>
            preference to another; for instance ensis and gladius. There <lb/>
            are others, again, which, though properly belonging to distinct <lb/>
            objects, are yet by a trope, as it were, used for conveying the <lb/>
            same idea; asferrum and mucro.† 12. Thus, too, by a cata­ <lb/>
            chresis, we call all assassins sicarii,‡ whatever be the weapon <lb/>
            with which they have committed slaughter. Some things, <lb/>
            moreover, we indicate by a circumlocution, as pressi copia <lb/>
            lactis.§ Many things, also, by a change of words, we express <lb/>
            figuratively, as, for I know, we say I am not ignorant, or It <lb/>
            does not escape me, or It does notfail to attract my attention, <lb/>
            or Who is not aware ? or No man doubts. 13. We may like­ <lb/>
            wise profit by the near import 6f words, for I understand, I <lb/>
            perceive, I see, have often just the same meaning as I know. <lb/>
            Of such synonyms reading will furnish us with copious sup­ <lb/>
            plies, so that we may use them not only as they present <lb/>
            themselves, but as they ought to be adopted. 14. For such <lb/>
            terms do not always express exactly the same things; and <lb/>
            though I may properly say "I see" in reference to the <lb/>
            perception of the mind, I cannot say “ I understand " in <lb/>
            reference to the sight of the eyes; nor, though mucro indi­ <lb/>
            cates gladius, does gladius indicate mucro. 15. But though a <lb/>
            copious stock of words be thus acquired, we are not to read or <lb/>
            bear merely for the sake of words; for in all that we teach <lb/>
            examples are more powerful || even than the rules which are <note type="footnote"> * Quintilian speaks as if this experiment had been several times <lb/>

            taught, (I mean when the learner is so far advanced that he <lb/>
            can enter into the subjects without a guide, and pursue them <lb/>
            with his own unassisted efforts,) inasmuch as what the master <lb/>
            teaches, the orator exhibits..</p>
          <p>16. Some speeches contribute more to our improvement <lb/>
            when we hear them delivered, others when we peruse them. <lb/>
            He who speaks to us rouses us by his animation, and excites <lb/>
            us, not by an artificial representation and account of things,! <lb/>
            but by the things themselves. Every thing seems to live and <lb/>
            move before us, and we catch the new ideas, as it were at their <lb/>
            birth, with partiality and affection. We feel interested, not <lb/>
            only in the event of the cause, but in the perilous efforts of <lb/>
            those who plead it. 17. In addition to this, a becoming tone and <lb/>
            action, a mode of delivery adapted to what particular passages <lb/>
            require, (which is perhaps the most powerful element in <lb/>
            oratory,) and, in a word, all excellent qualities in combination <lb/>
            teach us at the same time. In reading, on the other hand, <lb/>
            the judgment is applied with more certainty, for, when a person <lb/>
            is listening to speeches, his own partiality for any particular <lb/>
            speaker, or the ordinary applause of approving auditors, often <lb/>
            deprives him of the free exercise of his judgment; 18. since we <lb/>
            are ashamed to express dissent from others, and are prevented, <lb/>
            by a sort of secret modesty, from trusting too much to our­ <lb/>
            selves, though what is faulty sometimes pleases the majority, <lb/>
            and even what does not please is applauded by those who are <lb/>
            engaged to applaud. 19. On the contrary, too, it sometimes <lb/>
            happens that the bad taste of the audience does not do justice <lb/>
            to the finest passages. But reading is free, and does not <lb/>
            escape us with the rapidity of oral delivery, but allows us to <lb/>
            go over the same passages more than once, whether we have <lb/>
            any doubt of their meaning, or are desirous to fix them in onr <lb/>
            memory. Let us review, then, and reconsider the subject of <lb/>
            our reading, and as we consign our food to our stomach only <lb/>
            when it is masticated and almost dissolved, in order that it <lb/>
            may be easier of digestion, so let what we read be committed <note type="footnote"> * We are not to read or hear merely to get words, but to observe at <lb/>

            he adds, and suits very well with imago, as opposed to res ipsœ. </note> <pb n="251"/>

            to the memory and reserved for imitation, not when it is in a <lb/>
            crude state, but after being softened, and as it were triturated, <lb/>
            by frequent repetition.</p>
          <p>20. For a long time, too, none but the best authors must be <lb/>
            read, and such as are least likely to mislead him who trusts them; <lb/>
            but they must be read with attention, and indeed with almost <lb/>
            as much care as if we were transcribing them; and every por­ <lb/>
            tion must be examined, not merely partially, but a whole book, <lb/>
            when read through, must be taken up afresh, and especially <lb/>
            any excellent oration, of which the merits are often designedly <lb/>
            concealed; 21. for the speaker frequently prepares his audi­ <lb/>
            ence for what is to follow, dissembles with them, and places <lb/>
            ambuscades; and states in the first part of his pleading what <lb/>
            is to have its full effect at the conclusion. Hence what is <lb/>
            advanced in its proper place often pleases us less than it <lb/>
            ought, since we are not aware why it is advanced; and all such <lb/>
            passages, accordingly, ought to be perused again after we have <lb/>
            read the whole. 22. But one of the most useful exercises, is <lb/>
            to learn the history of those causes of which we have taken <lb/>
            the pleadings in hand for perusal, and, whenever opportunity <lb/>
            shall offer, to read speeches delivered on both sides of the <lb/>
            same question; as those of Demosthenes and AEschines in <lb/>
            opposition to each other; those of Servius Sulpicius and <lb/>
            Messala, of whom one spoke for Aufidia,* and the other <lb/>
            against her; those of Pollio and Cassius when Asprenas t was <lb/>
            accused ; and many others. 23. Even if the pleaders seem un­ <lb/>
            equally matched, yet some of the speeches may be reasonably <lb/>
            consulted in order to ascertain the question for decision, as the <lb/>
            orations of Tubero against Ligarius ‡ and of Hortensius on <lb/>
            behalf of Verres,§ in opposition to those of Cicero. It will <lb/>
            also be of advantage to know how different orators pleaded the <lb/>
            same causes; for Calidius || delivered a speech concerning the <lb/>
            house of Cicero; and Brutus wrote an oration in defence of <note type="footnote"> * IV. 2,106. </note><note type="footnote"> t He was accused of poisoning by Cassius Severus, as appears from <lb/>

            Messala, too, defended the same persons; and, when I was a <lb/>
            boy, there were in circulation celebrated speeches of Domitius <lb/>
            Afer, Crispus Passienus, and Decimus Lælius, in defence of <lb/>
            Volusenus Catulus.t</p>
          <p>Nor must he who reads feel immediately convinced that <lb/>
            everything that great authors have said is necessarily per­ <lb/>
            fect; for they sometimes make a false step, or sink under <lb/>
            their burden, or give way to the inclination of their genius ; <lb/>
            nor do they always equally apply their minds, but sometimes <lb/>
            grow weary; as Demosthenes seems to Cicero ‡ sometimes to <lb/>
            nod, and Homer himself appears to Horace § to do so. <lb/>
            25. They are great men, indeed, but men nevertheless ; and <lb/>
            it often happens to those, who think that whatever is found in <lb/>
            such authors is a law for eloquence, that they imitate what is <lb/>
            inferior in them, (for it is easier to copy their faults than their <lb/>
            excellences,) and fancy that they fully resemble great men <lb/>
            when they have adopted great men's defects.</p>
          <p>26. Yet students must pronounce with diffidence and cir­ <lb/>
            cumspection on the merits of such illustrious characters, lest, <lb/>
            as is the case with many, they condemn what they do not <lb/>
            understand. If they must err on one side or the other, I <lb/>
            should prefer that every part of them should please youthful <lb/>
            readers rather than that many parts should displease them.</p>
          <p>27. Theophrastus says that the reading of the poets is of the <lb/>
            greatest use to the orator. Many others adopt his opinion ; <lb/>
            and not without reason ; for from them is derived animation in <lb/>
            relating facts, sublimity in expression, the greatest power in <lb/>
            exciting the feelings, and gracefulness in personifying cha­ <lb/>
            racter;ll and, what is of the utmost service, the faculties of <lb/>
            the orator, worn out as it were by daily pleading in the forum, <lb/>
            are best recruited by the charms of the works of such authors. <lb/>
            Accordingly Cicero IT thinks that relaxation should be sought <lb/>
            in that sort of reading. 28. But we must remember that <lb/>
            poets are not to be imitated by the orator in every respect: <lb/>
            not, for instance, in freedom of language, or unrestrained use <lb/>
            of figures ; that the style of poets is adapted for display, and, <note type="footnote"> * III. 6, 93. </note><note type="footnote">t Of him nothing is known. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Drat. c. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> § A.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            besides, that it aims merely at giving pleasure, and pursues its <lb/>
            object by inventing not only what is false, but even sometimes <lb/>
            what is incredible; 29. that it enjoys certain privileges, inasmuch <lb/>
            as, being confined to the regular requirements of feet, it cannot <lb/>
            always use proper terms, but, being driven from the straight <lb/>
            road, must necessarily have recourse to certain bye-paths of <lb/>
            eloquence, and is obliged not only to change words, but to <lb/>
            lengthen, shorten, transpose,* and divide them; but that we <lb/>
            orators stand in arms in a field of battle, contend for concerns <lb/>
            of the highest moment, and must struggle only for victory. <lb/>
            30. Yet I would not wish that the arms of the orator should <lb/>
            be squalid from foulness and rust, but that there should be a <lb/>
            brightness on them like that of steel, which may dismay oppo­ <lb/>
            nents, and by which the mind and the eye may at once be <lb/>
            dazzled, and not like that of gold or silver, which is unwarlike, <lb/>
            and dangerous rather to the wearer than to the enemy.</p>
          <p>31. History, also, may nourish oratory with a kind of <lb/>
            fertilizing and grateful aliment. But it must be read with <lb/>
            the conviction that most of its very excellences are to be <lb/>
            avoided by the orator; for it borders closely on poetry, and <lb/>
            may be said, indeed, to be a poem unfettered by the restraints <lb/>
            of metre; it is written to relate, not to prove; and its whole <lb/>
            nature is suited, not to the pleading of causes, or to instant <lb/>
            debate, but to the transmission of events to posterity, and to <lb/>
            gain the reputation of ability for its author; and for this <lb/>
            reason it relieves the tediousness of narrative by words more <lb/>
            remote from common usage, and by a more bold † employment <lb/>
            of figures. 32. Accordingly, as I observed, ‡ neither is the <lb/>
            brevity of Sallust, than which nothing can be more perfectly <lb/>
            pleasing to the unoccupied and learned ear, to be studied by <lb/>
            us in addressing a judge, who is engaged with various thoughts, <lb/>
            and often destitute of literature; nor will the milky exuberance <lb/>
            of Livy satisfactorily instruct a hearer who looks not for beauty <lb/>
            of statement, but for proof of fact. 33. Besides, Cicero§ thinks <lb/>
            that not even Thucydides and Xenophon are of any use to the <note type="footnote"> * Convertere.] By this word may be signified the figure anastrophe, <lb/>

            orator, though he allows that the one sounds the trumpet of <lb/>
            war, and that the muses spoke by the mouth of the other. In <lb/>
            digressions, however, we may at times adopt the polished <lb/>
            elegance of history, provided we remember that in the parts of <lb/>
            our speech on which the question depends, there is need, not <lb/>
            of the showy muscles of the athlete, but of the nervous arms <lb/>
            of the soldier ;* and that the variegated robe which Demetrius <lb/>
            Phalereus is said to have worn t is not adapted to the dust of <lb/>
            the forum. 34. There is also, indeed, another advantage to <lb/>
            be gained from history, and an advantage of the greatest value, <lb/>
            though of no concern with the present part of my subject; I <lb/>
            mean that which is to be derived from the knowledge of facts <lb/>
            and precedents, with which the orator ought to be extremely <lb/>
            well acquainted, that he may not have to seek all his arguments <lb/>
            from the parties going to law, but may avail himself of many <lb/>
            drawn from an accurate knowledge of antiquity; arguments <lb/>
            the more weighty, as they alone are exempt from the charges <lb/>
            of prejudice and partiality.</p>
          <p>35. That we have to derive much from the study of the <lb/>
            philosophers, has been occasioned by another fault t .n <lb/>
            orators, who have given up to them the better part of <lb/>
            their duty; for the philosophers speak copiously of what is <lb/>
            just, and honourable, and useful, of what is of a contrary <lb/>
            nature, and of divine subjects, and reason upon all these topics <lb/>
            with the utmost acuteness; and the followers of Socrates <lb/>
            excellently qualify the future orator for debates and examina­ <lb/>
            tions of witnesses. 36. But in studying these writers, too, we <lb/>
            must use similar judgment; and, though we may have to <lb/>
            speak on the same subjects with them, we must bear in mind <lb/>
            that the same manner is not suited for lawsuits as for philo­ <lb/>
            sophical disputations, for the forum as for the lecture-room, <lb/>
            for exercises on rules as for actual trials.</p>

            advantage in reading, most of my friends will expect me to <lb/>
            insert in my work some remarks on the authors that ought to <lb/>
            be read, and the peculiar excellence of each. But to go <lb/>
            through authors one by one, would be an endless task. 38. <lb/>
            For when Cicero, in his Brutus, employs so many thousands of <lb/>
            lines in speaking of the Roman orators only, and yet observes <lb/>
            silence concerning all of his own age, among whom he lived, <lb/>
            except Caesar and Marcellus, what limit would there be to my <lb/>
            task, if I should undertake to review not only all those, but <lb/>
            those who succeeded them, and all the Greek philosophers and <lb/>
            poets ?* 39. That brevity, therefore, would be safest for me <lb/>
            to observe, which is adopted by Livy in a letter addressed to <lb/>
            his son, † that Demosthenes and Cicero should first be read, and <lb/>
            afterwards every writer according as he most resembles Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes and Cicero. 40. Yet the conclusions to which my <lb/>
            judgment has led me must not be withheld. I think that <lb/>
            among all the authors who have stood the test of time, few, or, <lb/>
            indeed, scarcely a single one, can be found, who would not <lb/>
            contribute some profit to such as read them with judgment; <lb/>
            for Cicero himself acknowledges that he was greatly benefited <lb/>
            by even the most ancient writers, who had plenty of ability, <lb/>
            though they were destitute of art. 41. Nor do I entertain a very <lb/>
            different opinion with regard to the moderns; for how few can <lb/>
            be found so utterly devoid of sense, as not to hope, from some <lb/>
            small confidence in at least some part of their work, to secure <lb/>
            a hold on the memory of posterity? If there be any such <lb/>
            writer, he will be detected in his very first lines, and will <lb/>
            release us too soon for the trial of his work to cost us any <lb/>
            great waste of time. 42. But it is not everything in an <lb/>
            author that relates to any department of knowledge whatever, <lb/>
            that is adapted to produce the copiousness of diction of which <lb/>
            we are speaking.</p>
          <p>Before I proceed, however, to speak of authors individually, <lb/>
            a few general remarks must be premised in regard to the <lb/>
            diversity of opinions concerning them. 43. Some think that <lb/>
            the ancients only deserve to be read, and imagine that in no <lb/>
            others is to be found natural eloquence and manly force. On <lb/>
            the contrary, the floridness and affectation of the moderns, <note type="footnote"> * I have inserted the words " and poets," profiting by the suggestion <lb/>
            of Spalding, who saw that et poetas is needed in the text after philoso­ <lb/>

            <pb n="256"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            and all the blandishments intended to charm the ear of the <lb/>
            ignorant multitude, delight others. 44. Even of those, again, <lb/>
            who would adopt a right sort of style, some think that no lan­ <lb/>
            guage but such as is concise and simple, and departs as little <lb/>
            as possible from common conversation, is sound and truly <lb/>
            Attic; while more sublime efforts of genius, more animated, <lb/>
            more full of lofty conceptions, attract others; and there are <lb/>
            also not a few lovers of a quiet, neat, and subdued style. Con­ <lb/>
            cerning such differences in taste I shall speak more at large, <lb/>
            when I come to consider the species of style most proper for <lb/>
            the orator.* 45. In the meantime, I shall briefly touch on the <lb/>
            advantages which those may derive from reading who wish <lb/>
            to increase their facility in speaking,! and show by what kind <lb/>
            of reading they may be most benefited; for I intend to select for <lb/>
            notice a few of the authors who are most distinguished; and it <lb/>
            will be easy for the studious to judge who are most similar to <lb/>
            them. This I mention, lest any one should complain that <lb/>
            writers, whom he himself highly approves, have been omitted; <lb/>
            for I admit that more ought to be read than those whom I <lb/>
            shall here specify.</p>
          <p>But I shall now merely go through the various sorts of <lb/>
            reading which I consider peculiarly suitable for those who aim <lb/>
            at becoming orators.</p>
          <p>46. As Aratus, then, thinks that we ought to begin with <lb/>
            Jupiter, so I think that I shall very properly commence with <lb/>
            HOMER; for, as he says that the might of rivers and the courses <lb/>
            of springs take their rise from the ocean, § so has he himself <lb/>
            given a model and an origin for every species of eloquence. <lb/>
            No man has excelled him in sublimity on great subjects, no <lb/>
            man in propriety on small ones. He is at once copious and <lb/>
            concise, pleasing and forcible ; admirable at one time for exube­ <lb/>
            rance, and at another for brevity; eminent not only for poetic, <lb/>
            but for oratorical excellence. 47. To say nothing of his <lb/>
            laudatory, exhortatory, and consolatory speeches, does not <lb/>
            the ninth book of the Iliad, in which the deputation sent to <lb/>
            Achilles is comprised, or the contention between the chiefs in <note type="footnote"> * See x:i. 10, 63—70. </note><note type="footnote"> t Facultatem dicendi.] A reference to sect. 1 may perhaps induce <lb/>

            the first book, or the opinions delivered in the second, display <lb/>
            all the arts of legal pleadings and of councils? 48. As to <lb/>
            the feelings, as well the gentle as the more impetuous, there <lb/>
            is no one so unlearned as not to acknowledge that he had <lb/>
            them wholly under his control. Has he not, at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement * of both his works, I will not say observed, but <lb/>
            established, the laws of oratorical exordia? for be renders <lb/>
            his reader well-affected towards him by an invocation of the <lb/>
            goddesses who have been supposed to preside over poets ; he <lb/>
            makes him attentive by setting forth the grandeur of his sub­ <lb/>
            jects, and desirous of information by giving a brief and com­ <lb/>
            prehensive view of them. 49. Who can state facts more con­ <lb/>
            cisely than he who relates the death of Patroclus,† or more <lb/>
            forcibly thon he who describes the combat of the Curetes and <lb/>
            Ætolians ?‡ As to similes, amplifications, illustrations, <lb/>
            digressions, indications and proofs of things, and all other <lb/>
            modes of establishment and refutation, examples of them are <lb/>
            so numerous in him, that even most of those who have written <lb/>
            on the rules of rhetoric produce from him illustrations of their <lb/>
            precepts. 50. What peroration of a speech will ever be <lb/>
            thought equal to the entreaties of Priam beseeching Achilles <lb/>
            for the body of his son ?§ Does he not, indeed, in words, <lb/>
            thoughts, figures, and the arrangement of his whole work, <lb/>
            exceed the ordinary bounds of human genius ? So much, in­ <lb/>
            deed, that it requires a great man even to follow his excel­ <lb/>
            lences, not with rivalry, (for rivalry is -impossible,) but with a <lb/>
            just conception of them, 51. But he has doubtless left all <lb/>
            authors, in every kind of eloquence, far behind him, but the <lb/>
            epic poets most remarkably, as, in similar subjects, the com­ <lb/>
            parison is most striking.</p>
          <p>52. As for HESIOD, he rarely rises above the general level, <lb/>
            and a great part of his poetry is occupied with mere names, <lb/>
            yet his sententious manner is useful in delivering precepts, and <lb/>
            the easy flow of his words and style merits approbation ; and <lb/>
            in that middle kind of writing the palm is allowed to be his.</p>
          <p>53. In ANTIMACHUS,|| on the other hand, there is energy <note type="footnote"> * I read in ingressu with Gesner, instead of Spalding's ingressus, as <lb/>
            suiting better with the drift of the passage. </note><note type="footnote"> t IL xviii. 20. </note><note type="footnote">‡ II. ix. 530. </note><note type="footnote">§ II. xxiv. 486 </note><note type="footnote"> || His chief work was the Thebais, a poem on the expedition of the <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            and force, and his manner of expression, which is by no <lb/>
            means common, has great merit. But although the unanimous <lb/>
            consent of critics assigns him the second place,* he is so defi­ <lb/>
            cient in power over the feelings, in ability to please, in the <lb/>
            arrangement of his matter, and in every requisite of the poetic <lb/>
            art, that he affords us a convincing proof how different a thing <lb/>
            it is to be near to another writer, and to be second to him.</p>
          <p>54. PANYASIS t they consider as compounded of both,‡ as <lb/>
            far as his style is concerned, but as reaching, on the whole, the <lb/>
            excellences of neither; yet they allow that the one is sur­ <lb/>
            passed by him in the nature of his materials, and the other in <lb/>
            the arrangement of them.</p>
          <p>APOLLONIUS § is not included in the catalogue given by <lb/>
            the critics, since Aristarchus and Aristophanes, those great <lb/>
            judges of the poets, inserted no one of their own age in their <lb/>
            list; yet he produced a work, in a style of evenly sustained <lb/>
            mediocrity, which is by no means to be despised.</p>
          <p>55. ARATUS'S subject is destitute of animation, as there is <lb/>
            in it no variety, no action on the feelings, no portraiture of <lb/>
            character, no speech from any person. But he is equal to the <lb/>
            work to which he thought himself equal.</p>
          <p>THEOCRITUS is admirable in his peculiar style, but his rustic <lb/>
            and pastoral muse shrinks not only from appearing in the <lb/>
            forum, but even from approaching the city.</p>
          <p>56. I seem to hear my readers collecting together from all <lb/>
            sides the names of a vast number of poets. What, they say, <lb/>
            has not PISANDER || sung, with great effect, the achievements <lb/>
            of Hercules? Have Macer ¶ and Virgil** without reason imi­ <note type="footnote"> * Next to Homer. Proximus, Bed longo proximus internallo. </note><note type="footnote"> + A native of Halicarnassus, and relative of Herodotus. He wrote <lb/>

            I would ask whether any part of the remains of that poem can fairly <lb/>
            be pointed out as having been imitated by Virgil. Macrobius, in his </note> <pb n="259"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            tated NICANDER? Shall we pass over EUPHORION,* when, if <lb/>
            Virgil had not admired him, he would certainly never have <lb/>
            made mention, in his Bucolics,† of poems composed in Chal­ <lb/>
            cidian verse? Does Horace,‡ without reason, name TYRTÆUS <lb/>
            next to Homer? 57. No one assuredly, is so void of all <lb/>
            knowledge of those authors, that he might not transfer into <lb/>
            his book a catalogue of them taken from some library. Nor <lb/>
            am I, for my part, ignorant of the writers whom I omit, and, <lb/>
            certainly, I do not condemn them as worthless, having already <lb/>
            said that there is some good in all of them. 58. But we shall <lb/>
            return to them when our strength is matured and confirmed ; <lb/>
            as it often happens to us at great banquets, that after we have <lb/>
            satisfied ourselves with the best dishes, the variety of plainer <lb/>
            food is still agreeable to us. Then we shall have time, too, to take <lb/>
            in hand the elegiac poets, of whom CALLIMACHUS is considered <lb/>
            as the chief; while PHILETAS,§ in the opinion of most critics, <lb/>
            has made good his claim to the second place, 59. But while <lb/>
            we are acquiring that efficient readiness, as I termed it,|| we <lb/>
            must devote ourselves to the perusal of the best authors ; and <lb/>
            the character of our mind must be formed, and a complexion <lb/>
            given to our oratory, by much reading in good writers, rather <lb/>
            than by reading many.</p>
          <p>Of the three If writers of Iambics, then, sanctioned by the <lb/>
            judgment of Aristarchus, ARCHILOCHUS only will have any <lb/>
            great influence in assisting us to attain facility of style. 60. <lb/>
            There is in him the utmost vigour of language, thoughts <lb/>
            forcible, concise, and lively, and abundance of life and energy ; <lb/>
            insomuch that some think it owing to his subjects, not to his <lb/>
            genius, that he is inferior to any writer whatever.</p>
          <p>61. But of the nine.. Lyric poets, PINDAR is by far the <note type="footnote"> Saturnalia, does not mention Meander among the authors to whom <lb/>
            Virgil was at all indebted. But wherever critics have admitted that <lb/>
            Virgil followed Nicander, it always appears that the Theriaca was the <lb/>
            object of his imitation. See Heyne's Proem to Virgil's Georgia. <lb/>

            figures, and a most happy exuberance of matter and words, <lb/>
            spreading forth as it were in a flood of eloquence ; on account <lb/>
            of all which qualities Horace * justly thinks him inimitable.</p>
          <p>62. As to STESICHORUS, the very subjects that he has <lb/>
            chosen show how powerful he is in genius, when he sings of <lb/>
            the greatest wars and most illustrious leaders, and supports on <lb/>
            his lyre all the weight of the epic song ; for he assigns to his <lb/>
            characters due dignity in acting and speaking; and if he had <lb/>
            kept a just control over himself, he seems likely to have <lb/>
            proved Homer's nearest rival; but he is redundant and over­ <lb/>
            flowing ; a fault, however, which, though deserving of censure, <lb/>
            is yet that of an exuberant genius.</p>
          <p>63. ALCÆUS is deservedly complimented with a golden <lb/>
            quill t for that part of his works in which he inveighs against <lb/>
            tyrants, and contributes much to the improvement of morals. In <lb/>
            his language, also, he is concise, magnificent, and careful, and <lb/>
            in many passages resembles Homer; but he descends to <lb/>
            sportive and amorous subjects, though better qualified for those <lb/>
            of a higher nature.</p>
          <p>64. SIMONIDES, though in other respects of no very high <lb/>
            genius,‡ may be commended for a propriety of language, and <lb/>
            a pleasing kind of sweetness; but his chief excellence is in <lb/>
            exciting pity, so that some prefer him, in that particular, to <lb/>
            all other writers of the kind.</p>
          <p>65 The old comedy retains, almost alone, the pure grace <lb/>
            of Attic diction, and the charm of a most eloquent freedom of <lb/>
            language ; and though it is chiefly employed in attacking <lb/>
            follies, yet it has great force in other departments; for it is <lb/>
            sublime, elegant, and graceful; and I know not whether any <lb/>
            poetry, next to Homer's, (whom it is always right to except, as <unclear/> <lb/>
            e himself excepts Achilles,§) has either a greater resemblance <lb/>
            .o oratory, or is better adapted for forming orators. 66. The <note type="footnote"> * Od. iv. 2. </note><note type="footnote">t Aureo Ple.ctro. Hor. Od. ii. 13, 26. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Tenuis alioqui.] I know not who, besides Quintilian, has pro­ <lb/>
            nounced such a judgment on Simonides. Spalding. The opinion of <lb/>
            Dionysius Halicarnassensis, however, is not very different. He is said <lb/>
            to have excelled Pindar and AEschylus in exciting tender feelings. </note><note type="footnote"> § Il. ii. 674 :— <lb/>

            authors of it are numerous; but ARISTOPHANES, EUPOLIS, and <lb/>
            CRATINUS, are the principal.</p>
          <p>Tragedy ÆSCHYLUS first brought before the world, an author <lb/>
            of great sublimity and power, and grandiloquent even to a <lb/>
            fault, but in many parts rough and unpolished; for which <lb/>
            reason the Athenians permitted the poets who succeeded him <lb/>
            to exhibit his plays, when corrected, in competition for the <lb/>
            prize; and by that means many obtained the crown. 67. But <lb/>
            SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES throw a brighter lustre on that kind <lb/>
            of composition; concerning whom, as their styles are different, <lb/>
            it is a question among many which is the better poet. This <lb/>
            point, since it has no relation to my present subject, I shall, <lb/>
            for my own part, leave undecided. 68. But every one must <lb/>
            acknowledge that for those who are preparing themselves for <lb/>
            pleading, Euripides will be by far the more serviceable; for, <lb/>
            in his style, (which those to whom the gravity, and dig­ <lb/>
            nified step, and lofty tone of Sophocles, appear to have an air <lb/>
            of greater sublimity, think proper to censure,) he approaches <lb/>
            nearer to the language of oratory; he abounds with fine <lb/>
            thoughts; in precepts of morality, such as have been delivered <lb/>
            by the philosophers, he is almost equal to the philosophers <lb/>
            themselves; in addresses and replies he is comparable to any <lb/>
            of those who have been distinguished as eloquent speakers in <lb/>
            the forum; and in touching every kind of feeling he has <lb/>
            remarkable power, but in exciting that of pity holds undis­ <lb/>
            puted pre-eminence.</p>
          <p>69. MENANDER, as be himself often testifies, admired Euri­ <lb/>
            pides greatly, and even imitated him, though in a different <lb/>
            department of the drama; and Menander alone, in my judg­ <lb/>
            ment, would, if diligently read, suffice to generate all those <lb/>
            qualities in the student of oratory for which I am an advocate ; <lb/>
            so exactly does he represent all the phases of human life; <lb/>
            such is his fertility of invention, and easy grace of expression; <lb/>
            and so readily does he adapt himself to all circumstances, <lb/>
            persons, and feelings. 70. Nor are those, assuredly, destitute <lb/>
            of penetration, who think that the orations which are cir­ <lb/>
            culated under the name of Charisius,* were written by <lb/>
            Menander. But to me he seems to prove himself a far <note type="footnote"> * See Cicero Brut. c. 83. Some fragments of his speeches are pre­ <lb/>
            served by Rutilius Lupus. He was contemporary with Demetrius <lb/>
            Phalereus. </note> <pb n="262"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            greater orator in his own province, unless it be said that <lb/>
            those trials,* which the Epitrepontes, the Epicleron, and the <lb/>
            Locrians contain, are absurd, and that the speeches t in the <lb/>
            Psophodees, the Nomothetes, and the Hypobolimæus,‡ are not <lb/>
            finished off with all the perfections of oratory. 71. But I <lb/>
            think that to declaimers he may contribute still greater ser­ <lb/>
            vice, since it is necessary for them according to the nature of <lb/>
            the cases which they attempt, to assume various characters,§ <lb/>
            as those of fathers, sons, soldiers, countrymen, rich and poor <lb/>
            men, of persons angry and persons beseeching, of persons of <lb/>
            mild and persons of savage dispositions; in all which charac <lb/>
            ters propriety is wonderfully observed by Menander, who <lb/>
            indeed has left other authors in that species of writing <lb/>
            scarcely a name, having, by the splendour of his reputation, <lb/>
            thrown over them a veil of darkness. 72. Other comic writers, <lb/>
            however, if they be read with indulgence, have some good <lb/>
            passages that we may select, and especially PHILEMON, who, <lb/>
            preferred as he frequently was to Menander by the bad taste <lb/>
            of his age, deserves in the opinion of all critics to be regarded <lb/>
            as second to him.</p>
          <p>73. History many have written with eminent reputation; <lb/>
            but nobody doubts that two writers of it are greatly to be <lb/>
            preferred to all others; two whose opposite excellences have <lb/>
            gained nearly equal praise. THUCYDIDES is pithy, concise, <lb/>
            and ever hastening forward; HERODOTUS is pleasing, clear,|| <lb/>
            and diffuse ; the one excels in the expression of animated, <lb/>
            the other in that of milder sentiments; the one in speeches, <lb/>
            the other in narrative; the one in force, the other in agree­ <lb/>
            ableness.</p>
          <p>74. Next to these stands THEOPOMPUS, who, inferior to <lb/>
            them as an historian, yet bears more resemblance to the <note type="footnote"> *Nisi forte aut illa mala judicia.] That is, as Spalding interprets, <lb/>
            AMisi illa judicia sunt mala. </note><note type="footnote">t Meditationes.] That is <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελέται</foreign>, formal speeches, on matters not <lb/>

            orator, since, before he was induced. to apply to historical <lb/>
            composition, he had been for some time a public speaker. <lb/>
            PHILISTUS, too, deserves to be distinguished from the crowd <lb/>
            of good authors next to these; he is an imitator of Thucydides <lb/>
            and, though much less forcible, is somewhat more perspicuous. <lb/>
            EPHORUS, as Isocrates thought, needed tho spur.† The <lb/>
            ability of CLITARCHUS ‡ is admired, but his veracity is im­ <lb/>
            peached. 75. TIMAGENES,§ born a long time afterwards, deserves <lb/>
            commendation at least on this account, that he revived with <lb/>
            fresh lustre the pursuit of writing history which had begun to <lb/>
            be neglected. XENOPHON I have not forgotten, but he is to <lb/>
            be noticed among the philosophers.</p>
          <p>76. A numerous band of orators follows, since one age pro­ <lb/>
            duced ten living at the same time at Athens; of whom <lb/>
            Demostbenes was by far the most eminent, and has been <lb/>
            almost the sole model for oratory; such is his energy, so com­ <lb/>
            pact is his whole language, so tense, as it were, with nerves, <lb/>
            so free from anything superfluous; and such the general <lb/>
            character of his eloquence, that we can neither find anything <lb/>
            wanting in it, nor anything superfluous. 77. ÆSCHINES is <lb/>
            more copious and diffuse in style, and, as being less confined <lb/>
            in scope, has more appearance of magnitude, but he has only <lb/>
            more flesh and less muscle. HYPERIDES is extremely agree­ <lb/>
            able and acute, but better qualified, not to say more service­ <lb/>
            able, for causes of minor importance. || 78. LYSIAS, an orator that <lb/>
            preceded these in time, is refined and elegant, and, if it be <lb/>
            enough for an orator to inform his hearers, we need not seek <lb/>
            anything more excellent than he is; for there is nothing <lb/>
            unmeaning, nothing far-fetched, in his sentences; but he is <lb/>
            more like a clear spring than a great river. 79. ISOCRATES, <lb/>
            in a different style of oratory, is neat and polished, but better <note type="footnote"> * By his master Isocrates. See Cicero de Oral. ii. 13. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t II. 8, 11. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ He accompanied Alexander the Great, and wrote a history of his <lb/>
            exploits. See Cicero, Brut. c. 11. Longinus, c. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> § See note on i 10, 10. </note><note type="footnote"> || Who else, says Spalding, has plainly expressed such an opinion <lb/>
            respecting the talents of Hyperides, I do not know. Spalding allows, <lb/>
            however, that what is said of him by Dionysius Halicamassensis (De <lb/>
            Vett. Script. Cens. vol. v. p. 434, ed. Reisk.), by Longinus, c. 34, and <lb/>
            other writers, tends to show that he was much of the same character <lb/>
            as Quintilian thinks him. </note> <pb n="264"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            fitted for the fencing-school than for actual combat; he <lb/>
            assiduously courts every beauty of diction; and not without <lb/>
            reason, for he had qualified himself for lecture-rooms, and not <lb/>
            for courts of justice; he is ready in invention, and constantly <lb/>
            aiming at embellishment; and so careful in composition that <lb/>
            his care is even censured.</p>
          <p>80. I do not consider that these are the only, but the chief <lb/>
            excellences, in those authors of whom I have spoken; nor do <lb/>
            I think the others, whom I have omitted to name, had not a <lb/>
            high degree of merit. I even admit that the famous DEME­ <lb/>
            TRIUS PHALEREUS, though he is said to have been the first to <lb/>
            cause the decline of eloquence,* had much talent and com­ <lb/>
            mand of language; and he deserves to be remembered, if for <lb/>
            no other reason than that he was almost the last of the <lb/>
            Athenians that could be called an orator. Cicero,! however, <lb/>
            prefers him to all other orators in the middle kind of elo­ <lb/>
            quence.</p>
          <p>81. Of the Philosophers, from whom Cicero acknowledges <lb/>
            that he derived a large portion of his eloquence,‡ who can <lb/>
            doubt that PLATO is the chief, as well in acuteness of reasoning, <lb/>
            as in a certain divine and Homer-like power of language ? <lb/>
            For he rises far above ordinary prose, and what the Greeks <lb/>
            call oratio pedestris,§ so that he appears to me to be animated, <lb/>
            not with mere human genius, but with the inspiration as it <lb/>
            were of the Delphic oracle. 82. Why need I dwell on the sweet­ <lb/>
            ness of XENOPHON, sweetness which is unaffected, but which <lb/>
            no affectation could attain ? so that even the Graces them­ <lb/>
            selves are said to have formed his style, and the testimony of <lb/>
            the Old Comedy concerning Pericles may justly be applied to <lb/>
            him, that the goddess of persuasion was seated on his lips. || <note type="footnote"> * He was the first, says Cicero, Brut. c. 9, who relaxed the force of <lb/>
            eloquence, and gave her a soft and tender air. </note><note type="footnote"> t Quintilian refers, I think, to Orat. c. 27, as Almeloveen has <lb/>

            83. Why need I expatiate on the elegance of the rest of the <lb/>
            Socratic school ? Why need I speak of the merits of ARISTO­ <lb/>
            TLE, of whom I am in doubt whether I should deem him more <lb/>
            admirable for his knowledge of things, for the multitude of <lb/>
            his writings, for the agreeableness of his language, the pene­ <lb/>
            tration shown in his discoveries, or the variety exhibited in <lb/>
            his works? As to THEOPHRASTUS, there is such a divine <lb/>
            beauty in his language, that he may be said even to have <lb/>
            derived his name from it.. 84. The old STOICS indulged but <lb/>
            little in eloquence, but they recommended what was virtuous, <lb/>
            and had great power in reasoning, and in enforcing what they <lb/>
            taught. They were rather, however, acute in discussing their <lb/>
            subjects than lofty in their style, an excellence at which they <lb/>
            certainly did not aim.</p>
          <p>85. The same order I intend to observe, also, in proceeding <lb/>
            through the Roman authors.</p>
          <p>As Homer, accordingly, among the Greeks, so VIRGIL among <lb/>
            our own countrymen, presents the most auspicious commence­ <lb/>
            ment ; an author who of all poets of that class, Greek or <lb/>
            Roman, approaches doubtless nearest to Homer. 86. 1 will <lb/>
            here repeat the very words which, when I was a young <lb/>
            man, I heard from Domitius Afer, who, when I asked him <lb/>
            what poet he thought came nearest to Homer, replied, Virgil <lb/>
            is second to him, but nearer the first than the third. <lb/>
            Indeed, though we must give place to the divine and immortal <lb/>
            genius of Homer, yet in Virgil there is more care and exact­ <lb/>
            ness, for the very reason that he was obliged to take more <lb/>
            pains; and for what we lose in the higher qualities we perhaps <lb/>
            compensate in equability of excellence.</p>
          <p>87. All our other poets will follow at a great distance. <lb/>
            MACER t and LUCRETIUS should be read indeed, but not in <lb/>
            order to form such a style as constitutes the fabric of eloquence ; <lb/>
            each is an elegant writer on his own subject, but the one is <lb/>
            tame, and the other difficult.‡ VARRO ATACINUS, in those <note type="footnote"> * It is said that his original name was Tyrtamus, and that Aristotie <lb/>
            changed it to Theophrastus, which signifies “possessed of divine <lb/>
            eloquence." See Diog. Laert. v. </note><note type="footnote"> t See vi. 3, 96. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Difficilis.] The commentators hardly know what to understand by <lb/>
            this word. Burmann, referring to i. 4, 4, supposes that the allusion is <lb/>
            to the abstruse nature of Lucretius's subject, just as Ovid, with refer­ <lb/>
            once to his subject, calls him subliumis, Amor. i. 15, 23. Macer also, </note> <pb n="266"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            writings in which he has gained a name, as the interpreter of <lb/>
            another man's work,* is not indeed to be despised, but is not <lb/>
            rich enough in diction to increase the power of the orator. 88. <lb/>
            ENNIUS we may venerate, as we venerate groves sacred from <lb/>
            their antiquity; groves in which gigantic and aged oaks affect <lb/>
            us not so much by their beauty, as by the religious awe with <lb/>
            which they inspire us.</p>
          <p>There are other poets nearer to our own times, and better <lb/>
            suited to promote the object of which we are speaking. OVID <lb/>
            allows his imagination to wanton,† even in his heroic verse, <lb/>
            and is too much a lover of his own conceits, but deserves <lb/>
            praise in certain passages. 89. CORNELIUS SEVERUS,‡ though <lb/>
            a better versifier than poet, yet if he had finished his "Sicilian <lb/>
            War," as has been observed, in the manner of his first book, <lb/>
            would justly have claimed the second place in epic poetry.§ <lb/>
            But an immature death prevented his powers || from being <lb/>
            brought to perfection; yet his youthful compositions display <lb/>
            very great ability, and a devotion to a judicious mode of <lb/>
            writing which was wonderful, especially at such an age. <lb/>
            90. In VALERIUS FLACCUS we have lately had a great loss. The <lb/>
            genius of SALEIUS BASSUS ¶ was ardent, and highly poetical, <lb/>
            and had not reached maturity even in his old age. RABI­ <lb/>
            RIUS** and PEDO †† are not unworthy of the orator's acquaint­ <note type="footnote">says Spalding, is called humilis, "tame," from the character of his <lb/>
            subject, which was the qualities of herbs. </note> <note type="footnote"> * See i. 5, 18. The interpretation to which Quintilian alludes was a <lb/>

            as Mark Antony was one of his characters; see Sen. Benef. vi. 3. A <lb/>
            fragment of a poem found at Herculaneum has been supposed <lb/>
            to be a part of that of Rabirius. See Smith's Diet. of Biog. and <lb/>

            ance, if he has time to read them. LUCAN is fiery and <lb/>
            spirited, and sublime in sentiment, and, to say what I think, <lb/>
            deserving to be numbered rather with orators than poets.</p>
          <p>91. These authors we have named, since the government <lb/>
            of the world has diverted Germanicus Augustus * from the <lb/>
            studies which he had commenced, and it did not seem sum­ <lb/>
            cient to the gods that he should be the greatest of poets.† <lb/>
            Yet what can be more sublime, more learned, more excellent <lb/>
            in all respects, than the works on which he had entered in his <lb/>
            youth, when he gave up his military command ?‡ Who <lb/>
            could sing of wars more ably than he who so ably conducts <lb/>
            them? To whom would the goddesses that preside over <lb/>
            liberal studies listen more propitiously? To whom would <lb/>
            Minerva, his familiar deity, more willingly communicate her <lb/>
            accomplishments? 92. Future ages will speak of these <lb/>
            matters more fully; for at present the merit of the poet is <lb/>
            obscured by the dazzling brightness of other great qualities <lb/>
            Yet you will bear with us, Cæsar, if, while we are celebrating <lb/>
            the sacred rites of literature, we do not pass over your <lb/>
            genius in silence, but testify, at least by citing a verse from <lb/>
            Virgil, that <note type="footnote"> Epist. ex Pont. iv. 16, and is supposed also to have written a poem in <lb/>
            the epic form on the exploits of Germanicus ; see Sen. Suasor. b. i. </note><note type="footnote"> * It is some time since the commentators saw that there is no <lb/>

            only to all writers in the same kind of composition, but to all <lb/>

            them as much as I do from Horace, who thinks that Lucilius <lb/>
            runs muddy, and that there is always something in him which <lb/>
            you might remove;. for there is in him wonderful learning, <lb/>
            spirit, causticity resulting from it, and an abundance of <lb/>
            wit. HORACE is far more terse and pure in his style, and <lb/>
            eminently happy in remarking on the characters of mankind. <lb/>

            among the Romans, as his peculiar province,* though it has <lb/>
            been interspersed with some other kinds of verse; its bitterness <lb/>
            is to be seen in CÀTULLUS, BIBACULUS,t and HORACE, though <lb/>
            in Horace the epode ‡ is found introduced between the iambics</p>
          <p>Of our Lyric poets HORACE is almost the only one that <lb/>
            deserves to be read; for he soars occasionally, is full of agree­ <lb/>
            ableness and grace, and shows a most happy daring in certain <lb/>
            figures and expressions. If the student should wish to add <lb/>
            any other, there is GÆSIUS BASSUS,§ whom we lately saw among <lb/>
            us; but the genius of some that are living far excels his.</p>
          <p>97. The writers of Tragedy most celebrated, among the <lb/>
            ancients, for their force of thought, weight of language, and <lb/>
            the dignity of their personages, are Accius and PACUVIUS; <lb/>
            neatness and finish in the polishing of their works seems to <lb/>
            have been wanting in them rather through the fault of their <lb/>
            age than through their own. To Accius, however, is attri­ <lb/>
            buted the greater share of energy; those who affect to be <lb/>
            learned themselves, would have Pacuvius thought the more <lb/>
            learned of the two. 98. The Thyestes of VARIUS is comparable <lb/>
            to any of the Greek tragedies. OVID'S Medea || appears to me <lb/>
            to show how much that great man could have done, if he had <lb/>
            been willing to control rather than indulge his genius. ¶Of <lb/>
            those whom I have myself seen, POMPONIUS SECUNDUS** is <lb/>

            the writings of TERENCE have been ascribed to Scipio Africa­ <lb/>
            nus; and Terence's writings are indeed extremely elegant in <lb/>
            their kind ; yet they would have had still more gracefulness if <lb/>
            they had been strictly confined to trimeter iambic verse. 100. <lb/>
            We scarcely attain a faint image of the Greek comedy, so that <lb/>
            the Latin language itself seems to me not susceptible of that <lb/>
            beauty which has hitherto been granted to the Attics only, <lb/>
            since not even the Greeks themselves have attained it in any <lb/>
            other dialect of their language. AFRANIUS excels in comedies <lb/>
            purely Latin; and I wish that he had not polluted his plays <lb/>
            with offensive amours, betraying his own character.</p>
          <p>101. In history, however, I cannot allow superiority to the <lb/>
            Greeks ; I should neither fear to match SALLUST against Thu <lb/>
            cydides, nor should Herodotus feel indignant if LIVY is thought <lb/>
            equal to him, an author of wonderful agreeableness, and re­ <lb/>
            markable perspicuity,! in his narrative, and eloquent beyond <lb/>
            expression in his speeches, so admirably is all that is said in <lb/>
            his pages adapted to particular circumstances and characters; <lb/>
            and as to the feelings, especially those of the softer kind, no <lb/>
            historian, to speak but with mere justice, has succeeded better in <lb/>
            describing them. 102. Hence, by his varied excellences, he has <lb/>

            composition he is everywhere deserving of praise, but falls in <lb/>
            some parts below his own powers. 104. But there still sur­ <lb/>

            freedom of his writings, though some of his expressions have <lb/>
            been pruned, has been injurious to him. Even in what re­ <lb/>
            mains, however, we may see his lofty spirit and boldness of <lb/>
            thought. There are also other good writers; but we touch <lb/>
            only on particular departments of composition, and do not <lb/>
            review whole libraries.</p>
          <p>105. But our orators may, above all, set the Latin elo­ <lb/>
            quence on an equality with that of Greece; for I would confi­ <lb/>
            dently match Cicero against any one of the Greek orators. <lb/>
            Nor am I unaware how great an opposition I am raising <lb/>
            against myself,§ especially when it is no part of my design at <lb/>
            present to compare him with Demosthenes, for it is not at all <lb/>
            necessary, since I think that Demosthenes ought to be read <lb/>
            above all other orators, or rather learned by heart. 106. Of <lb/>
            their great excellences I consider that most are similar; their <lb/>
            method, their order of partition, their manner of preparing the <lb/>
            minds of their audience, their mode of proof, and, in a word, <lb/>
            everything that depends on invention. In their style or <lb/>
            speaking there is some difference ; Demosthenes is more com­ <note type="footnote"> * Scarcely anything is known of him, and not a fragment of his <lb/>
            work is extant. The elder Pliny wrote a continuation of his history. <lb/>

            Dialogue de Oroloribus. Plutarch, in his comparison of Cicero and <lb/>
            Demosthenes, makes Demosthenes far superior to Cicero. Tuniebus. </note> <pb n="272"/>

            pact, Cicero more verbose; Demosthenes argues more closely,* <lb/>
            Cicero with a wider sweep ; Demosthenes always attacks with <lb/>
            a sharp-pointed weapon, Cicero often with a weapon both <lb/>
            sharp and weighty; from Demosthenes nothing can be taken <lb/>
            away, to Cicero nothing can be added; in the one there is <lb/>
            more study, in the other more nature. ] 07. In wit, certainly, <lb/>
            and pathos, two stimulants of the mind which have great in­ <lb/>
            fluence in oratory, we have the advantage. Perhaps the <lb/>
            custom of his country did not allow Demosthenes pathetic <lb/>
            perorations; but, on the other hand, the different genius of <lb/>
            the Latin tongue did not grant to us those beauties which the <lb/>
            Attics so much admire. In the epistolary style, indeed, though <lb/>
            there are letters written by both, and in that of dialogue,! in <lb/>
            which Demosthenes wrote nothing, there is no comparison. <lb/>
            108. We must yield the superiority, however, on one point, <lb/>
            that Demosthenes lived before Cicero, and made him, in a <lb/>
            great measure, the able orator that he was; for Cicero <lb/>
            appears to me, after he devoted himself wholly to imitate the <lb/>
            Greeks, to have embodied in his style the energy of Demos. <lb/>
            thenes, the copiousness of Plato, and the sweetness of Iso­ <lb/>
            crates. 109. Nor did he, by zealous effort, attain only what <lb/>
            was excellent in each of these, but drew most, or rather all <lb/>
            excellences, from himself, by the felicitous exuberance of his <lb/>
            immortal genius. He does not, as Pindar ‡ says, collect rain <lb/>
            water, but overflows from a living fountain, having been <lb/>
            so endowed at his birth, by the special kindness of Providence, <lb/>
            that in him eloquence might make trial of her whole strength <lb/>
            For who can instruct a judge with more exactness, or excite <lb/>
            him with more vehemence ? What orator had ever so pleasing <lb/>
            a manner ? 110. The very points which he wrests from you by <lb/>
            force, you would think that he gained from you by entreaty ; <lb/>
            and when he carries away the judge by his impetuosity, he yet <lb/>
            does not seem to be hurried along, but imagines that he is <lb/>
            following of his own accord. 111. In all that he says, indeed, <lb/>
            there is so much authority, that we are ashamed to dissent <note type="footnote"> * Concludit astrictuius.] Concludit in syllogismo, i. e. ratiocatur, as <lb/>

            from him; he does not bring to a cause the mere zeal of an <lb/>
            advocate, but the support of a witness or a judge ; and, at the <lb/>
            same time, all these excellences, a single one of which any <lb/>
            other man could scarcely attain with the utmost exertion, flow <lb/>
            from him without effort; aDd that stream of language, than <lb/>
            which nothing is more pleasing to the ear, carries with it the <lb/>
            appearance of the happiest facility. 112. It was not without <lb/>
            justice, therefore, that he was said by his contemporaries to <lb/>
            reign supreme in the courts; and he has gained such esteem <lb/>
            among his posterity, that Cicero is now less the name of a man <lb/>
            than that of eloquence itself. To him, therefore, let us look ; <lb/>
            let him be kept in view as our great example; and let that <lb/>
            student know that he has made some progress to whom Cicero <lb/>
            has become an object of admiration.</p>
          <p>113. In Asinius POLLIO there is much invention, and the <lb/>
            greatest accuracy; so great, indeed, that by some it is re­ <lb/>
            garded as excessive; and there is also sufficient method and <lb/>
            spirit; but he is so far from having the polish or agreeableness <lb/>
            of Cicero, that he may be thought to have preceded him by a <lb/>
            century. Messala, again, is elegant and perspicuous, and gives <lb/>
            proof as it were in his style of the nobleness of his birth, but <lb/>
            is deficient in energy. 114. As for JULIUS CÆSAR, if he had <lb/>
            devoted himself wholly to the forum, no other of our country <lb/>
            men would have been named as a rival to Cicero. There is in <lb/>
            him such force, such perspicuity, such fire, that he evidently <lb/>
            spoke with the same spirit with which he fought. All these <lb/>
            qualities, too, he sets off with a remarkable elegance of diction, <lb/>
            of which he was peculiarly studious. 115. In CÆELIUS * there <lb/>
            is much ability, and much pleasant wit, especially in bringing <lb/>
            an accusation; and he was a man worthy to have had wiser <lb/>
            thoughts and a longer life. I have found some critics that <lb/>
            preferred CALVUS † to all other orators; I have found some who <lb/>
            agreed in opinion with Cicero,‡ that he had, by too severe criticism <lb/>
            on himself, diminished his natural energy; yet his language <lb/>
            is chaste, forcible, correct, and often also spirited. But he is <lb/>

            but not if he intended to take from it. 110. SERVIUS SULPI­ <lb/>
            CIUS,* also, has gained a distinguished reputation, and not un­ <lb/>
            deservedly, by three speeches. CASSIUS SEVERUS,† if he be <lb/>
            read with judgment, will offer us much that is worthy of imi­ <lb/>
            tation, and if, in addition to his other excellences, he had given <lb/>
            colouring and body to his language, he might have been ranked <lb/>
            among the most eminent crators. 117. For there is great <lb/>
            ability in him, and extraordinary power of sarcasm, as well as <lb/>
            abundance of wit; but he allowed more influence to his passion <lb/>
            than to his judgment; and besides, while his jokes are bitter, <lb/>
            their bitterness often becomes ridiculous.‡</p>
          <p>118. There have been also many other eloquent speakers, <lb/>
            whom it would be tedious to particularize. Of those whom <lb/>
            I have seen, DOMTTIUS AFER and JULIUS AFRICANUS were by <lb/>
            far the most eminent. Domitius deserved the preference for <lb/>
            skill, and for his general manner of speaking, and we need not <lb/>
            fear to rank him with the ancient orators. Africanus had <lb/>
            more animation, but was too fastidious in the choice of his <lb/>
            words, tedious, at times, in his phraseology, and too lavish <lb/>
            in the use of metaphors.</p>
          <p>There were also men of ability in recent times. 119. TRA­ <lb/>
            CHALUS § was generally elevated, and sufficiently perspicuous; <lb/>
            and we might have supposed that he aimed at the highest. <lb/>
            excellence; yet he was greater when heard than when read ; <lb/>
            for he had such a fine tone of voice as I never knew in any other <lb/>
            persor, a delivery that would have sufficed for the stage, <lb/>
            gracefil ness of action, and every external advantage even to <lb/>
            excess. VIBIUS CRISPUS || was succinct and agreeable in his <lb/>
            style, and naturally qualified to please; but he was better in <note type="footnote"> * Servius Sulpicius Rufus. One of the speeches to which Quintilian <lb/>

            pleading private than public causes. 120. If longer life had <lb/>
            been granted to JULIUS SECUNDUS* his name as an orator <lb/>
            would doubtless have been highly renowned among posterity; <lb/>
            for he would have added, and was indeed continually adding, <lb/>
            whatever was wanting to his other excellences ; and what he <lb/>
            wanted was, to be more energetic in debate, and to turn his <lb/>
            attention more frequently from his delivery to his matter. <lb/>
            121. But even though cut off prematurely, he claims a high <lb/>
            place for himself; such is his eloquence, such his gracefulness <lb/>
            in expressing whatever he pleased; such is the perspicuity, <lb/>
            smoothness, and attraction of his style; such his felicity in the <lb/>
            use of words, even those that are pressed into his service ; and <lb/>
            such his force of expression in some that he boldly hazarded. <lb/>
            122. But they who shall write of orators after me, will have <lb/>
            ample reason for praising those that are now at the height of <lb/>
            reputation; for there are in the present day men of eminent <lb/>
            ability by whom the forum is highly adorned. Our finished <lb/>
            advocates rival the ancients, and the efforts of our youth, <lb/>
            aiming at the highest excellence, imitate them and follow in <lb/>
            their footsteps.</p>
          <p>123. There remain to be noticed those who have written <lb/>
            on philosophy, in which department Roman literature has as <lb/>
            yet produced but few eloquent writers. Yet CICERO, who <lb/>
            distinguishes himself on all subjects, stands forth in this as <lb/>
            a rival to Plato. But BRUTUS, † a noble writer, and of more <lb/>
            excellence in philosophy than in oratory, has ably supported <lb/>
            the weight of such subjects; for his reader may feel sure that <lb/>
            he says what he thinks. 124. CORNELIUS CELSUS, ‡ too, has <lb/>
            written no small number of works, following in the track of <lb/>
            the Sextii, § and not without grace and elegance. Among the <note type="footnote"> * Nothing more is known of him than is to be gathered from Quin­ <lb/>
            tilian and from the Dialogue de Oratoribus, c. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t The conspirator against Cæsar. He wrote several philosophical <lb/>

            various other subjects. See xii. 11, 24, where Quintilian calls him <lb/>

            generally with little respect for his opinions on rhetorical subjects. </note><note type="footnote"> § " There were two Sextii, Quintus Sextius the father, who refused <lb/>

          <p>125. Of SENECA I have purposely delayed to speak, in <lb/>
            reference to any department of eloquence, on account of a false <lb/>
            report that has been circulated respecting mo, from which I was <lb/>
            supposed to condemn and even to hate him. This happened <lb/>
            to me while I was striving to bring back our style of speaking <lb/>
            which was spoiled and enervated by every kind of fault, to a <lb/>
            more severe standard of taste. 126. At that time Seneca was <lb/>
            almost the only writer in the hands of the young. I was not <lb/>
            desirous, for my own part, to set him aside altogether, but I <lb/>
            could not allow him to be preferred to those better authors <lb/>
            whom he never ceased to attack,‡ since, being conscious that <lb/>
            he had adopted a different style from theirs, he distrusted his <lb/>
            power of pleasing those by whom they were admired. But <lb/>
            his partisans rather admired than succeeded in imitating him, <lb/>
            and fell as far below him as he had fallen below the older <lb/>
            writers. 127. Yet it had been desirable that his followers should <lb/>
            have been equal to him, or at least have made near approaches <lb/>
            to him ; but he attracted them only by his faults, and each <lb/>
            of them set himself to copy in him what he could; and then, <lb/>
            when they began to boast that they wrote like him, they <lb/>
            brought dishonour on his name. 128. Still he had many and <lb/>
            great merits ; a ready and fertile wit, extraordinary applica­ <lb/>
            tion, and extensive knowledge on various subjects, though he <lb/>
            was sometimes deceived by those whom he had employed to <lb/>
            make researches for him. 129. He has written on almost <lb/>
            every department of learning; for there are orations of his, <lb/>
            and poems, and letters, and dialogues, in circulation. In <note type="footnote"> and at the end of the seventh book of the Naturale, Quœstiona.” Nic. <lb/>

            philosophy he was not sufficiently accurate, though an admi­ <lb/>
            rable assailant of vices. There are many bright thoughts in <lb/>
            him, and much that may be read for moral improvement, but <lb/>
            most of his phraseology is in a vitiated taste, and most hurt­ <lb/>
            ful to students for the very reason that it abounds in pleas­ <lb/>
            ing faults. 130. We could wish that he had written from his <lb/>
            own mind, and under the control of another person's judg­ <lb/>
            ment ; for if he had rejected some of his thoughts, if he had not <lb/>
            fixed his affections on small beauties,* if he had not been in <lb/>
            love with everything that he conceived, if he had not weak­ <lb/>
            ened the force of his matter by petty attempts at sententious­ <lb/>
            ness, he would have been honoured with the unanimous <lb/>
            consent of the learned rather than the admiration of boys. <lb/>
            131. Yet, such as he is, he ought to be read by those whose <lb/>
            judgment is matured, and whose minds have been strength­ <lb/>
            ened by a severer manner of writing, if with no other object <lb/>
            than that the reader may exercise his judgment for and <lb/>
            against him; for, as I said, there is much in him worthy of <lb/>
            approval, and much deserving of admiration ; only it must be <lb/>
            our care to choose judiciously, as I wish that he himself had <lb/>
            done, since natural powers that could accomplish whatever <lb/>

          <p>Of imitation ; necessity of it, and remarks upon it. § 1—13. Not <lb/>
            every quality, even in eminent authors, is to be imitated ; necessity <lb/>
            of judgment in the choice of models for imitation, 14 - 21. We <lb/>
            are not to imitate one author only, 22—26. Not to imitate style <lb/>
            only, 27, 28.</p>
          <p>1. FROM these authors, and others worthy to be read, a <lb/>
            stock of words, a variety of figures, and the art of composition, <note type="footnote"> * Si parum non coneupuset..] These words have troubled une com­ <lb/>
            mentators. Gesner and others omit the non ; but, as it occurs in all <lb/>
            the manuscripts, Buttmann justly observes that it must at any rate bo <lb/>
            retained. In explaining the passage, he makes parum equivalent to an <lb/>
            accusative after concupisset, and gives it the signification of id ipsum <lb/>
            quiod non est satis, quod est exile et minutum ; ea quœ minus tenuia et <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            must be acquired; and our minds must be directed to the <lb/>
            imitation of all their excellences; for it cannot be doubted <lb/>
            that a great portion of art consists in imitation, since, though <lb/>
            to invent was first in order of time, and holds the first place <lb/>
            in merit, yet it is of advantage to copy what has been invented <lb/>
            with success. 2. Indeed the whole conduct of life is based on <lb/>
            the desire of doing ourselves that which we approve in others.- <lb/>
            Thus boys follow the traces of letters in order to acquire skill <lb/>
            in writing; thus musicians follow the voice of their teachers, <lb/>
            painters look for models to the works of preceding painters, <lb/>
            and farmers adopt the system of culture approved by experi­ <lb/>
            ence. We see, in short, that the beginnings of every kind of <lb/>
            study are formed in accordance with some prescribed rule. <lb/>
            3. We must, indeed, be either like or unlike those who excel; <lb/>
            and nature rarely forms one like, though imitation does so <lb/>
            frequently. But the very circumstance that renders the study <lb/>
            of all subjects so much more easy to us, than it was to those <lb/>
            who had nothing to imitate, will prove a disadvantage to us, <lb/>
            unless it be turned to account with caution and judgment.</p>
          <p>4. Undoubtedly, then, imitation is not sufficient of itself, if <lb/>
            for no other reason than that it is the mark of an indolent <lb/>
            nature to rest satisfied with what has been invented by others. <lb/>
            For what would have been the case, if, in those times which <lb/>
            were without any models, mankind had thought that they <lb/>
            were not to execute or imagine anything but what they <lb/>
            already knew ? Assuredly nothing would have been invented. <lb/>
            5. Why then is it unlawful for anything to be devised by us <lb/>
            which did not exist before? Were our rude forefathers led, <lb/>
            by the mere natural force of intellect, to the discovery of so <lb/>
            many things, and shall not we be roused to inquiry by the <lb/>
            certain knowledge which we possess that those who sought, <lb/>
            found ? 6. When those who had no master in any subject, <lb/>
            have transmitted so many discoveries to posterity, shall not the <lb/>
            experience which we have in some things assist us to bring to <lb/>
            light others, or shall we have nothing but what we derive from <lb/>
            other men's bounty, as some painters aim at nothing more than <lb/>
            to know how to copy a picture by means of compasses and <lb/>
            lines ?</p>
          <p>7. It is dishonourable even to rest satisfied with simply <note type="footnote"> * We might suppose that this sentence suggested to Adam Smith <lb/>
            his Theory of Moral Sentimenis. </note> <pb n="279"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH II.]"/><lb/>
            equalling what we imitate. For what would have been the <lb/>
            case, again, if -no one had accomplished more than he whom <lb/>
            -he copied ? We should have nothing in poetry superior to <lb/>
            Livius Andronicus, nothing in history better than the <lb/>
            Annals of the Pontiffs; we should still sail on rafts; there <lb/>
            would be no painting but that of tracing the outlines of the <lb/>
            shadow which bodies cast in the sunshine.* 8. If we take <lb/>
            a view of all arts, no one can be found exactly as it was when <lb/>
            it was invented; no one that has confined itself within its <lb/>
            original limits; unless, indeed, we have to convict our own <lb/>
            times, beyond all others, of this unhappy deficiency, and to <lb/>
            consider that now at last nothing improves; for certainly <lb/>
            nothing does improve by imitation only. 9. But if it is not <lb/>
            allowable to add to what has preceded us, how can we ever <lb/>
            hope to see a complete orator, when among those, whom we <lb/>
            have hitherto recognized as the greatest, no one has been <lb/>
            found in whom there is not something defective or censurable ? <lb/>
            .Even those who do not aim at the highest excellence, should <lb/>
            rather try to excel, than merely follow, their predecessors ; <lb/>
            for he who makes it his object to get before another, will <lb/>
            possibly, if he does not go by him, get abreast of him. 10. But <lb/>
            assuredly no one will come up with him in whose steps he <lb/>
            thinks that he must tread, for he who follows another must of <lb/>
            necessity always be behind him. Besides, it is generally <lb/>
            easier to do more, than to do precisely the same ; since exact <lb/>
            likeness is attended with such difficulty that not even nature <lb/>
            herself has succeeded in contriving that the simplest objects, † <lb/>
            and such as may be thought most alike, shall not be distin. <lb/>
            guished by some perceptible difference. 11. Moreover, <lb/>
            everything that is the resemblance of something else, must <lb/>
            necessarily be inferior to that of which it is a copy, as the <lb/>
            shadow to the substance, the portrait to the natural face, and <lb/>
            the acting of the player to the real feeling. The same is the <lb/>
            case with regard to oratorical composition; for in the origi. <lb/>
            nals, which we take for our models, there is nature and real <lb/>
            power, while every imitation, on the contrary, is something <note type="footnote"> * That such delineation was the origin of painting every one asserts <lb/>
            who first practised it. no one tells us. See Pliny, H. N. XXXV. 3 <lb/>

            counterfeit, and seems adapted to an object not its own. <lb/>
            12. Hence it happens that declamations have less spirit and <lb/>
            force than actual pleadings, because in one the subject is real, <lb/>
            in the other fictitious. In addition to all this, whatever <lb/>
            excellences are most remarkable in an orator, are inimitable, <lb/>
            as natural talent, invention, energy, easiness of manner, and <lb/>
            whatever cannot be taught by art. 13. In consequence, many <lb/>
            students, when they have selected certain words, or acquired a <lb/>
            certain rhythm of composition, from any orator's speeches, think <lb/>
            that what they have read is admirably represented in their own <lb/>
            sentences; though words fall into desuetude, or come into use, <lb/>
            according to the fashion of the day, so that the most certain <lb/>
            rule for their use is found in custom, and they are not in <lb/>
            their own nature either good or bad, (for in themselves they <lb/>
            are only sounds,) but just as they are suitably and properly <lb/>
            applied, or otherwise; and when our composition is best <lb/>
            adapted to our subject, it becomes most pleasing from its. <lb/>
            variety.</p>
          <p>14. Everything, therefore, relating to this department of <lb/>
            study, is to be considered with the nicest judgment. First of <lb/>
            all, we must be cautious as to the authors whom we would <lb/>
            imitate, for many have been desirous to resemble the worst <lb/>
            and most faulty originals. In the next place, we must ex­ <lb/>
            amine what there is in the authors whom we have chosen for <lb/>
            models, that we should set ourselves to attain, for even in <lb/>
            great writers there occur faulty passages and blemishes, which <lb/>
            have been censured by the learned in their remarks on one <lb/>
            another; and I wish that our youth would improve in their <lb/>
            oratory by imitating what is good, as much as they are <lb/>
            deteriorated in it by copying what is bad.</p>
          <p>15. Nor let those who have sufficient judgment for avoiding <lb/>
            faults, be satisfied with forming a semblance, a mere cuticle, <lb/>
            if I may so express myself, of excellence, or rather one of <lb/>
            those images of Epicurus,* which he says are perpetually <lb/>
            flying off from the surfaces of bodies. 16. This, however, is <lb/>
            the fate of those who, having no thorough insight into the <lb/>
            merits of a style, adapt their manner, as it were, to the first <lb/>
            aspect of it; and even when their imitation proves most suc­ <lb/>
            cessful, and when they differ but little from their original <lb/>
            author, in language and harmony, they yet never fully attain <lb/>
            to his force or fertility of language, but commonly degenerate <note type="footnote"> * See Lucret. IV. 48. AuL Gell. v. 16. Cic. Ep. ad Div. xv. 16, 19. </note> <pb n="281"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH II.]"/><lb/>
            into something worse, lay hold on such defects as border on <lb/>
            excellences, and become tumid instead of great, weak instead <lb/>
            of concise, rash instead of bold, licentious instead of ex­ <lb/>
            uberant, tripping instead of dignified, careless instead of <lb/>
            simple. 17. Accordingly, those who have produced something <lb/>
            dry and inane, in a rough and inelegant dress, fancy them <lb/>
            selves equal to the ancients; those who reject embellishment <lb/>
            of language or thought, compare themselves, forsooth, to the <lb/>
            Attic writers; those who become obscure by curtailing their <lb/>
            periods, excel Sallust and Thucydides; the dry and jejune rival <lb/>
            Pollio; and the dull and languid, if they but express them­ <lb/>
            selves in a long period, declare that Cicero would have spoken <lb/>
            just like themselves. 18. I have known some, indeed, who <lb/>
            thought that they bad admirably represented the divine orator's <lb/>
            manner in their speeches, when they had put at the end of a <lb/>
            period esse videatur. The first consideration, therefore, for <lb/>
            the student, is, that he should understand what he proposes to <lb/>
            imitate, and have a thorough conception why it is excellent,]</p>
          <p>19. Next, in entering on his task, let him consult his own <lb/>
            powers, (for some things are inimitable by those whose natural <lb/>
            weakness is not sufficient for attaining them, or whose natural <lb/>
            inclination is repugnant to them,) lest he who has but a feeble <lb/>
            capacity, should attempt only what is arduous and rough, or <lb/>
            lest he who has great but rude talent, should waste his <lb/>
            strength in the study of refinement, and fail of attaining the <lb/>
            elegance of which he is desirous; for nothing is more un­ <lb/>
            graceful than to treat of delicate subjects with harshness. SO. <lb/>
            [ did not suppose, indeed, that by the master whom I instructed <lb/>
            in my second book,! those things only were to be taught, to <lb/>
            which he might see his pupils severally adapted by nature; he <lb/>
            ought to improve whatever good qualities he finds in them ; to <lb/>
            supply, as far as he can, what is deficient; to correct some <lb/>
            things and to alter others; for be is the director and regulator <lb/>
            of the minds of others; to mould his own nature may be <lb/>
            more difficult. 21. But not even such a teacher, however he <lb/>
            may wish everything that is right to be found in the highest <lb/>
            excellence in his pupils, will labour to any purpose in that to <lb/>
            which he shall see that nature is opposed.</p>
          <p>There is another thing also to be avoided, a matter in which <lb/>
            many err; we must not suppose that poets and historians are <note type="footnote"> * IX. 4, 73. </note><note type="footnote">t C. 8. </note> <pb n="282"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            to be the objects of our imitation in oratorical composition, or <lb/>
            orators and declaimers in poetry or history. 22. Every species <lb/>
            of writing has its own prescribed law; each its own appro­ <lb/>
            priate dress ; for comedy does not strut in tragic buskins, nor <lb/>
            does tragedy step along in the slipper of comedy: yet all elo­ <lb/>
            quence has something in common; and let us look on that <lb/>
            which is common as what we must imitate. 23. On those who <lb/>
            have devoted themselves to one particular kind of style, there <lb/>
            generally attends this inconvenience, that if, for example, the <lb/>
            roughness of some writer has taken their fancy, they cannot <lb/>
            divest themselves of it in pleading those causes which are of a <lb/>
            quiet and subdued nature; or if a simple and pleasing manner <lb/>
            has attracted them, they become unequal to the weight of their <lb/>
            subject in complex and difficult causes; when not only <lb/>
            the nature of one cause is different from that of another, but <lb/>
            the nature of one part of a cause differs from that of another <lb/>
            part, and some portions are to be delivered gently, others <lb/>
            roughly, some in a vehement, others in an easy tone, some for <lb/>
            the purpose of informing the hearer, others with a view to ex­ <lb/>
            cite his feelings; all which require a different and distinct <lb/>
            style. 24. I should not, therefore, advise a student to devote <lb/>
            himself entirely to any particular author, so as to imitate him <lb/>
            in all respects. Of all the Greek orators Demosthenes is by <lb/>
            far the most excellent; yet others, on some occasions, may <lb/>
            have expressed themselves better; and he himself has ex­ <lb/>
            pressed many things better on some occasions than on others. <lb/>
            But he who deserves to be imitated most, is not therefore the <lb/>
            only author to be imitated. 25. “What then ?" the reader <lb/>
            may ask, “is it not sufficient to speak on every subject as <lb/>
            Cicero spoke ?” To me, assuredly, it would be sufficient, if I <lb/>
            could attain all his excellences. Yet what disadvantage would <lb/>
            it be to assume, on some occasions, the energy of Cæsar, the <lb/>
            asperity of Cælius, the accuracy of Pollio, the judgment of <lb/>
            Calvus ? 26. For besides that it is the part of a judicious <lb/>
            student to make, if he can, whatever is excellent in each <lb/>
            author his own, it is also to be considered, that if, in a matter <lb/>
            of such difficulty as imitation, we fix our attention only on one <lb/>
            author, scarcely any one portion of his excellence will allow us <lb/>
            to become masters of it. Accordingly, since it is almost <lb/>
            denied to human ability to copy fully the pattern wnich we <lb/>
            have choseu, let us set before our eyes the excellences of <pb n="283"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            several, that different qualities from different writers may fix <lb/>
            themselves in our minds, and that we may adopt, for any sub <lb/>
            ject, the style which is most suitable to it.</p>
          <p>27. But let imitation (for I must frequently repeat the <lb/>
            same precept*) not be confined merely to words. We ought <lb/>
            to contemplate what propriety was observed by those great <lb/>
            men,† with regard to things and persons; what judgment, <lb/>
            what arrangement, and how everything, even what seems <lb/>
            intended only to please, was directed to the attainment 01 <lb/>
            success in their cause. Let us notice what is done in their <lb/>
            exordium; how skilful and varied is their statement of facts; <lb/>
            how great is their ability in proving and refuting; how con­ <lb/>
            summate was their skill in exciting every species of emotion ; <lb/>
            and how even the applause which they gained from the public <lb/>
            was turned to the advantage of their cause; applause which <lb/>
            is most honourable when it follows unsolicited, not when it is <lb/>
            anxiously courted. If we gain a thorough conception of all <lb/>
            these matters, we shall then be such imitators as we ought to <lb/>
            be. 28. But he who shall add to these borrowed qualities <lb/>
            excellences of his own, so as to supply what is deficient in his <lb/>
            models, and to retrench what is redundant, will be the com­ <lb/>
            plete orator whom we desire to see; and such an orator ought <lb/>
            now surely to be formed, when so many more examples of <lb/>
            eloquence exist than fell to the lot of those who have hitherto <lb/>
            been considered the best orators; for to them will belong the <lb/>
            praise, not only of surpassing those who preceded them, but of <lb/>
            instructing those who followed.</p>

          <p>Of writing; utility of it, § 1—4. How, and what, we should write; <lb/>
            necessity of correction, 5—14. Judicious exercise requisite, 15— <lb/>
            18. Objections to dictation, 19--21. A retired place desirable <lb/>
            for composition ; of writing at night, 22—27. But retirement <lb/>
            cannot always be secured, and we must do our best in the circum­ <lb/>
            stances in which we find ourselves, 28—30. Further remarks, 31 <lb/>
            —33.</p>
          <p>]. SUCH, then, are the means of improvement to be derived <note type="footnote"> *Comp. sect. 13, 16. </note><note type="footnote">t Who are named in the preceding paragraph </note> <pb n="284"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            from external sources. But of those which we must secure <lb/>
            for ourselves, practice in writing, which is attended with the <lb/>
            most labour, is attended also with the greatest advantage. <lb/>
            Nor has Cicero without reason called the peri the best modeller <lb/>
            and teacher of eloquence; and by putting that opinion into the <lb/>
            mouth of Lucius Crassus, in his Dialogues on the character of <lb/>
            the Orator* he has united his own judgment to the authority <lb/>
            of that eminent speaker.</p>
          <p>2. We must write, therefore, as carefully, and as much, as we <lb/>
            can; for as the ground, by being dug to a great depth, becomes <lb/>
            more fitted for fructifying and nourishing seeds, so improvement <lb/>
            of the mind, acquired from more than mere superficial cultiva­ <lb/>
            tion, pours forth the fruits of study in richer abundance, and <lb/>
            retains them with greater fidelity. For without this precau­ <lb/>
            tion,† the very faculty of speaking extempore will but furnish <lb/>
            us with empty loquacity, and words born on the lips.‡ 3. In <lb/>
            writing are the roots, in writing are the foundations of <lb/>
            eloquence ; by writing resources are stored up, as it were, in a <lb/>
            sacred repository, whence they may be drawn forth for sudden <lb/>
            emergencies, or as circumstances require. Let us above all <lb/>
            things get strength, which may suffice for the labour of our <lb/>
            contests, and may not be exhausted by use. 4. Nature has <lb/>
            herself appointed that nothing great is to be accomplished <lb/>
            quickly, and has ordained that difficulty should precede every <lb/>
            work of excellence ;§ and she has even made it a law with <note type="footnote"> * De Orate i. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> + Sine hac conscientid.] Hæc conscientia is nothing else but hujus rei <lb/>
            conscientia ; and hæc res is insumptus in scribendo labor. He only, <lb/>
            who, while he speaks extempore, can support himself with the con­ <lb/>
            sciousness of having previously written much for the sake of exercise, <lb/>
            will stand forth to plead with self-respect and without inconsiderateness. <lb/>
            Spalding. “Nisi quis sibi conscius sit se multum in scribendo laborem <lb/>
            insumpsisse." Rollin. Gesner would read constantiâ, by which the <lb/>
            passage would surely not be improved. I cannot say that “precau­ <lb/>
            tion," which I have given in the text, is a translation of conscientia, <lb/>
            but I have borrowed it, as a pretty fair equivalent for it, from Gedoyn's <lb/>
            version of the passage : “Si notre propre conscience ne nous répond do <lb/>
            eette precaution.” </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ In labris nascentia.] Not coming from the depths of the under­ <lb/>

            regard to gestation, that the larger animals are retained longer <lb/>
            in the womb of the parent.</p>
          <p>5. But as two questions arise from this subject, how, and <lb/>
            what, we ought principally to write, I shall consider them both <lb/>
            in this order. Let our pen be at first slow, provided that it be <lb/>
            accurate. Let us search for what is best, and not allow our­ <lb/>
            selves to be readily pleased with whatever presents itself; let <lb/>
            judgment be applied to our thoughts, and skill in arrangement <lb/>
            to such of them as the judgment sanctions; for we must make <lb/>
            a selection from our thoughts and words, and the weight of <lb/>
            each must be carefully estimated; and then must follow the <lb/>
            art of collocation, and the rhythm of our phrases must be tried <lb/>
            in every possible way, since any word must not take its position <lb/>
            just as it offers itself. 6. That we may acquire this accomplish­ <lb/>
            ment with the more precision, we must frequently repeat the last <lb/>
            words of what we have just written ; for besides that by this <lb/>
            means what follows is better connected with what precedes, <lb/>
            the ardour of thought, which has cooled by the delay of writing, <lb/>
            recovers its strength anew, and, by going again over the <lb/>
            ground, acquires new force; as is the case, we see, in a contest <lb/>
            at leaping; men run over a certain portion of ground that they <lb/>
            may take a longer spring, and be carried with the utmost <lb/>
            velocity to the other part on which they aim at alighting ; as <lb/>
            in hurling a javelin, too, we draw back the arm; and, when <lb/>
            going to shoot an arrow, we pull back the bowstring. 7. At <lb/>
            times, however, if a gale bear us on, we may spread our sails <lb/>
            to it, provided that the licence which we allow ourselves does <lb/>
            not lead us astray; for all our thoughts please us at the time <lb/>
            of their birth; otherwise they would not be committed to <lb/>
            writing. But let us have recourse to our judgment, and revise <lb/>
            the fruit of our facility, which is always to be regarded with <lb/>
            suspicion. 8. Thus we learn that Sallust wrote ; and his <lb/>
            labour, indeed, is shown in his productions. That Virgil <lb/>
            wrote very few verses in a day Varus bears testimony.. 9. With <lb/>
            the speaker, indeed, the case is different; and I, therefore, <lb/>
            enjoin this delay and solicitude only at the commencement of <lb/>
            his course; for we must make it first of all our object, and <lb/>
            must attain that object, to write as well as we can; practice <lb/>
            will bring celerity; thoughts, by degrees, will present them­ <note type="footnote"> * See Aul. Gell. xvii. 10, where it is related that Virgil used to say <lb/>
            of himself, that he licked hit verses into shape as bears lick their cuba. </note> <pb n="286"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            selves with greater readiness, words will correspond to them, <lb/>
            and suitable arrangement will follow; and everything, in a <lb/>
            word, as in a well ordered household, will be ready for service. <lb/>
            10. The sum of the whole matter, indeed, is this; that by writing <lb/>
            quickly we are not brought to write well, but that by writing <lb/>
            well we are brought to write quickly. But after this facility <lb/>
            has been attained, we must then, most of all, take care to stop <lb/>
            and look before us, and restrain our high-mettled steeds with <lb/>
            the curb ; a restraint which will not so much retard us, as give <lb/>
            us new spirit to proceed.</p>
          <p>Nor, on the other hand, do I think that those, who have <lb/>
            acquired some power in the use of the pen, should be chained <lb/>
            down to the unhappy task of perpetually finding fault with <lb/>
            themselves. 11. For how could he perform his duty to the public, <lb/>
            who should waste his life in polishing every portion of his <lb/>
            pleadings ? But there are some whom nothing ever satisfies; <lb/>
            who wish to alter everything, and to express everything in a <lb/>
            different form from that in which it first occurs to them. <lb/>
            Some. again, there are, who, distrustful of themselves, and <lb/>
            paying an ill compliment to their own powers, think that <lb/>
            accuracy in writing means to create for themselves extraor <lb/>
            dinary difficulties. 12. Nor is it easy for me to say which I <lb/>
            regard as more in the wrong, those whom everything that <lb/>
            they produce, or those whom nothing that they produce, <lb/>
            pleases; for it is often the case even with young men of talent, <lb/>
            that they wear themselves away with useless labour, and sink <lb/>
            into silence from too much anxiety to speak well. In regard <lb/>
            to this subject, I remember that Julius Secundus,* a contem­ <lb/>
            porary of mine, and, as is well known, dearly beloved by me, a <lb/>
            man of extraordinary eloquence, but of endless labour, men­ <lb/>
            tioned to me something that had been told him by his uncle. <lb/>
            13. This uncle was Julius Florus,† the most celebrated man <lb/>
            for eloquence in the provinces of Gaul, (for it was there that <lb/>
            he practised it,) and, in other respects, an orator to be ranked <lb/>
            with few, and worthy of his relationship to Secundus. He, <lb/>
            happening one day to observe that Secundus, while he was <lb/>
            still working at school, was looking dejected, asked him what <lb/>
            was the reason of his brow being so overcast. 14. The youth <note type="footnote"> *C. 1, sect. 120. </note><note type="footnote"> t Spalding supposes this to be the Julius Florus to whom HolMe <lb/>
            ad dresses the third epistle of his first book. </note> <pb n="287"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            used no concealment, but told him that that was the third day <lb/>
            that he had been vainly endeavouring, with his utmost efforts, <lb/>
            to find an exordium for a subject on which he had to write; <lb/>
            whence not only grief had affected him in respect to the present <lb/>
            occasion, but despair in regard to the time to come. Florus <lb/>
            immediately replied with a smile, Do you wish to write better <lb/>
            than you can? 15. Such is the whole truth of the matter; <lb/>
            we must endeavour to speak with as much ability as we <lb/>
            can, but we must speak according to our ability. For im­ <lb/>
            provement there is need of application, but not of vexation <lb/>
            with ourselves.</p>
          <p>But to enable us to write more, and more readily, not <lb/>
            practice only will assist, (and in practice there is doubtless <lb/>
            great effect,) but also method, if we do not, lolling at our ease, <lb/>
            looking at the ceiling, and trying to kindle our invention by <lb/>
            muttering to ourselves* wait for what may present itself, but, <lb/>
            observing what the subject requires, what becomes the cha­ <lb/>
            racter concerned, what the nature of the occasion is, and what <lb/>
            the disposition of the judge, set ourselves to write like reason­ <lb/>
            able beings; for thus nature herself will supply us not only <lb/>
            with a commencement but with what ought to follow. 16. Most <lb/>
            points, indeed, are plain, and set themselves before our eyes if <lb/>
            we do not shut them ; and accordingly not even the illiterate <lb/>
            and untaught have long to consider how to begin ; and there­ <lb/>
            fore we should feel the more ashamed if learning produces <lb/>
            difficulty. Let us not, then, imagine that what lies hid is <lb/>
            always best; or, if we think nothing fit to be said but what <lb/>
            we have not discovered, we must remain dumb.</p>
          <p>IT. A different fault is that of those who wish, first of all <lb/>
            to run through their subject with as rapid a pen as possible, <lb/>
            and, yielding to the ardour and impetuosity of their imagination, <lb/>
            write off their thoughts extemporaneously, producing what <lb/>
            they call a rough copy,† which they then go over again, and <lb/>
            arrange what they have hastily poured forth; but though the <lb/>
            words and rhythm of the sentences are mended, there still re­ <lb/>
            mains the same want of solid connexion that there was origin­ <lb/>
            ally in the parts hurriedly thrown together. 18. It will be better, <lb/>
            therefore, to use care at first, and so to form our work from <note type="footnote"> * Comp. it. 11, </note><note type="footnote"> t Silvam.] The thoughts being committed to writing, without any <lb/>

            the beginning that we may have merely to polish it, and not <lb/>
            to mould it anew. Sometimes, however, we may give a loose <lb/>
            to our feeling, in the display of which warmth is generally of <lb/>
            more effect than accuracy.</p>
          <p>19. From my disapprobation of carelessness in writing, it is <lb/>
            clearly enough seen what I think of the fine fancy of dicta­ <lb/>
            tion;* for in the use of the pen, the hand of the writer, <lb/>
            however rapid, as it cannot keep pace with the celerity of his <lb/>
            thoughts, allows them some respite; but he to whom we dic­ <lb/>
            tate urges us on, and we feel ashamed at times to hesitate, or <lb/>
            stop, or alter, as if we were afraid to have a witness of our <lb/>
            weakness. 20. Hence it happens, that not only inelegant and <lb/>
            casual expressions, but sometimes unsuitable ones, escape us, <lb/>
            while our sole anxiety is to make our discourse connected; <lb/>
            expressions which partake neither of the accuracy of the writer <lb/>
            nor of the animation of the speaker; while, if the person who <lb/>
            takes down what is dictated, prove, from slowness in writing, <lb/>
            or from inaccuracy in reading, a hindrance, as it were, to us, <lb/>
            the course of our thought is obstructed, and all the fire that <lb/>
            nad been conceived in our mind is dispelled by delay, or, <lb/>
            sometimes, by anger at the offender. 21. Besides, those gestures <lb/>
            which accompany the stronger excitements of the mind, and <lb/>
            which, in some degree, rouse the imagination, such as waving <lb/>
            of the hand, alteration of the features, turning from side to <lb/>
            side, and all such acts as Persius† satirizes, when he alludes <lb/>
            to a negligent species of style, (the writer, he says. <lb/>
            Nec pluteum cædit, nec demorsos sapit ungues, <lb/>
            Nor thumps his desk, nor tastes his bitten nails,) <lb/>
            are utterly ridiculous except when we are alone. 22. In short, <lb/>
            to mention once for all the strongest argument against dictation, <lb/>
            privacy is rendered impossible by it; and that a spot free from <lb/>
            witnesses, and the deepest possible silence, are the most de­ <lb/>
            sirable for persons engaged in writing, no one can doubt.</p>
          <p>Yet we are not therefore necessarily to listen to those, who <note type="footnote"> * De illis dictandi deliciis.] Self-indulgence, and dislike of labour, <lb/>
            had then become so prevalent that men of any station were growing <lb/>
            careless about manual dexterity in writing, and, subsequently, to <lb/>
            dictate, instead of to write, became a great portion of the business of <lb/>
            the learned. Thus Sidonius Apollinaris, viii 6, says that he had <lb/>
            excelled many others vario dictandi genere, " in the various departments <lb/>
            of dictation," and speaks of the three employments certandi, dictandi, <lb/>

            tnink that groves and woods are the most proper places for <lb/>
            study, because, as the free and open sky, they say, and the <lb/>
            beauty of sequestered spots, give elevation to the mind and a <lb/>
            happy warmth to the imagination. 23. To me, assuredly, such <lb/>
            retirement seems rather conducive to pleasure than an incen­ <lb/>
            tive to literary exertion; for the very objects that delight us <lb/>
            must, of necessity, divert our attention from the work which <lb/>
            we designed to pursue; for the mind cannot, in truth, attend <lb/>
            effectually to many things at once, and in whatever direction <lb/>
            it looks off, it must cease to contemplate what had been in­ <lb/>
            tended for its employment. 24. The pleasantness, therefore, <lb/>
            of the woods, the streams gliding past, the breezes sporting <lb/>
            among the branches of the trees, the songs of birds, and the <lb/>
            very freedom of the extended prospect, draw off our attention <lb/>
            to them; so that all such gratifications seem to me more <lb/>
            adapted to relax the thoughts than to brace them. 25. De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes acted more wisely, who secluded himself in a place <lb/>
            where no voice could be heard, and no prospect contemplated, <lb/>
            that his eyes might not oblige his mind to attend to anything <lb/>
            else besides his business. As for those who study by lamp­ <lb/>
            light, therefore, let the silence of the night, the closed <lb/>
            chamber, and a single light, keep them as it were wholly in <lb/>
            seclusion. 26. But in every kind of study, and especially in <lb/>
            such nocturnal application, good health, and that which is the <lb/>
            principal means of securing it, regularity of life,* are neces­ <lb/>
            sary, since we devote the time appointed us by nature for <lb/>
            sleep and the recruiting of our strength, to the most intense <lb/>
            labour; but on this labour we must not bestow more time <lb/>
            than what is too much for sleep, and what will not leave too <lb/>
            little for it; 27. for weariness hinders application to writing; and <lb/>
            day-light, if we are free from other occupations, is abundantly <lb/>
            sufficient for it; it is necessity that drives men engaged in <lb/>
            business to read at night. Yet study by the lamp, when we <lb/>
            come to it fresh and vigorous, is the best kind of retirement.</p>
          <p>28. But silence and seclusion, and entire freedom of mind, <lb/>
            though in the highest degree desirable, cannot always fall to <lb/>
            our lot; and therefore we must not, if any noise disturbs us, <lb/>
             <note type="footnote"> * Frugalitas.] Beware of circumscribing the meaning of this word <lb/>
            within the limits to which we at present generally confine it, and of <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            immediately throw aside our books, and deplore the day as <lb/>
            lost, but we must strive against inconveniences, and acquire <lb/>
            such habits, that our application may set all interruptions at <lb/>
            defiance; for if we direct our attention, with our whole <lb/>
            mental energy, to the work actually before us, nothing of all <lb/>
            that strikes our eyes or ears will penetrate into the mind. <lb/>
            29. Does a casual train of thought often cause us not to see <lb/>
            persons in our way, and to wander from our road, and shall <lb/>
            we not attain the same abstraction if we resolve to do so? We <lb/>
            must not yield to excuses for idleness ; for if we fancy that we <lb/>
            must not study except when we are fresh, except when we are <lb/>
            in good spirits, except when we are free from all other cares, <lb/>
            we shall always have some reason for self-indulgence. 30. In <lb/>
            the midst of crowds, therefore, on a journey, and even at festive <lb/>
            meetings, let thought secure for herself privacy. Else what <lb/>
            will be the result, when we shall have, in the midst of the <lb/>
            forum, amid the hearing of so many causes, amid wranglings <lb/>
            and casual outcries, to speak, perhaps on a sudden, in a con­ <lb/>
            tinued harangue, if we cannot conceive the memoranda which <lb/>
            we enter on our tablets, anywhere but in solitude ? For this <lb/>
            reason Demosthenes, though so great a lover of seclusion, <lb/>
            used to accustom himself, by studying on the sea-shore, where <lb/>
            the breakers dashed with the loudest noise, not to be discon­ <lb/>
            certed at the uproar of public assemblies</p>
          <p>31. Some lesser matters also (though nothing is little that re­ <lb/>
            lates to study) must not be left unnoticed; one of which is,that we <lb/>
            can write best on waxen tablets, from which there is the greatest <lb/>
            facility for erasing, unless, perchance, weakness of sight* re­ <lb/>
            quires the use of parchment; but parchment, though it assists the <lb/>
            sight, yet, from the frequent movement of the hand backwards <lb/>
            and forwards, while dipping the pen in the ink, causes delay, <lb/>
            and interrupts the current of thought. 32. Next we may <lb/>
            observe, that in using either of these kinds of material, we <lb/>
            should take care to leave some pages blank, on which we may <lb/>
            have free scope for making any additions; (since want of <lb/>
            room sometimes causes a reluctance to correct, or, at least, <lb/>
            what was written first makes a confused mixture with what is <lb/>
            inserted. But I would not have the waxen tablets extrava­ <lb/>
            gantly broad, baving found a youth, otherwise anxious to <note type="footnote"> It The letters, It appears, were plainer and more legible on parch­ <lb/>

            excel, make his compositions of too great a length, because <lb/>
            he used to measure them by the number of lines, a fault which, <lb/>
            though it could not be corrected by repeated admonitions, was <lb/>
            at last removed by altering the size of his tablets. 33. There <lb/>
            should also be a portion of space left vacant on whirh may be <lb/>
            noted down what frequently occurs out of order to persons who <lb/>
            arc writing, that is, in reference to other subjects than those <lb/>
            which we have in hand ; for excellent thoughts sometimes <lb/>
            start into our minds, which we cannot well insert in our pages, <lb/>
            and which it is not safe to delay noting down, because they <lb/>
            sometimes escape us, and sometimes, if we are anxious to <lb/>
            keep them in memory, divert us from thinking of other things. <lb/>
            Hence they will be properly deposited in a place for memoranda</p>

          <p>Observations on correction; we must not indulge in it too much.</p>
          <p>1. NEXT follows correction, which is by far the most useful <lb/>
            part of our studies ; for it is believed, and not without reason, <lb/>
            that the pen is not least serviceable when it is used to erase.. <lb/>
            Of correction there are three ways, to add, to take away, and <lb/>
            to alter.</p>
          <p>In regard, however, to what is to be added or taken away, <lb/>
            the decision is comparatively easy and simple; but to com­ <lb/>
            press what is tumid, to raise what is low, to prune what is <lb/>
            luxuriant, to regulate what is ill-arranged, to give compactness <lb/>
            to what is loose, to circumscribe what is extravagant, is a two­ <lb/>
            fold task; for we must reject things that had pleased us, and <lb/>
            find out others that had escaped us. 2. Undoubtedly, also, <lb/>
            the best method for correction is to lay by for a time what we <lb/>
            have written, so that we may return to it, after an interval, as <lb/>
            if it were something new to us, and written by another, lest <lb/>
            our writings, like new-born infants, compel us to fix our <lb/>
            affections on them.</p>
          <p>3. But this cannot always be done, especially by the orator, <lb/>
            who must frequently write for present purposes; and correction <note type="footnote"> * When it prunes luxuriance and exuberance of style. See <unclear>Cicer</unclear> <lb/>
            do Orat. ii. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> u a </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="292"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            must therefore have its limits; for there are some that return <lb/>
            to whatever they compose as if they presumed it to be incorrect; <lb/>
            and, as if nothing could be right that has presented itself first, <lb/>
            they think whatever is different from it is better, and find <lb/>
            something to correct as often as they take up their manuscript, <lb/>
            like surgeons who make incisions even in sound places; and <lb/>
            hence it happens that their writings are, so to speak, scarred <lb/>
            and bloodless, and rendered worse by the remedies applied. <lb/>
            Let what we write, therefore, sometimes please, or at least <lb/>
            content us, that the file may polish our work, and not wear it <lb/>
            to nothing. To the time, too, allowed for correction, there <lb/>
            must be a limit; for as to what we hear about Cinna's <lb/>
            Zmyrna,* that it occupied nine years in writing, and about the <lb/>
            Panegyric of Isocrates, which they who assign the shortest <lb/>
            period to its production,! assert to have been ten years in <lb/>
            being finished, it is of no import to the orator, whose aid <lb/>
            would be useless if it were so long in coming.</p>

          <p>What sort of composition we should practise ; of translating Greek <lb/>
            into Latin, § 1—8. Of putting the writing of eminent authors <lb/>
            into other words, 9—11. Of theses, common places, declamations, <lb/>
            and other species of composition and exercise, 12—20. Cases for <lb/>
            declamation should be as similar as possible to real cases, 21—23.</p>
          <p>1. THE next point is, to decide on what we should employ <lb/>
            ourselves when we write. It would be a superfluous labour, <lb/>
            indeed, to detail what subjects there are for writing, and what <lb/>
            should be studied first, or second, and so on in succession ; for <lb/>
            this has been done in my first book,‡ in which I prescribed <lb/>
            the order for the studies of boys, and in my second, § where I <lb/>
            specified those of the more advanced; and what is now to he <note type="footnote"> * Zmyrna or Myrrha, see ix. 2, 64. The author was Cams Helviua <lb/>
            Cinna; and that he was nine years about the poem, (or play, as Gedoyn <lb/>
            inclines to think it,) is stated in one of the epigrams of Catullus. <lb/>
            Horace's term of " nine years " was probably taken from Cinaa's period <lb/>
            of devotion to his work. </note><note type="footnote"> t Some say that it occupied fifteen years, as Plutarch observes in <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH V.]"/><lb/>
            considered, is whence copiousness and facility of expression <lb/>
            may be derived.</p>
          <p>2. To translate Greek into Latin our old orators thought to <lb/>
            be a very excellent exercise. Lucius Crassus, in the well- <lb/>
            known books of Cicero De Oratore,* says that he often <lb/>
            practised it; and Cicero himself, speaking in his own person, t <lb/>
            very frequently recommends it, and has even published books <lb/>
            of Plato and Xenophon: translated in that kind of exercise. <lb/>
            It was also approved by Messala; and there are extant several <lb/>
            versions of speeches made by him, so that he even rivalled the <lb/>
            oration of Hyperides for Phryne in delicacy of style, a quality <lb/>
            most difficult of attainment to Romans. 3. The object of such <lb/>
            exercise is evident; for the Greek authors excel in copious­ <lb/>
            ness of matter, and have introduced a vast deal of art into the <lb/>
            study of eloquence; and, in translating them, we may use <lb/>
            the very best words, for all that we use may be our own. As <lb/>
            to figures,§ by which language is principally ornamented, we <lb/>
            may be under the necessity of inventing a great number and <lb/>
            variety of them, because the Roman tongue differs greatly <lb/>
            from that of the Greeks.</p>
          <p>4. But the conversion of Latin writing into other words will <lb/>
            also be of great service to us. About the utility of turning <lb/>
            poetry into prose, I suppose that no one has any doubt; and <lb/>
            this is the only kind of exercise that Sulpicius is said to have <lb/>
            used; for its sublimity may elevate our style, and the bold­ <lb/>
            ness of the expressions adopted by poetic license does not <lb/>
            preclude* the orator's efforts to express the same thoughts in <lb/>

            our paraphrase to be a mere interpretation, but an effort to <lb/>
            vie with and rival our original in the expression of the same <lb/>
            thoughts. 5. I therefore differ in opinion from those who <lb/>
            disapprove of paraphrasing Latin orations,. on the pretext that, <lb/>
            as the best words and phrases have been already used, what­ <lb/>
            ever we express in another form, must of necessity be ex­ <lb/>
            pressed worse. But for this allegation there is no sufficient <lb/>
            ground; for we must not despair of the possibility of finding <lb/>
            something better than what has been said; nor has nature <lb/>
            made language so meagre and poor that we cannot speak well <lb/>
            on any subject except in one way; unless we suppose, indeed, <lb/>
            that the gestures of the actor can give a variety of turns to the <lb/>
            same words, but that the power of eloquence is so much <lb/>
            inferior that when a thing has been once said, nothing can be <lb/>
            said after it to the same purpose. 6. But let it be granted <lb/>
            that what we conceive is neither better than our original nor <lb/>
            equal to it; yet it must be allowed, at the same time, that <lb/>
            there is a possibility of coming near to it. 7. Do not we <lb/>
            ourselves at times speak twice or oftener, and sometimes a <lb/>
            succession of sentences, on the same subject, and are we to <lb/>
            suppose that though we can contend with ourselves we cannot <lb/>
            contend with others ? If a thought could be expressed <lb/>
            well only in one way, it would be but right to suppose that <lb/>
            the path of excellence has been shut against us by some of our <lb/>
            predecessors; but in reality there are still innumerable modes <lb/>
            of saying a thing, and many roads leading to the same point. <lb/>
            8. Conciseness has its charms, and so has copiousness; there <lb/>
            is one kind of beauty in metaphorical, another in simple expres­ <lb/>
            sions ; direct expressions become one subject, and such as are <lb/>
            varied by figures another. In addition, the difficulty of the <lb/>
            exercise is most serviceable. Are not our greatest authors by <lb/>
            this means studied more carefully ? For, in this way, we do <lb/>
            not run over what we have written in a careless mode of <lb/>
            reading, but consider every individual portion, and look, from <lb/>
            necessity, thoroughly into their matter, and learn how much <lb/>
            merit they possess from the very fact that we cannot succeed <lb/>
            in imitating them.</p>
          <p>9. Nor will it be of advantage to us only to alter the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of others; it will be serviceable also to vary our own in <lb/>
            a number of different forms, taking certain thoughts for the <note type="footnote"> * Something to this effect is said by Crassus in Cicero do Orat. L 34. </note> <pb n="295"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH V.]"/><lb/>
            purpose, and putting them, as harmoniously as possible, into <lb/>
            several shapes, just as different figures are moulded out of the <lb/>
            same wax. 10. But I consider that the greatest facility in com­ <lb/>
            position is acquired by exercise in the simplest subjects; for <lb/>
            in treating of a multiplicity of persons, causes, occasions, <lb/>
            places, sayings. and actions, our real weakness in style may <lb/>
            readily escape notice amidst so many subjects which present <lb/>
            themselves on all sides, and on some of which we may readily <lb/>
            lay hold. 11. But the great proof of power is to expand what <lb/>
            is naturally contracted, to amplify what is little, to give variety <lb/>
            to things that are similar, and attraction to such as are obvious, <lb/>
            and to say with effect much on a little.</p>
          <p>To this end indefinite questions will much contribute, ques­ <lb/>
            tions which we call <foreign xml:lang="grc">θέσεις</foreign>, and on which Cicero, even when he <lb/>
            had become the first orator in his country, used to exercise <lb/>
            himself.. IS. Next in utility to these are refutations and <lb/>
            defences of sentences; for as a sentence is a sort of decree and <lb/>
            order, whatever questions may arise regarding the subject of it, <lb/>
            may also arise regarding the decision on the subject. Next <lb/>
            stand common-places ,† on which we know that accomplished <lb/>
            orators have written. For he who shall succeed in treating <lb/>
            fully on questions that are plain and direct, and do not <lb/>
            involve any complicated inquiries, will be still better able to <lb/>
            expatiate on such as admit of excursive discussion, and will be <lb/>
            prepared for any cause whatever. 13. All causes, indeed, rest <lb/>
            on general questions; for what difference does it make, for <lb/>
            instance, whether Cornelius, as tribune of the people, is <lb/>
            accused of having read to the people the manuscript of a <lb/>
            proposed law,‡ or whether we have to consider the general <lb/>
            question, Is it a breach of the dignity of office, if a magistrate <lb/>
            reads his own law to the people in his own person? What <lb/>
            difference does it make whether the question to be tried is, <lb/>
            Did Milo lawfully kill Clodius ? or, Ought a lier-in-wait to be <lb/>
            killed, or a mischievous member of the commonwealth, even <lb/>
            though he be not a lier-in-wait? What is the difference <lb/>
            whether the question is, Did Cato act properly in giving up his <lb/>
            wife to Hortensius? or, Does such a proceeding become a <note type="footnote"> * See it 1, 9. Cicero ad Att. ix. 4, 19. Gesner very properly observes <lb/>

            respectable man? Decision is pronounced concerning the <lb/>
            persons, but the dispute concerns the general questions.</p>
          <p>14. Declamations, too, such as are usually pronounced in the <lb/>
            schools, are, if but adapted to real cases, and made similar to <lb/>
            actual pleadings, of the greatest service, Dot only while our <lb/>
            education has still to reach maturity, (for the exercise is alike <lb/>
            both in conception and in arrangement,) but even when our <lb/>
            studies are said to be completed, and have obtained us repu­ <lb/>
            tation in the forum; since eloquence is thus nurtured and <lb/>
            made florid, as it were, on a richer sort of diet, and is refreshed <lb/>
            after being fatigued by the constant roughnesses of forensic <lb/>
            contests. 15. Hence, also, the copious style of history may be <lb/>
            tried with advantage for exercising the pen; and we may <lb/>
            indulge in the easy style of dialogues. Nor will it be prejudi­ <lb/>
            cial to our improvement to amuse ourselves with verse; as <lb/>
            athletes, relaxing at times from their fixed rules for food and <lb/>
            exercise, recruit themselves with ease and more inviting dain­ <lb/>
            ties. 16. It was from this cause, as it seems to me, that <lb/>
            Cicero threw such a glorious brilliancy over his eloquence, that <lb/>
            he used freely to ramble in such sequestered walks of study; <lb/>
            for if our sole material for thought is derived from law cases, the <lb/>
            gloss of our oratory must of necessity be rubbed off, its joints <lb/>
            must grow stiff, and the points of its wit be blunted by daily <lb/>
            encounters.</p>
          <p>17. But though this feasting, as it were, of eloquence, <lb/>
            refreshes and recruits those who are employed, and, as we may <lb/>
            say, at war, in the field of the forum, yet young men ought <lb/>
            not to be detained too long in fictitious representations and <lb/>
            empty semblances of real life ; to such a degree, I mean, that <lb/>
            it would be difficult to familiarize them, when removed from <lb/>
            such illusions, to the occupations of the forum; lest, from the <lb/>
            effect of the retirement in which they have almost wasted away <lb/>
            their life, they should shrink from the field of action as from <lb/>
            too dazzling sunshine. 18. This is said indeed to have been <lb/>
            the case with Porcius Latro, who was the first professor of <lb/>
            rhetoric of any eminence, so that, when he was called on to <lb/>
            plead a cause in the forum, at the time that he bore the high­ <lb/>
            est character in the schools, he used earnestly to entreat that <lb/>
            the benches of the judges might be removed into the hall; for <lb/>
            so strange did the open sky appear to him, that all his elo­ <lb/>
            quence seemed to lie within a roof and walls. 19. Let the <pb n="297"/>

            young man, then, who has carefully learned skill in conception <lb/>
            and expression from his teachers, (which will not be an endless <lb/>
            task if they are able and willing to teach,) and who has gained <lb/>
            a fair degree of facility by practice, choose some orator, as was <lb/>
            the custom among the ancients, whom he may follow and imi­ <lb/>
            tate; let him attend as many trials as possible, and be a <lb/>
            frequent spectator of the sort of contest for which he is intended. <lb/>
            20. Let him set down cases also in writing, either the same <lb/>
            that he has heard pleaded, or others, provided that they be on <lb/>
            real facts, and let him handle both sides of the question; and, <lb/>
            as we see in the schools of gladiators, let him exercise himseli <lb/>
            with arms that will decide contests,* as we observed that Brutus. <lb/>
            did in composing a speech for Milo.t This is a much better <lb/>
            practice than writing replies to old speeches, as Cestius ‡ did <lb/>
            to the speech of Cicero on behalf of Milo, though he could not <lb/>
            have had a sufficient knowledge of the other side from reading <lb/>
            only the defence.</p>
          <p>21. The young man will thus be sooner qualified for the <lb/>
            forum, whom his master has obliged to approach in his decla­ <lb/>
            mations as nearly as possible to reality, and to range through <lb/>
            all sorts of cases, of which masters now select only the easiest <lb/>
            parts, as most favourable for exhibition. The ordinary hin­ <lb/>
            drances to such variety in cases,§ are the crowd of pupils, the <lb/>
            custom of hearing the classes on stated days, and, in some <lb/>
            degree, the influence of parents, who count their sons! decla­ <lb/>
            mations rather than judge of the merit of them. 22. But a <lb/>
            good master, as I said, I believe, in my first book,|| will not <lb/>
            encumber himself with a greater number of pupils than he <lb/>
            can well undertake to teach; he will put a stop to all empty <lb/>
            loquacity, allowing everything to be said that concerns the <note type="footnote"> * Decretoriis.] " The gladiators," says Seneca the Rhetorician, Con­ <lb/>

          <p>Of thought and premeditation.</p>
          <p>1. NEXT to writing is meditation, which indeed derives <lb/>
            strength from it, and is something between the labour of <lb/>
            writing and the trial of our fortune in extemporary speaking; <lb/>
            and I know not whether it is not more frequently of use than <lb/>
            either; for we cannot write everywhere and at all times; but <lb/>
            there is abundance of time and room for thought. Meditation <lb/>
            may in a very few hours embrace all points of the most important <lb/>
            causes. When our sleep is broken at night, meditation is <lb/>
            aided by the very darkness. Between the different stages in <lb/>
            the pleading of a cause it finds some room to exercise itself, <lb/>
            and never allows itself to be idle. 2. Nor does it only <lb/>
            arrange within its circle the order of things, (which would <lb/>
            itself be a great assistance to us,) but forms an array of <lb/>
            words, and connects together the whole texture of a speech, <lb/>
            with such effect, that nothing is wanting to it but to write <lb/>
            it down. That, indeed, is in general more firmly fixed in the <lb/>
            memory, on which the attention does not relax its hold from <lb/>
            trusting too securely to writing.</p>
          <p>But at such power of thought we cannot arrive suddenly or <lb/>
            oven soon. 3. In the first place, a certain form of thinking <lb/>
            must be acquired by great practice in writing, a form which <lb/>
            may be continually attendant on our meditations; a habit of <pb n="299"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH VI.]"/><lb/>
            thinking must then be gradually gained by embracing in our <lb/>
            minds a few particulars at first, in such a way that they may <lb/>
            be faithfully repeated; next, by additions so moderate that <lb/>
            our task may scarcely feel itself increased, our power of con­ <lb/>
            ception must be enlarged, and sustained by plenty of exercise; <lb/>
            power which in a great degree depends on memory, and I <lb/>
            shall consequently defer some remarks on it till I enter on <lb/>
            that head of my subject.* 4. Yet it has already been made <lb/>
            apparent,! that he to whom nature does not obstinately refuse <lb/>
            her aid, may, if assisted only by zealous application, attain such <lb/>
            proficiency that what he has merely meditated, as well as <lb/>
            what he has written and learned by heart, may be faithfully <lb/>
            expressed in his efforts at oratory. Cicero indeed has <lb/>
            acquainted us that, among the Greeks, Metrodorus of Scepsis, ‡ <lb/>
            and Empylus § of Rhodes, and Hortensius among our own <lb/>
            countrymen, could, when they pleaded a cause, repeat word <lb/>
            for word what they had premeditated.</p>
          <p>5. But if by chance, while we are speaking, some glowing <lb/>
            thought, suggested on the instant, should spring up in our <lb/>
            minds, we must certainly not adhere too superstitiously to <lb/>
            that which we have studied; for what we meditate is not to <lb/>
            be settled with such nicety, that room is not to be allowed for <lb/>
            a happy conception of the moment, when thoughts that sud­ <lb/>
            denly arise in our minds are often inserted even in our written <lb/>
            compositions Hence the whole of this kind of exercise must <lb/>
            be so ordered that we may easily depart from what we have <lb/>
            arranged and easily return to it; since, though it is of the <lb/>
            first importance to bring with us from home a prepared and <lb/>
            precise array of language, yet it would be the greatest folly <lb/>
            to reject the offerings of the moment. 6. Let our premeditation, <lb/>
            therefore, be made with such care that fortune, while she is <lb/>
            unable to disappoint, may have it in her power to assist us. <lb/>
            But it will depend on the strength of our memory, whether <lb/>
            what we have embraced in our minds flows forth easily, and <note type="footnote"> * B. xi. c. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t Eo tamen pervenit, so. res ; “the subject has come to this,. that is, <lb/>

            does not prevent us, while we are anxious and looking back, <lb/>
            and relying on no hope but that of recollection, from casting a <lb/>
            glance in advance; otherwise I should prefer extemporary <lb/>
            venturesomeness to premeditation of such unhappy coherence. <lb/>
            It has the very worst effect to be turning back in quest of our <lb/>
            matter, because, while we are looking for what is in one direc. <lb/>
            tion, we are diverted from what is in another, and we derive <lb/>
            our thoughts rather from mere memory than from our proper <lb/>
            subject. Supposing, too, that we had to depend wholly on <lb/>
            premeditation or wholly on the conceptions of the moment, <lb/>
            we know very well that more may be imagined than has <lb/>
            been imagined.</p>

            it is to be acquired, 5—23. How we must guard against losing it, <lb/>
            24—33.</p>
          <p>1. BUT the richest fruit of all our study, and the most <lb/>
            ample recompense for the extent of our labour, is the faculty <lb/>
            of speaking extempore; and he who has not succeeded in <lb/>
            acquiring it, will do well, in my opinion, to renounce the <lb/>
            occupations of the forum, and devote his solitary talent of <lb/>
            writing to some other employment; for it is scarcely consis­ <lb/>
            tent with the character of a man of honour to make a public <lb/>
            profession of service to others which may fail in the most <lb/>
            pressing emergencies, since it is of no more use than to point <lb/>
            out a harbour to a vessel, to which it cannot approach unless <lb/>
            it be borne along by the gentlest breezes. 2. There arise <lb/>
            indeed innumerable occasions where it is absolutely necessary <lb/>
            to speak on the instant, as well before magistrates, as on <lb/>
            trials that are brought on before the appointed time;* <lb/>
            and if any of these shall occur, I do not say to any one of our <lb/>
            innocent fellow-citizens, but to any of our own friends or <lb/>
            relatives, is an advocate to stand dumb, and, while they are <note type="footnote"> * Repræsentatis judiciis.] That is, ante siatutum vel expectatum tempus <lb/>

            begging for a voice to save them, and are likely to be undone <lb/>
            if succour be not instantly afforded them, is he to ask time <lb/>
            for retirement and silent study, till his speech be formed and <lb/>
            committed to memory, and his voice and lungs be put in <lb/>
            tune ? 3. What system of pleading will allow of an orator being <lb/>
            unprepared for sudden calls ? What is to be done when we <lb/>
            have to reply to an opponent ? for that which we expected him <lb/>
            to say, and in answer to which we composed our speech, often <lb/>
            disappoints our anticipations, and the whole aspect of the <lb/>
            cause is suddenly changed; and as the pilot has to alter his <lb/>
            course according to the direction of the winds, so must our <lb/>
            plan be varied to suit the variation in the cause 4. What pro­ <lb/>
            fit does much writing, constant reading, and a long period of <lb/>
            life spent in study, bring us, if there remains with us the <lb/>
            same difficulty in speaking that we felt at first? He, <lb/>
            assuredly, who has always to encounter the same labour, must <lb/>
            admit that his past efforts were to no purpose. Not that I <lb/>
            make it an object that an orator should prefer to speak <lb/>
            extempore; I only wish that he should be able to do so.</p>
          <p>This talent we shall most effectually attain by the following <lb/>
            means. 5. First of all, let our method of speaking be settled ; <lb/>
            for no journey can be attempted before we know to what <lb/>
            place, and by what road, we have to go. It is not enough not <lb/>
            to be ignorant what the parts of judicial causes are, or how to <lb/>
            dispose questions in proper order, though these are certainly <lb/>
            points of the highest importance, but we must know what <lb/>
            ought to be first, what second, and so on, in each department <lb/>
            of a pleading; for different particulars are so connected by <lb/>
            nature that they admit no alteration of their order, nor allow <lb/>
            any thing to be forced between them, without manifest con­ <lb/>
            fusion. 6. But he who shall speak according to a certain <lb/>
            method, will be led forward, most of all, by the series <lb/>
            of particulars, as by a sure guide; and hence even per­ <lb/>
            sons of but moderate practice will adhere with the greatest <lb/>
            ease to the chain of facts in their narratives. They will also <lb/>
            know what they want in each portion of a speech, and will not <lb/>
            look about like persons at a loss; nor will they be distracted <lb/>
            by ideas that present themselves from other quarters, nor mix <lb/>
            up their speech of ingredients collected from separate spots, <lb/>
            like men leaping hither and thither, and resting nowhere <pb n="302"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            7. They will likewise have a certain range and limit, which <lb/>
            cannot exist without proper division. When they have <lb/>
            treated, to the best of their ability, of everything that they had <lb/>
            proposed to themselves, they will be sensible that they have <lb/>
            come to a termination.</p>
          <p>These qualifications depend on art; others on study; thus <lb/>
            we must acquire, as has been already directed, an ample store <lb/>
            of the best language; our style must be so formed by much <lb/>
            and diligent composition, that even what is poured forth by <lb/>
            us unpremeditatedly may present the appearance of having <lb/>
            been previously written; so that, after having written much, <lb/>
            we shall have the power of speaking copiously. 8. For it is <lb/>
            habit and exercise that chiefly beget facility, and if they are <lb/>
            intermitted, even but for a short period, not only will our <lb/>
            fluency be diminished, but our mouth may even be closed. <lb/>
            9. Since, though we have need of such natural activity of mind, <lb/>
            that, while we are uttering what is immediately present to our <lb/>
            thoughts, we may be arranging what is to follow, and that <lb/>
            thought preconceived and put into shape may always be <lb/>
            ready for our voice, yet scarcely could either nature or art fix <lb/>
            the mind on such manifold duties, as that it should suffice at <lb/>
            once for invention, arrangement, delivery, for settling the <lb/>
            order of our matter and words, for conceiving what we are <lb/>
            uttering, what we must say next, and what is to be contem. <lb/>
            plated still further on, while its attention is given, at the same <lb/>
            time, to our tone, pronunciation, and gesture. 10. Our <lb/>
            activity of mind, indeed, must stretch far in advance, and <lb/>
            drive our subject, as it were, before it, and whatever portion <lb/>
            of our matter is consumed in speaking, an equal portion must <lb/>
            be brought forward from that which is to follow, so that, until <lb/>
            we arrive at the end, our prospect may advance no less than <lb/>
            our step, unless, indeed, we are content to stop and stumble <lb/>
            at every phrase, and throw out short and broken expressions <lb/>
            like persons sobbing out what they have to say.</p>
          <p>11. There is accordingly a certain unreflecting and mechani­ <lb/>
            cal habit, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλογος τϱιή</foreign>, such as that by <lb/>
            which the hand runs on in writing, and by which the eye, in <lb/>
            reading, sees several lines, with their turns and transitions, <lb/>
            at once, and perceives what follows before the voice has <lb/>
            utteied what piecedes. Hence the possibility of those won <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH VII.]"/><lb/>
            derful tricks of performers on the stage with balls, and of <lb/>
            other jugglers,* whose dexterity is such that one might <lb/>
            suppose the things which they throw from them to return into <lb/>
            their hands of their own accord, and to fly whithersoever they <lb/>
            are commanded to go. 12. But such habit will be of advan­ <lb/>
            tage to us only where the art, of which we spoke, has pre­ <lb/>
            ceded it, so that that which is done without reflection may yet <lb/>
            have its origin in reflection. For he only seems to me to <lb/>
            speak, who speaks connectedly, elegantly, and fluently; other­ <lb/>
            wise he appears only to utter noisy gabble. 13. Nor shall I <lb/>
            ever admire a stream of fortuitous eloquence, which I hear in <lb/>
            abundance even among women when they are quarrelling, <lb/>
            though it often happens,† that when ardour and animation <lb/>
            carry a speaker along, no study can equal the success of his <lb/>
            extemporary efforts. 14. When such a flow of language <lb/>
            occurred, the old orators, as Cicero observes,‡ used to say <lb/>
            that some god had inspired the orator. But the cause of the <lb/>
            fluency is evident; for strongly conceived thoughts, and <lb/>
            images rising fresh in the mind, bear us along with uninter­ <lb/>
            rupted rapidity, when they would sometimes, if retarded by <lb/>
            the slowness of writing, grow cool, and, if put off, would <lb/>
            never return. § When to this, too, is added an unhappy scru­ <lb/>
            pulousness about words, and the progress of the speaker is <lb/>
            thus stopped at every step, the impulse of eloquence can have <lb/>
            no free course; and even though his choice of particular <lb/>
            words may be extremely happy, yet the combination of them <lb/>
            will proceed with no natural ease, but will appear like the <lb/>
            laborious construction of art.</p>
          <p>15. Those images, therefore, to which I have alluded,|| <lb/>
            and which, I observed, are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασίαι</foreign> by the Greeks, <note type="footnote"> * Pilariorum ac ventilatorum.] The pilarii had their name from <lb/>
            pila, a ball; and we can easily understand what sort of performances <lb/>
            theirs were. What the ventilatores did is not known; Turnebus <lb/>
            supposes that they were so called from ventus, because they made <lb/>
            things which they had in their hands abire, as it were, in ventos, <lb/>
            disappear in the air. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cum eo qu<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign>d, si calor et spiritus tulit, frequenter accidit, &amp;c.] <lb/>
            Spalding (ad ii. 4, 30) observes that cum eo qu<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign>d is equivalent to qu<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign> et <lb/>
            hoc accedit qu<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ</foreign>d. Gesner and others read quern si calor et spiritus <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            must be carefully cherished in our minds, and everything on <lb/>
            which we intend to speak, every person and every question, <lb/>
            and all the hopes and fears likely to be attendant on them, <lb/>
            must be kept full before our view, and admitted as it were <lb/>
            into our hearts; for it is strength of feeling combined with <lb/>
            energy of intellect, that renders us eloquent. Hence even to <lb/>
            the illiterate words are not wanting, if they be but roused by <lb/>
            some strong passion. 16. Our attention must also be fixed, <lb/>
            not merely on any single object, but on several in connexion, <lb/>
            just as, when we cast our eye along a straight road, we see <lb/>
            everything that is on it and about it, commanding a view, not <lb/>
            only of the end of it, but of the whole way to the end.</p>
          <p>17. The fear of failure, moreover, and the expectation of <lb/>
            praise for what we shall say, gives a spur to our exertions, and <lb/>
            it may seem strange that though the pen delights in seclusion, <lb/>
            and shrinks from the presence of a witness, extemporal <lb/>
            oratory is excited by a crowd of listeners, as the soldier by <lb/>
            the mustering of the standards; for the necessity of speaking <lb/>
            expels and urges forth our thoughts, however difficult to be <lb/>
            expressed, and the desire to please increases our efforts. So <lb/>
            much does everything look to reward, that even eloquence, <lb/>
            though it has the highest pleasure in the exercise of its own <lb/>
            powers, is yet greatly incited by the enjoyment of praise ani <lb/>
            reputation.</p>
          <p>18. But let no one feel such confidence in his talents, as to <lb/>
            hope that this power will come to him as soon as he attempts <lb/>
            oratory; but, as I directed with regard to meditation,. so, in <lb/>
            cultivating facility in extemporary speaking, we must advance <lb/>
            it, by slow degrees, from small beginnings to the highest <lb/>
            excellence; but it can neither be acquired nor retained <lb/>
            without practice. 19. It ought, however, to be attained to <lb/>
            such a degree, that premeditation, though safer, may not be <lb/>
            more effective; since many have had such command of language, <lb/>
            not only in prose, but even in verse, as Antipater of Sidon t <lb/>
            and Licinius Archias; ‡ for we must rely on Cicero's authority <lb/>
            with regard to them both ; not but that even in our own <lb/>
            times some have exercised this talent and still exercise it. I <lb/>
            mention the acquirement, however, not so much because 1 <note type="footnote"> * See c. 6, sect. 3. I read præcepimus with Gesner, instead of præ­ <lb/>
            cipimus, which is in Spalding's text. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero do Orat. iii. 50. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Cicero pro <unclear>Archill</unclear>, a. 8. </note> <pb n="305"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH VII.]"/><lb/>
            think it commendable in itself, (for it is of no practical value, <lb/>
            nor at all necessary,) as because I consider it a useful example <lb/>
            for those who require to be encouraged in the hope of attain <lb/>
            ing such facility, and who are in the course of preparation for <lb/>
            . the forum.</p>
          <p>20. Nor, again, would I ever wish, for my own part, to <lb/>
            have such confidence in my readiness to speak, as not to take <lb/>
            at least a short time, which may almost always be had, to <lb/>
            consider what I am going to say; and time indeed is always <lb/>
            allowed both on trials and in the forum. No one, assuredly. <lb/>
            can plead a cause which he has not studied. 21. Yet a per­ <lb/>
            verse kind of ambition moves some of our declaimers to <lb/>
            profess themselves ready to speak as soon as a case is laid <lb/>
            before them; and, what is the most vain and theatrical of all <lb/>
            their practices, they even ask for a word with which they may <lb/>
            commence. But Eloquence, in her turn, derides those who <lb/>
            thus insult her; and those who wish to appear learned to <lb/>
            fools are decidedly pronounced fools by the learned.</p>
          <p>22. Yet if any chance shall give rise to such a sudden necessity <lb/>
            for speaking extempore, we shall have need to exert our mind <lb/>
            with more than its usual activity ; we must fix our whole <lb/>
            attention on our matter, and relax, for the time, something of <lb/>
            our care about words, if we find it impossible to attend to <lb/>
            both. A slower pronunciation, too, and -a mode of speaking <lb/>
            with suspense and doubt, as it were, gives time for considera­ <lb/>
            tion ; yet we must manage so that we may seem to deliberate <lb/>
            .and not to hesitate. 23. To this cautious method of delivery <lb/>
            we may adhere as long as we are clearing the harbour, should the <lb/>
            wind drive us forward before our tackle is sufficiently pre­ <lb/>
            pared ; afterwards, as we proceed on our course, we shall fill <lb/>
            our sails and arrange our ropes by degrees, and pray that our <lb/>
            canvas may be filled with a prosperous gale. This will be <lb/>
            better than to launch forth on an empty torrent of words, so as to <lb/>
            be carried away with it, as by the blasts of a tempest, whither­ <lb/>
            soever it may wish to sweep us.</p>
          <p>24. But this talent requires to be kept up with no less <lb/>
            practice than it is acquired. An art,. indeed, once thoroughly <note type="footnote"> * Ars enim semel percepta non labitur; stilus quoque intermissions <lb/>
            vaullulum admodum de celeritate deperdit.] The conjunctions enim aud <lb/>
            quoque puzzle the commentators, and there is doubtless something <lb/>
            wrong in t-Le text, but how it is to be corrected, without violence to </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B X"/><lb/>
            learned, is never wholly lost. Even the pen, by disuse, loses <lb/>
            but very little of its readiness; while promptitude in speaking, <lb/>
            which depends on activity of thought, can be retained only <lb/>
            by exercise. Such exercise we may best use by speaking <lb/>
            daily in the hearing of several persons, especially of those for <lb/>
            whose judgment and opinion we have most regard; for it <lb/>
            rarely happens that a person is sufficiently severe with him­ <lb/>
            self.. Let us however rather speak alone than not speak at <lb/>
            all. 25. There is also another kind of exercise, that of medi. <lb/>
            tating upon whole subjects and going through them in silent <lb/>
            thought, (yet so as to speak as it were within ourselves,) an <lb/>
            exercise which may be pursued at all times and in all places, <lb/>
            when we are not actually engaged in any other occupation: <lb/>
            and it is in some degree more useful than the one which I <lb/>
            mentioned before it; for it is more accurately pursued than <lb/>
            that in which we are afraid to interrupt the continuity of our <lb/>
            speech t 26. Yet the other method, again, contributes more to <lb/>
            improve other qualifications, as strength of voice, flexibility of <lb/>
            features, and energy of gesture, which of itself, as I remarked,‡ <lb/>
            rouses the orator, and, as he waves his hand and stamps his <lb/>
            foot, excites him as lions are said to excite themselves by the <lb/>
            lashing of their tails.§</p>
          <p>27. But we must study at all times and in all places; for <lb/>
            there is scarcely a single one of our days so occupied that <lb/>
            some profitable attention may not be hastily devoted during <lb/>
            at least some portion of it, (as Cicero || says that Brutus used <lb/>
            to do,) to writing, or reading, or speaking. Caius Carboy even <note type="footnote"> the passage, is not apparent. Quintilian's meaning, however, is pretty <lb/>
            clear. I have given the passage the same turn with the French trans­ <lb/>
            lator in Didot's “ Collection des Auteurs Latins." </note><note type="footnote"> * Rarum est enim ut satis se quisque vereatur.] A man is apt to be too <lb/>
            indulgent to his own performances. </note><note type="footnote"> t Rather than interrupt the course of a speech that we deliver aloud, <lb/>

            in his tent, was accustomed to continue his exercises in <lb/>
            oratory. 28. Nor must we omit to notice the advice, which <lb/>
            is also approved by Cicero,* that no portion even of our <lb/>
            common conversation should ever be careless ; and that what <lb/>
            ever we say, and wherever we say it, should be as far as <lb/>
            possible excellent in its kind. As to writing, we must cer­ <lb/>
            tainly never write more than when we have to speak much <lb/>
            extempore; for by the use of the pen a weightiness will be <lb/>
            preserved in our matter, and that light facility of language, <lb/>
            which swims as it were on the surface, will be compressed <lb/>
            into a body ;t as husbandmen cut off the upper roots of the <lb/>
            vine, (which elevate it to the surface of the soil,) in order <lb/>
            that the lower roots may be strengthened by striking deeper. <lb/>
            29. And I know not whether both exercises, when we perform <lb/>
            them with care and assiduity, are not reciprocally beneficial, as it <lb/>
            appears that by writing we speak with greater accuracy, and by <lb/>
            speaking we write with greater ease. We must write, there­ <lb/>
            fore, as often as we have opportunity; if opportunity is not <lb/>
            allowed us, we must meditate; if we are precluded from both, <lb/>
            we must nevertheless endeavour that the orator may nut seem <lb/>
            to be caught at fault, nor the client left destitute of aid. <lb/>
            30. But it is the general practice among pleaders who have <lb/>
            much occupation, to write only the most essential parts, and <lb/>
            especially the commencements, of their speeches; to fix the <lb/>
            other portions that they bring from home in their memory by <lb/>
            meditation ; and to meet any unforeseen attacks with extem­ <lb/>
            poraneous replies.</p>
          <p>That Cicero adopted this method is evident from his own <lb/>
            memoranda.‡ But there are also in circulation memoranda of <lb/>
            other speakers, which have been found, perhaps,§ in the state <lb/>
            in which each had thrown them together when he was going <lb/>
            to speak, and have been arranged in the form of books; for <lb/>
            instance, the memoranda of the causes pleaded by Servius <lb/>

            memoranda * of which 1 am now speaking, are so carefully <lb/>
            arranged, that they appear to me to have been composed by <lb/>
            him to be handed down to posterity. 31. Those of Cicero, <lb/>
            which were intended only for his particular occasions, his <lb/>
            freedman Tiro collected ; and, in saying this, I do not speak <lb/>
            of them apologetically, as if I did not think very highly of <lb/>
            them, but intimate, on the contrary, that they are for that <lb/>
            reason more worthy of admiration.</p>
          <p>Under this head, I express my full approbation of short <lb/>
            notes, and of small memorandum-books which may be held in <lb/>
            the hand, and on which we may occasionally glance. 32. But <lb/>
            the method which Lænas recommends, of reducing what we <lb/>
            have written into summaries, or into short notes and heads, I <lb/>
            do not like; for our very dependence on these summaries <lb/>
            begets negligence in committing our matter to memory, and <lb/>
            disconnects and disfigures our speech. t I even think that <lb/>
            we should not write at all what we design to deliver from <lb/>
            memory; for, if we do so, it generally happens that our <lb/>
            thoughts fix us to the studied portions of our speech, and do <lb/>
            not allow us to try the fortune of the moment. Thus the <lb/>
            mind hangs in suspense and perplexity between the two,‡ <lb/>
            having lost sight of what was written, and yet not being a:. <lb/>
            liberty to imagine anything new. For treating on the memory <lb/>
            however, a place is appointed in the next book: but it cannot <lb/>
            be immediately subjoined to these remarks, because I must <lb/>
            speak of some other matters previously <note type="footnote"> * Those of Sulpicius. </note><note type="footnote"> t For, when some portions of what we have written in our larger <lb/>

          <p>Of speaking with propriety; in different causes, 1—5. In different <lb/>
            parts of the same cause, 6, 7. The orator's chief consideration is, <lb/>
            what is becoming, 8—11. What is becoming is generally found in <lb/>
            union with what is expedient, 12—14. Vanity and self-applause <lb/>
            always unbecoming in an orator, 15—17. Whether Cicero in <lb/>
            chargeable with this fault, 18—24. But an orator may some­ <lb/>
            times express confidence, 25, 26. Yet not so as to declare that his <lb/>
            judgment must be infallible, 27, 28. Other faults in orators <lb/>
            noticed, 29, SO. Different kinds of oratory are suited to different <lb/>
            speakers, 31—88. An orator should also adapt his style to the <lb/>
            characters of those for whom he pleads, 39—42. He must also <lb/>
            vary it to suit those to whom he addresses himself, 43—45. He <lb/>
            must also have regard to time and place, 46—48. To the nature <lb/>
            of the cause, 49—56. To the characters of those to whom he is <lb/>
            opposed, 57—67. How he may sometimes avoid offending those <lb/>
            against whom he speaks, 68 — 74. How the judge may be con­ <lb/>
            ciliated, 75—77. How an orator may notice points in which he is <lb/>
            conscious that -he himself, or his party, is vulnerable, 78—83. <lb/>
            How he may touch on delicate subjects, 84. How he may soften <lb/>
            his language in an attack on any one, 85—90. Excess in every <lb/>
            respect to be avoided, 91. Different kinds of oratory find favour <lb/>
            with different audiences, 92, 93.</p>
          <p>1. HAVING acquired, as is stated in the preceding book, the <lb/>
            ability of writing and thinking, as well as of speaking extempore <lb/>
            when necessity requires, our next study must be to speak with <lb/>
            aptitude, an excellence which Cicero shows to be the fourth* in <lb/>
            elocution, and which is indeed, in my opinion, the most <lb/>
            important of all. 2. For as the dress of oratory is various and <lb/>
            manifold, and different forms of it are suited to different <lb/>
            subjects, it will, unless it be thoroughly adapted to things and <lb/>
            persons, not only not add lustre to our eloquence, but will <lb/>
            even destroy the force of it, and give to our efforts an effect <lb/>
            contrary to that which we intended. Of what avail will it be <lb/>
            that our language is pure Latin, that it is expressive, elegant, <lb/>
            adorned with figures, and harmoniously arranged, unless it be <lb/>
            also adapted to establish the conclusions to which we wish the <lb/>
            judge to be led, and to confirm him in them ? 3. Of what <note type="footnote"> <lb/>
            * De Oral. iii. 10. " What sort of delivery can be better than that <lb/>
            of speaking in pure Latin, with perspicuity, with gracefulness, and with <lb/>
            aptitude and congruity tc the subject in question." </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="310"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            service will our eloquence be, if we adopt a grand style in trivial <lb/>
            causes, a poor and constrained style in such as are of high <lb/>
            moment, a florid style on grave subjects, a calm style when <lb/>
            forcible argument is necessary, a menacing style in depre­ <lb/>
            cation, a submissive style in spirited discussions, a fierce and <lb/>
            violent mode of speaking on topics intended to please ? The <lb/>
            same kind of result would be produced as when men are <lb/>
            disfigured. with necklaces, pearls, and long robes, which are the <lb/>
            ornaments of women, while a triumphal habit, than which <lb/>
            nothing can be imagined to add greater majesty to men, is to <lb/>
            women but an unbecoming encumbrance.</p>
          <p>4. On this subject Cicero briefly touches in his third book <lb/>
            de Oratore ;* and yet he may be thought not to have omitted <lb/>
            anything, when he says that one kind of style cannot suit every <lb/>
            cause, or every auditor, or every character, or every occasion. In <lb/>
            his Orator t he expresses the same remark in a not much <lb/>
            greater number of words. But in the de Oratore, Lucius <lb/>
            Crassus, as he is addressing himself to eminent orators, and <lb/>
            men of great learning, thinks it sufficient to intimate his <lb/>
            opinion to those who acknowledged the justice of it. 5. In <lb/>
            the Orator, too, Cicero himself, addressing Brutus, remarks <lb/>
            that what he says is well known to him, and that consequently <lb/>
            the subject is noticed by him but cursorily, though it is one of <lb/>
            great amplitude, and has been treated at great length by the <lb/>
            philosophers. I, however, undertaking to form an orator, <lb/>
            communicate these precepts not only to those who know, but <lb/>
            to those who are learning, and therefore indulgence must be <lb/>
            allowed me if I enter into the subject more fully.</p>
          <p>6. It must be understood, then, above all things, what <lb/>
            kinds of style are proper for conciliating, instructing, and <lb/>
            exciting the judge; and what objects we contemplate in the <lb/>
            several parts of our speech. We shall then neither use obso­ <lb/>
            lete, nor metaphorical, nor newly-coined words, in our exordium, <lb/>
            statement of facts, or series of arguments; nor shall we indulge <lb/>
            in flowing periods of studied elegance when our cause is to be <lb/>
            divided, and distinguished into parts; nor shall we choose a <lb/>
            low and ordinary sort of style, and of a loose texture, for our <lb/>
            peroration ; nor, when we ought to excite pity, shall we dry <note type="footnote">* C. 55. But Quintilian's words are not to be understood as if <lb/>
            there was nothing more in Cicero on this subject than what he quotes <lb/>
            Gesner. </note> <note type="footnote"> t C. 2L </note> <pb n="311"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            up the tears of our audience with jests; for the effect of all <lb/>
            ornament depends not so much on its own nature as on that of <lb/>
            the object to which it is applied; nor is it of more importance <lb/>
            what you say than where you say it. 7. But the whole art of <lb/>
            speaking with propriety depends not merely on our choice of <lb/>
            language, but has much also in common with invention of <lb/>
            matter; for if mere words have so much power, how much <lb/>
            greater power must thoughts have ? What was necessary to <lb/>
            be remarked, however, with regard to thoughts, I have noticed, <lb/>
            from time to time, in the proper places.</p>
          <p>8. It cannot be too earnestly inculcated, that he only will <lb/>
            speak with aptitude and propriety, who considers, not only <lb/>
            what is to the purpose, but what is becoming. Nor am I <lb/>
            ignorant that these two qualities of speaking are mostly <lb/>
            united; for what is becoming, is generally to the purpose ;* <lb/>
            nor are the minds of judges conciliated by anything more <lb/>
            than by the observance of decorum, or alienated by anything <lb/>
            more than by violations of it. 9. The two, however, are <lb/>
            sometimes at variance; and, when they are so, that which <lb/>
            is becoming will be allowed the preference over that which is <lb/>
            merely serviceable; for who does not know that nothing would <lb/>
            have been of greater service in procuring an acquittal for <lb/>
            Socrates, than the adoption of the ordinary mode of defence on <lb/>
            trials, the conciliation of the favour of the judges by a submis­ <lb/>
            sive address to them, and the careful refutation of the charges <lb/>
            brought against him?† 10. But such a course would have <lb/>
            been unbecoming to Socrates; and he therefore pleaded like a <lb/>
            man who thought himself deserving, not of punishment, but of <lb/>
            the highest honours; for, wisest of men as he was, he pre­ <lb/>
            ferred that what remained of his life should be lost rather than <lb/>
            that portion of it which was past; and since he was not <lb/>
            sufficiently understood by the men of his day, he committed <lb/>
            himself to the judgment of posterity, and purchased, by the <lb/>
            sacrifice of a short portion of extreme old age, a life that will <lb/>
            last for ever. 11. Though Lysias,‡ therefore, who was <note type="footnote"> * See the Introd. to b. viii. sect. 19. </note><note type="footnote"> t This subject is well known; and Gesner aptly refers to the <lb/>
            beginning of Xenophon's Apology of Socrates, where, in Zeune's <lb/>

            noticed. See also Diogenes Laertius, ii. 40, and his commentators. <lb/>

            esteemed the most accomplished orator of the time, offered <lb/>
            him a defence ready written, he declined making use of it, <lb/>
            saying, that though he thought it good, he did not consider <lb/>
            that it would become him. From this example, without <lb/>
            having recourse to any other, it is evident that the end to be <lb/>
            kept in view by the orator is not persuasion, but speaking <lb/>
            well,* since to persuade would sometimes be dishonourable ; <lb/>
            the conduct of Socrates was not conducive to his acquittal, <lb/>
            but, what was of greater importance, was honourable to his <lb/>
            character as a man.</p>
          <p>12. I myself, in making this distinction, and separating utility <lb/>
            from decorum, speak rather in conformity with the common <lb/>
            way of speaking, than according to the strictness of truth; <lb/>
            unless, indeed, the first Scipio Africanus,t who chose rather <lb/>
            to banish himself from his country than to maintain his in <lb/>
            tegrity against the charges of a mean tribune of the people, can <lb/>
            be supposed to have acted disadvantageously for his honour; <lb/>
            or unless Publius Rutilius, either when he adopted his almost <lb/>
            Socratic kind of defence, or when he preferred to remain in <lb/>
            exile at the time that Publius Sylla recalled him, can be <lb/>
            imagined to have been ignorant what was most proper for <lb/>
            him.‡ 13. These great men thought that the trivial con­ <lb/>
            siderations, which abject minds regard as of so much im­ <lb/>
            portance, are to be despised in comparison with true honour, <lb/>
            and are, in consequence, distinguished by the perpetual ad­ <lb/>
            miration of all ages. Nor let us indulge in so abject a way of <lb/>
            thinking as to consider, that what we allow to be honourable may <lb/>
            be unprofitable. 14. But any occasion for this distinction, <lb/>
            such as it is, very seldom occurs, since, in every kind of cause, <note type="footnote"> * See b. ii. c. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> + When he was accused by Nævius, a tribune of the people, of <lb/>

            was, " This is the anniversary of the day on which I defeated Hannibal <lb/>

            as I observed,. whatever is advantageous will generally be <lb/>
            becoming.</p>
          <p>There are some things of such a nature that they become <lb/>
            all persons at all times, and in all places, as to act and speak <lb/>
            honourably; and there are others, on the contrary, which <lb/>
            become no person at any time or in any place, as to act and <lb/>
            speak dishonourably. But things of less importance, and such <lb/>
            as hold a middle place between the two, are generally of such <lb/>
            a kind, that they are lightly regarded by some and more <lb/>
            seriously by others, and must appear either more or less <lb/>
            excusable, or more or less reprehensible, according as we look­ <lb/>
            to characters, times, places, or motives. 15. And as, in plead­ <lb/>
            ing, we speak either of what concerns others or what concerns <lb/>
            ourselves, we must make a just distinction between the two, <lb/>
            provided we bear in mind that there are many things improper <lb/>
            to be brought forward in either case.</p>
          <p>Above all things, every kind of self-laudation is unbecoming, <lb/>
            and especially praise of his own eloquence from an orator;t as <lb/>
            it not only gives offence to his audience, but generally creates: <lb/>
            in them even a dislike towards him. 16. Our mind has in it <lb/>
            something naturally sublime and haughty, and is impatient of <lb/>
            a superior; and hence we willingly raise the humble, or those <lb/>
            who submit to us, because, when we do so, we appear to our­ <lb/>
            selves greater than they; and when rivalry is absent, benevo­ <lb/>
            lence finds a place in us; but he who unreasonably exalts <lb/>
            himself seems to depress and despise us, yet not to make him­ <lb/>
            self greater so much as to try to make others less. 17. Hence-, <lb/>
            his inferiors envy him, (for envy is the vice of those who are, <lb/>
            unwilling to yield though unable to oppose,) his superiors <lb/>
            deride, and the judicious censure him. In general, too, we. <lb/>
            find, that the opinion of the arrogant concerning themselves <lb/>
            is unfounded; while, to persons of real merit, the conscious­ <lb/>
            ness of merit is sufficient.</p>
          <p>Cicero, in this respect, has been censured in no small <lb/>
            degree; although, in his speeches, he was much more of a <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 8. </note><note type="footnote"> † " Though arrogance of every kind is odious, yet for a speaker to <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            boaster of what he had done than of his abilities in speaking. <lb/>
            18. Indeed, he uttered such boasts, for the most part, not <lb/>
            without much appearance of reason, for he had either to de­ <lb/>
            fend those whose aid he had received in suppressing the <lb/>
            conspiracy of Catiline, or he had to justify himself against <lb/>
            popular odium, which he was so far from being able to with­ <lb/>
            stand, that he had to go into exile, as a punishment for <lb/>
            having saved his country ; so that his frequent allusions to <lb/>
            what he had achieved in his consulship, may be thought to <lb/>
            have been made, not more from vanity than for self-defence. <lb/>
            19. As to eloquence, at the same time that he allowed a full <lb/>
            measure of it to the pleaders on the opposite side, he never <lb/>
            claimed in his speeches any immoderate share of it to himself; <lb/>
            he says, If there be any ability in me, judges, and I am sensible <lb/>
            how little there is, &amp;c.; and, The more I feel my inability, the <lb/>
            more diligently have I endeavoured to make amends for it by <lb/>
            application, &amp;c.* 20. Even in contending against Quintus <lb/>
            Cæcilius, about the appointment of an accuser of Verres, <lb/>
            though it was of great importance which of the two should <lb/>
            appear the better qualified for pleading, yet he rather de­ <lb/>
            tracted from Cæcilius's talent in speaking than assumed any <lb/>
            superiority in it to himself, and said that he had not attained <lb/>
            eloquence, but had done everything in his power that he might <lb/>
            attain it. 21. It is only at times in his letters, when he is <lb/>
            writing familiarly to his friends, and occasionally in his <lb/>
            Dialogues, under another person's character, that he does <lb/>
            justice to his own eloquence.</p>
          <p>Yet I know not whether open self-applause is not more <lb/>
            tolerable, even from the very undisguisedness of the offence, <lb/>
            than the hypocritical boastfulness t of those who speak of <lb/>
            themselves as poor when they abound with wealth, as obscure <lb/>
            when they are of high rank, as weak when they have great <lb/>
            influence, as ignorant and incapable of speaking when they <note type="footnote"> * These are the commencements of the orations for Quintius and <lb/>

            are possessed of great eloquence. 22. It is an ostentatious <lb/>
            kind of vanity to speak thus ironically of ourselves. Let us <lb/>
            be content, therefore, to be praised by others, for it becomes us, <lb/>
            as Demosthenes says, to blush even when we hear other men's <lb/>
            commendations of ourselves.* I do not say that an orator <lb/>
            may not sometimes speak of what he has done, as Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes himself did in his defence of Ctesiphon;‡ but he so <lb/>
            qualified what he said, as to show that he was under the <lb/>
            necessity of saying it, and to throw the odium of it on him <lb/>
            who forced him to say it. 23. So Cicero, though he often <lb/>
            speaks of the suppression of Catiline's conspiracy, attributes <lb/>
            it sometimes to the meritorious efforts of the senate, some­ <lb/>
            times to the providence of the immortal gods. In speaking <lb/>
            against his enemies and calumniators, indeed, he generally <lb/>
            vindicates his claim to greater merit; for, when charges were <lb/>
            brought against his conduct, it was for him to justify it. <lb/>
            24. In his verses, I wish he had been more modest,‡ since <lb/>
            the malicious have never ceased to remark upon his <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            allowable; for who would blame such remarks as these:. <lb/>
            What am I to think ? That I am despised ? But I do not <lb/>
            see what there is, either in my life, or in the favour which I <lb/>
            experience, or in what I have done, or in my moderate share of <lb/>
            ability, for Antony to despise. 26. Or as he expresses himself, <lb/>
            a little afterwards, with somewhat more boldness : Would he <lb/>
            wish to engage with me in a contest of eloquence ? He would <lb/>
            then confer an obligation on me ; for what ampler field, what <lb/>
            more copious subject could I desire, than the opportunity of <lb/>
            speaking on behalf of myself and against Antony ?</p>
          <p>27. Those speakers who are arrogant, who assert that they <lb/>
            have convinced themselves of the goodness of their cause, or <lb/>
            otherwise they would not have undertaken it; for judges listen <lb/>
            with unwillingness to a pleader who anticipates their decision; <lb/>
            and that which was granted to Pythagoras by his disciples, <lb/>
            that his Ipse dixit should settle a question, is not likely to be <lb/>
            allowed to an advocate by his opponents. 28. But confidence <lb/>
            in speakers will be more or less blamable according to their <lb/>
            characters; for it is sometimes justified by their age, dignity <lb/>
            or authority; and yet these will hardly be so great in any <lb/>
            orator as not to require that his dependence on them should be <lb/>
            tempered with some degree of modesty, as must be the case in <lb/>
            all particulars in which a pleader draws arguments from his <lb/>
            own person. It would have been somewhat too arrogant, <lb/>
            perhaps, if Cicero had denied, when he was defending himself, <lb/>
            that to be the son of a Roman knight ought to be made a <lb/>
            ground of accusation against him; but he turned the charge <lb/>
            even in his favour, by identifying his own dignity with that of <lb/>
            his judges, and saying, But that I am the son of a Roman, <lb/>
            knight should assuredly never have been alleged as a reproach <lb/>
            against me by the accusers in any cause, while you are trying it <lb/>
            and while I am defending it before you.t</p>
          <p>29. An impudent, noisy, and angry tone, is unbecoming in <lb/>
            all speakers; but the more remarkable a speaker is for age, <lb/>
            or dignity, or experience, the more blamable he is if he <lb/>
            adopts it. Yet we see some wranglers held under no <lb/>
            restraint, either by respect for the judges, or by regard to the <lb/>
            forms and practices of pleading; and from this very character <lb/>
            of their mind, it is evident that they have no consideration for <lb/>
            their honour either in undertaking causes or in pleading them. <note type="footnote"> * Cic Philipp. it. 1. </note><note type="footnote">t Cic. pro Cæl. c. 2. </note> <pb n="317"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            30. For men's speech is generally an indication of their <lb/>
            disposition, and lays open the secrets of their minds; and it is <lb/>
            not without reason that the Greeks have made it a proverb <lb/>
            that As a man lives, so also he speaks.* There are faults also <lb/>
            of a still meaner nature ; grovelling adulation, studied buf­ <lb/>
            foonery, disregard of modesty in respect to things or words of <lb/>
            an offensive or indecent kind, and violations of dignity on all <lb/>
            occasions ; faults which are oftenest seen in those who are too <lb/>
            anxious either to please or to amuse.</p>
          <p>31. All kinds of oratory, too, are not alike suitable to all <lb/>
            speakers.</p>
          <p>Thus a copious, lofty, bold, and florid style would not be so <lb/>
            becoming to old men as one that is close, mild, and precise ; <lb/>
            such a one as Cicero† wished us to understand when he said <lb/>
            that his style was growing grey; just as that age, also, is not <lb/>
            adapted for wearing garments gleaming with purple and scarlet. <lb/>
            32. In young men, on the other hand, an exuberant and <lb/>
            somewhat daring style is well received ; while a dry, circum <lb/>
            spect, and concise manner of speaking is offensive in them <lb/>
            from its very affectation of gravity; as in regard to manners, <lb/>
            the austerity of old men is considered as quite premature in <lb/>
            the young.</p>
          <p>33. A plain style suits military men. To those who make <lb/>
            an ostentatious profession of philosophy, as some do, most of <lb/>
            the embellishments of speech are by no means becoming, and <lb/>
            especially those which have reference to the passions, which <lb/>
            they regard as vices. Extraordinary elegance of diction, too, <lb/>
            and studied harmony of periods, are altogether foreign to <lb/>
            their pursuits. 34. Not only florid expressions, such as these <lb/>
            of Cicero, Rocks and deserts respond to the voice of the poet,‡ <lb/>
            but even those .)f a more vigorous and forcible character, as, / <lb/>
            now implore and attest Tou, you, I say, 0 Alban hills and <lb/>
            groves, and tou, O dismantled altars of the Albans, united and <lb/>
            coeval with the religion of the people of Rome,§ are utterly <lb/>
            unsuited to the beard and solemnity of the philosopher. <lb/>
            35. But the man who is desirous of civil distinction, the man <lb/>
            of sound sense, who devotes himself, not to idle disputations, <lb/>
            but to the management of public affairs, from which those who <note type="footnote"> * A saying attributed to Solon. See Erasm. Adag. i. 6, 50. Menag. <lb/>

            call themselves philosophers have as far as possible withdrawn <lb/>
            themselves, will freely use whatever ornaments of style may <lb/>
            tend to effect the object which he has in view when he speaks, <lb/>
            having previously resolved in his mind not to recommend <lb/>
            anything but what is honourable.</p>
          <p>36. There is a style of oratory that becomes princes, which <lb/>
            others would hardly be allowed to assume. The mode of <lb/>
            speaking suited to military commanders, also, and eminent <lb/>
            conquerors, is in a great degree distinct from that of other <lb/>
            men. In this kind of style Pompey was an extremely eloquent <lb/>
            narrator of his exploits; and Cato, who killed himself in the <lb/>
            civil war, was an able speaker in the senate. 37. The same <lb/>
            language will often be characterized as freedom in one person, <lb/>
            folly in another, and pride in a third. The reproaches ad. <lb/>
            dressed by Thersites to Agamemnon* are regarded with <lb/>
            derision ; put them into the mouth of Diomede, or any one of <lb/>
            his equals, they will exhibit only greatness of spirit. Should <lb/>
            I regard you as a consul, said Lucius Crassus to Philippus,† <lb/>
            when you do not regard me as a senator ? This is the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of a noble magnanimity, yet we should not think it <lb/>
            proper for every one to utter it. 38. Some one of the poets ‡ <lb/>
            says that he does not care much whether Cæsar were a black <lb/>
            man or- a white; this is folly; but if Cæsar had used the <lb/>
            same expression with regard to the poet, it would have been <lb/>
            pride.</p>
          <p>There is great regard paid to character among the tragic <lb/>
            and comic poets; for they introduce a variety of persons <lb/>
            accurately distinguished. Similar discrimination used to be <lb/>
            observed by those who wrote speeches for others ;§ and it is <lb/>
            observed by declaimers, for we do not always declaim as <lb/>
            pleaders of a cause, but very frequently as parties concerned <lb/>
            in it.</p>
          <p>39. But even in the causes in which we plead as advocates, <lb/>
            the same difference should be carefully observed; for we often <lb/>
            take upon ourselves the character of others, and speak, as it <lb/>
            were. with other persons' mouths; and we must exhibit in <note type="footnote"> * II. ii. 225, seqq. </note><note type="footnote">t See vili. 3, 89; Cic. de Orat. iii. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Aliquis poetarum.] We may observe with how much contempt he <lb/>

            those to whom we adapt our voice, their exact peculiarities of <lb/>
            manner. Publius Clodius is represented as speaking in one <lb/>
            way, Appius Cæcus in another; the father, in the comedy of <lb/>
            Cæcilius, is made to express himself in one style, the father. <lb/>
            in the comedy of Terence, in another. 40. What could be <lb/>
            more brutal than the words of the lictor of Verres, To see him, <lb/>
            you must pay so much ?† What could be more magnanimous <lb/>
            than the behaviour of the Roman, from whom the only <lb/>
            exclamation heard, amidst all the tortures of scourging, was, <lb/>
            I am a Roman citizen ? How suitable is the language used <lb/>
            in the peroration of the speech for Milo, to a man who, in <lb/>
            defence of the commonwealth, had so often curbed a seditious <lb/>
            citizen, and who had, at last, triumphed over his plots by <lb/>
            valour ?‡ 41. Not only, indeed, are there as many various points <lb/>
            to be observed in prosopopeiæ§ as in the cause itself, but even <lb/>
            more, as in them we assume the characters of children, women, <lb/>
            nations, || and even of voiceless objects; and in regard to all of <lb/>
            them, propriety must be observed. 42. The same care is to be <lb/>
            taken with respect to those for whom we plead; for, in <lb/>
            speaking for different characters we must often adopt different <lb/>
            styles, according as our client is of high or low station, popular <lb/>
            or unpopular; noting, at the same time, the difference in <lb/>
            their principles of action and in their past lives. As to the <lb/>
            orator himself, the qualities that will recommend him most <lb/>
            are courtesy, mildness, good temper, and benevolence. But <lb/>
            qualities of an opposite kind will, sometimes, be very becoming <lb/>
            in a speaker of high moral character, as he may testify hatred <lb/>
            of the wicked, concern on behalf of the public, and zeal I0I <lb/>
            the punishment of offences and crimes; and, indeed, as I said <lb/>
            at first,¶ every kind of honourable sentiment will become him.</p>
          <p>43. Nor is it of importance only what our own character is, <lb/>
            and for whom we plead, but to whom we address ourselves ; for <lb/>
            rank and power make a great difference; and the same manner <lb/>
            of speaking is not equally proper before a prince, a magistrate, <lb/>
            a senator, and a private person, or a mere free citizen; nor are <note type="footnote"> * See Cic. pro Cæl. c. 16. </note><note type="footnote">t See Quint. ix. 4, 7., 102; iv. 2, 106. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Comp. iv. 1, 25; 5, 10. </note><note type="footnote"> § Comp. in. 8, 49; ix. 2, 31.

            conducted in the same tone. 44. For in proportion as anxiety <lb/>
            and care, and every engine set to work, as it were, for strength <lb/>
            ening argument, is becoming in the orator who pleads in a <lb/>
            capital cause ; so, in cases and trials of smaller moment,* <lb/>
            such solicitude would be but foolish, and he who, sitting† to <lb/>
            speak before an umpire on some unimportant question, should <lb/>
            make a declaration like that of Cicero,‡ that he was not only <lb/>
            disturbed in mind, but that he felt a trembling through his <lb/>
            whole frame, would be justly ridiculed. 45. Who, indeed, <lb/>
            does not know, that the gravity of the senate demands one <lb/>
            sort of eloquence, and the levity of a popular assembly another, <lb/>
            when, even before single judges, the same mode of address <lb/>
            that suits serious characters, is not adapted to those of a lighter <lb/>
            cast; the same manner that is proper in speaking to a man of <lb/>
            learning, is improper in speaking to a military or uneducated <lb/>
            man ; and our language must sometimes be lowered and quali­ <lb/>
            fied, lest the judge should be unable to comprehend or see the <lb/>
            tenor of it?</p>
          <p>46. Time and place, also, require a due degree of observa­ <lb/>
            tion ; the occasion on which an orator speaks may be one of <lb/>
            seriousness, or one of rejoicing: the time allowed him may be <lb/>
            unlimited or limited ; and to all such circumstances his speech <lb/>
            must be adapted. 47. It makes a great difference, too, whether <lb/>
            we speak in a public or private place, in one that is populous <lb/>
            or unfrequented, in a foreign city or in our own, in a camp or <lb/>
            in the forum; each of these places requires its own peculiar <lb/>
            form and style of eloquence; as, even in other affairs of life, <lb/>
            the same mode of proceeding is not equally suitable in the <lb/>
            forum, the senate, the Campus Martius, the theatre, and in <lb/>
            our own houses; and many things, which are not reprehensible <lb/>
            in their own nature, and are sometimes absolutely necessary, <lb/>
            are counted unseemly if done in any other place than where <lb/>
            custom authorizes.</p>
          <p>48. How much more elegance and refinement demonstrative <lb/>
             <note type="footnote"> * Spalding's text has in parvis rebus judicibusque, but it would <lb/>

            have already observed.*</p>
          <p>To this it is also to be added, that many eminent excel­ <lb/>
            lences of oratory are rendered unsuitable to certain causes by <lb/>
            the nature of them. 49. Would any one endure to hear an <lb/>
            accused person, in danger of losing his life, especially if <lb/>
            pleading for himself before his conqueror or his sovereign, <lb/>
            indulge in frequent metaphors, in words either of his own <lb/>
            coining or studiously fetched from remote antiquity, in a style <lb/>
            as far removed as possible from common usage, in flowing <lb/>
            periods and florid common places, and fine thoughts ? Would <lb/>
            not all such elegances destroy that appearance of solicitude <lb/>
            natural to a man in peril, and deprive him of the aid of <lb/>
            pity, which is necessary to be sought, even by the innocent? <lb/>
            50. Would any one be moved at the fate of him, whom, in so <lb/>
            perilous a situation, he should see swelling with vanity and <lb/>
            self-conceit, and making an ambitious display of oratory? <lb/>
            Would he not rather feel alienated from a man, who, under <lb/>
            an accusation, should hunt for words, feel anxiety about his <lb/>
            reputation for talent, and consider himself at leisure to be <lb/>
            eloquent? 5J. This Marcus Cælius seems to me to have <lb/>
            admirably shown,! when he defended himself on his trial for <lb/>
            an assault, saying, Lest to any one of you, judges, or to any of <lb/>
            all those here to plead against me, any look of mine should <lb/>
            seem offensive, or any expression too presumptuous, or, what is <lb/>
            the least‡ however of the three, any gesture at all arrogant, &amp;c <lb/>
            52. Some pleadings consist wholly in pacifying,§ deprecating,|| <lb/>
            and making confession, and ought we to weep in fine thoughts ? <lb/>
            Will epiphonemata,¶ or entbymemes, prevail upon judges ? <lb/>
            Will not whatever is superadded to genuine feeling, diminish <lb/>
            its whole force, and dispel compassion by an appearance of <lb/>
            unconcern ? 53. If a father has to demand justice for the death <lb/>

            will he, instead of being content* with giving a brief and direct <lb/>
            statement of the matter, study that grace of delivery in his <lb/>
            narrative, which depends on the use of pure and perspicuous <lb/>
            language? Will he count his arguments upon his fingers, <lb/>
            aim at exact nicety in his propositions and divisions, and <lb/>
            deliver himself, as is commonly the case in those parts of <lb/>
            speeches, without the least manifestation of feeling? 54. <lb/>
            Whither, in the meantime, will his grief have fled? How <lb/>
            have his tears been dried ? Whence has so calm a regard to <lb/>
            the precepts of art proceeded? Will not his speech be rather <lb/>
            a prolonged groan, from the exordium to the last word, and <lb/>
            will not the same look of sadness be invariably maintained by <lb/>
            him, if he wishes to transfuse a portion of his own sorrowful <lb/>
            feeling into the breasts of his audience, a feeling, which, if he <lb/>
            once abates it, he will never revive in them? 55. By those <lb/>
            learning to declaim, (for I feel no reluctance to look back to <lb/>
            what was formerly my own employment, and to think of the <lb/>
            benefit of the youth once under my care,) these proprieties <lb/>
            ought to be observed with the utmost strictness, inasmuch <lb/>
            as there are exhibited, in the schools, the feelings of a great <lb/>
            variety of characters, which we take upon ourselves, not as <lb/>
            pleaders for others, but as if we had actually experienced what <lb/>
            we say; 56. for example, cases of the following kind are fre <lb/>
            quently supposed, in which persons request of the senate leave <lb/>
            to put themselves to death,! either on account of some great <lb/>
            misfortune, or from remorse for some crime; and in such <lb/>
            cases it is not only unbecoming to adopt a chanting tone.‡ <lb/>
            a fault which has become universal, or to indulge in fine <lb/>
            language, but it is improper even to pursue a train of argu­ <lb/>
            ment, unless feeling, indeed, be mixed with it, and mixed to <lb/>
            such a degree, that it may predominate over proof; for he <lb/>
            who in pleading can intermit his grief, may be thought capable <lb/>
            of laying it aside altogether.</p>
          <p>57. I know not, however, whether the observance of the <lb/>
            decorum of which we are speaking, should not be maintained <lb/>
            with even more scrupulosity towards those against whom we <lb/>
            plead than towards others; for we should undoubtedly make <note type="footnote"> * Spalding saw the necessity of reading protulisse non contentus, but <lb/>

            it our care, in every case of accusation, to appear to have en <lb/>
            gaged in it with reluctance. Hence I am extremely offended <lb/>
            with the remark of Cassius Severus,* Good gods, 4 am alive, <lb/>
            and I see, what may, well give me pleasure to be alive, Asprenas <lb/>
            in the condition of a criminal; Severus may be thought to <lb/>
            have accused him, not from any just or necessary cause, but <lb/>
            for the pleasure of being his accuser. 58. In addition to this <lb/>
            observance of what is becoming, too, which is common to all <lb/>
            cases, certain subjects require a peculiar tenderness of manage­ <lb/>
            ment. Thus the son, who shall apply for the appointment of <lb/>
            a guardian over his father's property ,f ought to testify concern <lb/>
            at his father's unsoundness of mind; and a father who brings <lb/>
            charges, however grievous, against his son, ought to show <lb/>
            that the necessity of doing so is the greatest affliction to him; <lb/>
            and this feeling he should exhibit, not in a few words only, <lb/>
            but through the whole texture of his speech, so that he may <lb/>
            appear to speak, not only with his lips, but from the bottom <lb/>
            of his heart. 59. A guardian, also, if his ward make allega­ <lb/>
            tions against him, should never manifest towards him resent­ <lb/>
            ment of such a nature that traces of affection and sacred <lb/>
            regard for the memory of his father may not be apparent <lb/>
            through it. How a cause ought to be pleaded by a son against <lb/>
            a father who renounces him, and by a husband against a wife <lb/>
            who accuses him of ill-treating her, I have remarked, I <lb/>
            believe, in the seventh book ;‡ when we may properly plead <lb/>
            our own cause, and when we should employ the services of an <lb/>
            advocate, the fourth book,§ in which directions are given <lb/>
            respecting the exordium, shows.</p>
          <p>60. That there may be something becoming, or something <lb/>
            offensive, in mere words, no one can doubt. A remark, there­ <lb/>
            fore, seems necessary to be added with reference to a point cer­ <lb/>
            tainly of extreme difficulty; the consideration, namely, how <lb/>
            those things which are by no means inviting in their nature, <lb/>
            and of which, if choice were allowed us, we had rather not <lb/>
            speak, may nevertheless be expressed by us without inde­ <lb/>
            corum. 61. What can wear a more disagreeable aspect, or <lb/>
            what are the ears of men more unwilling to hear, than a case <lb/>
            in which a son, or the advocates of a son, have to plead <lb/>
            against a mother ? Yet such pleading is sometimes necessary, <note type="footnote"> * Comp. x, 1, 22. </note><note type="footnote">t See vii. 4, 11. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ C. 4, sect. 24. </note><note type="footnote">§ C. 1, sect. 46. </note> <note type="footnote"> y a </note> <pb n="324"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            as in the cause of Cluentius Habitus; though it need not <lb/>
            always be conducted in the same way as Cicero has chosen <lb/>
            in speaking against Sassia; not that he did not proceed with <lb/>
            the greatest judgment, but because it is of importance to con­ <lb/>
            sider, in reference to the particular case, in what respect, and <lb/>
            by what means, the mother has sought to commit injury.* 62. <lb/>
            Sassia, as she had attempted the lifer of -her son openly, de­ <lb/>
            served to be assailed with great severity. Yet two points, <lb/>
            which required particular attention, Cicero has managed ad­ <lb/>
            mirably ; the first, not to forget the reverence due to parents; <lb/>
            the second, to demonstrate most carefully, by going far back <lb/>
            into causes, that what he was to say against the mother was <lb/>
            not only proper to be said, but absolutely necessary. 63. To <lb/>
            show the propriety of his mode of proceeding was accordingly <lb/>
            his first object, though it had no immediate bearing on the <lb/>
            question in hand; so much was he convinced that, in so <lb/>
            delicate and difficult a cause, the first consideration should be <lb/>
            what was due to decorum. Thus he made the name of parent <lb/>
            cast odium, not upon the son, but upon her against whom he <lb/>
            spoke.</p>
          <p>64. A mother may, however, be sometimes opposed to her <lb/>
            son in a case of less seriousness or bitterness; and a more <lb/>
            gentle and submissive tone of pleading, on behalf of the son, <lb/>
            will then be proper; for, by showing a readiness to make all <lb/>
            due satisfaction, we shall lessen any ill feeling that may arise <lb/>
            against ourselves, and may even divert it to the opposite <lb/>
            party; and if it be manifest that the son is deeply concerned <lb/>
            at being obliged to appear against his mother, it will be be­ <lb/>
            lieved that the fault is not on his side, and he will at once <lb/>
            become an object of compassion. 65. It will be well, too. to <lb/>
            throw the blame of the proceeding on other parties, that it <lb/>
            may be thought to have had its origin in their malice, and to <lb/>
            protest that we will endure to the utmost and make no harsh <lb/>
            reply; so that if we have, in fact, no opportunity of showing <lb/>
            bitterness, we may appear to have intentionally abstained from <lb/>
            it. If any point, again, has to be urged against the mother, <lb/>
            it is the duty of the son's advocate to make it appear that he <lb/>
            urges it, not with his client's consent, but because the interest <lb/>
            of his cause compels him. Thus both the son and his advocate <lb/>
            may gain praise. <note type="footnote"> * Lædat.] Scilicet mater ilia, in quam dicimus. Spalding. </note> <pb n="325"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/></p>
          <p>What 1 have said with respect to a mother, may be regarded <lb/>
            as equally applicable to either parent; for I am aware that <lb/>
            between fathers and sons, after emancipation* has taken place, <lb/>
            lawsuits sometimes occur. 66. In opposing other relatives, <lb/>
            also, we must make it our care that we may be thought to have <lb/>
            spoken against them unwillingly, from necessity, and with <lb/>
            forbearance; and this solicitude should be greater or less <lb/>
            according to the respect due to each particular person. The <lb/>
            same moderation should be observed in speaking for freed­ <lb/>
            men against their patrons; and, to say much in a few words, <lb/>
            it will never be seemly to plead against such persons in a <lb/>
            style which we should be extremely displeased to find men of <lb/>
            that condition adopt against ourselves.</p>
          <p>67. The same consideration must at times be shown in <lb/>
            opposing personages of great dignity; and some justification <lb/>
            must be offered for the liberty which we assume, lest any one <lb/>
            should think that we indulge a wanton inclination, or gratify <lb/>
            our vanity, in wounding them. Thus Cicero, though he <lb/>
            had to speak with the utmost severity against Cutta,† since <lb/>
            the case of Publius Oppius could not otherwise have been <lb/>
            pleaded, yet apologized for the necessity of doing his duty in a <lb/>
            long preface. 68. Sometimes, too, it may be proper to spare or <lb/>
            deal gently with persons of an inferior condition, especially if <lb/>
            they are young. Such moderation Cicero observes in speaking <lb/>
            for Cælius against Atratinus,‡ appearing, not to attack him <lb/>
            like an adversary, but almost to admonish him like a father; <lb/>
            for he was both of noble birth and a youth, and had come <lb/>
            forward to accuse Cælius not without just ground for com­ <lb/>
            plaint.</p>
          <p>But in moderating our conduct towards those, in regard to <lb/>
            whom proofs of our forbearance are to be made apparent to the <lb/>
            judge or the rest of the audience, there may be comparatively <lb/>
            little difficulty; in cases where we fear to offend those in <lb/>
            opposition to whom we plead, we may feel greater embar­ <note type="footnote"> * Emancipatio was an imaginary sale, by which a son was set free <lb/>

            rassment. 69. T.vo antagonists of that kind were opposed to <lb/>
            Cicero, when he was pleading for Muræna, in the persons <lb/>
            of Marcus Cato and Servius Sulpicius. Yet how delicately <lb/>
            does he deny Sulpicius, after allowing him all other <lb/>
            merits, the art of successfully standing for the consulship! <lb/>
            What else was there, indeed, in which a man of noble <lb/>
            birth, and of high reputation for legal knowledge, would <lb/>
            with less regret acknowledge himself defeated ? How ably <lb/>
            has he stated his reasons for undertaking the defence of <lb/>
            Muræna, when he says that he supported the claims of Sul­ <lb/>
            picius against the election of Muræna to office, but that he <lb/>
            should not have thought himself justified in not defending <lb/>
            Muræna against a capital accusation! 70. With how gentle a <lb/>
            touch, too, has he handled Cato !* After testifying the highest <lb/>
            admiration for his character, he proceeds to represent it as <lb/>
            having become hardened in some points, not through his own <lb/>
            fault, but through that of the sect of the Stoics; so that we <lb/>
            might suppose that there had occurred between them, not a judi­ <lb/>
            cial contest, but a philosophical discussion. 71. It is certainly, <lb/>
            then, the best of rules, and the surest of all precepts, to follow <lb/>
            the example of the illustrious orator, and, when you wish to <lb/>
            deny a person any particular excellence without offending him, <lb/>
            to grant him every other good quality, observing that in this <lb/>
            respect alone is he less judicious than in others, adding, if <lb/>
            possible, the reason why such is the case, as, that he has been <lb/>
            a little too obstinate, or credulous, or angry, or that he is <lb/>
            incited by other persons. 72. This may serve for a common <lb/>
            mode of qualifying our language in all such cases, if there <lb/>
            appear, through the whole course of our argument a regard <lb/>
            not only to what is honourable, but to what is kind. There <lb/>
            should also seem to be the best of reasons for what we say; <lb/>
            and we should express ourselves, not only with moderation, <lb/>
            but as if under the compulsion of necessity.</p>
          <p>73. It is a different case from this, but not so difficult, <lb/>
            when we are obliged to commend certain acts of persons <lb/>
            otherwise of ill repute, or objects of dislike to us ; for we <lb/>
            must praise that which deserves praise, in whatever character <lb/>
            it be found. Cicero pleaded for Gabinius and Publius Vati. <note type="footnote"> * A divine passage, c. 29, set. Gesner. </note> <pb n="327"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            nius,* men who had previously been his greatest enemies, and <lb/>
            against whom he had even written orations; but the course <lb/>
            which he adopted is justified by his declaration that he was <lb/>
            anxious, not about his reputation for ability, but about his <lb/>
            honour. 74. His proceeding on the trial of Cluentiust was <lb/>
            attended with greater difficulty, as he was obliged to assert <lb/>
            Scamander to be guilty, whose cause he had before pleaded. <lb/>
            But he extricates himself from his embarrassment most grace­ <lb/>
            fully, alleging in his defence the importunity of those by whom <lb/>
            Scamander had been introduced to him, and his own extreme <lb/>
            youth; whereas he would have greatly injured his reputation, <lb/>
            if he had made himself appear to be one who would rashly <lb/>
            undertake the defence of the guilty, especially in so suspicious <lb/>
            a cause.</p>
          <p>75. In speaking before a judge ‡ who is adverse to the <lb/>
            cause which we have undertaken, either from regard to another <lb/>
            person's interest or his own, though to convince him may be <lb/>
            very difficult, yet the proper mode of addressing him is very <lb/>
            clear; for we must represent that through confidence in his <lb/>
            justice we have no fear for our cause. We must also stimu­ <lb/>
            late him to respect his honour, observing that his integrity <lb/>
            and conscientiousness will be the more celebrated, the less he <lb/>
            consults his resentment or private interest in forming his <lb/>
            decision. 76. We may proceed in the same manner, also, <lb/>
            before judges from whom we have appealed, if we should be <lb/>
            sent back to them again ; alleging some plea of necessity, if it <lb/>
            be consistent with our cause, or of error, or suspicion.§ The <lb/>
            safest mode, however, is to express repentance, and to offer <lb/>
            atonement for our fault; and we must render the judge, by <lb/>
            every artifice in our power, afraid of incurring disgrace by <lb/>
            sacrificing our cause to his resentment. <note type="footnote"> * Concerning Gabinius see Cic. pro Rabir. Post. c. 8; Val. Max. IV. <lb/>

          <p>77. The cause upon which a judge has already given a <lb/>
            division, may sometimes happen, from particular circum­ <lb/>
            stances, to come before him again, and he may have to try it <lb/>
            a second time. In such a case it is common to observe that <lb/>
            we should not have entered on a discussion of his sentence <lb/>
            before any other judge, as it ought to be reversed only by <lb/>
            himself, but that certain particulars in the affair were unknown <lb/>
            to us, (if the nature of the cause allows us to say so,) or that <lb/>
            witnesses were wanting, or (what must be advanced with great <lb/>
            caution, and only if nothing else can be urged) that the <lb/>
            pleaders did not fully discharge their duty. 78. Even if we <lb/>
            have to plead a cause a second time, too, before other judges, <lb/>
            as in a second suit for the liberty of an individual,. or of cases <lb/>
            that come before a second section of the centumviri,t after our <lb/>
            side has been defeated, it will be most proper, whenever it is <lb/>
            practicable, to express respect for the opinion of the former <lb/>
            judges; a point on which I have spoken more fully in the <lb/>
            part where I have treated of proofs.‡</p>
          <p>79. It may happen, also, that we may have to censure in <lb/>
            others what we have done ourselves ; thus Tubero makes it a <lb/>
            charge against Ligarius that he was in Africa; thus some who <lb/>
            have been found guilty of bribery, have brought others to trial <lb/>
            for the same crime, for the sake of recovering their position as <lb/>
            citizens; § and thus, in the declamations of the schools, a <lb/>
            young man who is himself extravagant accuses his father of <lb/>
            extravagance. How such proceedings can be plausibly con­ <lb/>
            ducted, I, for my own part, do not see, unless there be <lb/>
            discovered something that makes a difference in the two cases, <lb/>
            as character, age, circumstances, motives, place, or intention. <lb/>
            80. Tubero pleads that he accompanied his father into Africa <lb/>
            when young, who was sent thither by the senate, not to take <lb/>
            part in the war, but to buy corn, and withdrew from his party <note type="footnote"> * In secundâ assertione.] Assertio secunda is a second trial de liberali <lb/>

            as soon as he found opportunity; but that Ligarius, on the <lb/>
            contrary, persevered in his course, and kept on the side, not <lb/>
            of Pompey, between whom and Cæsar there was a contest for <lb/>
            the chief power, though both of them wished well to their <lb/>
            country, but of Juba and the Africans, who were the greatest <lb/>
            enemies to the Roman people. 81. It is indeed very easy to <lb/>
            impute guilt to others, when we own ourselves guilty ; but this <lb/>
            is the part of an informer, not of a pleader ;* and if no ground <lb/>
            of excuse is available, contrition is the only thing that can <lb/>
            recommend us to favour; for he may be thought to have <lb/>
            sufficiently corrected himself who has been led into detestation <lb/>
            of the errors which he has committed. Some characters, how­ <lb/>
            ever, may offer such censure not inexcusably, from the very <lb/>
            nature of the matter to which it refers; as when a father <lb/>
            disinherits a son, the offspring of a harlot, because he has mar­ <lb/>
            ried a harlot. 82. This is a suppositious case in the schools, <lb/>
            but it is a case that may really happen ; and the father may <lb/>
            offer many arguments not unbecomingly in justification of his <lb/>
            conduct; as, that it is the wish of all parents to have children <lb/>
            of higher character than themselves, (since, if he had a daughter <lb/>
            instead of a son, her mother, though a harlot, would have <lb/>
            desired her to be chastely brought up,) or that he himself was <lb/>
            of a humbler condition, (supposing that he can fairly say this,) <lb/>
            or that he had no father to admonish him ; 83. and that his <lb/>
            son should have been the less willing to form such a union. <lb/>
            that he might not revive the disgrace of his family, and <lb/>
            reproach his father with his marriage, and his mother with the <lb/>
            distresses of the early part of her life, and that he might not <lb/>
            give a precedent of such a marriage for his own children to <lb/>
            follow. Some glaring turpitude, also, may be supposed in the <lb/>
            character of the son's mistress, on which his father cannot nowt <lb/>
            look with indulgence. Other arguments I omit; for I am not <lb/>
            now composing a declamation, only showing that a pleader <lb/>
            may sometimes make an advantageous use even of circum­ <lb/>
            stances that appear to be strongly against him. 84. It is a case <lb/>
            of greater embarrassment to an advocate, when he has to com <lb/>
            plain of things that he is ashamed to mention, as corporeal <note type="footnote"> * He that accuses others of crimes of which he himself is guilty, <lb/>

            dishonour, especially in reference to males, or other outrages.* <lb/>
            I say nothing of the possibility of the sufferer speaking for <lb/>
            himself, for what else would become him but to groan and <lb/>
            weep, and express detestation of life, leaving the judge <lb/>
            rather to divine his grief than to hear it stated? But the <lb/>
            advocate will also have to exhibit similar feelings ;t since this <lb/>
            kind of injury causes more shame to those who endure it than <lb/>
            to those who inflict it.</p>
          <p>85. Asperity of language, when a speaker feels inclined to <lb/>
            indulge in it, must, in most cases, be tempered with a mixture <lb/>
            of another tone, such as Cicero adopted in pleading for the <lb/>
            children of the proscribed.‡ What, indeed, could be more <lb/>
            cruel, than that men descended from honourable fathers and <lb/>
            forefathers should be excluded from, places of honour in the <lb/>
            state? Accordingly that great master of the art of swaying <lb/>
            the minds of mankind is obliged to assert that it is a very <lb/>
            severe law; but he remarks, at the same time, that the consti­ <lb/>
            tution of the state was so essentially upheld by the laws of <lb/>
            Sylla, that if they were repealed it could no longer stand; <lb/>
            and thus he succeeded in saying something in apology for <lb/>
            those against whom he had to plead.</p>
          <p>86. In speaking on the subject of raillery,§ I observed how <lb/>
            unseemly it is to reproach a person with his condition of life, <lb/>
            and that we should not make wanton attacks upon whole <lb/>
            classes of men, or entire nations or people. But sometimes <lb/>
            the duty of our advocate absolutely obliges him to make some <lb/>
            remarks on the general character of some particular descrip­ <lb/>
            tion of people, as that of freedmen, soldiers, tax-gatherers, and <lb/>
            the like. 87. In all such cases, it is a common way of quali­ <lb/>
            fying our observations, to represent that we advert with <lb/>
            reluctance to points that must give pain; and we must not <lb/>
            assail all points in their character indiscriminately, but that <lb/>
            only which it is our business to attack, and while we censure <lb/>
            that particular, we must make some compensation by encomiums <note type="footnote"> * Aut os profanatum.] Nefandam et abominandam libidinem pluribus <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            on others. 88. Thus we may say that soldiers are certainly <lb/>
            rapacious; but we- may add that such a quality in their <lb/>
            character is by no means wonderful, as they think that greater <lb/>
            rewards are due to them than to other men, for the dangers to <lb/>
            which they expose themselves and the blood which they lose <lb/>
            in defence of their country. We may acknowledge, also, that <lb/>
            they are inclined to quarrelling; but may say that this is a <lb/>
            natural consequence of their greater familiarity with war than <lb/>
            with peace. We may have to detract from the credit of freed­ <lb/>
            men; but we may at the same time bear testimony to their <lb/>
            industry, by which they have released themselves from servitude. <lb/>
            89. As to foreign nations, Cicero affords as various examples <lb/>
            of the modes in which we may deal with them. When he has <lb/>
            to invalidate the veracity of some Greek witnesses, he allows <lb/>
            the Greeks eminence in knowledge and learning, and professes <lb/>
            himself a great admirer of that nation.. He affects contempt <lb/>
            for the Sardinians,† he inveighs against the Allobroges as ene­ <lb/>
            mies,‡ but none of his remarks, when they were made, appeared <lb/>
            at all impertinent, or at variance with decorum.</p>
          <p>90. If there be anything offensive in a matter of which we <lb/>
            have to speak, it may be softened by moderation in the terms <lb/>
            which we apply to it. Cruelty in a man’s character we may <lb/>
            call too great severity; of a person that has acted unjustly we <lb/>
            may say that he has been misled by the persuasion of others; <lb/>
            and of an obstinate man that he is somewhat tenacious of his <lb/>
            opinion. In many cases we may endeavour to overcome our <lb/>
            adversaries by reasoning, which is the most gentle of all modes <lb/>
            of contention.</p>
          <p>91. To these observations I may add, that whatever is in <lb/>
            excess is indecorous; and hence even that which in itself is <lb/>
            well adapted to our purpose, loses all its grace if it be not <lb/>
            under the control of moderation. An estimation of what is <lb/>
            right on this point is rather to be formed by the exercise of <lb/>
            our own judgment, than to be commuicated by precepts. We <lb/>
            must endeavour to conceive how much may be sufficient, and <lb/>
            to how much our audience are likely to listen with gratifica­ <lb/>
            tion; for such particulars do not admit of weight and measure, <lb/>
            because, as is the case with different kinds of food, some satiate <lb/>
            more than others. <note type="footnote"> * Pro Place, c. 26, seq. </note><note type="footnote">t Fragment of his oration for Scaurus. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Pro Fonteio, c. 8, seq. </note> <pb n="332"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/></p>
          <p>92. I think it proper to add, briefly, that very different excel­ <lb/>
            lences in speaking have not only their admirers, but are often <lb/>
            extolled by the same person. Cicero, in one passage of his <lb/>
            writings,* says that that is the best style, which the hearer thinks <lb/>
            himself able easily to equal by imitation, but finds himself <lb/>
            unable; and in another place, that he did not make it his object <lb/>
            to speak so as every one, but so as no one, would feel confident <lb/>
            of being able to speak. 93. One of these positions may <unclear>appear</unclear> <lb/>
            to contradict the other, but both are praised, and with goc <lb/>
            reason for'differences in style arise from difference in tl <lb/>
            nature of subjects ; since simplicity, and the negligence, as <unclear>it</unclear> <lb/>
            were, of an unaffected manner, are extremely suitable to inferior <lb/>
            causes, while a grander species of oratory is better adapted to <lb/>
            those of more importance. Cicero excels in both. The inex­ <lb/>
            perienced may think that they can easily acquire one of them; <lb/>
            the experienced will despair of acquiring either.</p>

          <p>1. SOME have thought memory to be a mere gift of nature ; <lb/>
            and to nature, doubtless, it is chiefly owing; but it is <lb/>
            strengthened, like all our other faculties, by exercise ; and all <lb/>
            the study of the orator, of which we have hitherto been speak­ <lb/>
            ing, is ineffectual, unless the other departments of it be held <lb/>
            together by memory as by an animating principle. All <lb/>
            knowledge depends on memory; and we shall be taught to no <note type="footnote"> * The commentators refer to Orate c. 23 and 28, where, however, <lb/>

            purpose if whatever we hear escapes from us. It is the power <lb/>
            of memory that brings before us those multitudes of precedents, <lb/>
            laws, judgments, sayings, and facts, of which an orator should <lb/>
            always have an abundance, and which he should always be <lb/>
            ready to produce. The memory is accordingly not without <lb/>
            reason called the treasury of eloquence.</p>
          <p>2. But it is necessary for those who are to plead, not only <lb/>
            to retain multitudes of particulars firmly in the memory, but <lb/>
            also to have a quick conception of them; not only to remem­ <lb/>
            ber what they have written after repeated perusals, but to <lb/>
            observe the order of thoughts and words even in what they <lb/>
            have merely meditated; and to recollect the statements of <lb/>
            the adverse party, not necessarily with a view to refute them <lb/>
            in the order in which they have been advanced, but to notice <lb/>
            each of them in the most suitable place. 3. The ability of speak­ <lb/>
            ing extempore seems to me to depend on no other faculty of the <lb/>
            mind than this; for, while we are uttering one thought, we <lb/>
            have to consider what we are to say next; and thus, while <lb/>
            the mind is constantly looking forward beyond its immediate <lb/>
            object, whatever it finds in the meantime it deposits in the <lb/>
            keeping as it were of the memory, which, receiving it from <lb/>
            the conception, transmits it, as an instrument of intercommu­ <lb/>
            nication, to the delivery.</p>
          <p>4. I do not think that I need dwell on the consideration <lb/>
            what it is that constitutes memory. Most, however, are of <lb/>
            opinion that certain impressions are stamped on the mind, as <lb/>
            the signets of rings are marked on wax.* But I shall not be <lb/>
            so credulous as to believe that the memory may be rendered <lb/>
            duller or more retentive by the condition of the body.t 5. I <lb/>
            would rather content myself with expressing my admiration <lb/>
            of its powers, as they affect the mind; so that, by its influence, <lb/>
            old ideas, revived after a long interval of forgetfulness, sud­ <lb/>
            denly start up and present themselves to us, not only when <lb/>
            we endeavour to recall them, but even of their own accord, <lb/>
            not only when we are awake, but even when we are sank in <note type="footnote"> * See Plato Theæt. p. 191, Steph. In the Philebus he compares the <lb/>

            remember and recognize things, and, however far they may <lb/>
            be taken from their usual abodes, still return to them again. <lb/>
            Is it not a surprising inconsistency that what is recent should <lb/>
            escape the memory, and what is old should retain its place in <lb/>
            it? That we should forget what happened yesterday, and <lb/>
            yet remember the acts of our childhood? 7. That things <lb/>
            when sought,. should conceal themselves, and occur to us <lb/>
            unexpectedly ? That memory should not always remain with <lb/>
            us, but sometimes return after having been lost? Yet its full <lb/>
            power, its entire divine efficacy, would never have been <lb/>
            known, had it not exalted eloquence to its present lustre.† <lb/>
            8. For it supplies the orator with the order, not only of <lb/>
            things, but of words, not connecting together a few only, but <lb/>
            extending a series almost to infinity, so that, in very long <lb/>
            pleadings, the patience of the hearer fails sooner than the <lb/>
            memory of the speaker. 9. This may be an argument that <lb/>
            art has some influence on memory, and that nature is aided <lb/>
            by method, since persons, when instructed, can do that which, <lb/>
            when without instruction or practice, they could not do ; <lb/>
            though I find it said indeed by Plato,t that the use of letters <lb/>
            is a detriment to memory, because, as he intimates, what we <lb/>
            have committed to writing we cease, in some degree, to guard, <lb/>
            and lose it through mere neglect. 10. Doubtless, attention <lb/>
            of the mind is of great influence in this respect, like that of <lb/>
            the sight of the eye with regard to objects, when not diverted <lb/>
            from anything on which it has been fixed. Hence it happens, <lb/>
            that of what we have been writing for several days, with a <lb/>
            view to learning it by heart, the memory firmly embraces the <lb/>
            whole.</p>

            lated :* That when, for a stipulated sum, he had written in <lb/>
            honour of a pugilist, who had won the crown, an ode of the <lb/>
            kind usually composed for conquerors in the games, half of <lb/>
            the money was refused him, because, according to a practice <lb/>
            very common with poets, he had made a digression in praise <lb/>
            of Castor and Pollux, for which reason he was told to apply <lb/>
            for the other half to the deities whose praises he had chosen <lb/>
            to celebrate. 12. The deities, according to the story, paid it; <lb/>
            for, as a splendid entertainment was made in honour of that <lb/>
            victory, Simonides, being invited to the banquet, was called <lb/>
            away from it by a message that two young men, mounted on <lb/>
            horses, earnestly requested to see him. 13. When he went <lb/>
            out he found nobody; but he discovered, from what followed, <lb/>
            that the deities were not ungrateful to him, for he had scarcely <lb/>
            passed the threshold, when the banqueting-room fell down <lb/>
            upon the guests, and crushed them so horribly, that those who <lb/>
            went to look for the bodies of the dead, in order to bury them, <lb/>
            were unable to recognize, by any mark, not only their faces, <lb/>
            but even their limbs; when Simonides, by the aid of his <lb/>
            memory, is said to have pointed out the bodies to their friends <lb/>
            in the exact order in which they had sat. 14. But it is by no <lb/>
            means agreed among authors, whether this ode was written for <lb/>
            Glaucus of Carystus, or Leocrates, or Agatharcus, or Scopas; <lb/>
            and whether the house was at Pharsalus, as Simonides himself <lb/>
            seems somewhere to intimate, and as Apollodorus, Eratos­ <lb/>
            thenes, Euphorion, and Eurypylus of Larissa, have stated, or <lb/>
            at Cranon, as Apullas Callimachus asserts, whom Cicero has <lb/>
            followed, giving a wide circulation to his account of the story. † <lb/>
            15. That Scopas, a Thessalian nobleman, was killed at that <lb/>
            banquet, is generally believed; his sister's son is said to have <lb/>
            perished with him ; and some think that most of the family of <lb/>
            another and older Scopas was killed at the same time. 16. <lb/>
            However, that part of the story relating to Castor and Pollux <lb/>
            appears to me to be utterly fabulous, as the poet himself has <lb/>
            nowhere alluded to the occurrence, and he assuredly would <lb/>
            not have been silent about an incident so much to his honour.</p>
          <p>17. From what Simonides did on that occasion, it appears <lb/>
            to have been remarked, that the memory is assisted by <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* See Cic. de Orate ii 86. Phæd. iv. 24. </note><note type="footnote"> † This learned and mighty controversy has escaped us, through the <lb/>

            localities impressed on the mind; and every one seems able <lb/>
            to attest the truth of the observation from his own experience; <lb/>
            for when we return to places, after an absence of some time, <lb/>
            we not only recognize them, but recollect also what we did in <lb/>
            them; persons whom we saw there, and sometimes even <lb/>
            thoughts that passed within our minds, recur to our memory <lb/>
            Hence in this case, as in many others, art has had its origin <lb/>
            in experiment. 18. People fix in their minds places of the <lb/>
            greatest possible extent, diversified by considerable variety, <lb/>
            such as a large house, for example, divided into many apart- <lb/>
            ments. Whatever is remarkable in it is carefully impressed <lb/>
            on the mind. so that the thought may run over every part of <lb/>
            it without hesitation or delay; and it is indeed of the first <lb/>
            importance, to be at no loss in recurring to any part, for ideas <lb/>
            which are meant to excite other ideas, ought to be in the <lb/>
            highest degree certain. 19. They then distinguish what they. <lb/>
            have written, or treasured in their mind, by some symbol by <lb/>
            which they may be reminded of it; a symbol which may <lb/>
            either have reference to the subject in general, as navigation <lb/>
            or warfare, or to some particular word ;* for if they forget, they <lb/>
            may, by a hint from a single word, find their recollection <lb/>
            revived. It may be a symbol, however, of navigation, as an <lb/>
            anchor; or of war, as some particular weapon. 20. These <lb/>
            symbols they then dispose in the following manner: they <lb/>
            place, as it were, their first thought under its symbol, in the <lb/>
            vestibule, and the second in the hall, and then proceed round <lb/>
            the courts, locating thoughts in due order, not only in cham­ <lb/>
            bers and porticoes, but on statues and other like objects. This <lb/>
            being done, when the memory is to be tried, they begin to <lb/>
            pass in review all these places from the commencement, de­ <lb/>
            manding from each what they have confided to it, according <lb/>
            as they are reminded by the symbol; and thus, however <lb/>
            numerous be the particulars which they have to remember, <lb/>
            they can, as they are connected each to each like a company <lb/>
            of dancers hand to hand, make no mistake in joining the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing to the preceding, if they only take due trouble to fix <lb/>
            the whole in their minds. 21. What I have specified as <lb/>
            being done with regard to a dwelling house, may be done also <lb/>
            with regard to public buildings, or a long road, or the walls of <note type="footnote"> * Thus, if a period begins with the word solet, sol may be the <lb/>

            a city, or pictures, or we may even conceive imaginary places <lb/>
            for ourselves.</p>
          <p>Places, however, we must have, either fancied or selected, <lb/>
            and images or symbols which we may invent at pleasure. <lb/>
            These symbols are marks by which we distinguish the parti­ <lb/>
            culars which we have to get by heart, so that, as Cicero says.* <lb/>
            ice use places as waxen tablets, and symbols as letters. 22. <lb/>
            But it will be best to cite what he adds, in his exact words : <lb/>
            We must fancy many plain and distinct places, at moderate <lb/>
            distances; and such symbols as are expressive, striking, and <lb/>
            well-marked, which may present themselves to the mind and act <lb/>
            upon it at once. I am therefore the more surprised that <lb/>
            Metrodorus should have made three hundred and sixty places <lb/>
            in the twelve signs through which the sun passes.† This was <lb/>
            doubtless vanity and boastfulness in a man priding himself on <lb/>
            his memory rather as the result of art than as the gift of <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>23. For myself, I do not deny that this method may be of <lb/>
            use in some cases; for instance, if the names of several things, <lb/>
            after being heard in a certain order are to be repeated without <lb/>
            deviation from it ; for those who would do so, locate the things <lb/>
            in the places which they have previously conceived, the table, <lb/>
            for example, in the vestibule, the couch in the hall, and other <lb/>
            things in the same way; and then, going over the places <lb/>
            again, they find the things where they deposited them. 24. <lb/>
            Perhaps those were assisted by this method, who, at the close <lb/>
            of an auction, could specify what had been sold to each buyer, <lb/>
            in conformity with the books of the money-takers. Such a <lb/>
            proof of memory they say that Hortensius often gave.‡</p>
          <p>But this mode will be of much less efficacy for learning by <lb/>
            heart the parts that constitute a continuous speech; for <lb/>
            thoughts have not their peculiar images like things, the image, <lb/>
            in this case, being a mere fiction of the imagination; though <lb/>
            indeed the place will suggest to us either a fictitious or a real <note type="footnote"> * De Orat. ii. 86. </note><note type="footnote"> t He used the twelve signs of the Zodiac as aids for his memory, <lb/>

            image ; but how will the connexion of the words of a speech­ <lb/>
            be retained in mind by the aid of such a method? 25. I do <lb/>
            not dwell on the circumstance that some things cannot be sig­ <lb/>
            nified by any images, as for example, conjunctions. We may <lb/>
            have, it is true, like short-hand writers,† certain marks for <lb/>
            every word, and an infinite number of places, as it were, in <lb/>
            which all the words contained in the five books of the second <lb/>
            pleading against Verres may be arranged, so that we may re­ <lb/>
            member all just as we have supposed them to be deposited, <lb/>
            but must not the course of the orator's speech, as he pro­ <lb/>
            nounces the words, be impeded by the double effort necessary <lb/>
            to the memory ?‡ 26. How can his words flow on in a con­ <lb/>
            tinuous current, if he has to refer for every word to its particular <lb/>
            image? Let Charmadas,§ therefore, and Metrodorus of <lb/>
            Scepsis, whom I mentioned a little above,|| both of whom <lb/>
            Cicero asserts to have used this method, keep their art to <lb/>
            themselves ; and let me propose one of a simpler nature.</p>
          <p>27. If a long speech is to be retained in the memory, it will <lb/>
            be of advantage to learn it in parts; for the memory sinks <lb/>
            under a vast burden laid on it at once. At the same time, the <lb/>
            portions should not be extremely short; for they will then dis­ <lb/>
            tract and harass the memory. I cannot however prescribe any <lb/>
            certain length, since this must be suited, as much as possible, <lb/>
            to the different divisions of the subject, unless a division, per­ <lb/>
            chance, be of such magnitude that it requires to be subdivided. <lb/>
            28. But certain limits must assuredly be fixed, that frequent <lb/>
            meditation may connect the series of words in each, which is <lb/>
            attended with great difficulty, and that a repetition of the parts <lb/>
            in their order may unite them into a whole. As to those <lb/>
            which are least easily remembered, it will be of advantage to <lb/>
            associate with them certain marks,¶ the recollection of which <note type="footnote"> * Sermonis alicujus habiti.] Spalding doubts the soundness of the <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH II.]"/><lb/>
            may refresh and excite the memory. 29. Scarcely any roan <lb/>
            has so unhappy a memory as not to remember what symbol he <lb/>
            designed for any particular part; but, if he be so unfortunately <lb/>
            dull, it will be a reason for him to adopt the remedy of marks, <lb/>
            that they may stimulate him. For it is of no small service in <lb/>
            this method, to affix signs to those thoughts which are likely, <lb/>
            we think, to escape us; an anchor, as I remarked above, if we <lb/>
            have to speak of a ship; a spear, if we have to think of a <lb/>
            battle; since signs are of great efficacy; and one idea arises <lb/>
            from another; as when a ring shifted from one finger to <lb/>
            another, or tied with a thread, reminds us why we shifted or <lb/>
            tied it.</p>
          <p>30. Those contrivances have the greatest effect in fixing <lb/>
            things in the memory, which lead it from some similar object <lb/>
            to that which we have to remember ; as, in regard to names, if <lb/>
            Fabius, for instance, is to be kept in our memory, we may <lb/>
            think of the famous Cunctator, who will surely not escaape us, <lb/>
            or of some one of our friends, who is named Fabius. 31. This <lb/>
            is still more easy in respect to such names as Aper, Ursus, <lb/>
            Naso, or Crispus, since we can fix in our minds the things to <lb/>
            which they allude. A reference to the origin of derivative <lb/>
            names is sometimes even a still better means of remembering <lb/>
            them, as in those of Cicero, Verrius, Aurelius.</p>
          <p>32. What will be of service, however, to every one, is to <lb/>
            learn by heart from the same tablets on which he has written ; <lb/>
            for he will pursue the remembrance of what he has composed <lb/>
            -by certain traces, and will look, as it were, with the eye of his <lb/>
            mind, not only on the pages, but on almost every individual line, <lb/>
            resembling, while he speaks, a person reading, If, moreover, <lb/>
            any erasure, or addition, or alteration, has been made, they <lb/>
            will be as so many marks, and while we attend to them, we <lb/>
            shall not go astray. 33. This method, though not wholly un­ <lb/>
            like the system of which I spoke at first,. is yet, if experience <lb/>
            has taught me anything, more expeditious and efficacious.</p>
          <p>To learn by heart in silence, (for it is a question whether we <lb/>
            should do so or not,) would be best, if other thoughts did not <lb/>
            intrude on the mind at a time when it is, so to speak, at rest, <lb/>
            for which reason it requires to be stimulated by the voice, that <note type="footnote"> memory." "I consider," says Burmann, "that nota and signum are <lb/>
            the same, and mean some sort of note to be placed in the margin." </note><note type="footnote"> * Sect. 18—23. </note> <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            the memory may be excited by the double duty of speaking <lb/>
            and hearing. But the tone of voice ought to be low, and rather <lb/>
            a kind of murmur. 34. As to him that learns from another <lb/>
            person who reads to him, he is in some degree retaried, as the <lb/>
            sense of seeing is quicker than that of hearing, but he may, on <lb/>
            the other hand, be in some degree benefited, as, after he has <lb/>
            heard a passage once or twice, he may immediately begin to try <lb/>
            his memory, and attempt to rival the reader; indeed, for other <lb/>
            reasons, we should make it our great care to test the memory from <lb/>
            time to time, since continuous reading passes with equal celerity <lb/>
            over that which takes less and that which takes more hold of <lb/>
            the mind ; while, in making trial whether we retain what we <lb/>
            have heard, not only a greater degree of attention is applied, <lb/>
            but no time is unoccupied, or lost in repeating that which we <lb/>
            already know, as, in this way, only the parts that have escaped <lb/>
            us are gone over again, that they may be fixed in the memory <lb/>
            by frequent repetition, though generally, indeed, these very <lb/>
            parts are more securely stored in the memory than others, for <lb/>
            the very reason that they escaped it at first.</p>
          <p>35. It is common alike to learning by heart and to com­ <lb/>
            position, that good health, excellent digestion, and a mind free <lb/>
            from other subjects of care, contribute greatly to success in <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>36. But for fixing in the memory what we have written, <lb/>
            and for retaining in it what we meditate, the most efficacious, <lb/>
            and almost the only, means, (except exercise, which is the <lb/>
            most powerful of all,) are division and arrangement. He who <lb/>
            makes a judicious division of his subject, will never err in the <lb/>
            order of particulars ; 37. for, if we but speak as we ought,* there <lb/>
            will be certain points, as well in the treatment as in the distri­ <lb/>
            bution of the different questions in our speech, that will nature <lb/>
            ally be first, second, and so on ; and the whole concatenation <lb/>
            of the parts will be so manifestly coherent, that nothing can <lb/>
            be omitted or inserted in it without being at once perceived. <lb/>

            beaten, and going over the whole process of the game in his <lb/>
            mind as he was travelling into the country, recollect at what <lb/>
            move he had made a mistake,. and return to tell the person <lb/>
            with whom he had been playing, who acknowledged that it <lb/>
            was as he said ; and shall order have less effect in a speech, <lb/>
            where it is settled wholly at our own pleasure, than it has in <lb/>
            a game, where it depends partly on the will of another ? 39. <lb/>
            All parts that have been well put together, too, will guide the <lb/>
            memory by their sequence; for as we learn by heart verse <lb/>
            more easily than prose, so we learn compact prose better than <lb/>
            such as is ill-connected. Thus it happens that passages in a <lb/>
            speech, which seemed to have been poured forth extempore, <lb/>
            are heard repeated word for word; and such repetition was <lb/>
            possible even to the moderate power of my own memory, <lb/>
            whenever, as I was declaiming, the entrance of any persons, <lb/>
            who merited such attention, induced me to repeat a portion of <lb/>
            my declamation. I have no opportunity of saying what is <lb/>
            untrue, as there are people living that were present when I <lb/>
            did so.t</p>
          <p>40. If any one ask me, however, what is the only and great <lb/>
            art of memory, I shall say that it is exercise and labour. To <lb/>
            learn much by heart, to meditate much, and, if possible, daily, <lb/>
            are the most efficacious of. all methods. Nothing is so much <lb/>
            strengthened by practice, or weakened by neglect, as memory. 41. <lb/>
            Let children, therefore, as I directed,t learn as much as possible <lb/>
            by heart at the earliest possible age; and let every one, at what. <lb/>
            ever age, that applies himself to strengthen his memory by culti­ <lb/>
            vation, get resolutely over the tedium of going through what has <lb/>
            often been written and read, and of masticating repeatedly, as <lb/>
            it were, the same food; a labour which may be rendered easier, <lb/>
            if we begin with learning a few things first, and such as do not <lb/>
            create disgust in us ; and we may then add to our task a verse <lb/>
            or two every day, the addition of which will cause no sensible <note type="footnote">different from our backgammon. It was called duodecim scripta from <lb/>
            twelve lines that were drawn on the board. See Cicero de Orate i. 50, <lb/>

            increase to our labour, but will lead, at length, to almost incon­ <lb/>
            ceivable results. We may first learn pieces of poetry, then <lb/>
            passages from orators, and at last composition of a less studied <lb/>
            kind, and more remote from the style of oratory, as that of <lb/>
            writers on law. 42. For what is intended as an exercise ought <lb/>
            to be of a rather difficult nature, in order that that for which it <lb/>
            is intended as an exercise may be easier; just as athletes ac­ <lb/>
            custom their hands to leaden weights, though they must use <lb/>
            them empty and unarmed in actual combats.</p>
          <p>I must not omit to mention, what is found to be true by daily <lb/>
            experience, that in. minds of a somewhat slow nature, the im <lb/>
            pression of what is recent on the memory is by no means exact. <lb/>
            43. It is astonishing how much strength the interval of a night <lb/>
            gives it; and a reason for the fact cannot be easily dis­ <lb/>
            covered ; whether it be from the effort, the fatigue of which was <lb/>
            a hindrance to itself, being suspended during the time; or <lb/>
            whether it be that reminiscence, which is the most efficient <lb/>
            quality of the memory, is cherished or matured; certain it is, <lb/>
            that what could not be repeated at first, is readily put together <lb/>
            on the following day; and the very time which is generally <lb/>
            thought to cause forgetfulness is found to strengthen the memory. <lb/>
            44. On the other hand, the extraordinarily quick memory soon <lb/>
            allows what it has grasped to escape it; and as if, after dis­ <lb/>
            charging a present duty, it owed nothing further, it resigns its <lb/>
            charge like a dismissed steward. Nor is it indeed surprising <lb/>
            that what has been longest impressed upon the mind should <lb/>
            adhere to it with the greatest tenacity.</p>
          <p>From this difference in minds a question has arisen, whether <lb/>
            those who are going to deliver a speech should learn it by heart <lb/>
            word for word, or whether it be sufficient to master merely the <lb/>
            substance and order of particulars. 45. This is a point on <lb/>
            which certainly no general decision can be given ; for, for my <lb/>
            own part, if my memory be sufficiently strong, and time be <lb/>
            not wanting, I should wish not a single syllable to escape me; <lb/>
            else it would be to no purpose to write. Such exactness we <lb/>
            should acquire in childhood; and the memory should be <lb/>
            brought to such a condition by exercise, that we may never <lb/>
            learn to excuse its failures. To be prompted, therefore, and <lb/>
            to refer to one's writing, is pernicious, as it grants indulgence <lb/>
            to carelessness ; nor will a speaker feel that he retains with <lb/>
            sufficient security that which he is in no fear of losing. 46 <pb n="343"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH II.]"/><lb/>
            Hence, too, proceed interruptions in the course of our speech, <lb/>
            and a mode of delivery halting and irregular, while the <lb/>
            speaker, appearing like one who has learned a lesson, destroys <lb/>
            the whole grace of what be had written with grace, by making <lb/>
            it evident that he did write it. 47. But a good memory gains <lb/>
            us credit even for readiness of wit, as we appear, not to have <lb/>
            brought what we utter from home, but to have conceived it <lb/>
            on the instant; an opinion which is of great service both to the <lb/>
            speaker and to his cause; for a judge admires more, and dis­ <lb/>
            trusts less, that which he regards as not having been pre-con­ <lb/>
            certed to mislead him. We should therefore consider it as <lb/>
            one of the most excellent artifices in pleading to deliver some <lb/>
            parts of our speech, which we have extremely well connected, as <lb/>
            if they had not been connected at all, and to appear, at times, <lb/>
            like persons thinking and doubting, seeking what we have in <lb/>
            reality brought with us, 48. What it is best for a speaker to <lb/>
            do, then, in regard to memory, cannot escape the apprehension <lb/>
            of any one.</p>
          <p>But even if a person's memory be naturally dull, or if time <lb/>
            be but short, it will be useless for him to tie himself down to <lb/>
            a series of words, when to forget any one of them may occa­ <lb/>
            sion either disagreeable hesitation, or total silence; and it will <lb/>
            be far safer for him, after treasuring up his matter in his mind, <lb/>
            to leave himself at liberty to deliver it as he pleases ; for a <lb/>
            speaker never loses a single word that he has chosen, without <lb/>
            regret, and cannot easily put another in its place while he is try­ <lb/>
            ing to recollect the very one that he had written. 49. But not even <lb/>
            such power of substitution is any remedy for a weak memory, <lb/>
            unless in those who have acquired some ability in speaking <lb/>
            extempore ; and if both resources be wanting to a speaker, I <lb/>
            would advise him to renounce entirely all attempts at pleading, <lb/>
            and to apply himself, if he has any talent for composition, to <lb/>
            writing. But such unfortunate weakness of memory is very <lb/>
            rarely seen.</p>
          <p>50. What strength the memory may attain when assisted <lb/>
            by nature and art, Themistocles may be named as an instance, <lb/>
            who, as is generally believed, learned to speak the Persian <lb/>
            language accurately in less than a year ;* or Mithridates, to <lb/>
            whom it is said that two and twenty languages, the number of <note type="footnote"> * Thucyd L 137; Coin. Nep. ii 10, 1. Plutarch, Themist, p 229, <lb/>

            the nations over whom he ruled, were known ;* or Grassus t <lb/>
            the rich, who, when he was prætor of Asia, was so well <lb/>
            acquainted with the five dialects ‡ of the Greek tongue, that in <lb/>
            whichsoever of them a complainant sought justice from him, <lb/>
            he pronounced in that very dialect a decision on his case ; or <lb/>
            Cyrus, who is supposed to have known the names of <lb/>
            every one of his soldiers. 51. Theodectes, also, is said to <lb/>
            have been able to repeat instantly any number of verses after <lb/>
            having once heard them. There were said to be persons, in <lb/>
            my time, who could do so, but I never had the fortune to <lb/>
            witness such a performance. The belief in its possibility may <lb/>
            well, however, be cherished, if for no other reason thar <lb/>
            that he who thinks it practicable may hope to effect it.</p>

            and delivery, 61—64. Of gesture, 65—68. Of decorum, 69—71. <lb/>
            Of the countenance, 72—81. Of the management of other parts <lb/>
            of the body, 82—87. Of imitation; must not be in excess, 88— <lb/>
            91. Of certain common gestures and attitudes of the hands and <lb/>
            fingers, 92—116. Of faulty and unbecoming gestures, 117—130. <lb/>
            Of habits in which many speakers indulge, 131—136. Of dress, <lb/>
            and the management of the toga, 137—149. An orator must <lb/>
            adapt his delivery to his subject, and to the characters of those <lb/>
            before whom he speaks; various remarks on decorum in speaking, <lb/>
            150—176. But everything cannot be taught, and an orator must <lb/>
            consult his own powers and qualifications, 177—184.</p>
          <p>1. Delivery is by most writers called action ; but it appears <lb/>
            to derive the one name from the voice, and the other from the <note type="footnote"> * Plin. H. N. vii. 24, xxv. 2; Aul. Gell. xvii. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> t Val Max. viii. 7, 6. </note><note type="footnote"> t Attic, Ionic, Doric, Æolic, and Macedonian. </note> <pb n="345"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            gesture; for Cicero calls action sometimes the language, as it <lb/>
            were,* and sometimes the eloquence of the body.† Yet he <lb/>
            makes two constituent parts of action, which are the same as <lb/>
            those of delivery, voice and motion. We, therefore, make use of <lb/>
            either term indiscriminately.</p>
          <p>2. As for the thing itself, it has a wonderful power and effi­ <lb/>
            cacy in oratory; for it is not of so much importance what <lb/>
            sort of thoughts we conceive within ourselves, as it is in what <lb/>
            manner we express them; since those whom we address are <lb/>
            moved only as they hear. Accordingly there is no proof, that <lb/>
            proceeds in any way from a pleader,‡ of such strength that it <lb/>
            may not lose its effect, unless it be supported by a tone of <lb/>
            affirmation in the speaker. All attempts at exciting the feel­ <lb/>
            ings must prove ineffectual, unless they be enlivened by the <lb/>
            voice of the speaker, by his look, and by the action of almost <lb/>
            his whole body. 3. For when we have displayed energy in all <lb/>
            these respects, we may think ourselves happy, if the judge <lb/>
            catches a single spark of our fire ; and we surely cannot hope <lb/>
            to move him if we are languid and supine, or expect that he <lb/>
            will not slumber if we yawn. 4. Even actors on the stage give <lb/>
            proof of the power of delivery, since they add so much grace <lb/>
            even to the best of our poets, that the same passages delight <lb/>
            us infinitely more when they are heard than when they are <lb/>
            read; and they gain a favourable hearing for the most con­ <lb/>
            temptible performances, insomuch that pieces which have no <lb/>
            place in our libraries are welcomed time after time at the <lb/>
            theatre 5. If, then, in matters which we know to be ficti. <lb/>
            tious and unreal, delivery is of such effect as to excite in us <lb/>
            anger, tears, and concern, how much additional weight must <lb/>
            it have when we also believe the subjects on which it is <lb/>
            bestowed? For my own part. I should be inclined to say <lb/>
            that language of but moderate merit, recommended by a <lb/>
            forcible delivery, will make more impression than the very <lb/>
            best, if it be unattended with that advantage. 6. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly Demosthenes, when he was asked what was the <lb/>
            chief excellence in the whole art of oratory, gave the palm to <note type="footnote"> * Est enim actio quasi sermo corporis. Cic. de Drat. iii. 59. </note><note type="footnote"> + Est enim actio quasi corporis quœdam eloquentia, quum constet A <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            delivery, and assigned to it also the second and third place, <lb/>
            until he ceased to be questioned ; so that he may be thought <lb/>
            to have esteemed it not merely the principal, but the only <lb/>
            excellence. 7. It was for this reason that he himself studied <lb/>
            it under Andronicus * the actor, and with such success that <lb/>
            Æschines, when the Rhodians expressed admiration of his <lb/>
            speech, appears to have exclaimed with great justice, What if <lb/>
            you had heard him himself deliver it ? 8. Cicero t also thinks <lb/>
            that delivery has supreme power in oratory. He says that <lb/>
            Cneius Lentulus obtained more reputation by his delivery than <lb/>
            by any real power of eloquence; that it was by delivery that <lb/>
            Caius Gracchus, in deploring his brother's death, excited the <lb/>
            tears of the whole Roman people; and that Antonius and <lb/>
            Crassus produced great impression by it, but Hortensius more <lb/>
            than either of them. A proof of this remark regarding <lb/>
            Hortensius, is, that his writings are so much below that cha­ <lb/>
            racter for which he was long accounted the chief of our <lb/>
            orators, then the rival of Cicero, and at last, as long as <lb/>
            he lived, second to him; whence it appears that there was <lb/>
            some charm in his delivery which we do not find in reading <lb/>
            him. 9. Indeed, as words have much power of themselves, as <lb/>
            the voice adds a particular force to thought, and as gesture <lb/>
            and motion are not without meaning, some great excellence <lb/>
            must necessarily be the result when all these sources of power <lb/>
            are combined.</p>
          <p>10. Yet there are some who think that an unstudied mode of <lb/>
            delivery, such as the impulse of the individual speaker's mind <lb/>
            produces, is more forcible, and indeed the only mode of deli­ <lb/>
            very worthy of men. But those who hold this opinion are <lb/>
            mostly such as make it their practice to decry all care, and art, <lb/>
            and polish in speaking in general, and to condemn whatever is <lb/>
            acquired by study as affected and unnatural; or such as pretend <lb/>
            to imitate antiquity by an assumed rudeness of style and pro­ <lb/>
            nunciation, as Cicero ‡ says that Lucius Cotta used to do. <lb/>
            11. Let those, however, who think it enough for men to be <lb/>
            born to become orators, enjoy their own opinion, but let them <note type="footnote"> * Satyrus is the name generally given to the instructor of Demos­ <lb/>

            be indulgent, at the same time, to the trouble which I take, <lb/>
            who believe that there can be no consummate excellence except <lb/>
            when nature is assisted by art. 12. But I allow, without the <lb/>
            least reluctance, that the chief power rests with nature; for he, <lb/>
            assuredly, will be unable to deliver himself properly, to whom <lb/>
            either memory is wanting for retaining what he has written, or <lb/>
            ready facility in uttering what he has to speak extempore; or <lb/>
            if any incurable defects of utterance disable him. There may <lb/>
            even be such extraordinary deformity of body in a person that <lb/>
            it cannot be remedied by any effort of art. 13. Nor can a <lb/>
            weak voice attain any degree of excellence in delivery; for we <lb/>
            may manage a sound and strong voice as we please, but a bad <lb/>
            or weak voice prevents us from doing many things that are <lb/>
            necessary, as giving emphasis and elevation of tone, and forces <lb/>
            us to do many other things that we ought to avoid, as breaking <lb/>
            pur sentences, adopting an unnatural pitch, and recruiting a <lb/>
            hoarse throat and exhausted lungs with an offensive resemblance <lb/>
            to singing. But let me now speak of him who is so qualified <lb/>
            by nature that rules will not fail to be of use to him.</p>
          <p>14. Since delivery in general, as I said, depends upon two <lb/>
            things, voice and gesture, of which the one affects the eyes and <lb/>
            the other the ears, the two senses through which all impressions <lb/>
            find their way into the mind, it is natural to speak first of the <lb/>
            voice, to which, also, the gesture is to be adapted.</p>
          <p>In regard to it, then, the first thing to be considered is what <lb/>
            sort of voice we have, and the next, how we use it. The natural <lb/>
            power of the voice is estimated by its quantity and its quality <lb/>
            15. Of these, the quantity is the more simple consideration, <lb/>
            for it may be said in general that it is either much or little; <lb/>
            but between the extremes of these quantities there are many <lb/>
            diversities, and many gradations from the lowest tone to the <lb/>
            highest, and from the highest to the lowest. Quality is more <lb/>
            varied; for the voice is either clear or husky, full or weak, <lb/>
            smooth or rough, of smaller or larger compass, hard or flexible, <lb/>
            sharp or flat. 16. The breath may also be longer or shorter <lb/>
            As to the causes whence each of these peculiarities arises, it is <lb/>
            not necessary to the design of my work to consider whether the <lb/>
            difference lies in those parts of the body in which the breath <lb/>
            is generated, or in those through which, as through tubes, it <lb/>
            passes; whether it results from the nature of the voice itself, <lb/>
            or from the impulse which it receives; or whether strength of <pb n="348"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            lungs, or of the chest, or even of the head, affords it most <lb/>
            assistance; for there is need of concurrent aid from all these <lb/>
            parts, as well as of a clear formation,* not only of the mouth, <lb/>
            but also of the nostrils, through which the remainder of the <lb/>
            breath t is expelled. The general tone of the voice, however, <lb/>
            ought to be sweet, not grating.</p>
          <p>17. In the management of the voice there are many parti­ <lb/>
            culars to be observed; for besides the three main distinctions <lb/>
            of acute, grave, and intermediate, there is need of many <lb/>
            other kinds of intonation, as the forcible and the gentle, the <lb/>
            higher and the lower; and of slower or quicker time. ‡ 18. But <lb/>
            between these varieties there are other intermediate varieties; <lb/>
            and as the face, though it consists of very few features, is infi­ <lb/>
            nitely diversified, so the voice, though it has very few variations <lb/>
            that can be named, has yet a peculiar tone in each individual; <lb/>
            and the voice of a person is as easily distinguished by the ear, <lb/>
            as the face by the eye.</p>
          <p>19. But the good qualities of the voice, like those of all our <lb/>
            other faculties, are improved by attention and deteriorated by <lb/>
            neglect. The attention to be paid to the voice by orators, <lb/>
            however, is not the same as that which is required from <lb/>
            singing-masters ;§ though there are many things equally <lb/>
            necessary to both ; as strength of body, for instance, that the <lb/>
            voice may not dwindle down to the weak tone of eunuchs, <lb/>
            women, and sick persons; strength which walking, anointing <lb/>
            with oil, continence, and easy digestion of food, which is the <lb/>
            result of moderation in eating, contribute to maintain. 20. It <lb/>
            is necessary, also, that the throat be in good condition, that is, <lb/>
            soft and flexible, for by any defect in it the voice may be <lb/>
            rendered broken, husky, rough, or squeaking ;|| for as flutes, <lb/>
            receiving the same breath, give one sound when the holes are <lb/>
            stopped, another when they are open, another when the instru­ <note type="footnote"> * Suavitate.] He says that of the organs which is properly applicable <lb/>

            merits are not thoroughly clean, and another when they are <lb/>
            cracked; so the throat, when swollen, strangles the voice, <lb/>
            when not clear, stifles it, when dry, roughens it, and when <lb/>
            affected with spasms, gives forth a sound like that of broken <lb/>
            pipes. 21. The breath, too, is sometimes broken by some obstruc­ <lb/>
            tion, as a small stream of water by a pebble, the current of <lb/>
            which, though it unites soon after the obstruction, yet leaves <lb/>
            something of a void behind it. Too much moisture also im­ <lb/>
            pedes the voice, and too little weakens it. As to fatigue, it <lb/>
            affects the voice as it affects the whole body, not for the present <lb/>
            merely, but for some time afterwards.</p>
          <p>22. But though exercise is necessary alike for singing- <lb/>
            masters and orators, in order that all their faculties may be in <lb/>
            full vigour, yet the same kind of attention to the body is not <lb/>
            to be expected from both; for certain times for walking cannot <lb/>
            be fixed for himself by a man who is occupied in so many <lb/>
            duties of civil life, nor can he tune his voice at leisure from <lb/>
            the lowest to the highest notes; or give it rest when he pleases <lb/>
            from the labours of the forum, since he has often to speak on <lb/>
            many trials in succession. 23. Nor need he observe the <lb/>
            same care in regard to diet; for he has occasion, not so much <lb/>
            for a soft and sweet voice, as for one that is strong and dura­ <lb/>
            ble, and though singers may soften all sounds, even the <lb/>
            highest, by a certain modulation of the voice, we, on the c'on­ <lb/>
            trary, must often speak with roughness and vehemence. We <lb/>
            must frequently, also, watch whole nights, we must imbibe the <lb/>
            smoke of the lamp by which we study, and remain long, during <lb/>
            the day-time, in garments moistened with perspiration.* 24. <lb/>
            Let us not, therefore, weaken our voice by delicate treatment <lb/>
            of ourselves, or bring it to a condition which will not be en­ <lb/>
            during; but let the exercise which we give it be similar to the <lb/>
            exertion for which it is destined; let it not be relaxed by want <lb/>
            of use, but strengthened by practice, by which all difficulties <lb/>
            are smoothed.</p>
          <p>25. To learn passages of authors by heart, in order to <lb/>
            exercise the voice, will be an excellent method; for as to those <lb/>
            who speak extempore, the feeling which is excited by their <note type="footnote"> * A practice which the phonasci say should be avoided, and make it <lb/>
            a rule that after great perspiration the orator should anoint himself <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            matter prevents them from giving due attention to the voice; <lb/>
            and it will be well to learn passages of as much variety of sub­ <lb/>
            ject as possible, such as may exercise us in exclamation, in <lb/>
            discussion, in the familiar style, and in tho softer kind of <lb/>
            eloquence, * that we may be prepared for every mode of <lb/>
            speaking. 26. This will be sufficient exercise ; but the deli­ <lb/>
            cate voice, which is too much nursed, will be unequal to any <lb/>
            extraordinary exertion; just as athletes accustomed to the oil <lb/>
            and the gymnasium, though they may appear, in their own <lb/>
            games, handsome and strong, yet, if we were to order them on <lb/>
            a military expedition, and require them to carry burdens and <lb/>
            pass whole nights on guard, would soon faint with fatigue, and <lb/>
            long to be anointed and to perspire at freedom in an undress. <lb/>
            27. Who, indeed, in a work like this, would endure to find it <lb/>
            directed that sunshine and wind, cloudy and very dry days, <lb/>
            should be objects of dislike to an orator ?t If, then, we be <lb/>
            called upon to speak in the sun, or on a windy, moist, or <lb/>
            hot day, shall we desert onr clients ? As to the admonitions <lb/>
            that some give, that an orator should not speak when he is suffer­ <lb/>
            ing from indigestion, or heavy after a full meal, or intoxicated, <lb/>
            or after having just vomited, I suppose that no man, who <lb/>
            retains possession of his senses, would be guilty of such folly.</p>
          <p>28. It is not without reason, however, directed by all writers, <lb/>
            that we should be moderate in the exercise of the voice at the <lb/>
            period of transition from boyhood to manhood, because it is <lb/>
            then naturally obstructed, not, as I think, from heat, as some <lb/>
            have imagined, (for there is more heat in the body at other <lb/>
            periods of life,) but rather from excess of moisture, with which <lb/>
            that age abounds. 29. Hence the nostrils, too, and the <lb/>
            breast, dilate at that time, and the body germinates, as it <lb/>
            were, all over, and consequently every part is tender and <lb/>
            liable to injury.</p>
          <p>But, that I may return to my subject, I consider the best <lb/>
            kind of exercise for the voice, when it is well strengthened <lb/>
            and developed, to be that which has most resemblance to the <lb/>
            orator's business, namely, to speak every day just as we plead <note type="footnote"> * Flexus ] That is, passages which require to be spoken in a tone <lb/>
            adapted for exciting pity, a tone which approaches to singing ; see sect <lb/>
            170 ; also i. 11, 12. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t Quintilian doubtless alludes to some work or works in which such <lb/>
            directions had been given. </note> <pb n="351"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            in the forum ; for, by this means, not only the voice and lungs <lb/>
            will be strengthened, but a graceful carriage of the body, <lb/>
            suited to our style of speaking, will be acquired.</p>
          <p>30. As to rules for delivery, they are precisely the same as <lb/>
            those for language.</p>
          <p>For as language ought to be correct, clear, elegant, and to the <lb/>
            purpose, so delivery will be correct, that is, free from fault, if our <lb/>
            pronunciation be easy, clear, agreeable, and polished, that is, of <lb/>
            such a kind that nothing of the rustic or the foreign * be heard <lb/>
            in it; for the saying Barbarum Grœcumve, † that a man is <lb/>
            " Barbarian or Greek," is not without good foundation, since <lb/>
            we judge of men by their tones as of money by its clink. <lb/>
            31. Hence will arise the excellence which Ennius admired, <lb/>
            when he said that Cethegus was a man of sweetly speaking voice, <lb/>
            a quality very different from that which Cicero censures in <lb/>
            those who, as he said, barked rather than pleaded.‡ There <lb/>
            are, indeed, many faults in pronunciation, of which I spoke in <lb/>
            a part of my first book.§ when I was giving directions for <lb/>
            forming the speech of children, judging it most to the purpose <lb/>
            to mention them under that age at which they may be cor. <lb/>
            rected. 32. If the voice, too,|| be naturally, so to speak, sound, <lb/>
            it will have none of those defects to which I just now alluded ; <lb/>
            and it will, moreover, not be dull sounding, gross, bawling, <lb/>
            hard, stiff, inefficient,¶thick, or, on the contrary, thin, weak, <lb/>
            squeaking, small, soft, effeminate; while the breathing, at the <lb/>
            same time, should be neither short, nor unsustained, nor <lb/>
            difficult to recover. <note type="footnote"> * See the anecdote of Theophrastus, viii. 1, 2. </note><note type="footnote"> t Of this proverb I find no mention in any other author; and I see <lb/>
            that it is generally understood as referring to a person who spoke bad <lb/>
            Latin, and was accordingly regarded by the Romans -a a barbarian or <lb/>
            a Greek ; and Gesner, therefore, refers us to i. 1, 13, where Quintilian <lb/>
            speaks of Latin pronunciation being corrupted by a mixture of Greek. <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>83. Our pronunciation will be clear, if, in the first place, <lb/>
            our words are uttered entire; for, by many, part of them is <lb/>
            often swallowed, and part never formed, as they fail to pro­ <lb/>
            nounce the last syllables of words while they dwell on the <lb/>
            sound of the first. 34. But though the full articulation of <lb/>
            words is absolutely necessary, yet to count and number, as it <lb/>
            were, every letter, is disagreeable and offensive; for vowels <lb/>
            very frequently coalesce, and some consonants are elided when <lb/>
            a vowel follows. I have already given* an example of <lb/>
            both, in <lb/>
            Multum ile et terris.</p>
          <p>35. The concurrence of consonants that would produce a <lb/>
            harsh sound is also avoided, whence we have peUexit, collegit,t <lb/>
            and other forms which we have noticed elsewhere. ‡ Thus the <lb/>
            delicate utterance of his letters was a subject of praise in <lb/>
            Catulus.§</p>
          <p>The second requisite to clearness of pronunciation is, that <lb/>
            the phrases be distinct, that is, that the speaker begin and stop <lb/>
            where he ought. He must observe where his words are to be <lb/>
            reined in, as it were, and suspended, (what the Greeks call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐποδιαστολή</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐποστιγμή</foreign>, and where they are to be altogether <lb/>

            connected with what follows, virum Trojœ qui primus ab oris, <lb/>
            after which there is another suspension; for though there is <lb/>
            a difference between whence he came and whither he came, yet <lb/>
            we must not make a full stop, as both are signified by the <lb/>
            same word venit. 37. After Italiam we make a third suspension, <lb/>
            because the words fato profugus are thrown in, and break the <lb/>
            connexion which exists between Italiam and Lavinaque. For <lb/>
            the same reason, there is a fourth suspension after profugus, <lb/>
            when there follows Lavinaque litora, after which there will be <lb/>
            a full stop, because there another sentence commences. In <lb/>
            the more considerable distinctions, however, we must allow <lb/>
            sometimes a longer interval of time, and sometimes a shorter, <lb/>
            for it makes a difference whether they are at the end of a <lb/>
            period or only at that of a phrase. 38. I shall, accordingly, <lb/>
            after pausing at Litora, allow myself just to take breath; but, <lb/>
            when I come to the words atque alta mœnia Romœ, I shall <lb/>
            break off, make a full stop, and proceed, as it were, to a new <lb/>
            commencement. 39. Pauses are also made sometimes in <lb/>
            periods without any respiration; as in the passage, In casu verb <lb/>
            populi Romani, negotium publicum gerens, magister equitum, &amp;c. <lb/>
            " But in an assembly of the Roman people, holding a public <lb/>
            office, being master of the horse," &amp;c. This sentence has <lb/>
            many members, for there are several distinct thoughts; but as <lb/>
            one period comprehends them all, we must make but short <lb/>
            pauses to mark the intervals between them, and not interrupt <lb/>
            the continuation of the sense. But, on the other hand, we <lb/>
            must sometimes take breath without any perceptible pause, in <lb/>
            passages where we must steal a respiration, as it were; else, <lb/>
            it a respiration be made injudiciously, it may cause as much <lb/>
            obscurity in the sense as a wrong distinction. The merit of <lb/>
            making proper distinctions may perhaps be little; but without <lb/>
            it all other merit in speaking would be vain.</p>
          <p>40. That delivery is elegant, which is supported by a voice <lb/>
            that is easy, powerful, fine, flexible, firm, meet, well-sustained, <lb/>
            clear, pure, that cuts the air and penetrates the Bar; for there <lb/>
            is a kind of voice naturally qualified to make itself heard, not <lb/>
            by its strength, but by a peculiar excellence of tone; a voice <lb/>
            which is obedient to the will of the speaker, susceptible of <lb/>
            every variety of sound and inflexion that can be required, and <lb/>
            possessed, as they say, of all the notes of a musical instrument. <lb/>
            and to maintain it there should be strength of lungs, and <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="354"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            breath that can be steadily prolonged, and if .iot likely to sink <lb/>
            under labour 41. Neither the lowest musical tone, nor the <lb/>
            highest, is proper for oratory; for the lowest, which is far <lb/>
            from being clear, and is too full, can make no impression on <lb/>
            the minds of an audience; and the highest, which is very sharp, <lb/>
            and of excessive shrillness, rising above the natural pitch of <lb/>
            the voice, is neither susceptible of inflexion from pronunciation, <lb/>
            nor can endure to be kept long on the stretch. 42. For the <lb/>
            voice is like the strings of an instrument; the more relaxed <lb/>
            it is, the graver and fuller is its tone; the more it is stretched, <lb/>
            the more thin and sharp becomes the sound of it. Thus a <lb/>
            voice in the lowest key wants force; in the highest, is in <lb/>
            danger of being cracked. We must, therefore, cultivate the <lb/>
            middle tones, which may be raised when we speak with <lb/>
            vehemence, and lowered when we deliver ourselves with</p>
          <p>43The first requisite to be noticed for pronouncing well, <lb/>
            is, that an equality of tons must be maintained : so that our <lb/>
            speech may not proceed by starts, with irregular intervals and <lb/>
            tones, confounding long syllables with short, grave sounds <lb/>
            with acute, high with low, and halting from disorder in all <lb/>
            these particulars, as a person halts in walking from having <lb/>
            legs of unequal length. The next requisite is variety of tone, <lb/>
            in which alone pronunciation consists. 44. Nor let any one <lb/>
            suppose that equality and variety are incompatible; for the <lb/>
            fault opposed to equality is inequality, while that which is <lb/>
            opposed to variety is what the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">μονοιδές</foreign>, as pre­ <lb/>
            senting always one and the same aspect. The art of giving <lb/>
            variety to pronunciation, however, not only adds grace to it, <lb/>
            and pleases the ear, but relieves the hearer by the change that <lb/>
            pervades his labour, as alterations in position, standing. <lb/>
            walking, sitting, lying, relieve the body; for in no one of those <lb/>
            attitudes can we endure to continue long. 45. But what is <lb/>
            of the highest importance, (and I shall treat of it very soon,) <lb/>
            is, that the tone of our voice must be kept conformable to the <lb/>
            nature of the subjects on which we speak, and the feelings of <lb/>
            our minds, that the sound may not disagree with the sense. <lb/>
            Let us avoid, therefore, that which is in Greek termed <lb/>
            monotony, A uniform exertion of the breath and voice, and <lb/>
            let us not only beware of uttering anything in a bawling tone, <lb/>
            which is madness, or in the tone of conversation, which wants <pb n="355"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            animation, or in a low murmuring tone, by which all effort is <lb/>
            deadened; 46. but let us study that in delivering the same <lb/>
            parts of speeches, and in expressing the same feelings, there <lb/>
            may yet be some distinctions, however moderate, in our tone, <lb/>
            such as the dignity of our language, the nature of our thoughts, <lb/>
            the conclusions or commencements of our periods, or our <lb/>
            transitions, may require; just as painters who use but one <lb/>
            colour, nevertheless make some parts of their pictures appear <lb/>
            more prominent, and others more retiring, without which <lb/>
            difference they could not even have given due forms to the <lb/>
            limbs of their figures.</p>
          <p>47. Let us contemplate the commencement of the noble <lb/>
            oration of Cicero on behalf of Milo. Do we not see, that at <lb/>
            almost every division of the phrases, the tone of the speaker <lb/>
            must be in some degree varied, though the same kind of tone <lb/>
            is still preserved ?* Etsi vereor, judice8, ne turpe sit, pro for­ <lb/>
            tissimo viro dicere incipientem timere, " Though I am appre­ <lb/>
            hensive that it may be dishonourable in me, judges, in <lb/>
            beginning to speak on behalf of the bravest of men, to mani­ <lb/>
            fest fear.* 48. Notwithstanding this exordium is, in its whole <lb/>
            character, constrained and submissive, not only as being an <lb/>
            exordium, but as being that of a person deeply concerned, yet <lb/>
            the tone of the orator must have been fuller and more elevated <lb/>
            when he pronounced the words pro fortissimo viro, " on behalf <lb/>
            of the bravest of men," than when he said Etsi vereor, <lb/>
            " Though I fear," and ne turpe sit, " lest it be dishonourable," <lb/>
            and timere, " to manifest fear." 49. The next member, after <lb/>
            the speaker has taken breath, must be still more elevated in <lb/>
            tone, rising by a natural effort, because we utter what follows <lb/>
            with less timidity, and because the magnanimity of Milo is <lb/>
            then shown: Minimèque deceat, quum T. Annius ipse magis <lb/>
            reipublica de salute, quàm de suâ perturbetur, " And lest it <lb/>
            should be far from becoming, when Milo himself is more <lb/>
            anxious for the safety of the state than for his own," after <lb/>
            which there follows a species of self-reproach, me ad ejus <lb/>
            causam parem animi magnitudinem afferre non posse, " for me <lb/>
            to be unable to bring equal firmness of mind to his defence.' <lb/>
            50. He then casts a reflection on the unusual nature of the <note type="footnote"> * Quamvis in eddem facie tames vultus mutandus est.] " Though tho <lb/>
            face be tha. same, the look must be variod." </note> <note type="footnote"> A A 2 </note> <pb n="356"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            proceedings : Tamen hæc novi judicii nova forma ferret oculos, <lb/>
            “ Yet this new form of proceedings, attendant on a new mode <lb/>
            of trial, fills my eyes with dismay." What follows he delivers, <lb/>
            as they say, with the full sound of the flute,* Qui, quocun­ <lb/>
            que inciderunt, consuetudinem fori, et pristinum morem judicio <lb/>
            rum requirunt, “ since, wherever they direct themselves, <lb/>
            they seek in vain for the ordinary usages of the forum, and <lb/>
            the ancient mode of legal transactions." The next phrase is <lb/>
            to be given in a free and unrestrained manner: Non enim <lb/>
            coronâ consessus vester cinctus est, ut solebat, &amp;c. “ For your <lb/>
            assembly is not encircled with such attendants as it used to <lb/>
            be," &amp;c. 51. These remarks I have made to show, that not <lb/>
            only in the larger divisions of a cause, but even in the phrases <lb/>
            of every period, some variety of pronunciation may be adopted, <lb/>
            without which, indeed, nothing can be made to appear as <lb/>
            either more or less important.</p>
          <p>But the voice must not be strained beyond its natural <lb/>
            power, for, by that means, it is often choked, and becomes <lb/>
            less clear the greater the effort that is used; and sometimes, <lb/>
            if urged too far, it breaks out into the sound to which the <lb/>
            Greeks have given a name from the crowing of young cocks.t <lb/>
            52. Nor is what we say to be expressed confusedly through too <lb/>
            great rapidity of utterance, by which all distinction of phrases <lb/>
            is lost, and all power of touching the feelings; and by which <lb/>
            words are even sometimes curtailed of their syllables. The <lb/>
            fault contrary to this is that of excessive slowness, and it is a <note type="footnote"> * The commentators do nothing to illustrate this proverb, except <lb/>
            referring to i. 11, 6. On the suggestion of Erasmus, Adag. i. 5, 96, I <lb/>

            cackling of hens. But the lines of Juvenal have been very aptly cited <lb/>
            in illustration of the passage: <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            great fault, for it argues a difficulty of finding something to <lb/>
            say, it renders the hearer drowsy from affording no excitement <lb/>
            to his attention, and, what may be of some importance, it <lb/>
            wastes the time allowed by the hour-glass. Our pronuncia­ <lb/>
            tion must be fluent, not precipitate, well regulated, but <lb/>
            not slow.</p>
          <p>63. The breath, also, must not be drawn too frequently, so <lb/>
            as to break our sentences to pieces, nor must it be prolonged <lb/>
            until it is spent, for the sound of the voice, when the breath <lb/>
            is just lost, is disagreeable; the breathing of the speaker is <lb/>
            like that of a man held long under water, and the recovery of <lb/>
            the breath is long and unseasonable, as being made, not when <lb/>
            we please, but when it is compulsory. When we are about to <lb/>
            pronounce a long period, therefore, we must collect our breath, <lb/>
            but in such a way as not to take much time about it, or to do it <lb/>
            with a noise, or to render it at all observable ; in other parts <lb/>
            the breath may be freely drawn between the divisions of the <lb/>
            matter. 54. But we ought to exercise it, that it may hold out <lb/>
            as long as possible. Demosthenes, in order to strengthen his, <lb/>
            used to repeat as many verses as he could in succession, <lb/>
            climbing up a hill ;* and be was accustomed, while he spoke <lb/>
            at home, to roll pebbles under his tongue, that he might pro <lb/>
            nounce his words more freely when his mouth was unencum­ <lb/>
            bered. 55. Sometimes the breath can hold out long, and is <lb/>
            sufficiently full and clear, but is yet incapable of being firmly <lb/>
            sustained, and is consequently tremulous, resembling some <lb/>
            bodies, which though strong in appearance, are nevertheless <lb/>
            weak in the nerves. This imperfection in the breath the <lb/>
            Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">βϱάγχος</foreign>.†</p>
          <p>There are some speakers who do not draw their breath in <lb/>
            the ordinary way, but suck it in with a hissing through the <lb/>
            interstices of their teeth. Others there are, who, by incessant <lb/>
            panting, which can be plainly heard within their mouth, <lb/>
            resemble beasts labouring under burdens or in the yoke <lb/>
            56. Some even affect this manner, as if they were oppressed <lb/>
            with the redundancy of matter in their minds, and as if a <lb/>
            greater force of eloquence were rising within them than could <lb/>
            well find a passage through their throats. Others, again, have <lb/>
            a tightness of the mouth, and seem to struggle with their <lb/>
            words to force them out. To cough, to make frequent expec­ <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch, Vit. Demosth. o. 7. </note><note type="footnote">+ Sore throat or <unclear>hoarsenans</unclear>. </note> <pb n="358"/>

            torations, to hoist up phlegm from the bottom of the chest as <lb/>
            it were with a windlass,* to sprinkle the bystanders with the <lb/>
            moisture from the mouth, and to emit, in speaking, the greater <lb/>
            part of the breath through the nostrils, may, though they are <lb/>
            not properly faults of the voice, be nevertheless reasonably <lb/>
            noticed here, as it is in the use of the voice that they display <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>57. But I would endure any one of these faults sooner than <lb/>
            one with which we are annoyed in all pleadings and in every <lb/>
            school; I mean that of speaking in a singing tone; and I <lb/>
            know not whether it is more to be condemned for its absurdity <lb/>
            or for its offensiveness; for what is less becoming to an orator <lb/>
            than such theatrical modulation, which at times, indeed, resem­ <lb/>
            bles the loose singing of persons intoxicated, or engaged in a <lb/>
            revel ? 68. What can be more adverse to moving the feelings, <lb/>
            than, when we should express grief, or anger, or indignation, <lb/>
            or pity, not only to hold back from those affections, to which <lb/>
            the judge ought to be led, but to violate the sanctity of the <lb/>
            forum with the licence of games at dice ? t for Cicero said that <lb/>
            the orators from Lycia and Caria almost sang in their perora­ <lb/>
            tions. As for us, we have even somewhat exceeded the more <lb/>
            severe modes of singing. 69. Does any one, let me ask, sing <lb/>
            in defending himself, I do not say on a charge of murder, or <lb/>
            sacrilege, or parricide, but even in disputes about money <lb/>
            transactions or the settlement of accounts, or, in a word, in <lb/>
            any kind of lawsuit? ‡ If singing is at all to be admitted, <lb/>
            there is no reason why we should not assist the modulation of <lb/>
            the voice with the lyre or the flute, or even, please heaven, <lb/>
            with cymbals, instruments which would be more in conformity <lb/>
            with such an offensive practice.§ 60. Yet we fall into the <note type="footnote"> * [Velut] trochleis.] Velut is not found in any text, but the necessity <lb/>

            absurdity with willingness, for every one is charmed with what <lb/>
            he himself sings, and there is less labour in chanting than in <lb/>
            pronouncing with propriety. There are some auditors, too, <lb/>
            who, in accordance with their other depraved indulgences, are <lb/>
            attracted on all occasions by the expectation of pleasure in <lb/>
            listening to something that may soothe their ears. What, <lb/>
            then, it may be objected, does not Cicero say. that there is a <lb/>
            sort of scarcely perceptible chanting in oratorical language ? <lb/>
            And does not this proceed from an impulse of nature ? In <lb/>
            answer to this objection, I shall show, a little further on, when <lb/>
            and how far this inflexion of the voice, or even chanting, (but <lb/>
            chanting scarcely perceptible, a term which most of our <lb/>
            speakers do not choose to understand,) is admissible.</p>
          <p>61. It is now, indeed, time for me to say what delivery to <lb/>
            the purpose is; and it is certainly such as is adapted to the <lb/>
            subjects on which we speak. To produce this quality the <lb/>
            thoughts and feelings contribute most; and the voice sounds <lb/>
            as it is struck; but as feelings are in some cases sincere, and <lb/>
            in others assumed and fictitious, those which are sincere burst <lb/>
            forth naturally, as those of persons in grief, in anger, in indig­ <lb/>
            nation ; yet their expression is void of art, and consequently <lb/>
            requires to be formed by precept and method. 62. Feelings, <lb/>
            on the contrary, which are assumed by imitation, depend <lb/>
            wholly on art, and do not proceed from nature ; and, therefore, <lb/>
            iu representing such feelings, the first requisite is to impress <lb/>
            ourselves as much as possible, to conceive lively ideas of <lb/>
            things, and to allow ourselves to be moved by them as if they <lb/>
            were real; and then the voice, as an intermediate organ, will <lb/>
            convey to the minds of the judges that impression which it <lb/>
            receives from our own; for the voice is the index of the mind, <lb/>
            and has as many variations as the mind itself. 63. Hence, <lb/>
            in speaking on cheerful subjects, it flows in a full and clear <lb/>
            tone, and is itself, as it were, cheerful; in argument, it rouses <lb/>
            itself with its whole force, and strains, so to speak, every nerve; <lb/>
            in anger, it is fierce, rough, thick, and interrupted with frequent <lb/>
            respirations for the breath cannot hold long when it is expelled <note type="footnote"> * Orat. c. 18. " There is also in speaking a sort of concealed singing, <lb/>
            not like the peroration of rhetoricians from Phrygia or Caria, which is <lb/>
            nearly a chant, but that sort which Demosthenes and Æschines mean <lb/>
            when the one reproaches the other with the affected modulation of his <lb/>
            voice.” </note> <pb n="360"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            in extraordinary quantities ; in throwing odium on persons or <lb/>
            things it is slower, because it is in general only those on the <lb/>
            weaker side that have recourse to such attempts; but in flat­ <lb/>
            tering, confessing, apologizing, supplicating, it is gentle and <lb/>
            submissive. 64. The tone of those who persuade, advise, pro­ <lb/>
            mise, or console, is grave. In expressing fear and shame, the <lb/>
            tone is staid; in exhortation it is strong; in dispute, voluble; <lb/>
            in expressing pity, tender and mournful, and purposely some­ <lb/>
            what weakened. In oratorical digressions the voice is flowing, <lb/>
            and of a tranquil clearness ; in statements of facts, as well as <lb/>
            in familiar conversation, it is of an even tone, intermediate <lb/>
            between the acute and the grave. 65. In expressing the more <lb/>
            vehement feelings it rises; in uttering those of a calmer nature, <lb/>
            it falls, and pitches itself, in either case, higher or lower <lb/>
            according to the degree of intensity.</p>
          <p>But what tones of voice the several parts of speech require, <lb/>
            I shall omit to consider at present, that I may first make some <lb/>
            remarks on gesture, which must be in concert with the voice, <lb/>
            and must, as well as the voice, obey the mind.</p>
          <p>How much power gesture has in a speaker, is sufficiently <lb/>
            evident from the consideration that it can signify most things <lb/>
            even without the aid of words. 66. Not only a movement of <lb/>
            the hand, but even a nod. may express our meaning; and <lb/>
            such gestures are to the dumb instead of speech. Dancing, <lb/>
            too, unaccompanied by the voice, often conveys a meaning, and <lb/>
            touches the feelings ; the state of a person's mind is seen in <lb/>
            his looks and walk ; and in the inferior animals, which are <lb/>
            destitute of speech, anger, joy, fondness, are discoverable from <lb/>
            the glances of their eyes, and other indications from the move­ <lb/>
            ments of the body. 67. Nor is it surprising that such signs, <lb/>
            which must at any rate depend on motion, make such impres­ <lb/>
            sion on the mind, when even painting, a voiceless production, <lb/>
            and always keeping the same form, penetrates into our inner­ <lb/>
            most feelings, and with such force that it seems at times to <lb/>
            surpass the power of words. On the contrary, if our gesture <lb/>
            and looks are at variance with our speech; if we utter any­ <lb/>
            thing mournful with an air of cheerfulness, or assert anything <lb/>
            with an air of denial, not only impressiveness is wanting to <lb/>
            our words, but even credibility.</p>
          <p>68. Gracefulness also lies in gesture and motion ; and <lb/>
            hence Demostheues used to study action while looking into <pb n="361"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            a large mirror and though the polished surface made <lb/>
            the right side of the body appear the left, he could notwith­ <lb/>
            standing trust his eyes for the effect which he would be <lb/>
            enabled to produce.</p>
          <p>In action, as in the whole body, the head holds the chief <lb/>
            place, as contributing to produce both the gracefulness which <lb/>
            I have just mentioned, and expressiveness. 69. What contri­ <lb/>
            butes to gracefulness, is, first of all, that the head be held in <lb/>
            a proper and natural position ; for, by casting down the head, <lb/>
            humility is signified; by throwing it back, haughtiness; by <lb/>
            leaning it on one side, languor; by keeping it rigid and un­ <lb/>
            moved, a certain degree of rudeness. 70. It must receive, in <lb/>
            the next place, appropriate motions from the nature of the <lb/>
            subject on which we speak, that it may agree with the <lb/>
            gesture, and act in conformity with the hands and oscillations <lb/>
            of the body ; for the face must always be turned in the same <lb/>
            direction as the gesture, except in speaking of things which <lb/>
            we disapprove, or are unwilling to allow, or regard with aver­ <lb/>
            sion ; so that we may appear at the same time to express dis­ <lb/>
            like of an object with the look, and to repel it with the hand , <lb/>
            as in pronouncing such words as these : <lb/>
            Dt, talem avertite pestem It <lb/>
            Ye gods, such plague avert! <lb/>
            Haud equidem tali me dignor honore, <lb/>
            I think myself not worthy of such honour.</p>
          <p>71. But the head expresses meaning in various ways ; for be. <lb/>
            sides its motions of assenting, refusing, and affirming, it has <lb/>
            those of bashfulness, hesitation, admiration, indignation, which <lb/>
            are alike known and common to all persons. Yet to gesticu­ <lb/>
            late with the head alone the masters of theatrical attitude <lb/>
            regard as a fault. Even frequent nodding with it is thought <lb/>
            ungraceful; and to toss it to and fro, and shake and whirl <lb/>
            about the hair, are the gestures of frenzied inspiration.</p>
          <p>72. But the chief part of the head is the face. With the face <lb/>
            we show ourselves suppliant, menacing, soothing, sad, cheerful, <lb/>
            proud, humble ; on the face men hang as it were, and fix theif <lb/>
            gaze and entire attention on it, even before we begin to speak, <note type="footnote"> * Pluto Vit. Dem. c. 7; Apuleius, Apol. p. 87, ed. Gentil. </note><note type="footnote"> t Æn. iii. 620. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Æn. i. 335. </note> <pb n="362"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            by the face we express love and hate ; from the face we under­ <lb/>
            stand numbers of things, and its expression is often equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to all the words that we could use. 73. Accordingly in <lb/>
            the pieces composed for the stage, the masters in the art of <lb/>
            delivery borrow aid for exciting the feelings even from their <lb/>
            masks ; so that, in tragedy, the mask for the character of <lb/>
            Aerope * looks mournful; that for Medea, fierce; that for <lb/>
            Ajax, indicates disorder of mind; that for Hercules, boldness; <lb/>
            74. while in comedy, besides other designations by which slaves, <lb/>
            procurers, parasites, countrymen, soldiers, courtezans, maid­ <lb/>
            servants, morose or good-natured old men, careful or extrava­ <lb/>
            gant youths, are distinguished one from another, the father, <lb/>
            who plays the principal part, has, because he is sometimes in <lb/>
            a passion and sometimes calm, a mask with one of the eye­ <lb/>
            brows raised, and the other lowered, and it is the practice of <lb/>
            the actors to turn that side more frequently to the audience <lb/>
            which is more in accordance with the part of the character <lb/>
            which they are playing.</p>
          <p>75. But what is most expressive in the face is the eye, <lb/>
            through which the mind chiefly manifests itself; insomuch <lb/>
            that the eyes, even while they remain motionless, can sparkle <lb/>
            with joy, or contract a gloomy look under sadness. To the <lb/>
            eyes, also, nature has given tears, which are the interpreters of <lb/>
            our feelings, and which burst forth in grief, or trickle gently <lb/>
            down in joy. But when the eyes are in motion, they assume <lb/>
            an appearance of eagerness, or disregard, or pride, or sternness, <lb/>
            or mildness, or threatening ; all which feelings will be mani­ <lb/>
            fested in the eyes of an orator, according as his subject shall <lb/>
            require. 76. But rigid and distended, languid or torpid, <lb/>
            wanton or rolling, they ought never to be; nor should they <lb/>
            ever seem to swim or look watery with pleasure, or glance <lb/>
            sideways, or appear as it were amorous, or as if they were ask­ <lb/>
            ing or promising something. As to keeping them shut or <lb/>
            compressed in speaking, who would do so but a person utterly <lb/>
            ignorant or silly? 77. To aid in producing all these expres­ <lb/>
            sions, there is a kind of ministering power situate in the <lb/>
            upper and lower eye-lids. 78. Much effect is also produced <lb/>
            by the eye-brows; for they in some degree form the look of the <note type="footnote"> * The daughter of Crateus of Crete, who was violated by her own <lb/>

            eyes, and exercise a command over the forehead, which, by <lb/>
            their influence, is contracted, raised, or lowered ; so that the <lb/>
            only thing which has more power over it is the blood, which is <lb/>
            moved according to the state of the mind, and, when it <lb/>
            acts under a skin easily affected by shame,. mantles into a <lb/>
            Dlush, when it shrinks back through fear, wholly disappears, <lb/>
            and leaves the skin cold and pale, but when it is in a calm <lb/>
            condition, it spreads over the face that serene hue which holds <lb/>
            a middle place between blushing and paleness. 79. It is a fault <lb/>
            in the eyebrows, when they are either motionless, or too full of <lb/>
            motion, or when they rise and fall unequally, as I observed <lb/>
            just now t with respect to those of the comic mask, or when <lb/>
            their configuration is at variance with what we are saying ; for <lb/>
            anger is indicated by the contraction, sadness by the lowering, <lb/>
            and cheerfulness by the expansion of them.</p>
          <p>80. With the nose and the lips we can scarcely signify <lb/>
            anything becomingly; (though derision, contempt, and disdain <lb/>
            are often expressed by them;) for to wrinkle the nose, as <lb/>
            Horace‡ says, to distend it, to move it about, to rub it <lb/>
            incessantly with the finger, to expel the air with a sudden <lb/>
            snort,§ to stretch open the nostrils frequently.|| or to push <lb/>
            them up with the palm of the hand, is extremely offensive; <lb/>
            and even to blow or wipe the nose very often is not unjustly <lb/>
            blamed. 81. As to the lips, there is something unbecoming <lb/>
            when they are thrust out, or held in, or strongly ¶ pressed <lb/>
            together, or widely parted, so as to expose the teeth, or drawn <lb/>
            back towards each side, perhaps almost to each ear, or screwed <lb/>
            up with an air of disdain, or made to hang down, or emit the <lb/>
            voice only on one side. To lick and bite them is also unbe­ <note type="footnote"> * Infirmam verecundiâ cutem.] Equivalent to mollem fronteM, vi. 4, <lb/>

            which is produced by drawing back the corners of the mouth to as <unclear>te</unclear> <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            coming; and the movement of them even in the formation <unclear>of</unclear> <lb/>
            our words should be but moderate; for words ought to be <lb/>
            formed rather in the mouth than with the lips.</p>
          <p>82. The neck ought to be straight, not stiff or thrown back. <lb/>
            The throat cannot be drawn down or stretched up without <lb/>
            equal ungracefulness, though of different kinds; but uneasi­ <lb/>
            ness is attendant on the tension of it, and the voice is <lb/>
            weakened and exhausted by it. To sink the chin on the <lb/>
            breast renders the voice less distinct, and, as it were, grosser, <lb/>
            from the throat being compressed.</p>
          <p>83. To shrug or contract the shoulders is very seldom <lb/>
            becoming; for the neck is shortened by it; and it begets a <lb/>
            mean, servile, and knavish sort of gesture ; particularly when <lb/>
            men put themselves into postures of adulation, admiration, <lb/>
            or fear.</p>
          <p>84. A moderate extension of the arm, with the shoulders <lb/>
            thrown back, and the fingers opening as the hand advances, is a <lb/>
            kind of gesture excellently adapted to continuous and smoothly­ <lb/>
            flowing passages. But when anything finer or fuller than <lb/>
            ordinary is to be expressed, as, Rocks and deserts respond to <lb/>
            the voice of the poet,* it moves towards the side, and the words <lb/>
            and the gesture, if I may so express myself, expand them­ <lb/>
            selves together.</p>
          <p>85. As to the hands, without the aid of which all delivery <lb/>
            would be deficient and weak, it can scarcely be told of what a <lb/>
            variety of motions they are susceptible, since they almost <lb/>
            equal in expression the powers of language itself; for other <lb/>
            parts of the body assist the speaker, but these, I may almost <lb/>
            say, speak themselves. 86. With our hands we ask, promise, <lb/>
            call persons to us and send them away, threaten, supplicate, <lb/>
            intimate dislike or fear ; with our hands we signify joy, grief, <lb/>
            doubt, acknowledgment, penitence, and indicate measure, <lb/>
            quantity, number, and time. 87. Have not our hands the <lb/>
            power of inciting, of restraining, of beseeching, of testifying <lb/>
            approbation, admiration, and shame ? Do they not, in point <lb/>
            ing out places and persons, discharge the duty of adverbs and <lb/>
            pronouns ? So that amidst the great diversity of tongues per <lb/>
            wading all nations and people, the language of the hands <lb/>
            appears to be a language common to all men.</p>
          <p>88. The gestures of which I have hitherto spoken naturally <note type="footnote"> * Cicero pro Arch. c. S. </note> <pb n="365"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            proceed from us with our words; but there are ethers that <lb/>
            signify things by imitation ; as when, for example, we intimate <lb/>
            that a person is sick, by imitating the action of a physician <lb/>
            feeling the pulse, or that a person is a musician, by putting <lb/>
            our hands into the position of those of one playing the lyre; a <lb/>
            species -of imitation which ought to be carefully avoided in <lb/>
            oratory; 89. for an orator ought to be a very different character <lb/>
            from an actor in pantomime, as his gesture should be suited <lb/>
            rather to his sense than to his words ;* a principle which was <lb/>
            observed even by the more respectable class of actors. Though <lb/>
            I would allow a speaker, therefore, to direct his hand towards <lb/>
            his body when he is speaking of himself, or to stretch it <lb/>
            towards a person to point him out, and to use some other ges­ <lb/>
            tures of this sort, yet I would not permit him to represent <lb/>
            attitudes, and to exemplify whatever he says by action. <lb/>
            90. Nor is this to be observed in reference to the hands <lb/>
            alone, but to every kind of gesture, and even to the tone of <lb/>
            the voice; for neither in pronouncing the period Stetit sole­ <lb/>
            aMus praetor populi Romania " The prætor of the Roman <lb/>
            people, with sandals, stood," &amp;c., must the stooping of Verres, <lb/>

            words Cædebatur in medio foro Messanæ,‡ “ He was scourged <lb/>
            in the middle of the market-place of Messana," is a tortuous <lb/>
            motion of the body, like that of a man under the lash, to be <lb/>
            assumed, or the voice to be forced out like that of a man <lb/>
            compelled to cry with pain. 91. Even players seem to <lb/>
            me to act very injudiciously, who, though representing the <lb/>
            part of a young man, yet when, in a narrative, either the <lb/>
            speech of an old man, as in the prologue to the Hydria, or <lb/>
            that of a woman, as in the Georgus,§ has to be repeated, <lb/>
            pronounce it with a tremulous or effeminate tone of voice <lb/>
            Thus there may even be objectionable imitation in those <lb/>
            whose whole art consists in imitation.</p>
          <p>92. But, with regard to the hand, that gesture is most <lb/>
            common, in which the middle finger is drawn in towards the <note type="footnote"> * He should not attempt to exemplify particular words, but should <lb/>

            thumb, the other three fingers being open ;* it is suitable for <lb/>
            exordia, moderately exerted, and with a gentle movement of <lb/>
            the hand in either direction, while the head and shoulders <lb/>
            bend almost imperceptibly towards that quarter to which the <lb/>
            hand is stretched. In statements of facts it adds confirma­ <lb/>
            tion ,t but must then be somewhat more decided; in invective <lb/>
            and refutation it must be spirited and impressive, for it may <lb/>
            be exerted in such parts with more freedom and boldness. <lb/>
            93. But the middle finger ‡ is very often improperly directed <lb/>
            towards the side, as if aiming at the left shoulder; and some <lb/>
            speakers, with even still worse effect, extend the arm across <lb/>
            their chest, and speak over their elbow. The two middle <lb/>
            fingers are also sometimes brought under the thumb, and this <lb/>
            gesture is still more earnest than the former, and is accordingly <lb/>
            unsuitable for exordium or narrative. 94. But when three <lb/>
            fingers are compressed under the thumb, the finger which <lb/>
            Cicero says that Crassus used with such excellent effect,§ is <lb/>
            then fully extended. This finger has great effect in invective <lb/>

            shoulder, it affirms; directed towards the ground, and lowered <lb/>
            at the point, it insists; sometimes it indicates number." 95 <lb/>
            The same finger, when its lowest joint is lightly pressed on <lb/>
            each side,.. with the two next fingers moderately bent, and the <lb/>
            little one the less bent of the two, forms a gesture adapted for <lb/>
            discussion. Yet those appear to argue more spiritedly, who <lb/>
            hold rather the middle joint,tt the two outside fingers being <note type="footnote"> * The reader is not to suppose, says Spalding, that the middle finger <lb/>

            contracted in proportion as the others fall lower. 96. It is a <lb/>
            gesture also very suitable for modest language, when the hand, <lb/>
            its first four fingers being slightly curved at the extremity, is <lb/>
            drawn in towards the body, not far from the chin or the breast, <lb/>
            and then descending, and gradually moved back from the <lb/>
            body, is spread open. 97. With this gesture I conceive that <lb/>
            Demosthenes commenced his modest and submissive exordium <lb/>
            in the speech for Ctesiphon; and I imagine that Cicero's <lb/>
            hand was in this attitude when he uttered the words, If there <lb/>
            be any ability in me, judges, and I am sensible how little there <lb/>
            is,* &amp;c. The hand is also sometimes drawn back towards us <lb/>
            somewhat more quickly, with the fingers inclining downwards, <lb/>
            and is expanded more freely as it is moved in the opposite <lb/>
            direction, so that it seems itself, in a manner, to utter words.t <lb/>
            98. Sometimes we hold the two first fingers apart, without, <lb/>
            however, inserting the thumb between them, but with the two <lb/>
            lower fingers slightly curved inwards, and the two upper ones <lb/>
            not quite straightened. 99. Sometimes the two outside fingers <lb/>
            press the palm of the hand near the root of the thumb, which <lb/>
            it unites with the two first fingers at the middle joint; some­ <lb/>
            times the little finger is suffered to bend down obliquely, <lb/>
            sometimes, by relaxing rather than stretching the other four, <lb/>
            and inclining the thumb inwards, we put the band into a form <lb/>
            suited for waving expressively from side to side, or marking <lb/>
            distinctly what we say, it being moved upwards toward the <lb/>
            left side and downwards toward the right. 100. There are <lb/>
            also gestures of the hand taking less compass, as when, being <lb/>
            gently curved, like that of persons protesting,‡ it is moved <lb/>
            backwards and forwards at short intervals, the shoulders <lb/>
            moving slightly in concert with it; a gesture admirably <lb/>
            adapted to those who speak with reserve and timidity. A ges <lb/>
            ture suited to express admiration, is that in which the hand <lb/>
            moderately raised, and with each of the fingers curved, is <note type="footnote"> * Cie. pro Arch. c. 1. Whether it be that our northern climate <lb/>

            opened and slightly shut alternately.* 101. In asking que. <lb/>
            tions we use gestures of more kinds than one; generally, <lb/>
            however, turning the hand towards the person addressed, <lb/>
            whatever be the form into which it is put. When the finger <lb/>
            next to the thumb touches with its own tip the middle of the <lb/>
            thumb nail, a part where they readily meet,t the other fingers <lb/>
            being at the same time unbent, it is a gesture becoming to <lb/>
            speakers alike when expressing approbation, or narrating, or <lb/>
            making distinctions. 102. Not unlike this is the gesture <lb/>
            which the Greeks frequently use, even with both hands, but <lb/>
            with the three outside fingers compressed, whenever they <lb/>
            round, as it were, their enthymemes with action.! The hand <note type="footnote"> * Quo manus modicd supinata, ac per singulos à minimo collecta <lb/>

            nobody that would describe this gesture, as we ought to conceive it in <lb/>
            the mind. The passage was too plain, forsooth, in the opinion of the <lb/>
            commentators, to require any explanation. For my own part, I cannot <lb/>
            understand it at all, not knowing, in the first place, what is meant by <lb/>
            manus per singulos collecta digitos. Are we to understand that the <lb/>
            fingers are bent gradually, in the sight of the audience, in such a way <lb/>
            that the little finger may first touch the fourth, and then the fourth <lb/>
            the third, and so on ? He that looks into Gedoyn’s version, will see <lb/>
            that he has used great licence, and yet not produced anything clear. <lb/>
            Comp. sect. 105. Spalding. I will let the reader see Gedoyn's trans­ <lb/>

            retourne tout d'un terns en dehors, pendant que les bras, de plié qu'il <lb/>
            étoit, s'alonge et se déploie. Doubtless the tips of the fingers, when <lb/>
            the hand is held up in a gesture of admiration, form part of a sort of <lb/>
            circle, but this is no interpretation of per singulos collecta digitos, for <lb/>
            which I indeed give something in my translation, but do not pretend <lb/>
            to give anything equivalent. Redeunte flexu appears to be the same as <lb/>
            “ alternately." I wonder that Gesner should have passed the passage <lb/>
            quite unnoticed. </note><note type="footnote"> t Mediumque, quà dexter est, unguem pollicis summo suo jungens.] <lb/>
            Spalding is as much at a loss with regard to this passage as to the one <lb/>
            on which I have just cited him. He is displeased with the commenta­ <lb/>

            thrown out gently * promises and declares assent; moved more <lb/>
            quickly, it is a gesture of exhortation, or sometimes of praise <lb/>
            There is also the gesture, rather natural than artificial, used <lb/>
            by a person enforcing his words, when he shuts and opens his <lb/>
            hand alternately and rapidly. 103. There is the gesture, too, <lb/>
            of exhortation, as it were, when the hand is presented in a <lb/>
            hollow form, with the fingers apart,! and raised, with some <lb/>
            spirit, above the top of the shoulder. But the tremulous <lb/>
            movement of the hand in this position, which has been almost <lb/>
            generally adopted in foreign schools,‡ is too theatrical. Why <lb/>
            some should be displeased with the turning of the fingers, with <lb/>
            the tips of them close together, towards our body, I do not <lb/>
            know; for it is a gesture which we use when we manifest a <lb/>
            slight degree of wonder, or sometimes in sudden indignation, <lb/>
            when we express fear or deprecation. 104. We also, in <lb/>
            repentance or anger, press the hand tightly on the breast, <lb/>
            when a few words expressed between the teeth are not unbe­ <lb/>
            coming, as what shall I now do ? What would you do ? To <lb/>
            point to a person with the thumb turned back I regard as a <lb/>

            and the circular motion, which returns on itself, may be <lb/>
            regarded as a seventh, the last alone, in respect to gesture, is <lb/>
            objectionable ; five of the others are very fitly used in pointing <lb/>
            out what is before us, on the right or left hand, or above or <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρογγύλα ρ̒ήματα</foreign>, Aristopb. Acharn. 686; and Curvum sermone rotato <lb/>

            what sense can well be given to it. Gesner says Cæsim, hoc est, <lb/>
            extrorsum projectd manu promittimus. To this explanation Spalding, <lb/>
            though not satisfied with it, yields a kind of acquiescence. </note><note type="footnote"> t Rara.] Intelligo raram manum, in quâ divaricantur aliquantum <lb/>

            meant that the schools received the gesture from others, or that the <lb/>
            Roman orators received it from the schools, I cannot venture to affirm ; <lb/>
            but I suppose that the former is intended, as, in the latter case, the <lb/>
            word accept would rather have been used. Gallæus thinks that the <lb/>
            schools in the provinces are meant, and I agree with him, unless indeed <lb/>

            below ; to what is behind us, indeed, our gesture is never <lb/>
            properly directed, though it sometimes has, as it were, a back­ <lb/>
            ward movement.</p>
          <p>106. As to the motion of the hand, it commences, with very <lb/>
            good effect, on the left, and stops on the light; but the hand <lb/>
            ought to stop so that it may appear to be laid down, not to <lb/>
            strike against anything; though, at the end of a phrase, the <lb/>
            hand may sometimes sink, but so as soon to raise itself again ; <lb/>
            and it sometimes even rebounds, as it were, when we enforce a <lb/>
            denial or express wonder. In regard to this point the old <lb/>
            masters of delivery have very properly added a direction that <lb/>
            the movement of the hand should begin and end with the sense; <lb/>
            otherwise the gesture will either precede the sense, or will fall <lb/>
            behind it; and propriety is violated in either case. 107. But <lb/>
            they fell into too much nicety when they made it a rule that <lb/>
            there should be an interval of three words between each move­ <lb/>
            ment of the hand; a rule which is neither observed nor can be <lb/>
            observed; but they meant, it appears, that there ought to be <lb/>
            some sort of standard for slowness or quickness, justly desiring <lb/>
            that the hand should neither be too long inactive, nor disturb­ <lb/>
            the speech (as is the practice of many orators) by perpetual <lb/>
            motion. 108. There is, however, another fault, which is com­ <lb/>
            mitted more frequently, and is more likely to become imper­ <lb/>
            ceptibly habitual. There are certain slight percussions t in <lb/>
            our language, certain feet, I might almost say, in conformity <lb/>
            with which the gesture of very many of our speakers is regu­ <lb/>
            lated. Thus, in the following period, Novum crimen, C. <lb/>
            Cæsar, et ante hanc them non auditum, propinquus meus ad to <lb/>
            Quintus Tubero detulit, t they make one gesture at novum <lb/>
            crimen, a second at C. Cæsar, a third at ante hanc diem, a <lb/>
            fourth at non auditum, a fifth at propinquus meus, another at <lb/>
            ad te, another at Q. Tubero, and another at detulit. 109. From <lb/>
            this practice originates a bad habit among young men, that, <lb/>
            when they write, they meditate all their gestures before-hand, <lb/>
            and settle in their minds how their hand shall wave when <lb/>
            they speak. Hence arises, too, another inconvenience, that <lb/>
            the movement of the hand, which ought to terminate on the <note type="footnote"> * Spalding's text has conciderent, but he acknowledges that <unclear>we</unclear> <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            right, will often come to a stop on the left. * 110. It is there­ <lb/>
            fore a better method, as there are in every period short phrases, <lb/>
            at the close of each of which we may, if we please, take breath, <lb/>
            to regulate our gesture in conformity with them; for example, <lb/>
            the words Novum crimen, C. Cœsar, have a kind of complete <lb/>
            sense in themselves, as a conjunction follows; and the suc­ <lb/>
            ceeding phrase, et ante hanc them non auditum, is sufficiently <lb/>
            complete; and to these phrases the movement of the han.i <lb/>
            should conform, especially at the commencement, when the <lb/>
            manner is calm. 111. But when increasing warmth has given <lb/>
            it animation, the gesture will become more spirited in pro­ <lb/>
            portion to the ardour of the language. But though in some <lb/>
            passages a rapid pronunciation will be proper, in others a staid <lb/>
            manner will be preferable. On some parts we touch but <lb/>
            slightly, throw together our remarks upon them, and hasten <lb/>
            forward ;† in others we insist, inculcate, impress. But slow­ <lb/>
            ness in delivery is better suited to the pathetic; and hence it <lb/>
            was that Roscius was inclined to quickness of manner, Æsopus <lb/>
            to gravity, the one acting in comedy and the other in tragedy <lb/>
            112. The same observation is to be made with regard to the <lb/>
            motion of the body; and accordingly, on the stage, the walk <lb/>
            of men in the prime of life, of old men, of military characters, <lb/>
            and of matrons, is slow; while male or female slaves, parasites, <lb/>
            and fishermen, ‡ move with greater agility.</p>
          <p>But the masters of the art of gesture will not allow the <lb/>
            hand to be raised above the eyes, or to fall lower than the <lb/>
            breast; and consequently it must be thought in the highest <lb/>
            degree objectionable to lift it to the crown of the head, § or to <lb/>

            were our hand to the left, the left shoulder should, at the same <lb/>
            time, be advanced, that it may move in concert with the head <lb/>
            as it inclines to the right.</p>
          <p>114. The left hand never properly performs a gesture <lb/>
            alone; but it frequently acts in agreement with the right, <lb/>
            either when we enumerate our arguments on our fingers, or <lb/>
            when wo express detestation by turning our palms towards the <lb/>
            left, or presenting them straight before us, or spread them out <lb/>
            on either side. 115. But such gestures are all of different <lb/>
            import; as, in an attitude of apology or supplication, we lower <lb/>
            the hands ; in adoration we raise them; and, in any apostrophe <lb/>
            or invocation, we stretch them out; a gesture which we should <lb/>
            adopt in pronouncing Ye Alban hills and groves, &amp;c.,* or the <lb/>

            flee ? To the Capitol, to see my brother's blood ? Or to my <lb/>
            home, &amp;c.† 116. In such cases the hands acting in concert t <lb/>
            express most feeling; stretched out but a short distance when <lb/>
            we speak on inconsiderable, grave, or tranquil subjects, but <lb/>
            extended to a greater distance when we treat of such as are <lb/>
            important, exhilarating, or awful.</p>

            hands must be added; at least on such faults as are incident <lb/>
            to experienced speakers; for as to the gestures of asking for a <lb/>
            cup, or threatening to use a scourge, or forming the number <lb/>
            five hundred by bending the thumb,§ I, though they are <lb/>
            noticed by some writers, have never seen them even in <lb/>
            uneducated speakers. 118. But the exposure of the side by <lb/>

            has of stretching it out to its utmost length, or of raising it to <lb/>

            shoulder, and striking out towards his back in such a way that <lb/>
            it is dangerous to stand behind him, or of making a large <lb/>
            sweep with the left hand, or of throwing the bands about at <lb/>
            random so as to strike the persons nearest, or of thumping the <lb/>
            elbows against the sides, are things, I know, of frequent occur­ <lb/>
            rence. 119. The hand of some speakers is indolent, or moves <lb/>
            with tremor, or appears to be sawing the air, or is pressed on <lb/>
            the head with the fingers bent, or turned up and tossed on <lb/>
            high.. That gesture is also affected by some, in which the <lb/>
            Pacificator is represented by statuaries, who, with his head <lb/>
            inclined over his right shoulder, and his arm stretched out on <lb/>
            a level with his ear, spreads forth his hand with the thumb <lb/>
            bent down; † a gesture which is in great favour with those <lb/>
            who boast that they speak sublatâ manu, " with uplifted hand." ‡ <lb/>
            120. We may notice also those who dart forth smart thoughts <lb/>
            with a wave of their fingers, or make denunciations with the <lb/>
            hand raised; or who, whenever they are pleased with what <lb/>
            they say, elevate themselves on tip-toe; a gesture which is <lb/>
            sometimes allowable, but they make it reprehensible by point­ <lb/>
            ing their finger, or two fingers, as high as they can into the <lb/>
            air, or putting both their hands into the position of those of a <lb/>
            person carrying a weight on his head.</p>
          <p>121. To these faults may be added such as arise, not from <lb/>

            make a sound, if our memory fails, or if thought refuses to <lb/>
            assist us, as if something were sticking in the throat; to rub <lb/>
            the point of the nose ; to walk about before bringing a passage <lb/>
            to a conclusion ; to make a sudden stop, and to court applause <lb/>
            by silence; but to specify all such faults would be an infinite <lb/>
            task; for every speaker has his own.</p>
          <p>122. We must take care, especially, that the breast and <lb/>
            stomach be not too much protruded; for such an attitude <lb/>
            bends the back inwards; and, besides, all bending backwards <lb/>
            is offensive. The sides must conform to the gesture of the <lb/>
            rest of the body; for the movements of the whole body are of <lb/>
            great importance; insomuch that Cicero thinks that more <lb/>
            effect is produced by them than even by the motion of the <lb/>
            hands; for he says in his Orator,* There will be, in a consum­ <lb/>
            mate speaker, no affected motions of the fingers, no fall of the <lb/>
            fingers to suit the cadences of the language, but he will rather <lb/>
            produce gestures by the movements of his whole body, and a <lb/>
            manly inclination of his side.</p>
          <p>123. To strike the thigh, a gesture which Cleon is sup­ <lb/>
            posed to have first practised at Athens, is not only common, <lb/>
            but suits the expression of indignant feeling, and excites the <lb/>
            attention of the audience. Cicero complained of the absence <lb/>
            of it in Calidius ; there was no striking of his forehead, he <lb/>
            says, nor his thigh. † With regard to the forehead, however <lb/>
            I would, if it be allowable, dissent from Cicero ; since to <lb/>
            strike even the hands together,t or to beat the breast, is <lb/>
            suitable only to the stage.</p>
          <p>124. To touch the breast with the tips of the fingers bent <lb/>
            inwards is a gesture that becomes us but seldom, as when we <lb/>
            express ourselves in a tone of exhortation, or reproach, or <lb/>
            commiseration; and whenever we adopt such a gesture, it <lb/>
            will not be improper to draw back the toga from the breast.</p>
          <p>In regard to the feet, we must observe how we place and <lb/>
            how we move them. To stand with the right foot advanced, <lb/>
            and to advance at the same time the hand and foot on the <lb/>
            same side, is ungraceful. 125. It is sometimes allowable to <lb/>
            rest on the right foot, but this must be done without any <lb/>
            inclination of the rest of the body ; and the attitude is rather <note type="footnote"> * C. 18. </note><note type="footnote">t Brut. c. 80. Comp. x. 1. 23. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Which is a much less vehement gesture than to strike the fore­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            that of an actor, than of an orator. When speakers stand on <lb/>
            the left foot, the right can neither be becomingly lifted up. <lb/>
            nor rested on tip-toe. To stretch the legs very widely apart, <lb/>
            is unbecoming even if we but stand in that position, and to <lb/>
            walk in it is highly indecent. 126. To step forwards is not <lb/>
            improper, if the movement be brief moderate in quickness, <lb/>
            and not too frequent. To walk a few steps will not be <lb/>
            unsuitable at times, on account of the extraordinary time <lb/>
            occupied in applauding; but Cicero approves only of such walk­ <lb/>
            ing as is very rare and very short* But to run hither and <lb/>
            thither, and, as Domitius Afer said of Mallius Sura,t to over­ <lb/>
            do our business, is most absurd; and Flavius Virginius ‡ <lb/>
            wittily asked a rival professor, who had this habit, how many <lb/>
            miles he had declaimed.</p>
          <p>127. It is also a general rule, I know, that we should not, <lb/>
            as we walk, turn our backs on the judges, but that the inside <lb/>
            part of our foot should be constantly presented to the tribunal <lb/>
            as we look towards it. This rule cannot always be observed <lb/>
            on private trials; but there the space is more confined, and we <lb/>
            cannot turn our backs on the judges long. We may at times, <lb/>
            however, draw back by degrees. Some speakers even leap <lb/>
            back, an act in the highest degree ridiculous.</p>
          <p>128. To stamp with the foot, though not improper occa* <lb/>
            sionally, and especially, as Cicero says,§ at the beginning or <lb/>
            end of a spirited argument, yet, if practised too often, is a <lb/>
            proof of silliness in the speaker, and ceases to attract the <lb/>
            judge's attention. Swaying from right to left, too, in speakers <lb/>
            who balance themselves alternately on either foot. is unbe. <lb/>
            coming. But what is most of all to be avoided is an effemi. <lb/>
            nate kind of gesture, such as Cicero || says was used by Titius, <lb/>
            from whom also a kind of dance was called Titius. 129 <lb/>
            Frequent and rapid oscillation, also, from one side to the <lb/>
            other, is objectionable; a habit at which Julius laughed ir, <lb/>
            Curio the father, by asking who it was that was speaking in <lb/>
            the boat;¶ and Sicinius made a similar jest upon him; for <lb/>
            when Curio had been violently tossing himself about, accord <lb/>
            ing to his custom, while Octavius, who was his colleague ir <lb/>
            the consulship, was sitting by, and who from ill health, was <note type="footnote"> * Orat. c. 18, </note><note type="footnote">t See vi. 3, 54. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Till. 3, 33. </note><note type="footnote"> § De Orate in. 49. </note><note type="footnote">|| Brut. c. 62. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> ^ This and the following anecdote come from Cicero Brut. c. 60. </note> <pb n="376"/>

            bandaged and covered with a vast quantity of medicated <lb/>
            plasters, Sicinius said, You can never, Octavius, feel sufficiently <lb/>
            grateful to your colleague, for, if he had not been near you, <lb/>
            the flies would have devoured you to-day where you sat.</p>
          <p>130. The shoulders are sometimes disagreeably shrugged <lb/>
            up; a fault which Demosthenes * is said to have corrected in <lb/>
            himself by standing, while he spoke, in a narrow kind of pulpit, <lb/>
            with a spear hanging down over his shoulder, so that if, in <lb/>
            the warmth of speaking, that gesture escaped him, he might <lb/>
            be reminded of it by a puncture from the weapon.</p>
          <p>It is allowable to walk about while speaking, only when, in <lb/>
            public causes, where there are several judges, we wish to <lb/>
            impress what we say on each individually. 131. But there is <lb/>
            an intolerable practice in which some speakers indulge, who, <lb/>
            having thrown back their gown over the shoulder, and drawn <lb/>
            up the lower part of it in a fold to their loins with their right <lb/>
            hand, walk about and harangue while gesticulating with the <lb/>
            left hand; when even to draw the gown up on the left side, <lb/>
            and stretch out the right hand far, is offensive. Hence I am <lb/>
            reminded not to omit remarking that it is a very foolish prac­ <lb/>
            tice when speakers, during the time occupied by applauses, <lb/>
            whisper in a neighbour's ear, or jest with their associates, or <lb/>
            sometimes look back to their clerks, as if telling them to note <lb/>
            down some gratuity for those who were loudest in their appro­ <lb/>
            bation.</p>
          <p>132. To incline a little towards the judge when you are <lb/>
            stating a case to him, if the matter on which you are speaking <lb/>
            be somewhat obscure, is permissible. But to bend far forward <lb/>
            towards the advocate on the opposite benches, is ill-man. <lb/>
            nered ; and for a speaker to fall back among his friends, and <lb/>
            to be supported in their arms, unless from real and evident <lb/>
            fatigue, is foppish; as it is also to be prompted, or to read, as <lb/>
            if he were forgetful; for, by all such practices, the force of <lb/>
            eloquence is relaxed, and the ardour cooled, while the judge <lb/>
            will think that too little respect spaid him.</p>
          <p>133. To cross over to the opposite seats, is by no means <lb/>
            becoming; and Cassius Severus facetiously proposed that bar­ <lb/>
            riers t should be erected to restrain a speaker who was guilty <note type="footnote"> * Related by Libanius in his Life of Demosthenes. Philander. </note><note type="footnote"> t Lincas.] Such lineœ, says Gesner, as were in the amphitheatre <lb/>
            made of iron, to separate the rows of meata. </note> <pb n="377"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            of this habit. If, indeed, an orator sometimes starts forward <lb/>
            with a spirited effort, he is always sure to return with very <lb/>
            poor effect.</p>
          <p>134. But many of the directions which I am giving must <lb/>
            be modified by those who plead before tribunals ;* for there <lb/>
            the countenance must be more elevated, that it may be fixed <lb/>
            on him who is addressed; the gesture, which is directed <lb/>
            towards him, must also be more erect; and there are other <lb/>
            particulars to be observed, which will occur to all without any <lb/>
            mention of them on my part. Modifications must also be <lb/>
            made by those who plead sitting, as is generally the case in <lb/>
            unimportant causes, when there cannot be the same energy of <lb/>
            manner. 135. Some offences against gracefulness must also <lb/>
            be committed through necessity; for, as the speaker sits on <lb/>
            the left hand of the judge, he will be obliged to advance his <lb/>
            right foot; and much of his action must be transferred, as it <lb/>
            were, from the right side to the left, that it may be directed <lb/>
            towards the judge, Some sitters, however, I see start up at <lb/>
            the conclusion of every period or division of their speech, <lb/>
            and some occasionally take even a little walk. Whether such <lb/>
            practices are becoming, they may consider; but when they <lb/>
            indulge in them, they do not plead sitting. 136. To eat or <lb/>
            drink, a,.; was formerly the custom with many, and is now with <lb/>
            some, must be abjured by the orator whom I am desirous to <lb/>
            form ; for if a speaker cannot support the fatigue of pleading <lb/>
            without having recourse to such aid, it will be no great loss if <lb/>
            he does not plead at all, and it will be much better for him <lb/>
            than to show such contempt for his profession and his audience.</p>
          <p>137. As to dress, the orator has no peculiar habit, but what <lb/>
            he wears is more observed than that of other men; and it <lb/>
            should therefore be, like that of all other persons of note, ele­ <lb/>
            gant and manly; for the fashion of the gown, and the shoes, <lb/>
            and the hair, is as reprehensible for too much care as for too <lb/>
            great negligence. Some importance, indeed, is attached to <lb/>
            dress; and it undergoes considerable changes under the <lb/>
            influence of time; for the ancients had no folds † to the toga, <note type="footnote"> * Apud tribunalia.] As distinct from the subsellia. " The subsellia <lb/>
            were for the tribunes, triumvirs, quæstors, and such as tried inferior <lb/>

            and for some time after they were introduced they were but <lb/>
            very small. 138. Accordingly they must have used. at the <lb/>
            commencement* of their speeches, a kind of gesture different <lb/>
            from ours, as their arm, † like that of the Greeks,‡ was con <lb/>
            fined within the garment. But I am speaking of the present <lb/>
            mode. A speaker who has not the right of wearing the latus <lb/>
            clavus,§ should be apparelled in such a way that his tunic may <lb/>
            fall, with its front skirts, a little below the knee, and, with <lb/>
            those behind, to the middle of the thigh ; for to drop them <lb/>
            lower belongs to women, and to draw them up higher to <lb/>
            soldiers. 139. To see that the purple || falls properly, is but <lb/>
            a minor object of care, but negligence in that respect is some­ <lb/>
            times censured. Of those who wear the latus clavus, the <lb/>
            fashion is to let it descend a little lower than those which are <lb/>
            girt.¶ The gown itself I should wish to be round, and cut so <lb/>
            as to fit well ; for, if not, it will be out of shape in various <lb/>
            ways. The forepart of it falls only, in the best fashion, to the <lb/>
            middle of the leg ; the hinder part should be as much above <lb/>
            the hem of the tunic as the front falls below it. J 40. The <note type="footnote">originally a fold over the bosom, but was afterwards used in a more <lb/>
            extended sense. It was an excrescence on the primitive toga, as Quin­ <lb/>
            tilian observes. The difference in the toga with and without a sinus <lb/>
            may be best understood by imagining what it would be, as we see it <lb/>
            represented in ancient statues, if deprived of a large portion of its <lb/>
            folds. In the later times of the toga, the folds were very numerous <lb/>
            and complicated. See Smith's Diet. of Gr. and Rom. Ant. art. Toga. </note><note type="footnote"> * The difference was only at the commencement, for, as they pro. <lb/>
            ceeded, the narrowness of the toga would be no hindrance to their <lb/>
            gesture, since, when they became extremely animated, they threw the <lb/>
            toga back over the shoulders. See sect. 144, 145, 149. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cicero, in his speech for Cælius, c. 5, observes that young speakers <lb/>
            were expected to confine the arm within the toga for a year; and <lb/>
            Seneca, Controv. v. 6, makes a similar remark. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Gesner refers to AEschines in Timarch. p. 174, B , where it is said <lb/>

            would have thought it presumptuous and audacious to stretch out the <lb/>

            fold is most graceful when it falls somewhat above the bottom <lb/>
            of the toga; certainly it should never fall below it. That <lb/>
            fold which is passed under the right shoulder across to the <lb/>
            left, like a belt, should neither be tight round the body nor <lb/>
            hang very loose; and that part of the toga which is put on <lb/>
            last* should fall something lower, for thus it will sit better <lb/>
            and be kept in its place. Some portion of the tunic should <lb/>
            also be drawn up, that it may not fall on the arm of the orator <lb/>
            while he is speaking; and a fold should be thrown over <lb/>
            the shoulder, the outer edge of which it will not be unbe <lb/>
            coming to throw back. 141. But the shoulder and the whole <lb/>
            of the throat ought not to be covered, else the dress will <lb/>
            become too narrow, and lose the dignity which consists in <lb/>
            width of chest. The left arm should be only so far raised as <lb/>
            to form a right angle,! over which the edge of the toga should <lb/>
            fall equally low on each side. 142. The hand is not to be <lb/>
            loaded with rings, especially such as do not pass the middle <lb/>
            joint; and the best attitude for the hand will be when the <lb/>
            thumb is raised and the fingers slightly bent, unless it hold a <lb/>
            memorandum book, a practice which should not be much <lb/>
            affected, for it seems to imply a distrust of the memory, and is <lb/>
            an impediment to much of the gesture.</p>
          <p>143. Our forefathers allowed the toga to fall, as the Greeks <lb/>
            allow their pallium, down to the feet; and Plotius and <lb/>
            Nigidius, who wrote of gesture in those days, recommended <lb/>
            that fashion of wearing it. I am, therefore, the more surprised <lb/>
            at the opinion of so learned a man as Plinius Secundus, who, <lb/>
            even in a book in which he has been almost too scrupulous ‡ <lb/>
            in his researches, states that Cicero used to let his toga fall <lb/>
            so low in order to conceal the varicose veins in his legs,§ <lb/>
            notwithstanding this fashion of wearing the toga is seen in the <lb/>
            statues of persons who lived after Cicero's time. 144. The <lb/>
            use of the short cloak, || of bandages in which the legs are <note type="footnote"> * What part this was, is uncertain; perhaps that which was thrown <lb/>

            wrapped, of mufflers for the throat, and of coverings for the <lb/>
            ears. nothing but ill health can excuse.</p>
          <p>But this strict regard to dress can be paid only at the <lb/>
            beginning of a speech, for, as we proceed, and almost at the <lb/>
            very commencement of the statement of the case, the fold of <lb/>
            the robe very properly falls, as of itself, from the shoulder; <lb/>
            and when we come to argument and moral considerations, it <lb/>
            will not be amiss to throw back the toga from the left <lb/>
            shoulder, and to pull down the fold if it happens to hang. <lb/>
            145. The left side* we may also draw down from the throat <lb/>
            and the upper part of the breast, for we are then all ardour; <lb/>
            and as the voice grows more energetic and varied in tone, the <lb/>
            dress may also assume an air of combativeness. 146. Though, <lb/>
            therefore, to wrap the toga round the left hand, or to make a <lb/>
            girdle of it, makes an orator look like a madman; and though <lb/>
            to throw back the fold of the robe from the bottom over the <lb/>
            right shoulder, indicates effeminacy and delicacy, (and even <lb/>
            grosser faults than these are committed,) yet why may we not <lb/>
            draw up the looser part of the dress under the left arm, for it is <lb/>
            an attitude that has something of spirit and vivacity not <lb/>
            unsuited to warm and animated pleading? 147. But when <lb/>
            the greater part of our speech has been delivered, and success <lb/>
            seems to attend us, scarcely any sort of gesture is unbecoming; <lb/>
            perspiration and weariness, and disorder of dress, with the <lb/>
            toga loose and falling off as it were on every side, are regarded <lb/>
            without censure. 148. I cannot but wonder the more, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that it should have entered the mind of Pliny to direct, <lb/>
            that the forehead should be wiped with the handkerchief in <lb/>
            such a manner that the hair should not be discomposed, when, <lb/>
            a little afterwards, he forbids earnestly and severely, as be­ <lb/>
            came him, that any pains should be taken in arranging the <lb/>
            hair. To me disordered hair seems to indicate strong feeling, <lb/>
            and the appearance of the speaker seems to be set off by his <lb/>
            very inattention to the condition of it. 149. But if the toga <lb/>
            falls from a speaker when he is only beginning, or has made <lb/>
            but little progress in his oration, neglect to readjust it would <lb/>
            be a proof either of extreme carelessness, or of laziness, or <lb/>
            of ignorance how an orator ought to be dressed.</p>
          <p>Such are the excellences, and such the faults, that may be <lb/>
            shown in delivery; and the orator, after these have been se. <lb/>
            before him, has many other things to consider. <note type="footnote"> * Lœva.] Lævam togæ partem. Gesner </note> <pb n="381"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/></p>
          <p>150. In the first place, he has to reflect in what character <lb/>
            he himself appears, and to whom, and in whose presence, he is <lb/>
            going to speak; for it is more allowable to say or do some <lb/>
            things than others in addressing certain persons, or before <lb/>
            certain audiences; and the same peculiarities in tone, gesture, <lb/>
            and walk, are not equally becoming before a sovereign, before <lb/>
            the senate, before the people, and before magistrates, or on a <lb/>
            private as on a public trial, in a simple representation as in a <lb/>
            formal pleading. Such distinctions, every one who directs <lb/>
            his attention to the subject, can conceive for himself.</p>
          <p>151. He has then to consider on what subject be is to <lb/>
            speak, and what object he desires to effect. As to the subject, <lb/>
            four points are to be regarded; one, with reference to the <lb/>
            whole cause, for causes may be either of a mournful or an <lb/>
            amusing nature, dangerous or safe, important or inconsider­ <lb/>
            able ; so that we should never be so occupied with particular <lb/>
            portions of a cause as to forget the general character of it. <lb/>
            152. The second, with respect to the different divisions of a <lb/>
            cause, as the exordium, the statement of facts, the arguments, <lb/>
            and the peroration. The third, with regard to the thoughts, <lb/>
            where everything is varied in conformity with the matter and <lb/>
            the addresses to the feelings. The fourth, with reference to <lb/>
            the words, in which, though imitation, if we try to make the <lb/>
            sound everywhere correspond to the sense,* is reprehensible, <lb/>
            yet, unless the proper force be given to some words, the sense <lb/>
            of the whole would be destroyed.</p>
          <p>153. In panegyrics, then, unless they be funeral orations, <lb/>
            in giving thanks, in exhortations, and in subjects of a similar <lb/>
            nature, our action should be animated, or grand, or sublime. <lb/>
            In funeral orations, speeches of consolation, and the greater <lb/>
            part of criminal causes, the gesture should be grave and <lb/>
            staid. In addressing the senate gravity should be observed; <lb/>
            in- speaking to the people, dignity; and in pleading private <lb/>
            causes, moderation. Of the several divisions of a cause, and <lb/>
            of the thoughts and language, which are of varied character, I <lb/>
            must speak at greater length.</p>
          <p>154, Delivery ought to exhibit three qualities; it should <lb/>
            conciliate, persuade, and move; and to please will be a quality <lb/>
            that naturally combines itself with these. Conciliation is <note type="footnote"> * For instance, if we pronounce latro, " robber." in a loud and vehe­ <lb/>
            ment tone. Turnebus. See sect. 175. </note> <pb n="382"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            produced either by fairness of moral character, which mani. <lb/>
            fests itself, I know not how, even in the tone and in the ges. <lb/>
            ture, or by agreeableness of language. Persuasion depends <lb/>
            greatly on assertion, which sometimes has more effect than <lb/>
            even proof itself. 155. Would those statements, says Cicero­ <lb/>
            to Calidius, have been delivered by you in such a way, if they had <lb/>
            been true? and, So far were you from inflaming our passions, <lb/>
            that we could scarcely abstain from sleep in that passage. Let <lb/>
            confidence, therefore, and firmness, be apparent in an orator's <lb/>
            manner, at least if he has authority to support it. 156. The <lb/>
            art of moving lies either in the manifestation of our own feel­ <lb/>
            ings, or imitation of those others.</p>
          <p>When the judge, therefore, in a private cause, or the herald <lb/>
            in a public one, calls upon us to speak, we must rise with <lb/>
            calmness; and we may then delay a little to settle our toga, <lb/>
            or, if necessary, to throw it on afresh, in order that our dress <lb/>
            may be more becoming, and that we may have some moments <lb/>
            for reflection ; though this can be done only on ordinary <lb/>
            trials, for before the emperor,† the magistrates, or the supreme <lb/>
            tribunals, it will not be possible. 157. Even when we have <lb/>
            turned towards the judge, and the prætor, being consulted, has <lb/>
            granted us leave to speak, we must not burst forth suddenly, <lb/>
            but allow a short space for recollection; for preparation on the <lb/>
            part of him who is going to speak is extremely pleasing to <lb/>
            him who is going to hear ; and the judge naturally composes <lb/>
            himself for attention. 158. This instruction Homer ‡ gives <lb/>
            us in the example of Ulysses, whom he represents as standing <lb/>
            with his eyes fixed on the ground, and his sceptre unmoved, <lb/>
            before he poured forth that storm of eloquence. In such a <lb/>
            pause, there may be, as the players observe, certain not un­ <lb/>
            becoming pretexts for delay, such as to stroke the head, to look <lb/>
            down at the hand, to crack the joints of the fingers,§ to pre­ <lb/>
            tend to make an effort, to betray anxiety by a sigh, or what­ <lb/>
            ever other gesture may suit the speaker; and we may con­ <note type="footnote"> * Brut. c. 80. </note><note type="footnote"> t When the orator stands awaiting his nod, in order to begin at <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            tinue such actions, if the judge be still unprepared to give us <lb/>
            his attention. 159. As'to the attitude, it should be erect, the <lb/>
            feet a little apart, in similar positions, or the left a slight <lb/>
            degree in advance; the knees straight, but not so as to <lb/>
            seem stiff; the shoulders kept down; the countenance grave, <lb/>
            not anxious, or stolid, or languid ; the arms at a moderate <lb/>
            distance from the side ; the left hand in the position which I <lb/>
            have before prescribed ;* and the right, when we are going to <lb/>
            commence, a little extended beyond tne bosom of the toga, <lb/>
            with the most modest possible gesture, as if waiting for the <lb/>
            moment to begin. 160. For there are many offensive gestures <lb/>
            practised, such as looking up at the ceiling; rubbing the face, <lb/>
            and making it bold as it were; stretching forward the face <lb/>
            with a confident kind of air, or knitting the brows to make it <lb/>
            appear more stern; brushing the hair unnaturally back from <lb/>
            the forehead, that its roughness may look terrible; pretend­ <lb/>
            ing, by a constant motion of the lips and fingers, as is a fre­ <lb/>
            quent practice with the Greeks, to be studying what we are <lb/>
            going to say; hawking with a great noise ; extending one <lb/>
            foot far before the other; holding up a part of the toga with <lb/>
            the left hand ; standing with the legs wide apart, or with the <lb/>
            body stiff, or thrown back, or bent forwards, or with the <lb/>
            shoulders drawn up, like those of men about to wrestle, to the <lb/>
            hinder part of the head.</p>
          <p>161. For the exordium a calm delivery is generally suit­ <lb/>
            able ; for nothing is more attractive than modesty to gain us <lb/>
            a favourable hearing. Yet this is not always to be the case ; <lb/>
            for exordia, as I have shown,! are not all to be pronounced in <lb/>
            the same manner. In general, however, the tone at the com­ <lb/>
            mencement should be calm, the gesture modest, the toga well <lb/>
            settled on the shoulder, the motion of the body to either side <lb/>
            gentle, and the eyes looking in the same direction as the body.</p>
          <p>162. The statement of the case will commonly require the <lb/>
            hand to be more extended, the toga thrown back, and the <lb/>
            gesture more decided, with a tone of voice similar to that of <lb/>
            ordinary conversation, only more spirited, yet of uniform <lb/>
            sound; at least in such passages as these, For Quintus Liga­ <lb/>
            rius, when there was no suspicion of war in Africa,‡ &amp;c., and <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            &amp;c.; but other passages in a statement may call for a different <lb/>
            tone, as, The mother-in-law is married to her son-in-law,* &amp;c., <lb/>
            and, A spectacle grievous and afflicting to the whole province of <lb/>
            Asia is exhibited in the market-place of Laodicea,† &amp;c.</p>
          <p>163. In advancing proofs the action may be various and <lb/>
            diversified; for although to state, to distinguish particulars, to <lb/>
            ask questions, and to anticipate objections, (and this is another <lb/>
            kind of statement), may be confined to a tone bordering on <lb/>
            the conversational, yet we may sometimes offer our demon­ <lb/>
            strations in a strain of raillery or mimicry.</p>
          <p>164. Argumentation, being generally more spirited, lively, <lb/>
            and energetic, requires gesture suited to the subject, that is, <lb/>
            impressive and animated. We must insist strongly in cer­ <lb/>
            tain passages, and our words must appear as it were in close <lb/>
            array.</p>
          <p>Digressions should mostly be delivered in a gentle, agree­ <lb/>
            able, and calm tone ; as those of the rape of Proserpine,‡ the <lb/>
            description of Sicily,§ and the eulogy of Pompey; || for it is <lb/>
            natural that what is unconnected with the main question <lb/>
            should require less urgency of manner.</p>
          <p>165. A representation of the manners of the opposite <lb/>
            party, accompanied with censure, may sometimes be given in <lb/>
            a gentle tone, as, I seemed to myself to see some entering, <lb/>
            others going out, some tottering from the effects of wine, some <lb/>
            yawningfrom yesterday's carousal,¶ when gesture, such as is <lb/>
            not unsuitable to the tone, is admissible; for example, a <lb/>
            gentle movement to either side, but a movement confined to <lb/>
            the hand, without any change in the position of the body.</p>
          <p>166. For exciting the judge, many varieties of tone may be <lb/>
            adopted. The highest and loudest tone that a speaker can <lb/>
            possibly adopt is proper for uttering the following words, <lb/>
            When the war was begun, Cœsar, and, even in a great degree <lb/>
            advanced,.. &amp;c., for he had previously said, I will exert my <lb/>
            voice as loudly as possible, that the people of Rome may hear, <lb/>
            &amp;c. A tone somewhat lower, and having something pleasing <lb/>
            in it, is suitable for the question, What was that sword of <lb/>
            yours doing, Tubero, in the field of Pharsalia ? tt A tone <lb/>
            still fuller and slower, and consequently more agreeable, will <note type="footnote"> * Pro Cluent. c. 5. </note><note type="footnote">t In Verr. i. 30. </note><note type="footnote">‡ See iv. 3, 13. </note><note type="footnote"> § See ix. 2, 55. </note><note type="footnote">|| Pro Balb. c. 4. </note><note type="footnote">¶See viii. 3 66. </note><note type="footnote"> ** Cic. pro Lig. c. 3. </note><note type="footnote">†† Ibid. </note> <pb n="385"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            suit the words, But in an assembly of the people of Rome, and <lb/>
            when holding a public office,. &amp;c. 167. Here every sound should <lb/>
            be prolonged; the vowels should be extended, and the mouth <lb/>
            well opened. Yet the words, Ye Alban hills and groves,† &amp;c., <lb/>
            should flow in a still stronger stream; and, Rocks and deserts <lb/>
            respond to the voice of the poet,‡ &amp;c., should be pronounced in <lb/>
            a sort of chanting tone, and fall gradually in a musical cadence <lb/>
            168. It was with such variations of tone that Demosthenes <lb/>
            and Æschines upbraided each other ;§ but they are not on <lb/>
            that account to be condemned, for, as each reproached the <lb/>
            other with them, it is evident that both used them; since <lb/>
            it was not, assuredly, in an ordinary tone of voice that Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes || swore by the defenders of Marathon and Platæa and <lb/>
            Salamis, nor was it in the tone of daily conversation that <lb/>
            AEschines bewailed the fate of Thebes.¶ 169. There is also <lb/>
            a tone different from all those that have been mentioned, <lb/>
            raised almost above any key in which we speak, a tone on <lb/>
            which the Greeks have bestowed the term bitter, and which is <lb/>
            shrill beyond measure, and almost beyond the natural power of <lb/>
            the human voice. Thus are uttered the words, Quin compes­ <lb/>
            citis vocem istam, indicem stultitiœ, testem paucitatis,** " Will <lb/>
            you not restrain those cries, the indications of your folly, the <lb/>
            proofs of your fewness?" But the extravagant tone of which <lb/>
            I spoke is required only at the commencement, Quin com­ <lb/>
            pescitis.</p>
          <p>170. As to the peroration, if it consists of a recapitulation <lb/>
            of the case, it requires a continuous enumeration of particulars <lb/>
            in a uniform tone ; if it is intended to excite the judges, it must <lb/>
            be delivered in one of the tones which I have mentioned <lb/>
            above; if it is designed to soothe them, it calls for smooth­ <lb/>
            ness and gentleness; if to move them to pity, a kind of <lb/>
            musical cadence, and plaintive sweetness of the voice, by <lb/>
            which the mind is strongly affected, and which is extremely <lb/>
            natural; for at a funeral we may hear widows and orphans <lb/>
            lamenting in a mournful kind of melody. 171. In such a case <lb/>
            that muffled sort of voice which Cicero says that Antonius <lb/>
            had, †† will be of great effect, for it has from nature the tone <note type="footnote"> * Cic. Philipp. ii. 25. </note><note type="footnote">t Pro Mil. c. 31. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Pro Arch. c. &amp; </note><note type="footnote"> § Demosth. pro Cor. c. 90. Æach. cent.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            which we would wish to assume. There are, however, two <lb/>
            species of pity; one mixed with indignation, such as was <lb/>
            mentioned above * in reference to the condemnation of Philo­ <lb/>
            damus; the other in a lower tone, and accompanied with <lb/>
            deprecation. 172. Since, though there may be something of <lb/>
            scarcely perceptible music in the delivery of the words, But <lb/>
            in the assembly of the people of Rome,t &amp;c., for Cicero did not <lb/>
            utter them in a tone of invective, and in that of the exclama­ <lb/>
            tion, Ye Alban hills,‡ &amp;c., for he did not speak as if he were <lb/>
            invoking or calling them to witness, yet the following passages <lb/>
            must have been spoken in a manner infinitely more modu­ <lb/>
            lated and harmonious, Miserable, unhappy man that I am,§ <lb/>
            &amp;c., and, What answer shall I give to my children ? &amp;c., and, <lb/>
            Could you, Milo, by the means of these judges, recall me to my <lb/>
            country, and shall I be unable, by means of the same judges, to <lb/>
            retain you in yours ? || and he must have adopted a similar <lb/>
            tone when he values the property of Caius Rabirius at one <lb/>
            sesterce,¶ and exclaimed, 0 miserable and afflicting duty of <lb/>
            my voice! 173. A profession, too, on the part of the orator, that <lb/>
            he is sinking from distress and fatigue, has an extraordinary <lb/>
            effect in a peroration; as in the same speech for Milo, But <lb/>
            there must be an end; for I am no longer able to speak for <lb/>
            tears, &amp;c. ; and such passages must have the delivery conform­ <lb/>
            able to the language. 174. Other particulars may seem to <lb/>
            require notice as belonging to this portion and department of <lb/>
            a speech, as to produce accused persons, to take up children in <lb/>
            the arms, to bring forward relatives, and to rend garments, but <lb/>
            they have been mentioned in the proper place...</p>
          <p>Since, then, there is such variety in the different parts of a <lb/>
            cause, it is sufficiently apparent that the delivery, as I have <lb/>
            endeavoured to show, must correspond to the matter. But <lb/>
            the pronunciation must also be adapted to the words, as I <lb/>
            observed a little above, not indeed always, but at times. 175. <lb/>
            For example, must not the words unhappy man, poor creature, <lb/>
            be uttered in a low and subdued tone, and must not courageous, <lb/>
            vehement, robber, be spoken in a more elevated and energetic <unclear/> <lb/>
            one ? By such conformity a force and propriety of meaning <note type="footnote"> * Sect. 162. </note><note type="footnote">t See sect. 167. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Ibid. </note><note type="footnote"> § Pro Mil. c. 37. </note><note type="footnote">|| lb. c. 38. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ Pro Rabir. c. 17.

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH II.]"/><lb/>
            is given to our thoughts, and without it the tone would indicate <lb/>
            one thing and the thought another. 176. Do not, indeed, the <lb/>
            same words, by a change in the mode of pronouncing them, <lb/>
            express demonstration, assertion, reproach, denial, admiration, <lb/>
            indignation, interrogation, derision, contempt ? The syllable <lb/>
            tu is uttered in a very different tone in each of the following <lb/>
            passages of Virgil: <lb/>
            Tu mihi quodcunque hoc regni,* <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            Cantando tu illum ?† <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            Tune ille Æneas ?‡ <lb/>
            and, <lb/>
            Meque timoris <lb/>
            Argue tu, Drance.§ <lb/>
            Not to dwell too long on this head, let me observe only that <lb/>
            if the reader will conceive in his own mind this, or any other <lb/>
            word that he pleases, pronounced in conformity with every <lb/>
            variation of feeling, he will then be assured that what I say <lb/>
            is true.</p>
          <p>177. One remark must, however, be added, namely, that, <lb/>
            as the great object to be regarded in speaking is decorum, If <lb/>
            different manners often become different speakers; and for <lb/>
            such variety there is a secret and inexplicable cause; and <lb/>
            though it is truly said that our great triumph is, that what we <lb/>
            do should be becoming,¶ yet this, as it cannot be accomplished <lb/>
            without art, can still not be wholly communicated by art. 178. <lb/>
            In some, excellences have no charm; in others, even faults are <lb/>
            pleasing. We have seen the most eminent actors in comedy, <lb/>
            Demetrius and Stratocles,** delight their audiences by qualities <lb/>
            of a very different nature. It is not, however, surprising that <lb/>
            the one acted gods, young men, good fathers, domestics, <lb/>
            matrons, and staid old women, with happy effect, or that the <lb/>
            other was more successful in representing passionate old men, <lb/>
            cunning slaves, parasites, procurers, and other bustling cha­ <lb/>
            racters ; for their natural endowments were very different, as <lb/>
            even the voice of Demetrius was more pleasing, and that of <lb/>
            Stratocles more powerful. 179. But what was more observable <note type="footnote"> • An. i. 78. </note><note type="footnote">t Eel. iii. 25. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Æn. i. 617. </note><note type="footnote"> § AEn. xi. 383. </note><note type="footnote">|| Comp. c. 1, sect. 41. </note><note type="footnote">IT See Cic. de Orate i. 29. </note><note type="footnote"> ** Of these actors I find no mention elsewhere. Spalding. </note> <note type="footnote"> C C 2 </note> <pb n="388"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XI."/><lb/>
            was their peculiarity of action, which could not have been <lb/>
            transferred from one to the other; as to wave the hand in a <lb/>
            particular way, to prolong exclamations in an agreeable tone <lb/>
            to please the audience, to puff out the robe with the air on <lb/>
            entering the stage, and sometimes to gesticulate with the right <lb/>
            side,* could have been becoming in no actor but Demetrius ; <lb/>
            for in all these respects he was aided by a good stature and <lb/>
            comely person. 180. On the contrary, hurry, and perpetual <lb/>
            motion, and a laugh not altogether in unison with his mask, <lb/>
            (a laugh which he uttered to please the people, and with perfect <lb/>
            consciousness of what he was doing,) and a depression of the <lb/>
            head between the shoulders, were extremely agreeable in <lb/>
            Stratocles. But whatever excellence in either had been <lb/>
            attempted by the other, the attempt would have proved an <lb/>
            offensive failure. Let every speaker, therefore, know himself, <lb/>
            and, in order to form his delivery, consult, not only the ordi­ <lb/>
            nary rules of art, but his own abilities. 181. Yet it is not <lb/>
            absolutely impossible that all styles, or at least a great number, <lb/>
            may suit the same person.</p>
          <p>The conclusion to this head must be similar to that which I <lb/>
            have made to others, an admonition that moderation must <lb/>
            have the utmost influence in regard to it; for I do not wish <lb/>
            any pupil of mine to be an actor, but an orator. We need not, <lb/>
            therefore, study all the niceties of gesture, nor observe, in <lb/>
            speaking, all the troublesome varieties of stops, intervals, and <lb/>
            inflexions of tone for moving the feelings. 182. Thus, if an <lb/>
            actor on the stage had to pronounce the following verses, <lb/>
            Quid igitur faciam ? non eam, ne nunc quidem, <lb/>
            Quum arcessor ultro ? an potiùs ita me comparem, <lb/>
            Non perpeti meretricum contumelias ?† <lb/>
            What, therefore, shall I do ? not go ? not now, <lb/>
            When I'm invited by herself ? Or rather <lb/>
            Shall I resolve no longer to endure <lb/>
            These harlots' impudence ? <lb/>
            he would display all the pauses of doubt, and adopt various <lb/>
            inflexions of the voice and gestures of the hand ; but oratory <lb/>
            is of another nature, and will not allow itself to be too <lb/>
            much seasoned, for it consists in serious pleading, not in <lb/>
            mimicry. 183. Delivery, accordingly, that is accompanied with <lb/>
            perpetual movement of the features, that fatigues the <note type="footnote"> * Comp. sect. 74. </note><note type="footnote">t Ter. Eun. init. </note> <pb n="389"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH III.]"/><lb/>
            audience with gesticulation, and that fluctuates with con <lb/>
            slant changes of tone, is deservedly condemned. Our old <lb/>
            rhetoricians, therefore, wisely adopted a saying from the <lb/>
            Greeks, which Popilius Lænas inserted in his writings as <lb/>
            borrowed from our orators, that this is restless pleading.* <lb/>
            184. Cicero, in consequence, who has given excellent precepts <lb/>
            with regard to other matters, affords us similar directions with <lb/>
            respect to this; directions which I have already quoted from <lb/>
            his Orator;t and he makes observations of a like nature, in <lb/>
            reference to Antonius, in his Brutus. ‡ Yet a mode of speak­ <lb/>
            ing somewhat more vivacious than that of old has now become <lb/>
            prevalent, and is even required; and to some portions of a <lb/>
            speech it is very well adapted. But it must be kept so far under <lb/>
            control, that the orator, while he aims at the elegance of the <lb/>
            player, may not lose the character of a good and judicious <lb/>
            man. <note type="footnote"> * Inotiosam actionem.] The commentators have hitherto been unable <lb/>
            to find any Greek phrase resembling the Latin, or correspondent to it, <lb/>

          <p>1. I hAVE now arrived at by far the most important part of <lb/>
            the work which I had contemplated. Had I imagined, when <lb/>
            I first conceived the idea of it, that its weight would have <lb/>
            been so great as that with which I now feel myself pressed, I <lb/>
            should have earlier considered whether my strength would be <lb/>
            able to bear it. But, at the commencement, the thought of <lb/>
            the disgrace that I should incur if I did not perform what I <lb/>
            had promised, kept me to my undertaking; and afterwards, <lb/>
            though the labour increased at almost every stage, yet I <lb/>
            resolved to support myself under all difficulties, that I might <lb/>
            not render useless what had been already finished. 2. For <lb/>
            the same reason at present, also, though the task grows more <lb/>
            burdensome than ever, yet, as I look towards the end, I am <lb/>
            determined rather to faint than to despair.</p>
          <p>What deceived me, was, that I began with small matters; <lb/>
            and though I was subsequently carried onwards, like a mariner <lb/>
            by inviting gales, yet, as long as I treated only of what was <lb/>
            generally known, and had been the subject of consideration to <lb/>
            most writers on rhetoric, I seemed to be still at no great dis­ <lb/>
            tance from the shore, and had many companions who had <lb/>
            ventured to trust themselves to the same breezes. 3. But <lb/>
            when I entered upon regions of eloquence but recently dis­ <lb/>
            covered,. and attempted only by very few, scarcely a navigator <lb/>
            was to be seen that had gone so far from the harbour as <lb/>
            myself; and now, when the orator whom I have been forming, <lb/>
            being released from the teachers of rhetoric, is either carried <lb/>
            forward by his own efforts, or desires greater aid from the <lb/>
            inmost recesses of philosophy, I begin to feel into how vast an <lb/>
            ocean I have sailed, and see that there is <lb/>
            Cœlum undique et undique pontus,† <lb/>
            On all sides heaven, and on all sides sea. <lb/>
            I seem to behold, in the vast immensity, only one adventurer <note type="footnote"> * Because the ancient orators used but a rude kind of language, not <lb/>
            having discovered that regular and numerous composition which was <lb/>

            a height of excellence by Isocratea. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote">+ An. v 9. </note> <pb n="391"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="INTROD.]"/><lb/>
            besides myself, namely Cicero; and even he himself, though <lb/>
            he entered on the deep with so great and so well equipped a <lb/>
            vessel, contracts his sails, and lays aside his oars, and contents <lb/>
            himself with showing merely what sort of eloquence a consum­ <lb/>
            mate orator ought to employ. But my temerity will attempt <lb/>
            to define even the orator's moral character, and to prescribe <lb/>
            his duties. Thus, though I cannot overtake the great man <lb/>
            that is before me, I must, nevertheless, go farther than he, as <lb/>
            my subject shall lead me. However, the desire of what is <lb/>
            honourable is always praiseworthy, and it belongs to what we <lb/>
            may call cautious daring, to try that for failure in which pardon <lb/>
            will readily be granted</p>

          <p>A great orator must be a good man, according to Cato'a definition, <lb/>
            § 1, 2. A bad man cannot be a consummate orator, as he is <lb/>
            deficient in wisdom, 3—5. The mind of a had man is too much <lb/>
            distracted with cares and remorse, 6, 7. A bad man will not <lb/>
            speak with the same authority and effect on virtue and morality <lb/>
            as a good man, 8—13. Objections to this opinion answered, 14— <lb/>
            22. A bad man may doubtless speak with great force, but he <lb/>
            would make nearer approaches to perfect eloquence if he were a <lb/>
            good man, 23—32. Yet we must be able to conceive arguments <lb/>
            on either side of a question, 33—35. A good man may sometimes <lb/>
            be justified in misleading those whom he addresses, for the attain­ <lb/>
            ment of some good object, 36—45.</p>
          <p>1. LET the orator, then, whom I propose to form, be such a <lb/>
            one as is characterized by the definition of Marcus Cato, <lb/>
            a good man skilled in speaking.*</p>
          <p>But the requisite which Cato has placed first in this defini­ <lb/>
            tion, that an orator should be a good man, is naturally of more <lb/>
            estimation and importance than the other. It is of importance <lb/>
            that an orator should be good,† because, should the power of <note type="footnote"> * See note on ii. 15, 1. </note><note type="footnote"> t Id non e<foreign xml:lang="grc">ό</foreign> tantùm, quod, &amp;c.] Buttmann justly decides that e<foreign xml:lang="grc">ό</foreign> is <lb/>
            for propterea, as in iv. 2, 80. But there is an ancoluthon, as he <lb/>
            observes, in what follows, for Quintilian, instead of adding sed etiam, <lb/>
            as might have been expected, and proceeding regularly breaks off into <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            speaking be a support to evil, nothing would be more per­ <lb/>
            nicious than eloquence alike to public concerns and private, <lb/>
            and I myself, who, as far as is in my power, strive to contri­ <lb/>
            bute something to the faculty of the orator, should deserve <lb/>
            very ill of the world, since I should furnish arms, not for <lb/>
            soldiers, but for robbers. 2. May I not draw an argument <lb/>
            from the condition of mankind ? Nature herself, in bestowing <lb/>
            on man that which she seems to have granted him pre- <lb/>
            eminently, and by which she appears to have distinguished us <lb/>
            from all other animals,. would have acted, not as a parent, but <lb/>
            as a step-mother, if she had designed the faculty of speech to <lb/>
            be the promoter of crime, the oppressor of innocence, and the <lb/>
            enemy of truth; for it would have been better for us to have <lb/>
            been born dumb, and to have been left destitute of reasoning <lb/>
            powers, than to have received endowments from providence <lb/>
            only to turn them to the destruction of one another.</p>
          <p>3. My judgment carries me still further; for I not only say <lb/>
            that he who would answer my idea of an orator, must be a <lb/>
            good man, but that no man, unless he be good, can ever be an <lb/>
            orator. To an orator discernment and prudence are necessary; <lb/>
            but we can certainly not allow discernment to those, who, when <lb/>
            the ways of virtue and vice are set before them, prefer to <lb/>
            follow that of vice; nor can we allow them prudence, since <lb/>
            they subject themselves, by the unforeseen consequences of <lb/>
            their actions, often to the heaviest penalty of the law, and <lb/>
            always to that of an evil conscience. 4. But if it be not only <lb/>
            truly said by the wise, but always justly believed by the <lb/>
            vulgar, that no man is vicious who is not also foolish, a fool, <lb/>
            assuredly, will never become an orator.</p>
          <p>It is to be further considered that the mind cannot be in a <lb/>
            condition for pursuing the most noble of studies, unless it be <lb/>
            entirely free from vice; not only because there can be no <lb/>
            communion of good and evil in the same breast, and to medi­ <lb/>
            tate at once on the best things and the worst is no more in <lb/>
            the power of the same mind than it is possible for the same <lb/>
            man to be at once virtuous and vicious; 5. but also, because a <lb/>
            mind intent on so arduous a study should be exempt from all <lb/>
            other cares, even such as are unconnected with vice ; for then, <lb/>
            and then only, when it is free and master of itself, and when <lb/>
            no other object harasses and distracts its attention, will it be <note type="footnote"> * See ii. 16, 16, seg­ </note> <pb n="393"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            able to keep in view the end to which it is devoted. 6. But <lb/>
            if an inordinate attention to an estate, a too anxious pursuit of <lb/>
            wealth, indulgence in the pleasures of the chace, and the <lb/>
            devotion of our days to public spectacles, rob our studies of <lb/>
            much of our time,* (for whatever time is given to one thing <lb/>
            is lost to another,) what effect must we suppose that ambition, <lb/>
            avarice, and envy will produce, whose excitements are so <lb/>
            violent as even to disturb our sleep and our dreams ? 7. No­ <lb/>
            thing indeed is so pre-occupied, so unsettled, so torn and lace­ <lb/>
            rated with such numerous and various passions, as a bad mind; <lb/>
            for when it intends evil, it is agitated with hope, care, and <lb/>
            anxiety, and when it has attained the object of its wickedness, <lb/>
            it is tormented with uneasiness, repentance, and the dread of <lb/>
            every kind of punishment. Among such disquietudes, what <lb/>
            place is there for study, or any rational pursuit ? No more <lb/>
            certainly than there is for corn in a field overrun with thorns <lb/>
            and brambles.</p>
          <p>8. To enable us to sustain the toil of study, is not tem­ <lb/>
            perance necessary ? What expectations are to be formed, <lb/>
            then, from him who is abandoned to licentiousness and luxury ? <lb/>
            Is not the love of praise one of the greatest incitements to the <lb/>
            pursuit of literature ? But can we suppose that the love of <lb/>
            praise is an object of regard with the unprincipled ? Who does <lb/>
            not know that a principal part of oratory consists in discoursing <lb/>
            on justice and virtue ? But will the unjust man and the vicious <lb/>
            treat of such subjects with the respect that is due to them?</p>
          <p>9. But though we should even concede a great part of the <lb/>
            question, and grant, what can by no means be the case, that <lb/>
            there is the same portion of ability, diligence, and attainments, <lb/>
            in the worst man as in the best, which of the two, even under <lb/>
            that supposition, will prove the better orator ? He, doubtless, <lb/>
            who is the better man. The same person, therefore, can never <lb/>
            be a bad man and a perfect orator, for that cannot be perfect <lb/>
            to which something else is superior.</p>
          <p>10. That I may not seem, however, like the writers of <lb/>
            Socratic dialogues, to frame answers to suit my own purpose, <lb/>
            let us admit that there exists a person so unmoved by the <lb/>
            force of truth, as boldly to maintain that a bad man, possessed <lb/>
            of the same portion of ability, application, and learning, as a <note type="footnote"> * Compare i. 12, 18. Spalding. </note> <pb n="394"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            good man, will be an equally good orator, and let us convince <lb/>
            even such a person of his folly.</p>
          <p>11. No man, certainly, will doubt, that it is the object of <lb/>
            all oratory, that what is stated to the judge may appear to <lb/>
            him to be true and just; and which of the two, let me ask, <lb/>
            will produce such a conviction with the greater ease, the good <lb/>
            man or the bad? 12. A good man, doubtless, will speak of <lb/>
            what is true and honest with greater frequency; but even if, <lb/>
            from being influenced by some call of duty, he endeavours to <lb/>
            support what is fallacious, (a case which, as I shall show, may <lb/>
            sometimes occur,) he must still be heard with greater credit <lb/>
            than a bad man. 13. But with bad men, on the other hand, <lb/>
            dissimulation sometimes fails, as well through their contempt for <lb/>
            the opinion of mankind, as through their ignorance of what is <lb/>
            right; hence they assert without modesty, and maintain their <lb/>
            assertions without shame; and, in attempting what evidently <lb/>
            cannot be accomplished, there appears in them a repulsive <lb/>
            obstinacy and useless perseverance; for bad men, as well in <lb/>
            their pleadings as in their lives, entertain dishonest expecta­ <lb/>
            tions ; and it often happens, that even when they speak the <lb/>
            truth, belief is not accorded them, and the employment of <lb/>
            advocates of such a character is regarded as a proof of the <lb/>
            badness of a cause.</p>
          <p>14. I must, however, notice those objections to my opinion, <lb/>
            which appear to be clamoured forth, as it were, by the general <lb/>
            consent of the multitude. Was not then Demosthenes, they <lb/>
            ask, a great orator ? yet we have heard that he was not a good <lb/>
            man. Was not Cicero a great orator? yet many have thrown <lb/>
            censure upon his character. To such questions how shall I <lb/>
            answer? Great displeasure is likely to be shown at any <lb/>
            reply whatever; and the ears of my audience require first to <lb/>
            be propitiated. 15. The character of Demosthenes, let me say, <lb/>
            does not appear to me deserving of such severe reprehension, <lb/>
            that I should believe all the calumnies that are heaped upon <lb/>
            him by his enemies, especially when I read his excellent plans <lb/>
            for the benefit of his country and the honourable termination <lb/>
            of his life. 16. Nor do I see that the feeling of an upright <lb/>
            citizen was, in any respect, wanting to Cicero. As proofs of <lb/>
            his integrity, may be mentioned his consulship, in which he <lb/>
            conducted himself with so much honour, his honourable ad­ <lb/>
            ministration of his province; his refusal to be one of the <pb n="395"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            twenty commissioners ;* and, during the civil wars, which fell <lb/>
            with great severity on his times, his uprightness of mind, <lb/>
            which was never swayed, either by hope or by fear, from <lb/>
            adhering to the better party, or the supporters of the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth. 17. He is thought by some to have been de­ <lb/>
            ficient in courage, but he has given an excellent reply to this <lb/>
            charge, when he says, that he was timid, not in encountering <lb/>
            dangers, but in taking precautions against them ;† an assertion <lb/>
            of which he proved the truth at his death, to which he sub­ <lb/>
            mitted with the noblest fortitude. 18. But even should the <lb/>
            height of virtue have been wanting to these eminent men, I shall <lb/>
            reply to those who ask me whether they were orators, as the <lb/>
            Stoics reply when they are asked whether Zeno, Cleanthes, <lb/>
            and Chrysippus, were wise men; they say that they were great <lb/>
            and deserving of veneration, but that they did not attain the <lb/>
            highest excellence of which human nature is susceptible.</p>
          <p>19. Pythagoras desired to be called, not wise, like those who <lb/>
            preceded him, but a lover of wisdom. I, however, in speaking <lb/>
            of Cicero, have often said, according to the common mode of <lb/>
            speech, and shall continue to say, that he was a perfect orator, <lb/>
            as we term our friends, in ordinary discourse, good and pru. <lb/>
            dent men, though such epithets can be justly given only to the <lb/>
            perfectly wise. 20. But when I have to speak precisely, and in <lb/>
            conformity with the exactness of truth, I shall express myself <lb/>
            as longing to see such an orator as he himself also longed to <lb/>
            see ;‡ for though I acknowledge that Cicero stood at the head <lb/>
            of eloquence, and that I can scarcely find a passage in his <lb/>
            speeches to which anything can be added, however many I <lb/>
            might find which I may imagine that he would have pruned, <lb/>
            (for the learned have in general been of opinion that he had <lb/>
            numerous excellences and some faults, and he himself says that <lb/>
            he had cut off most of his juvenile exuberance, §) yet, since he <lb/>
            did not claim to himself, though he had no mean opinion of <note type="footnote"> * For dividing the lands of Campania. See Veil. Pat. ii. 45; Dion <lb/>

            his merits, the praise of perfection, and since he might cer­ <lb/>
            tainly have spoken better if a longer life had been granted him, <lb/>
            and a more tranquil season for composition, I may not unrea­ <lb/>
            sonably believe that the summit of excellence was not-attained by <lb/>
            him, to which, notwithstanding, no man made nearer approaches. <lb/>
            21. If I had thought otherwise, I might have maintained my <lb/>
            opinion with still greater determination and freedom. Did <lb/>
            Marcus Antonius declare that he had seen no man truly <lb/>
            eloquent* though to be eloquent is much less than to be a <lb/>
            perfect orator; does Cicero himself say that he is still seeking <lb/>
            Jor an orator, and merely conceives and imagines one ; and <lb/>
            shall I fear to say that in that portion of eternity which is yet <lb/>
            to come something may arise still more excellent than what <lb/>
            has yet been seen ? 22. I take no advantage of the opinion of <lb/>
            those who refuse to allow great merit to Cicero and Demosthenes <lb/>
            even in eloquence; though Demosthenes, indeed, does not <lb/>
            appear sufficiently near perfection even to Cicero himself, who <lb/>
            says that he sometimes nods; nor does Cicero appear so to <lb/>
            Brutus and Calvus, ‡ who certainly find fault with his language <lb/>
            even in addressing himself, or to either of the Asinii, § who <lb/>
            attack the blemishes in his style with virulence in various <lb/>
            places.</p>
          <p>23. Let us grant, however, what nature herself by no means <lb/>
            brings to pass, that a bad man has been found endowed with <lb/>
            consummate eloquence, I should nevertheless refuse to concede <lb/>
            to him the name of orator, as I should not allow the merit of <lb/>
            fortitude to all who have been active in the field, because <lb/>
            fortitude cannot be conceived as unaccompanied with virtue. <lb/>
            24. Has not he who is employed to defend causes need of <lb/>
            integrity which covetousness cannot pervert, or partiality <note type="footnote"> * Cic. Orate c. 5; De Orat. iii. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> t Dormitare interim dicit.] See x. 1, 24. Is the passage of Cicero lost <lb/>

            corrupt, or terror abash, and shall we honour the traitor, the <lb/>
            renegade, the prevaricator, with the sacred name of orator? <lb/>
            And if that quality, which is commonly called goodness, is found <lb/>
            even in moderate pleaders, why should not that great orator, <lb/>
            who has not yet appeared, but who may hereafter appear, be <lb/>
            as consummate in goodness as in eloquence? 25. It is not a <lb/>
            plodder in the forum, or a mercenary pleader, or, to use no <lb/>
            stronger term,* a not unprofitable advocate, (such as he whom <lb/>
            they generally term a causidicus,) that I desire to form, but a <lb/>
            man who, being possessed of the highest natural genius, stores <lb/>
            his mind thoroughly with the most valuable kinds of knowledge; <lb/>
            a man sent by the gods to do honour to the world, and such as <lb/>
            no preceding age has known; a man in every way eminent and <lb/>
            excellent, a thinker of the best thoughts and a speaker of the <lb/>
            best language. 26. For such a man's ability how small a <lb/>
            scope will there be in the defence of innocence or the repres­ <lb/>
            sion of guilt in the forum, or in supporting truth against false­ <lb/>
            hood in litigations about money ? He will appear great, indeed, <lb/>
            even in such inferior employments, but his powers will shine <lb/>
            with the highest lustre on greater occasions, when the counsels <lb/>
            of the senate are to be directed, and the people to be guided <lb/>
            from error into rectitude. 27. Is it not such an orator that <lb/>
            Virgil appears to have imagined, representing him as a calmer <lb/>
            of the populace in a sedition, when they were hurling firebrands <lb/>
            and stones ? <lb/>
            Tum pietate gravem et meritis si forte virum quem <lb/>
            Conspexere, silent, arrectisque auribm adatant, t <lb/>
            Then if perchance a sage they see, rever'd <lb/>
            For piety and worth, they hush their noise, <lb/>
            And stand with ears attentive. <lb/>
            We see that he first makes him a good man, and then adds <lb/>
            that he is skilled in speaking: <lb/>

            He rules their passions and their breasts controls.</p>
          <p>28. Would not the orator whom I am trying to form, too, if <lb/>
            he were in the field of battle, and his soldiers required to be <lb/>
            encouraged to engage, draw the materials for an exhortation <note type="footnote"> * Ut asperioribus verbis parcamus.] He forbears from using the word <lb/>

            from the most profound precepts of philosophy ? for how could <lb/>
            all the terrors of toil, pain, and even death, be banished from <lb/>
            their breasts, unless vivid feelings of piety, fortitude, and <lb/>
            honour, be substituted in their place ? 29. He, doubtless, will <lb/>
            best implant such feelings in the breasts of others who has <lb/>
            first implanted them in his own ; for simulation, however <lb/>
            guarded it be, always betrays itself, nor was there ever such <lb/>
            power of eloquence in any man that he would not falter and <lb/>
            hesitate whenever his words were at variance with his thoughts. <lb/>
            30. But a bad man must of necessity utter words at variance with <lb/>
            his thoughts; while to good men, on the contrary, a virtuous <lb/>
            sincerity of language will never be wanting, nor (for good men <lb/>
            will also be wise) a power of producing the most excellent <lb/>
            thoughts, which, though they may be destitute of showy charms, <lb/>
            will be sufficiently adorned by their own natural qualities, <lb/>
            since whatever is said with honest feeling will also be said with <lb/>
            eloquence.</p>
          <p>31. Let youth, therefore, or rather let all of us, of every <lb/>
            age, (for no time is too late for resolving on what is right,) <lb/>
            direct our whole faculties, and our whole exertions, to this <lb/>
            object; * and perhaps to some it may be granted to attain it; <lb/>
            for if nature does not interdict a man from being good, or <lb/>
            from being eloquent, why should not some one among man­ <lb/>
            kind be able to attain eminence in both goodness and eloquence ? <lb/>
            And why should not each hope that he himself may be the <lb/>
            fortunate aspirant ? 32. If our powers of mind are insufficient <lb/>
            to reach the summit, yet in proportion to the advances that <lb/>
            we make towards it will be our improvement in both eloquence <lb/>
            and virtue. At least, let the notion be wholly banished from <lb/>
            our thoughts, that perfect eloquence, the noblest of human <lb/>
            attainments, can be united with a vicious character of mind. <lb/>
            Talent in speaking, if it falls to the lot of the vicious, must be <lb/>
            regarded as being itself a vice, since it makes those more <lb/>
            mischievous with whom it allies itself.</p>
          <p>33. But I fancy that I hear some (for there will never be <lb/>
            wanting men who would rather be eloquent than good) saying <lb/>
            " Why then is there so much art devoted to eloquence ? Why <lb/>
            nave you given precepts on rhetorical colouring, and the <lb/>
            defence of difficult causes, and some even on the acknow­ <note type="footnote"> * The attainment of virtue and eloquence. </note> <pb n="399"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/><lb/>
            ledgment of guilt, * unless, at times, the force and ingenuity <lb/>
            of eloquence overpowers even truth itself? for a good man <lb/>
            advocates only good causes, and truth itself supports them <lb/>
            sufficiently without the aid of learning." 34. These objectors <lb/>
            I shall endeavour to satisfy, by answering them, first, concern­ <lb/>
            ing my own work, and, secondly, concerning the duty of a good <lb/>
            man, if occasion ever calls him to the defence of the guilty.</p>
          <p>To consider how we may speak in defence of what is false, <lb/>
            or even what is unjust, is not without its use, if for no other <lb/>
            reason than that we may expose and refute fallacious arguments <lb/>
            with the greater ease; as that physician will apply remedies <lb/>
            with the greater effect to whom that which is hurtful is known. <lb/>
            35. The Academicians, when they have disputed on both <lb/>
            sides of a point of morality, will not live according to either <lb/>
            side at hazard; nor was the well known Carneades,† who is <lb/>
            said to have argued at Rome, in the hearing of Cato the <lb/>
            Censor, with no less force against the observance of justice than <lb/>
            he had argued the day before in favour of it, an unjust man. <lb/>
            But vice, which is opposed to virtue, shows more clearly what <lb/>
            virtue is; justice becomes more manifest from the contem­ <lb/>
            plation of injustice; and many things are proved by their con­ <lb/>
            traries. The devices of his adversaries, accordingly, should <lb/>
            be as well known to the orator, as the stratagems of an enemy in <lb/>
            the field to a commander.</p>
          <p>36. Even that which appears, when it is first stated, of so <lb/>
            objectionable. a character, that a good man, in defending a <lb/>
            cause, may sometimes incline to withhold the truth from the <lb/>
            judge,‡ reason may find cause to justify. If any one feels <lb/>
            surprised that I advance this opinion, (though this is not <lb/>
            mine in particular, but that of those whom antiquity acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged as the greatest masters of wisdom,§) let him consider <lb/>
            that there are many things which are rendered honourable or <lb/>
            dishonourable, not by their own nature, but by the causes <lb/>
            which give rise to them. 87. For if to kill a man is often an <lb/>
            act of virtue, and to put to death one's children is sometimes a <note type="footnote"> * IV. 2, 68—75; xi. 1, 76. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is related more at length by Lactantius, Div. Inst. v. 13, 16. <lb/>

            noble sacrifice; * and if it is allowable to do things of a stil. <lb/>
            more repulsive nature when the good of our country demands <lb/>
            them, we must not consider merely what cause a good man <lb/>
            defends, but from what motive, and with what object he <lb/>
            defends it. 38. In the first place, every one must grant me, <lb/>
            what the most rigid of the Stoics do not deny, that a good <lb/>
            man may sometimes think proper to tell a lie,t and occa­ <lb/>
            sionally even in matters of small moment, as, when children <lb/>
            are sick, we make them believe many things with a view to pro­ <lb/>
            mote their health, and promise them many which we do not <lb/>
            intend to perform; 39. and much less,‡ is it forbidden to tell <lb/>
            a falsehood when an assassin is to be prevented from killing a <lb/>
            man, or an enemy to be deceived for the benefit of our <lb/>
            country; so that what is at one time reprehensible in a slave <lb/>
            is at another laudable even in the wisest of men. If this be <lb/>
            admitted, I see that many causes may occur for which an <lb/>
            orator may justly undertake a case of such a nature, as, in the <lb/>
            absence of any honourable motive, he would not undertake. <lb/>
            40. Nor do I say this only with reference to a father, a brother, <lb/>
            or a friend, who may be in danger, (because even in such a <lb/>
            case § I would allow only what is strictly lawful), though <lb/>
            there is then sufficient ground for hesitation, when the <lb/>
            image of justice presents itself on one side, and that of natural <lb/>
            affection on the other; but let us set the point beyond all <note type="footnote"> * The examples of Ahala, Scipio Nasica, Brutus, and Manlius, will <lb/>

            sense is very doubtful. Buttmann, not finding it settled by Spalding, <lb/>
            and not being able to satisfy himself about it, applied to Boeckh, who <lb/>
            said that the words nec hoc dico pro patre, fratre, amico penclitantibu, <lb/>
            must all be taken together, and quia severiores sequi placet leges <lb/>
            separately and subsequently. Of this explanation Buttmann approves. <lb/>
            I subjoin Boeckh's Latin: " Neque hoc ita dico, quasi pro patre, <lb/>
            fratre, amico periclitantibus reveraque noxiis contra veritatem et <lb/>
            justitiam dicere liceat; severiorem enim in talibus legem sequi mihi <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH I.]"/> <lb/>
            doubt. Let us suppose that a man has attempted the life <lb/>
            of a tyrant, and is brought to trial for the deed; will such <lb/>
            an orator as is described by us, be unwilling that his life <lb/>
            should be saved ? and, if he undertake to defend him, will he <lb/>
            not support his cause before the judge by the same kind of mis­ <lb/>
            representation as he who advocates a bad cause? 41. Or <lb/>
            what if a judge would condemn a man for something that was <lb/>
            done with justice, unless we convince him that it was not <lb/>
            done: would not an orator, by producing such conviction, save <lb/>
            the life of a fellow-citizen, when he is not only innocent but <lb/>
            deserving of praise ? Or what if we know that certain poli­ <lb/>
            tical measures are in contemplation, which, though just in <lb/>
            themselves, are rendered detrimental to the commonwealth <lb/>
            by the state of the times, shall we not adopt artifices of elo­ <lb/>
            quence to set them aside, artifices which, though well- <lb/>
            intended, are nevertheless similar to those of an immoral <lb/>
            character ?</p>
          <p>42. No man, again, will doubt, that if guilty persons can <lb/>
            by any means be turned to a right course of life, and it is <lb/>
            allowed that they sometimes may, it will be more for the <lb/>
            advantage of the state that their lives should be spared than <lb/>
            that they should be put to death. If, then, it appear certain <lb/>
            to an orator, that a person against whom true accusations are <lb/>
            brought, will, if acquitted, become a. good member of society, <lb/>
            will he not exert himself that he may be acquitted ?</p>
          <p>43. Suppose, again, that a man who is an excellent general, <lb/>
            and without whose aid his country would be unable to over­ <lb/>
            come her enemies, is accused of a crime of which he is <lb/>
            evidently guilty, will not the public good call upon an orator <lb/>
            to plead his cause? It is certain that Fabricius made Cor­ <lb/>
            nelius Rufinus,* who was in other respects a bad citizen, and <lb/>
            his personal enemy, consul, by voting for him when a war <lb/>
            threatened the state, because he knew him to be a good <lb/>
            general; and when some expressed their surprise at what he <lb/>
            had done, he replied, that he had rather be robbed by a citizen <lb/>
            than sold for a slave by the enemy. Had Fabricius, therefore, <lb/>
            been an orator, would he not have pleaded for Rufinus even <lb/>
            though he had been manifestly guilty of robbing his country ?</p>
          <p>44. Many similar cases might be supposed, but even any <lb/>
            one of them is sufficient; for I do not insinuate that the <note type="footnote"> * Cicero do Orat. ii. 66; AuL Gell iv. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> D D </note> <pb n="402"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            orator whom I would form should often undertake such <lb/>
            causes; I only wish to show that if such a motive as I have <lb/>
            mentioned should induce him to do so, the definition of an <lb/>
            orator, that he is a good man skilled in speaking, would still be <lb/>
            true.</p>
          <p>45. It is necessary, too, for the master to teach, and for the <lb/>
            pupil to learn, how difficult cases are to be treated in attempt­ <lb/>
            ing to establish them; for very often even the best causes <lb/>
            resemble bad ones, and an innocent person under accusation <lb/>
            may be urged by many probabilities against him; and he <lb/>
            must then be defended by the same process of pleading as if <lb/>
            he were guilty. There are also innumerable particulars com­ <lb/>
            mon alike to good and bad causes; as oral and written <lb/>
            evidence, and suspicions and prejudices to be overcome. But <lb/>
            what is probable is established or refuted by the same methods <lb/>
            as what is true. The speech of the orator, therefore, will be <lb/>
            modelled as circumstances shall require, uprightness of in­ <lb/>
            tention being always maintained.</p>

          <p>An orator must study to maintain a high moral character, § 1, a. <lb/>

            attach himself to any Met in particular, but may e content with <lb/>
            learning what is good wherever it is to be found, 24—31.</p>
          <p>1. SINCE an orator, then, is a good man, and a good man <lb/>
            cannot be conceived to exist without virtuous inclinations, and <lb/>
            virtue, though it receives certain impulses from nature, re­ <lb/>
            quires notwithstanding to be brought to maturity by instruction, <lb/>
            the orator must above all things study morality, and must <lb/>
            obtain a thorough knowledge of all that is just and honourable, <lb/>
            without which no one can either be a good man or an able <lb/>
            speaker. 2. Unless, indeed, we feel inclined to adopt the <lb/>
            opinion of those who think that the moral character is formed <lb/>
            by nature, and is not at all influenced by discipline; and who <pb n="403"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH II.]"/><lb/>
            forsooth, acknowledge that manual operations, and even the <lb/>
            meanest of them, cannot be acquired without the aid of <lb/>
            teachers, but say that we possess virtue, (than which nothing <lb/>
            has been given to man that raises him nearer to the immortal <lb/>
            gods,) unsought and without labour, simply because we are <lb/>
            born what we are. 3. But will that man be temperate, who <lb/>
            does not know even what temperance is? Or will that <lb/>
            man be possessed of fortitude, who has used no means to <lb/>
            free his mind from the terrors of pain, death, and superstition ? <lb/>
            Or will that man be just, who has entered into no examina­ <lb/>
            tion of what is equitable and good, and who has never ascer­ <lb/>
            tained from any dissertation of the least learning, the prin­ <lb/>
            ciples either of the laws which are by nature prescribed to all <lb/>
            men, or of those which are instituted among particular people <lb/>
            and nations? Of how little consequence do they think all <lb/>
            this, to whom it appears so easy! 4. But I shall say no <lb/>
            more on this point, on which I think that no man, who has <lb/>
            tasted of learning, as they say, with but the slightest touch oj <lb/>
            his lips, will entertain the least doubt.</p>
          <p>I pass on to my second proposition,. that no man will ever <lb/>
            be thoroughly accomplished in eloquence, who has not gained <lb/>
            a deep insight into the impulses of human nature, and formed <lb/>
            his moral character on the precepts of others and on his own <lb/>
            reflection. 6. It is not without reason that Lucius Crassus, in <lb/>
            the third book De Oratore,† asserts that everything that can <lb/>
            come under discussion respecting equity, justice, truth, good­ <lb/>
            ness, and whatever is of an opposite nature, are the proper <lb/>
            concerns of the orator; and that the philosophers, when they <lb/>
            inculcate those virtues with the force of eloquence, use the <lb/>
            arms of the orator and not their own. Yet he admits that <lb/>
            the knowledge of these subjects must now be sought from <lb/>
            philosophy, because philosophy, apparently, seems to him to <lb/>
            be more fully in possession of them. 6. Hence also it is <lb/>
            that Cicero remarks, in many passages both of his books and <lb/>
            of his letters, ‡ that the power of eloquence is to be derived <note type="footnote"> * This must be understood as contained in the latter half of sect. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> t C. 19, 27, 31. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ It would be tedious to refer to passages; and I wish that I could <lb/>
            point out a greater number in the letters than I can. But I find one, <lb/>
            which I may notice here, in the epistle to Cato (Ad. Fam. xiv. 4) <lb/>
            where he says that philosophy was introduced both by Cato and him-</note> <note type="footnote"> D D 2 </note> <pb n="404"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            from the deepest sources of wisdom, and that accordingly the <lb/>
            same persons were for a considerable time the teachers at <lb/>
            once of eloquence and of morality.</p>
          <p>This exhortation of mine, however, is not designed to inti­ <lb/>
            mate that I should wish the orator to be a philosopher, since <lb/>
            no other mode of life has withdrawn itself further from the <lb/>
            duties of civil society, and all that concerns the orator. 7. <lb/>
            Which of the philosophers, indeed, ever frequented courts of <lb/>
            justice, or distinguished himself in public assemblies? Which <lb/>
            of them ever engaged even in the management of political <lb/>
            affairs, on which most of them have given such earnest pre. <lb/>
            cepts?* But I should desire the orator, whom I am trying <lb/>
            to form, to be a kind of Roman wise man,† who may prove <lb/>
            himself a true statesman, not by discussions in retirement, but <lb/>
            by personal experience and exertions in public life. 8. But <lb/>
            because the pursuits of philosophy have been deserted by those <lb/>
            who have devoted their minds to eloquence, and because they <lb/>
            no longer display themselves in their proper field of action <lb/>
            and in the open light of the foium, but have retreated, at first <lb/>
            into the porticoes and gymnasia, and since into the assemblies <lb/>
            of the schools, ‡ the orator must seek that which is necessary <lb/>
            for him, and which is not taught by the masters of eloquence, <lb/>
            among those with whom it has remained, by perusing with <lb/>
            the most diligent application the authors that give instruction <lb/>
            in virtue, that his life may be in conformity with a thorough <lb/>
            knowledge of divine and human things; and how much more <lb/>
            important and noble would these things appear, if those were <lb/>
            to teach them who could discourse on them with the highest <lb/>
            eloquence? 9. Would that there may some day come a time, <lb/>
            when some orator, perfect as we wish him to be, may vindicate <lb/>
            to himself the study of philosophy, (which has been rendered <lb/>
            odious as well by the arrogant assumptions, as by the vices, of <lb/>
            those who have disgraced its excellent nature,) and, by a re­ <note type="footnote"> self to the forum. See de Orat. iiL 15; TuscuL i. 3; Orat. c. 21. <lb/>

            conquest as it were, annex it again to the domain of <lb/>
            eloquence!</p>
          <p>10. As philosophy is divided into three parts, physics, ethics, <lb/>
            and dialectics* by which of the three is it not allied with the <lb/>
            business of the orator ?</p>
          <p>To consider them in the order contrary to that in which J <lb/>
            have named them, no man can surely doubt whether the last, <lb/>
            which is wholly employed about words, concerns the orator, if <lb/>
            it be his business to know the exact significations of terms, to <lb/>
            clear ambiguities, to disentangle perplexities, to distinguish <lb/>
            falsehood from truth, and to establish or refute what he may <lb/>
            desire; 11. though, indeed, we shall not have to use these arts <lb/>
            with such exactness and preciseness in pleadings in the forum, <lb/>
            as is observed in the disputations of the schools ; because the <lb/>
            orator must not only instruct his audience, but must move <lb/>
            and delight them, and to effect that object there is need of <lb/>
            energy, animation, and grace; the difference between the <lb/>
            orator and the dialectician being as great as that in the <lb/>
            courses of rivers of an opposite character; for the force of <lb/>
            streams that flow between high banks, and with a full flood, <lb/>
            is far greater than that of shallow brooks, with water struggling <lb/>
            against the obstructions of pebbles. 12. And as the teachers <lb/>
            of wrestling do not instruct their pupils in all the attitudes,† <lb/>
            as they call them, that they may use all that they have learned <lb/>
            in an actual struggle with an adversary, (for more may be <lb/>
            effected by weight, and firmness, and ardour,) but that they <lb/>
            may have a large number of artifices, of which they may adopt <lb/>
            one or other as occasion may require; 13. so the art of logic, <lb/>
            or of disputation, if we had rather give it that name, though it <lb/>
            is often of the greatest use in definitions and deductions, in <lb/>
            marking differences and in explaining ambiguities, in distin­ <lb/>
            guishing and dividing, in perplexing and entangling, yet, if it <lb/>
            assumes to itself the whole conduct of a cause in the forum, <lb/>
            will prove but a hindrance to what is better than itself, and <lb/>
            will waste, by its very subtilty, the strength that is divided to <lb/>
            suit its niceties. 14. We may accordingly see that some <lb/>
            people, extremely acute in disputations, are, when they are <note type="footnote"> * See Sidon. Apollin. carm. xv. Cicero Acad. Quæst. i. 5. Almelo­ <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            drawn beyond the sphere of cavilling, no more able to support <lb/>
            any important exertion of eloquence, than certain little animals, <lb/>
            which are active enough to escape being caught in a small <lb/>
            space, can prevent themselves from being seized in an open <lb/>
            field.</p>
          <p>15. As to that part of philosophy which is called moral, <lb/>
            the study of it is certainly wholly suited to the orator; for in <lb/>
            such a variety of causes, (as I have remarked in the preceding <lb/>
            books,) in which some points are ascertained by conjecture,. <lb/>
            others are settled by definition,! others are set aside by the <lb/>
            law,t others fall under the state of exception,§ others are <lb/>
            determined by syllogism,|| others depend on a comparison of <lb/>
            different laws,|| others on explanations of ambiguous terms,.. <lb/>
            scarcely a single cause can occur in some part of which con­ <lb/>
            siderations of equity and morality are not concerned. Who <lb/>
            does not know, also, that there are numbers of cases which <lb/>
            depend entirely on the estimation of the quality of an act, a <lb/>
            question purely moral ? 16. In deliberative oratory, also, <lb/>
            what means would there be of exhortation unconnected with <lb/>
            questions of honesty ? As to the third kind of oratory, too, <lb/>
            which consists in the duties of praising and censuring, what <lb/>
            shall be said of it? It is assuredly engaged about con­ <lb/>
            siderations of right and wrong. 17. Will not an orator have <lb/>
            to speak much of justice, fortitude, abstinence, temperance, <lb/>
            piety? Yet the good man, who has a knowledge of these <lb/>
            virtues, not by sound and name only, not as heard merely by <lb/>
            the ear to be repeated by the tongue, but who has embraced <lb/>
            them in his heart, and thinks in conformity with them, will <lb/>
            have no difficulty in conceiving proper notions about them, <lb/>
            and will express sincerely what he thinks.</p>
          <p>18. Again, as every general question is more comprehen­ <lb/>
            sive than a particular one, as a part is contained in the whole <lb/>
            while the whole is not included in a part, no one will doubt <lb/>
            that general questions are intimately connected with that <lb/>
            kind of studies of which we are speaking. 19. As there are <lb/>
            many points also which require to be settled by appropriate <lb/>
            and brief definitions, whence one state of causes is called the <note type="footnote"> * Status conjecturalis. iii. 6, 31, 45. </note><note type="footnote">f Status definitivus. ib. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Statu legalis. iii. 6, 45. </note><note type="footnote"> § Status translativus, or " state of exception." iii. 6, 23. </note><note type="footnote"> || See iii. 6, 15. </note><note type="footnote">¶ B. vii. c. 7. </note><note type="footnote">** B. vii. a. 9. </note> <pb n="407"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH II.]"/><lb/>
            definitive,* ought not the orator to be prepared for giving such <lb/>
            definitions by those who have given most attention to that <lb/>
            department of study? Does not every question of equity <lb/>
            depend either on an exact determination of the sense of words, <lb/>
            or on the consideration of what is right, or on conjecture <lb/>
            respecting the intention of the author of something written ? <lb/>
            and of all such questions part will rest on logical and part on <lb/>
            ethical science. SO. All oratory, therefore, naturally partakes of <lb/>
            these two departments of philosophy; I mean all oratory that <lb/>
            truly deserves the name; for mere loquacity, which is igno­ <lb/>
            rant of all such learning, must necessarily go astray, as having <lb/>
            either no guides, or guides that are deceitful.</p>
          <p>But the department of natural philosophy, besides that <lb/>
            it affords so much wider a field for exercise in speaking than <lb/>
            other subjects, inasmuch as we must treat of divine in <lb/>
            a more elevated style than of human things, embraces also <lb/>
            the whole of moral science, without which, as I have just <lb/>
            shown, † there can be no real oratory. 21. For if the world is <lb/>
            governed by a providence, the state ought surely to be ruled <lb/>
            by the superintendence of good men. If our souls are of <lb/>
            divine origin, we ought to devote ourselves to virtue, and <lb/>
            not to be slaves to a body of terrestrial nature. Will not <lb/>
            the orator frequently have to treat of such subjects as these ? <lb/>
            Will he not have to speak of auguries, oracles, and of every­ <lb/>
            thing pertaining to religion, on which the most important <lb/>
            deliberations in the senate often depend, at least if he is to <lb/>
            be, as I think that he ought to be, a well qualified statesman? <lb/>
            What sort of eloquence can be imagined, indeed, to proceed <lb/>
            from a man who is ignorant of the noblest subjects of human <lb/>
            contemplation ?</p>
          <p>22. If what I say were not evidently supported by reason, <lb/>
            we might nevertheless believe it on the authority of examples; <lb/>
            for it is well known that Pericles, of whose eloquence, though <lb/>
            no visible proofs of it have come down to us, not only histo­ <lb/>
            rians, but the old comic writers, a class of men not at all <lb/>
            inclined to flattery, say that the power was scarcely credible, <lb/>
            was a hearer of Anaxagoras, the great natural philosopher; <lb/>
            and that Demosthenes, the prince of all the orators of Greece, <lb/>
            attended the lectures of Plato. 23. As to Cicero, be fre­ <note type="footnote"> * III. 6, <unclear>31</unclear>. </note><note type="footnote">+ Sect. 15. </note> <pb n="408"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            quently declares - that he owed less to the schools of the <lb/>
            rhetoricians than to the gardens of the Academy. Nor indeed <lb/>
            would so wonderful a fertility of mind have displayed itself in <lb/>
            him, if he had circumscribed his genius by the limits of the <lb/>
            forum, and not allowed it to range through all the domains of <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>But from these reflections arises another question, what sort <lb/>
            of philosophers will contribute most to the improvement of <lb/>
            eloquence; though it is a question which will concern hut a <lb/>
            small number of sects. 24. Epicurus, in the first place, <lb/>
            excludes us from all communication with him, as he directs <lb/>
            his disciples to flee from all learning with the utmost speed at <lb/>
            which they can sail.t Nor does Aristippus, who makes the <lb/>
            chief happiness to consist in the pleasures of the body, encou­ <lb/>
            rage us to support the fatigues of study. As to Pyrrho, what <lb/>
            concern can he have with our labour, he who is not certain <lb/>
            whether there are judges to whom he speaks, or a defendant <lb/>
            for whom he pleads, or a senate in which his opinion is to be <lb/>
            given ? 25. Some think the Academy most serviceable to elo­ <lb/>
            quence, as its practice of disputing on both sides of a question <lb/>
            is closely allied to the exercises preparatory to pleading in the <lb/>
            forum; and they add as a proof of their opinion that that <lb/>
            sect has produced men extremely eminent in eloquence.‡ <lb/>
            The Peripatetics also boast that they have a strong bearing <lb/>
            upon oratory; § as the practice of speaking on general ques­ <lb/>
            tions for the sake of exercise had its origin chiefly among <lb/>
            them. The Stoics, though they must allow that copiousness <lb/>
            and splendour of eloquence have been wanting in most of <lb/>
            their eminent men,|| yet assert that no philosophers can either <lb/>
            support proofs with greater force, or draw conclusions with <lb/>
            greater subtility. 26. But this is a notion among themselves, <lb/>
            who, as if bound by an oath, or influenced by some supersti­ <note type="footnote"> * The passage in the Orator, c. 3, has readily occurred to the com­ <lb/>

            tious obligation, think it criminal to depart from a persuasion <lb/>
            which they have once embraced.</p>
          <p>27. But an orator has no need to bind himself to the laws <lb/>
            of any particular sect; for the office to which he devotes him <lb/>
            self, and for which he is as it were a candidate, is of a loftier <lb/>
            and better nature, since he is to be distinguished as well <lb/>
            by excellence of moral conduct as by merit in eloquence. He <lb/>
            will accordingly select the most eloquent orators for imitation <lb/>
            in oratory, and for forming his moral character will fix upon <lb/>
            the most honourable precepts and the most direct road to <lb/>
            virtue. 28. He will indeed exercise himself on all subjects, <lb/>
            but he will attach himself most to those of the highest and <lb/>
            noblest nature; for what more fertile subjects can be found, <lb/>
            indeed, for grave and copious eloquence, than dissertations on <lb/>
            virtue, on government, on providence, on the origin of the <lb/>
            human mind, and on friendship? These are the topics by <lb/>
            which the mind and the language are alike elevated; what is <lb/>
            really good; what allays fear, restrains cupidity, frees us from <lb/>
            the prejudices of the vulgar, and raises the mind towards the <lb/>
            heaven from which it sprung..</p>
          <p>29. Nor will it be proper to understand those matters only <lb/>
            which are comprehended in the sciences of which I have been <lb/>
            speaking, but still more to know, and to bear continually in <lb/>
            mind, the noble deeds and sayings which are recorded of the <lb/>
            great men of antiquity, and which certainly are nowhere <lb/>
            found in greater number or excellence than in the annals of <lb/>
            our own commonwealth. 30. Will men of any other nation <lb/>
            give better lessons of fortitude, justice, honour, temperance, <lb/>
            frugality, contempt of pain and death, than a Fabricius, a <lb/>
            Curius, a Regulus, a Decius, a Mucius, and others without <lb/>
            number? for highly as the Greeks abound in precepts, the <lb/>
            Romans, what is of far more importance, abound quite as <lb/>
            much as in examples; 31. and that man will feel himself in <lb/>

            but the just sequel to a life of virtue, and the completion of a <lb/>
            career of merit. From this source let the orator whom I would <lb/>
            form derive strong encouragements to the observance of justice, <lb/>
            and let him show a sense of liberty drawn from hence in his <lb/>
            pleadings in the forum and in his addresses to the senate. <lb/>
            Nor will he indeed ever be a consummate orator who has not <lb/>

          <p>1. FOR such an orator, too, a knowledge of the civil law will <lb/>
            be necessary, and of the manners and religion of that state, <lb/>
            whatever it be, over which he shall endeavour to exert any <lb/>

            public or in private deliberations, who shall be ignorant of <lb/>
            things by which a state is principally held together ? or how <lb/>
            will he not falsely call himself a defender of causes, who has <lb/>
            to seek from another that which is of most importance to the <lb/>
            pleading of his causes, almost like those who recite the writings <lb/>
            of poets ?* 2. He will resemble in a manner a person carrying <lb/>
            messages; what he desires the judge to believe, he will have <lb/>
            to advance on the faith of another; and while he professes to <lb/>
            aid parties going to Jaw will stand in need of aid himself. <lb/>
            Though this may indeed sometimes be done with but little <lb/>
            inconvenience, when he shall bring before the judge what he <lb/>
            has taught himself and arranged at home, and which he has <lb/>
            learned by heart like other component parts of the cause, how <lb/>
            will he fare with regard to those questions which often arise <lb/>

            be not at hand to prompt him ? What if a person but imper­ <lb/>
            fectly acquainted with the subject suggests to him something <lb/>
            incorrect? For it is one of the greatest misfortunes of igno­ <lb/>
            rance to fancy that whoever pffers instruction is a man of <lb/>
            knowledge.</p>
          <p>4. I am not indeed forgetful of our practice, or unmindful of <lb/>
            those who sit as it were by the store-chests ‡ to furnish wea­ <lb/>
            pons for forensic combatants; nor am I unaware that the Greeks <lb/>
            also had the same custom, from whom the name of pragmatici, § <lb/>
            bestowed upon these gentlemen, was derived. But I am speak­ <lb/>
            ing of a genuine orator who is to bring to the support of his i <lb/>
            cause not only his voice, but everything that can possibly be <lb/>
            of service to it. 5. I would not think him therefore useless, if <lb/>
            he stand perchance for his hour, || or unskilful in establishing <lb/>
            evidence.¶ For who will prepare better than himself that <note type="footnote"> * Minores advocatos.] Quintilian here uses advocatus for him qui jus <lb/>
            suggerit, the attorney who suggested or explained points of law; or <lb/>
            rather, perhaps, ho alludes to the custom of having several advocates, <lb/>
            so that he who spoke might be called the major advocatus, and the <lb/>
            others, who assisted him with their advice, minores. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote"> t See b. vi. a. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> X Qui ad arculas sedent.] I suppose, says Buttmann, that Quintilian <lb/>
            alludes to chests for holding weapons used in the palæstræ or other <lb/>
            places of exercise. </note><note type="footnote"> § III. 6, 59. </note><note type="footnote"> || Si ad horam fortè constiterit.] In opposition to Burmann, who <lb/>
            understands these words as referring to the orator pleading according <lb/>

            that the allusion here is not to the pleading of the cause before the <lb/>
            judges, but to the preparation for pleading which an advocate might <lb/>
            wish to make..... But for such preparation an hour was allowed; <lb/>
            and even if an orator found it necessary to occupy the whole of that <lb/>
            time in preliminaries, Quintilian still thinks that he might be an able <lb/>
            man. Buttmann </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ In testationibus faciendis.] See v. 7, 83. To arrange and get ready <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            which he shall wish to appear in the cause when he shall plead <lb/>
            it ? Unless, indeed, we consider that an able general is one <lb/>
            who is active and brave in the field, and skilled in every­ <lb/>
            thing which an engagement requires, but who knows neither <lb/>
            how to levy troops, nor to muster or equip forces, nor to <lb/>
            secure provisions, nor to select a position for a camp; though <lb/>
            it is. surely of more importance to make preparations for <lb/>
            success in a fight, than to have the command in it. 6. But <lb/>
            an orator would very greatly resemble such a general, if he <lb/>
            should leave much that would promote his success to the <lb/>
            management of others, especially as this knowledge of the <lb/>
            civil law, which is of the utmost importance to him, is not so <lb/>
            difficult to be acquired as it may perhaps appear to those who <lb/>
            contemplate it from a distance. For every point of law, which <lb/>
            is certain, rests upon something written, or upon custom; what­ <lb/>
            ever is doubtful must be decided on grounds of equity. 7. What <lb/>
            is written, or dependent on the custom of a country, is attended <lb/>
            with no difficulty; for it is a matter of knowledge, not of in­ <lb/>
            vention, † and points which are explained by the comments of <lb/>
            lawyers, lie either in interpretations of words, or in distinctions <lb/>
            between right and wrong. To understand the sense of every <lb/>
            word in a law, is either common to all men of education, or <lb/>
            peculiar to the orator; equity is understood by every honest <lb/>
            man. 8. We, moreover, are supposing our orator to be a man <lb/>
            eminently good and sensible; a man who, when he has devoted <lb/>
            himself to the study of what is excellent in its nature, will not <lb/>
            be greatly troubled if a lawyer differ from him in opinion, since <lb/>
            lawyers themselves are allowed to hold various opinions on the. <lb/>
            same points.</p>
          <p>9. But if he shall desire to know what lawyers in general have <lb/>
            thought of any matter, he has only to apply himself to reading, <lb/>
            than which nothing in his course of study is less laborious; and <lb/>
            if many, from despair of acquiring the necessary qualifications <lb/>
            for speaking in public, have betaken themselves in consequence <lb/>
            to the study of law, ‡ how easy is it for the orator to attain <lb/>
            that which those acquire, who, according to their own confession, <note type="footnote">of the preparation allowed during the hour. This hour's preparation <lb/>
            was of course additional to whatever premeditation the advocate had <lb/>
            previously bestowed on the cause. </note><note type="footnote"> * The text has prius est enim; but the sense seems to require prius <lb/>

            cannot become orators! But Marcus Cato was both highly <lb/>
            distinguished for eloquence, and eminent for his knowledge of <lb/>
            law ; and the merit of eloquence was also allowed to Scævola <lb/>
            and Servius Sulpicius. 10. Cicero, too, was not only never at <lb/>
            a loss, in pleading, for a knowledge of law, but had even begun <lb/>
            to write on it,. whence it appears that an orator may not only <lb/>
            have time for learning law, but also for teaching it.</p>
          <p>11. But let no man suppose that the precepts which I have <lb/>
            offered respecting the necessity of attention to the moral cha­ <lb/>
            meter, and to the study of law, need not be regarded, because <lb/>
            we have known many who, from dislike of the labour which <lb/>
            they must undergo who aspire to eloquence, have resigned <lb/>
            themselves to employments better suited to their indolence. <lb/>
            Some of these have given themselves up to the white and <lb/>
            red ;f or have preferred to become formularii, or, as Cicero <lb/>
            terms them, leguleii, ‡ on pretence of choosing what was more <lb/>
            useful, when they in reality sought only what was easier. 12. <lb/>
            Others there have been, of equal indolence but greater arro­ <lb/>
            gance, who, having suddenly § settled their countenance with <lb/>
            affected gravity, and let their beards grow, have sat for a time, <lb/>
            as if they looked with contempt on the study of oratory, in the <lb/>
            schools of the philosophers, in order that, by assumed solemnity <lb/>
            in public, while they are. abandoned to licentiousness at <lb/>
            hornet they may assume authority to themselves by setting <lb/>
            others at nought. <note type="footnote"> * It appears from Aulus Gellius, i. 22, that Cicero wrote one book <lb/>

          <p>The mind of an orator must be stored with examples and precedents</p>
          <p>1. BUT an orator ought to be furnished, above all things, <lb/>
            with an ample store of examples, as well ancient as modem; <lb/>
            since he should not only be acquainted with matters which are <lb/>
            recorded in history, or transmitted from hand to hand as it <lb/>
            were by tradition, or are of daily occurrence, but should not <lb/>
            even be neglectful of the fictions of the more eminent poets ; <lb/>
            for those of the former kind have the authority of testimonies, <lb/>
            or even of precedents; and the latter sort are either supported by <lb/>
            the sanction of antiquity, or are supposed to have been invented <lb/>
            by great men to serve as precepts. 2. Let the orator, there­ <lb/>
            fore, know as many as possible of every kind ; for hence it is <lb/>
            that greater authority is attributed to old men, as they are thought <lb/>
            to have known and seen more than others ; a fact which Homer <lb/>
            frequently attests. But we must not wait till the last stage <lb/>
            of life to acquire authority; for study affords us such advantage, <lb/>
            that, as far as knowledge of events is concerned, we seem even <lb/>
            to have lived in past ages.</p>

          <p>Necessity of firmness and presence of mind to an orator, § 1—4. <lb/>
            Natural advantages to be cultivated, 5, 6.</p>
          <p>1. SUCH are the acquirements of which I had promised to <lb/>
            give an account.- They are instruments, not of the art, as <lb/>
            some have thought, but of the orator; they are the arms <lb/>
            which he ought to have at hand, and with a knowledge of <lb/>
            which he ought to be thoroughly prepared, united with a <lb/>
            ready store of words and figurative language, as well as with <lb/>
            power of imagination, skill in the disposition of materials, <lb/>
            strength of memory, and grace of delivery.</p>
          <p>2. But the most important of all qualities is steady pre­ <lb/>
            sence of mind, which fear cannot shake or clamour intimidate, <lb/>
            nor the authority of an audience restrain beyond the just <note type="footnote"> * See Preface, sect. 22; and Introd. to this book, sect. 4. </note> <pb n="415"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH V.]"/><lb/>
            portion of respect that is due to them ; for though faults of an <lb/>
            opposite nature, those of presumption, temerity, audacity, <lb/>
            and arrogance, are in the highest degree offensive, yet without <lb/>
            proper firmness, confidence, and courage, neither art, nor <lb/>
            study, nor knowledge would be of the least avail, any more <lb/>
            than weapons put into the hands of weakness and timidity. <lb/>
            It is not without unwillingness, indeed, that I observe (for <lb/>
            what I say may be misunderstood) that modesty itself, which, <lb/>
            though a fault, is an amiable one, and frequently the <lb/>
            parent of virtues, is to be numbered among qualities <lb/>
            detrimental to the orator, and has had such an effect on <lb/>
            many, that the merits of their genius and learning have <lb/>
            never been brought into light, but have wasted away <lb/>
            under the rust contracted in obscurity. 3. Should any young <lb/>
            student, however, not yet sufficiently experienced in dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishing the meaning of words, read this remark, let him <lb/>
            understand that it is not a reasonable degree of diffidence which <lb/>
            I blame, but an excess of modesty, which is a species of fear <lb/>
            that draws off the thoughts from what we ought to do, whence <lb/>
            proceeds confusion, repentance that we ever began, and sudden <lb/>
            silence; and who can hesitate to number among faults an <lb/>
            affection by the influence of which we become ashamed to do <lb/>
            what is right ? 4. Nor, on the other hand, should I be unwilling <lb/>
            that he who is going to speak should rise with some concern, <lb/>
            change colour, and show a sense of the hazard which he is en <lb/>
            countering; feelings which, if they do not arise within us, <lb/>
            should be assumed. But this should be the effect of concious <lb/>
            ness of the weight of our task, not of fear; and though we <lb/>
            should be moved, we should not sink down in helplessness. <lb/>
            The great remedy for bashfulness, however, is confidence in our <lb/>
            cause; and any countenance, however likely to be daunted, <lb/>
            will be kept steady by a consciousness of being in the right.</p>
          <p>5. But there are, as I observed before,- advantages from <lb/>
            nature, which may doubtless be improved by art; such as good <lb/>
            organs of speech and tone of voice, strength of body, and grace <lb/>
            of motion ; advantages which are often of such effect that they <lb/>
            gain the possessor of them reputation even for genius. Our <lb/>
            age has seen more fertile orators than Trachalus ;t but, when <lb/>
            he spoke, he seemed to be far above all his contemporaries <lb/>
            such was the loftiness of his stature, the fire of his eyes, the <note type="footnote"> * Preface, sect. 27. </note><note type="footnote">t X. 1, 119. </note> <pb n="416"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            authority of his look, and the grace of his actior.; while his <lb/>
            voice was, not indeed, as Cicero * desires, similar to that of <lb/>
            actors in tragedy, but superior to that of any tragic actor that <lb/>
            I ever heard. 6. I well remember that on one occasion, when <lb/>
            he was speaking in the Basilica Julia † before the first <lb/>
            tribunal, and the four companies of judges, as is usual, were <lb/>
            assembled,t while the whole place resounded with noise, he <lb/>
            was not only heard and understood, but was applauded from <lb/>
            all the four tribunals, to the great prejudice of those who were <lb/>
            speaking at the same time. But the possession of such a <lb/>
            voice is the very height of an orator's wishes, and a rare <lb/>
            happiness ; and whoever is without it, let it suffice for him to <lb/>
            be heard by those to whom he immediately addresses himself. <lb/>
            Such ought an orator to be; and such are the qualifications <lb/>
            which he ought to attain.</p>

          <p>At what age an orator should begin to plead in public.</p>
          <p>1. As to the age for beginning to plead in public, it must <lb/>
            doubtless be fixed according to the student's capacity. I <lb/>
            should name no particular year; for it is well known that <lb/>
            Demosthenes pleaded his cause against his guardians when he <lb/>
            was quite a boy; § Calvus, Cæsar, and Pollio || undertook <lb/>
            causes of the highest importance long before they were of age <lb/>
            for the quæstorship; ¶ it is said that some have pleaded in the <note type="footnote"> * De Orate i. 28. </note><note type="footnote"> t A large court or hall erected by Julius Cæsar in the forum. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ The centumviri litibus judicandis were anciently divided into two <lb/>
            hastæ, or companies, but subsequently into four tribunals. These four, <lb/>
            on the occasion to which Quintilian alludes, were assembled in one hall <lb/>
            Trachalus was speaking at the one called the first, but his voice was so <lb/>
            full and sonorous that he caught the attention of the people at the <lb/>
            other three, who neglected their own business to applaud him. </note><note type="footnote"> § See Adv. Mid. c. 23. He was then eighteen years of age. </note><note type="footnote"> || In the nineteenth year of his age Lucius Crassus pleaded against <lb/>

            twenty-second Asinius Pollio against Caius Cato, and Calvus was not <lb/>
            much older when he attacked Vatinius. Dialog. de Oratorib. c. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> ¶ Which could not be held before the age of twenty-five, or, as some </note> <pb n="417"/>

            toga prætexta; and Cæsar Augustus pronounced a funeral <lb/>
            eulogium on his grandmother at the age of twelve.*</p>
          <p>2. But it seems to me that a medium should be observed, <lb/>
            so that a countenance too young for the public eye may not be <lb/>
            made prematurely bold,! and that whatever is still crude in a <lb/>
            young man may not suffer by exposure ; for hence arises dis­ <lb/>
            dain of study; the foundations of effrontery are laid; and, <lb/>
            what is in all cases most pernicious, presumption goes before <lb/>
            ability. 3. Yet apprenticeship, on the other hand, should not <lb/>
            be put off till an advanced age; for fear then grows upon us <lb/>
            from day to day; what we have still to attempt appears con­ <lb/>
            tinually more alarming; and while we are deliberating when <lb/>
            we shall begin, we find that the time for beginning is past.</p>
          <p>The fruit of study ought accordingly to be produced in its <lb/>
            greenness and first sweets, while there is hope of indulgence, <lb/>
            while favour is ready to be shown, and while it is not unbe­ <lb/>
            coming to make a first trial; whatever is deficient in the <lb/>
            attempts of youth, age will supply; and whatever is expressed <lb/>
            in too turgescent a style, will be received as evidence of a <lb/>
            vigorous genius such is all that passage of Cicero in his <lb/>
            speech for Sextus Roscius, § Quid enim tarn commune, quàm <lb/>
            spiritus vivis, terra mortuis, mare fluctuantibus, litus ejectis, <lb/>
            “For what is more common than the air to the living, the <lb/>
            earth to the dead, the sea to navigators, the shore to those cast <lb/>
            up out of the deep," &amp;c.; a passage in reference to which, <lb/>
            after he had delivered it at six-and-twenty, with the greatest <lb/>
            applause from his audience, he observed, at a more advanced <lb/>
            period of life, that his style had fermented in the course of <lb/>
            time, and grown clear with age.|| 4. To say the truth, whatever <lb/>
            improvement private study may produce, there is still a peculiar <lb/>
            advantage attendant on our appearance in the forum, where the <lb/>

            eibility quite different from the fictitious cases of the schools, <lb/>
            and practice without learning, if we estimate the two separately, <lb/>
            will be of more avail than learning without practice. 5. Hence <lb/>
            some who have grown old in the schools, are astonished at the <lb/>
            novelty of things when they come before the tribunals, and <lb/>
            look in vain for something similar to their scholastic exercises. <lb/>
            But in the forum the judge is silent; the adversary noisy; <lb/>
            nothing uttered rashly is unnoticed; whatever we assert, we <lb/>
            must prove; time will perhaps be wanting for delivering a <lb/>
            speech which has been prepared and composed with the labour <lb/>
            of whole days and nights; and in some cases, laying aside the <lb/>
            ostentation of trumpeting forth fine words, we must speak in <lb/>
            the tone of conversation, to which our eloquent declaimers are <lb/>
            utter strangers; and we may accordingly find some of them <lb/>
            who are in their own opinion too eloquent for pleading causes.</p>
          <p>6. But I should wish my young student, whom I have <lb/>
            brought into the forum dependent on strength still immature, <lb/>
            to commence with as easy and favourable a cause as possible, <lb/>
            as the young of wild animals are fed with the most delicate <lb/>
            food that they can catch; but I would not have him continue to <lb/>
            plead causes uninterruptedly after his commencement, and <lb/>
            render his genius, which still requires nourishment, hard and <lb/>
            insensible; but I should like him. when he knows what a real <lb/>
            combat is, and for what be has to prepare himself, to recruit <lb/>
            and renew his strength.* 7. Thus he will have got over <lb/>
            the fear of a first attempt, while it is easier for him to make <lb/>
            it; and yet he will not make the facility which he experiences <lb/>
            in his first essays a reason for despising labour. It was this <lb/>
            plan that Cicero adopted; t and when he had already gained <lb/>
            an honourable name among the pleaders of his day, he made a <lb/>
            voyage into Asia, and attended doubtless on other masters of <lb/>
            eloquence and wisdom, but committed himself especially to <lb/>
            Apollonius Molo at Rhodes, of whom he had been an auditor <lb/>
            at Rome, to be fashioned and cast, as it were, anew. It is then, <lb/>
            indeed, that labour properly becomes valuable, when theory and <lb/>
            experience are duly united. <note type="footnote"> * By returning, at intervals, to his private studies. Turnebus. </note><note type="footnote">t See Brut. c. 91, where Cicero gives a full account of his proceed­ <lb/>

          <p>What sort of causes an orator should chiefly undertake, § 1—7, <lb/>
            What remuneration he may reasonably receive for his services, <lb/>
            8-12.</p>
          <p>1. AFTER the young orator has gained sufficient strength <lb/>
            for any kind of contest, his first care must be employed about <lb/>
            the choice of the. causes that he is to undertake. In making <lb/>
            such a choice, a good man will certainly prefer defending <lb/>
            accused persons rather than prosecuting them ; yet he will <lb/>
            not have such a horror of the name of accuser, as to be <lb/>
            incapable of being moved by any consideration, public or <lb/>
            private, to call any man to account for his life and conduct; <lb/>
            for even the laws themselves would be of no force if they were <lb/>
            not supported by the judicious voice of the orator; and if it <lb/>
            were not allowable to exact punishment for crimes, crimes <lb/>
            themselves would be almost permitted ; and that licence should <lb/>
            be granted to the bad is decidedly contrary to the interest of <lb/>
            the good. 2. The orator, therefore, will not allow the just <lb/>
            complaints of allies, or the murder of a friend or relative, or <lb/>
            conspiracies intended to burst forth in the overthrow of the <lb/>
            government, to pass unpunished; not because he is eager for <lb/>
            vengeance on the guilty, but because he is desirous of reforming <lb/>
            the vicious and of correcting public morals; since those who <lb/>
            cannot be brought to a better way of life by reason, can be <lb/>
            kept in order only by terror. 3. Though to live the life of an <lb/>
            accuser, therefore, and to be led to bring the guilty to judg <lb/>
            ment by hope of reward, is similar to subsisting by robbery, <lb/>
            yet to expel intestine corruption, is conduct resembling that of <lb/>
            the noblest defenders of their country.</p>
          <p>Accordingly the most eminent men in our republic have not <lb/>
            shrunk from this part of an oratoris duty; and young men of the <lb/>
            highest rank have been regarded as making the accusation of bad <lb/>
            citizens a proof of their attachment to their country, because it <lb/>
            was thought that they would have not expressed hatred of the <lb/>
            wicked, or have incurred the enmity of others, but from con­ <lb/>
            fidence in their own integrity of mind. A. This was the <lb/>
            conduct, in consequence, adopted by Hortensius, the Luculli, <lb/>
            Sulpicius, Cicero, Cæsar, and many others, as well as by the <note type="footnote"> * Lucius <unclear>Lucuirus</unclear> and Marcus his brother (or cousin, see Verheyk <lb/>
            ad Eutrop. vi 7), who are elsewhere mentioned in conjunction, as in </note> <note type="footnote"> E E 2 </note> <pb n="420"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/> <lb/>
            elder and younger Cato, one of whom has been called the Wise, <lb/>
            and unless the other be thought wise, I do not know to whom <lb/>
            he has left the right of taking the name. Yet an orator will <lb/>
            not defend all persons indiscriminately, or open the salutary <lb/>
            haven of his eloquence to pirates; and he will be influenced to <lb/>
            advocate any cause chiefly by the good opinion which he forms <lb/>
            of the nature of it.</p>
          <p>5. But as one man cannot undertake the defence of all those <lb/>
            who go to law with some appearance of justice, the number of <lb/>
            whom is certainly considerable, he will pay some attention to <lb/>
            the characters of those who recommend clients to his care, as <lb/>
            well as to that of those who are desirous to engage in suits,* <lb/>
            that he may be led by a feeling for the most upright, whom a <lb/>
            good man will always regard as his best friends. 6. But he <lb/>
            must keep himself free from two sorts of vain ostentation; the <lb/>
            one, that of obtruding his services on the powerful against the <lb/>
            humble; the other, which is even more boastful, that of sup­ <lb/>
            porting the humble against persons of dignity; for it is not <lb/>
            rank that makes causes just or unjust. Nor, in regard to any <lb/>
            cause which he has undertaken on the supposition that it was <lb/>
            good, but of which, in the course of discussion, he has dis. <lb/>
            covered the iniquitousness, will he let any feeling of shame <lb/>
            prevent him from declining it, after telling his client his real <lb/>
            opinion of it.</p>
          <p>7. It is indeed a great service to a client, if I am a fair <lb/>
            judge, not to beguile him with vain hopes. Nor, on the other <lb/>
            hand, is a client deserving of the assistance of an advocate, if <lb/>
            he does not listen to his advice. Assuredly it does not become <lb/>
            him, whom I would have to approve himself a true orator, <lb/>
            knowingly to defend injustice. If he support what is not true <lb/>
            in such cases as I have mentioned above,t what he does will <lb/>
            still be justifiable. <note type="footnote"> reference to their magnificent ædileship, Cic. de Off. it 16. They acted <lb/>

            the father of one or both of them; see Cicero, Acad. Quæst. iv. init.; <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH VII."/></p>
          <p>8. Whether an orator ought always to plead gratuitously, <lb/>
            is a question which admits of discussion, and which it would be <lb/>
            mere inconsiderateness to decide at once, and without reflec­ <lb/>
            tion ; for who is ignorant that it is by far the more honourable, <lb/>
            and more worthy of the liberal arts and of the feelings which <lb/>
            we expect to find in an orator, not to set a price on his efforts, <lb/>
            and thus lower the estimation of so great a blessing as <lb/>
            eloquence, as many things seem worthless in the eyes of <lb/>
            the world for no other reason than that they may be purchased? <lb/>
            9. This, as the saying is, is clear enough even to the blind; <lb/>
            nor will any pleader who has but a competency for himself, <lb/>
            (and a little will suffice for a competency,) make a gain of his <lb/>
            art without incurring the charge of meanness. But if his cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances demand something more for his necessary require­ <lb/>
            ments than he actually possesses, he may, according to the <lb/>
            opinions of all wise men, allow a recompence to be made him; <lb/>
            since contributions were raised for the support even of <lb/>
            Socrates and Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus took fees from <lb/>
            their scholars. 10. Nor do I see any more honourable way <lb/>
            of gaining support than by the practice of a noble profession, <lb/>
            and by receiving remuneration from those whom we have <lb/>
            served, and who, if they made no return, would be unworthy <lb/>
            of defence. Such a return, indeed, is not only just, but neces­ <lb/>
            sary, as the very labour and time devoted to other people's <lb/>
            business precludes all possibility of making profit by any other <lb/>
            means. 11. But in this respect also moderation is to be ob­ <lb/>
            served ; and it makes a great difference from whom an orator <lb/>
            receives fees, and how many, and for how long a time.t The <lb/>
            rapacious practice of making bargains, and the detestable <lb/>
            traffic of those who ask a price proportioned to the risk of their <lb/>
            clients, will never be adopted even by such as are but mode­ <lb/>
            rately dishonest, especially when he who defends good men <lb/>
            and good causes has no reason to fear that any one whom he <note type="footnote"> * Let no one suppose that this assertion is at variance with what is <lb/>
            stated in the sixth chapter of the first book of Xenophon'a Memorabilia <lb/>
            of Socrates; for the pay, on which the sophists lived luxuriously, <lb/>
            differed greatly from a small contribution, given only when necessary, <lb/>
            for the very simplest maintenance. Such a contribution seems to be <lb/>
            indicated by the very obscure words of Aristoxenus given in Diogenes <lb/>
            Laertius, ii. 20. Spalding. </note><note type="footnote"> + He is not to continue to demand fees, after lie has been enriched <lb/>

            had rather that the client should be in fault than the pleader. <lb/>
            12. The orator, therefore, will entertain no desire of gaining <lb/>
            more than shall be just sufficient, and, even if he be poor, will <lb/>
            not receive anything as pay, but will consider it merely as a <lb/>
            friendly acknowledgment of service, being conscious that he has <lb/>
            conferred much more than he receives. Benefits of such a <lb/>
            nature, because they are not to be sold, are not therefore to <lb/>
            be thrown away; and it belongs to the obliged party to show <lb/>
            gratitude.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The orator must study a cause well before he ventures to plead it; he <lb/>
            must examine all documents connected with it, and thoroughly <lb/>
            weigh the statements of his client.</p>
          <p>1. THE next thing to be considered is the mode of studying <lb/>
            a cause, which constitutes the foundation of pleading; for no <lb/>
            speaker can be imagined of such extremely slender powers, as, <lb/>
            when he has carefully ascertained every particular in a cause, <lb/>
            to be unable to state it at least to the judge. 2. But very few <lb/>
            orators take sufficient trouble in this respect; for, to say <lb/>
            nothing of those who are utterly careless, and who give them­ <lb/>
            selves no concern on what the success of a cause depends, if <lb/>
            there be but points which, though wholly unconnected with the <lb/>
            case, but relating to characters involved in it, and leading to <lb/>
            the usual flourishes on common-place topics, may afford them <lb/>
            an opportunity for noisy declamation, there are some also <lb/>
            whom vanity perverts, and who, (partly pretending that they <lb/>
            are constantly occupied, and have always something which <lb/>
            they must first dispatch, tell their client to come to them the <lb/>
            day, or the very morning, before the trial, and sometimes even <lb/>
            boast that they received their instructions while the court <lb/>
            was sitting; 3. or, partly assuming a show of extraordinary <lb/>
            ability, that they may be thought to understand things in a <lb/>
            moment, making believe that they conceive and comprehend <lb/>
            almost before they hear,) after they have chanted forth, with <lb/>
            wonderful eloquence, and the loudest clamours of applause from <pb n="423"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH VIII.]"/><lb/>
            their partizans, muci that has no reference either to the judge <lb/>
            or to their client, are conducted back, in a thorough perspira­ <lb/>
            tion, and with a long train of attendants, through the forum.</p>
          <p>4. Nor can I tolerate the foppishness of those who desire <lb/>
            that their friends should be instructed in the causes which <lb/>
            they have to plead; though, indeed there may be less harm <lb/>
            done in this case, if the friends learn accurately and repeat <lb/>
            accurately. But who will learn a cause with the same care as <lb/>
            the pleader himself? How can the depositary, the mere <lb/>
            instrument of communication in cases,. bestow his attention <lb/>
            contentedly on other men's causes, when, even to those who <lb/>
            are going to plead, their own causes are of so little moment?</p>
          <p>5. But the most pernicious practice of all is, for an orator to <lb/>
            be content with written memorials, which either the party who <lb/>
            has recourse to an advocate, because he is unable to conduct <lb/>
            his own cause, has drawn up, or which some one of that class <lb/>
            of advocates has composed, who confess that they are incapable <lb/>
            of pleading, and yet undertake that which is the most difficult <lb/>
            part of a pleader's business. For why should not he, who can <lb/>
            judge what ought to be said, what ought to be suppressed, or <lb/>
            altered, or imagined, stand forth as an orator himself, when, <lb/>
            what is far more difficult, he makes an orator? 6. Such com­ <lb/>
            posers of memorials, however, would be less mischievous, if <lb/>
            they wrote down everything merely as it occurred; but they <lb/>
            add motives and colouring, and inventions that do more harm <lb/>
            than the plain truth;† and most of our orators, when they <lb/>
            receive these farragos, think it wrong to make any change in <lb/>
            them, but adhere to them as strictly as to cases proposed in the <lb/>
            schools.‡ The consequence is, that they find themselves <lb/>
            deceived, and learn the cause, which they would not learn from <lb/>
            their own client, from the advocates of the opposite party. 7. <lb/>
            Let us allow plenty of time, then, and a place of interview free <lb/>
            from interruption, to those who shall have occasion to consult <lb/>
            us, and let us earnestly exhort them to state every particular <lb/>
            off hand, however verbosely, or however far they may wish to <lb/>
            go back; for it is a less inconvenience to listen to what is <note type="footnote"> * Media litium manus.] Compare xi. 2, 3. <lb/>
            t Aliqua pejora veris.] While they endeavour to throw into the <lb/>
            shade the true difficulties in a cause, they often introduce, through <lb/>
            want of skill, what is far more injurious than the truth would be. <lb/>
            This is Rolliu's view of the words. He takes veris for a dative, but, as <lb/>
            It appears, without necessity. </note><note type="footnote">‡ See iv. 2, 28. </note> <pb n="424"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            superfluous than to be left ignorant of what is essential. 8. <lb/>
            Frequently, too, the orator will find both the evil and the <lb/>
            remedy in particulars which to the client appeared to have <lb/>
            no weight on either side of the question. Nor should a pleader <lb/>
            have so much confidence in his memory as to think it too <lb/>
            great trouble to write down what he hears.</p>
          <p>Nor should he be content with hearing only once; the client <lb/>
            should be required to repeat the same things again and again; <lb/>
            not only because some things might have escaped his memory <lb/>
            at the first recital, especially if he be, as is often the case, an illi <lb/>
            terate person ; but also that we may see whether he tells exactly <lb/>
            the same story; for many state what is false, and, as if they <lb/>
            were not stating their case but pleading it, address themselves, <lb/>
            not as to an advocate, but as to a judge. 9. We must never <lb/>
            therefore place too much reliance on a client; but he must be <lb/>
            sifted, and cross-examined, and obliged to tell the truth; for as, <lb/>
            by physicians, not only apparent ailments are to be cured, but <lb/>
            even such as are latent are to be discovered, even though the <lb/>
            persons who require to be healed conceal them, so an advocate <lb/>
            must look for more than is laid before him. 10. When he has <lb/>
            exercised sufficient patience in listening, he must assume <lb/>
            another character, and act the part of the adversary ; he must <lb/>
            state whatever can possibly be imagined on the other side, and <lb/>
            whatever the nature of the case will allow in such a discuss on <lb/>
            of it. The client must be questioned sharply, and pressed <lb/>
            hard; for, by searching into every particular, we sometimes <lb/>
            [discover truth where we least expected to find it.</p>
          <p>11. In a word, the best advocate for learning the merits of <lb/>
            a cause is he that is least credulous; for a client is often ready <lb/>
            to promise everything; offering a cloud of witnesses,* and <lb/>
            sealed documents quite ready, t and averring that the ad­ <lb/>
            versary himself will not even offer opposition on certain points. <lb/>
            ] 2. It is therefore necessary to examine all the writings relating <lb/>
            to a case; it is not sufficient to inspect them; they must be read <lb/>
            through; for very frequently they are either not at all such as <lb/>
            they were asserted to be, or they contain less than was stated, or <note type="footnote"> * Testem populum.] Il a la favour du peuple. Gedoyn. He has the <lb/>

            they are mixed with matters that may injure the client's cause, <lb/>
            or they say too much, and lose all credit from appearing to be <lb/>
            exaggerated. 13. We may often, too, find a thread broken,* <lb/>
            or wax disturbed,! or signatures without attestation; all which <lb/>
            points, unless we settle them at home, will embarrass us <lb/>
            unexpectedly in the forum; and evidence which we are obliged <lb/>
            to give up will damage a cause more than it would have suf­ <lb/>
            fered from none having been offered.</p>
          <p>14. An advocate will also bring out many points which his <lb/>
            client regarded as having no bearing on the case, if he but go <lb/>
            over all the grounds which I have previously specified for <lb/>
            arguments; ‡ and as it will be by no means convenient to <lb/>
            review all these, and try them one by one, while we are plead­ <lb/>
            ing, for the reasons which I have given, § so, in studying a <lb/>
            cause, it will be necessary to examine minutely what sort of <lb/>
            characters are concerned in it, what times, or places, or prac­ <lb/>
            tices, || or documents, have any reference to it, and all other <lb/>
            particulars, from which not only artificial proofs ¶ may be drawn, <lb/>
            but it may be ascertained what witnesses are to be feared, and <lb/>
            how they are to be refuted; for it makes a great difference <lb/>
            whether an accused person suffers under envy, or dislike, or <lb/>
            contempt, of which the first is generally directed against supe­ <lb/>
            riors, the second against equals, and the third upon inferiors <lb/>
            15. After having thus thoroughly examined a cause, and brought <lb/>
            before his eyes everything that may promote or hinder its suc­ <lb/>
            cess, let him, in the third place, put himself in the place of the <lb/>
            judge, and imagine the cause to be pleaded before him; and <lb/>
            whatever arguments would move him most if he had really to. <lb/>
            pass sentence on the matter, let him suppose that those argu­ <lb/>
            ments will have most effect upon any judge before whom it <lb/>
            may be brought. Thus the result will seldom deceive him; <lb/>
            or, if it does, it will be the fault of the judge. <note type="footnote"> * Linum ruptum.] The thread which was passed three times round <lb/>

          <p>Applause not to be too eagerly sought, § 1—7. Invectives to be but <lb/>
            sparingly introduced into a speech, 8—13. How far an orator <lb/>
            should prepare himself by writing his speech; he must qualify <lb/>
            himself to reply extempore to objections that may be suddenly <lb/>
            started, 14—21.</p>
          <p>1. WHAT is to be observed in pleading a cause, I have been <lb/>
            employed in showing through almost the whole of the work; <lb/>
            yet I shall here notice a few things which properly fall under <lb/>
            this head, and which relate not so much to the art of oratory <lb/>
            in general, as to the duties of the orator personally. 2. Above <lb/>
            all things, let not the desire of temporary praise draw off his <lb/>
            attention, as is the case with many, from the interest of the <lb/>
            cause which he has undertaken; for as the troops of generals <lb/>
            conducting a war are not always to be led through level and <lb/>
            pleasant plains, but rugged hills are often to be ascended, and <lb/>
            towns, situate on rocks of the greatest possible steepness, and <lb/>
            scarcely accessible through the strength of their fortifications, <lb/>
            require to be stormed ; so eloquence will delight in an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of flowing in a more free course than ordinary, and, <lb/>
            engaging on fair ground, will display all its powers to gain <lb/>
            public praise; 3. but if it shall be called to trace the intri­ <lb/>
            cacies of law, or to penetrate into hiding-places for the sake of <lb/>
            discovering truth, it will not then make showy manoeuvres, or <lb/>
            use brilliant and pointed thoughts as missile weapons, but it <lb/>
            will carry on its operations by mines, and ambuscades, and <lb/>
            every kind of secret artifice. 4. These stratagems, however, <lb/>
            are commended, not so much while they are being practised, as <lb/>
            after they have been practised ; and hence also greater profit <lb/>
            falls to those who are less eager for applause ;* for when the <lb/>
            absurd parade of eloquence has brought its thunders among <lb/>
            its partisans to a close, the credit of genuine merit appears <lb/>
            with greater effect; the judges will not fail to show by which <lb/>
            speaker they have been most impressed; respect will be paid <lb/>
            to the truly learned; and the real merit of a speech will be <lb/>
            sure to be acknowledged when it is ended.</p>
          <p>6. Among the ancients, indeed, it was a practice to dissemble <note type="footnote"> * Minùs cupidis opinionis.] Opinio for fama, in which sense it had <lb/>
            begun to be used in the time of Quintilian, and is constantly used by <lb/>
            Justin. See Spalding on ii. 12, 5, and comp. sect. 7. </note> <pb n="427"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH IX.]"/><lb/>
            the force of their eloquence ;* a practice which Marcus Anto <lb/>
            nius recommends,† in order that more credit may be given to <lb/>
            speakers, and that the artifices of advocates on behalf of their <lb/>
            clients may be less suspected. But such eloquence as then <lb/>
            existed might well be concealed ; for such splendour of oratory <lb/>
            bad not then risen as to break through every intervening <lb/>
            obstacle. However, art and design, and whatever loses its <lb/>
            value when detected, should certainly be masked. So far, <lb/>
            eloquence has its secrecy. 6. As to choice of words, force of <lb/>
            thoughts, and elegance of figures, they are either not in a <lb/>
            speech, or they must appear in it; but they are not, because <lb/>
            they must appear, to be displayed ostentatiously; and, if one <lb/>
            of the two is to be preferred, let the cause be praised rather <lb/>
            than the pleader. Still the true orator will make it his object <lb/>
            that he may be thought to have pleaded an excellent cause in <lb/>
            an excellent way. Certain it is, that no man pleads worse <lb/>
            than he who pleases while his cause displeases; for that which <lb/>
            pleases in his speech must necessarily be foreign to the cause.</p>
          <p>7. Nor will an honourable orator be infected by the fastidious <lb/>
            disdain of pleading inferior causes, as if they were beneath <lb/>
            him, or as if a subject of little dignity would detract from his <lb/>
            reputation ; for regard to duty will amply justify him for un­ <lb/>
            dertaking such causes. He ought also to desire that his <lb/>
            friends may have as few lawsuits as possible;. and whoever has <lb/>
            defended a cause successfully, of whatever nature it be, has <lb/>
            proved himself sufficiently eloquent.</p>
          <p>8. But some pleaders, if they happen to undertake such <lb/>
            causes as require, in reality, but moderate powers of eloquence, <lb/>
            envelope them in a variety of extrinsic matter, and, if other <lb/>
            resources fail, fill up the vacancies in their subject with invectives; <lb/>
            urging just ones perhaps, if they occur, if not, such as they can <lb/>
            imagine; caring little, indeed, provided that there be exercise <lb/>
            for their wit, and that they gain applause while they continue <lb/>
            speaking. 9. But this is a practice which I consider so utterly <lb/>
            at variance with the character of a perfect orator, that I think he <lb/>
            would not even utter just invectives, unless his cause absolutely <note type="footnote"> * See iv. 1, 9. </note><note type="footnote"> + Cicero de Orate ii. 1. “ Antonius thought that his oratory would <lb/>
            be better received by the people of Rome if he were believed to have <lb/>
            had no learning at all." </note> <pb n="428"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            require him to do so; for it is mere canine eloquence,* as <lb/>
            Appius says, that subjects itself to the charge t of being slan­ <lb/>
            derous ; and they who practise it ought previously to have <lb/>
            acquired the power of enduring slander; since retaliation is <lb/>
            often inflicted on those who have pleaded in such a style ; or <lb/>
            the client at least suffers for the virulence of his advocate. <lb/>
            But what appears outwardly, is small in comparison with the <lb/>
            malice of the mind within ; for an evil speaker differs from an <lb/>
            evil-doer only in opportunity. 10. A base and inhuman gratifi. <lb/>
            cation, acceptable to no good man among the audience, is often <lb/>
            required by clients, who think more of revenge than of the de­ <lb/>
            fence of their cause.. But this, as well as many other things, <lb/>
            is not to be done according to their pleasure; for what man <lb/>
            indeed, possessed of the least portion of liberal spirit, could <lb/>
            endure to utter abuse at the pleasure of another ?</p>
          <p>11. Yet some take pleasure in inveighing against the advo­ <lb/>
            cates of the opposite party; but this, unless they happen to have <lb/>
            deserved reproof, is an ungenerous violation of the common <lb/>
            duties of the profession; it is a practice useless, too, to those <lb/>
            who adopt it, (for similar liberty of attack is allowed to the <lb/>
            respondents,) and it is detrimental to their cause, for their <lb/>
            adversaries are thus rendered real enemies, and whatever <lb/>
            power they have is provoked to double efforts by insult. 12. But <lb/>
            what is worst of all, that modesty, which gains the eloquence <lb/>
            of an orator so much authority and credit, is altogether lost if <lb/>
            he degrade himself from a man of high feeling into a brawler <lb/>
            and barker, ‡ adapting his language, not to the feelings of the <lb/>
            judge, but to the resentment of his client. 13. Frequently, too, <lb/>
            the seductions of such liberty lead to rashness, dangerous not <lb/>
            only to the cause, but to the speaker; nor was it without <lb/>
            reason that Pericles § wished no word might ever enter into <lb/>
            his mind at which the people could be offended. But the <lb/>
            regard which he paid to the people, I think that the orator <note type="footnote"> * Canina eloquentia.] What Appius this was, is uncertain. Spalding <lb/>
            supposes it may have been Appius Claudius Cæcus. Canind, ut ait <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH IX.]"/><lb/>
            ought to pay to every audience before whom he appears, as <lb/>
            they can do him quite as much harm as the people could do <lb/>
            Pericles; and what appears spirited when it is uttered, is called <lb/>
            foolish when it has given offence.</p>
          <p>14. As orators, for the most part, study each a particular <lb/>
            manner, and as the cautiousness of one is imputed to dulness, <lb/>
            while the readiness of another is ascribed to presumption, it <lb/>
            appears by no means improper to state what sort of middle <lb/>
            course I think that an orator may observe between the two. <lb/>
            15. He will, in the first place, always give to the cause which <lb/>
            he has to plead as much preparation as he can; for it is char <lb/>
            racteristic indeed, not only of a negligent, but of an unprinci­ <lb/>
            pled advocate, treacherous and faithless to the matter which <lb/>
            he undertakes, not to plead as well as he can. For this reason <lb/>
            he must not take upon himself more causes than he is certain <lb/>
            that he can fairly support. 16. He will utter, as far as his <lb/>
            subject will allow, nothing but what he has written, or, as <lb/>
            Demosthenes says,* hewn into shape. But this only the first <lb/>
            hearing of a cause, or such as are granted on public trials† <lb/>
            after an interval of certain days, will allow; when a speaker <lb/>
            has to reply at once to objections suddenly started, full pre­ <lb/>
            paration cannot be made; so that it is even injurious to those <lb/>
            who are rather slow to have written their matter, if something <lb/>
            arises from the opposite party different from what they had <lb/>
            expected. 17. For they cannot readily depart from what they <lb/>
            had premeditated, and look back through all their composition, <lb/>
            trying to ascertain if any part can be snatched from it, and united <lb/>
            with what they are going to say extempore; but, even if this be <lb/>
            practicable, there will be no proper coherence, and the patch­ <lb/>
            ing will be visible, not only from the opening of the seams, as <lb/>
            in a piece of work ill-joined, but from the difference of corn <note type="footnote"> * I have not discovered where. But Plutarch, in his Life of Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes, states much that shows how unwilling he was to speak extem­ <lb/>
            pore, and how in that respect he imitated Pericles. Gener. </note><note type="footnote"> + In publicis judiciis.] On private trials, or trials regarding inferior <lb/>
            matters, there was but one regular pleading, the prima actio, in which <lb/>
            the cause was stated to the judges; all else was done by altercation. <lb/>
            (B. vi. c. 4.) On public trials there was greater solemnity and cere­ <lb/>
            mony ; and if, in the prima actio, many particulars were advanced by <lb/>
            one party that required a studied refutation, a second actio was allowed <lb/>
            after an interval of some days, when both parties might argue the case <lb/>
            in speeches which they had premeditated. Spalding. </note> <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="B XII."/><lb/>
            plexion in the style. 18. Thus there will be neither fluency, <lb/>
            nor elegant compactness, in what they say; and the different <lb/>
            parts will but hamper one another; for what was written will <lb/>
            still fetter the mind, instead of yielding itself to the mind'a <lb/>
            influence. 19. In such pleadings therefore, we must stand as <lb/>
            the husbandmen say, on all OUT feet;. for as every case con <lb/>
            sists of a statement and a refutation, what belongs clearly to <lb/>
            our own part may be written; and of what it is certain that <lb/>
            the adversary will reply (for it is sometimes certain) a refuta­ <lb/>
            tion may be prepared with equal solicitude. But as to all <lb/>
            other points, there is but one kind of preparation that we can <lb/>
            make, namely, to gain a thorough knowledge of the cause; <lb/>
            something farther indeed we may gain at the time of the trial, <lb/>
            by listening attentively to the advocate of the opposite party. <lb/>
            20. We may, however, anticipate much that may occur, and <lb/>
            prepare ourselves for emergencies; and this is indeed a safer <lb/>
            method than writing, as first thoughts may thus more easily <lb/>
            be abandoned, and the attention directed to something else.</p>
          <p>21. But whether an orator has to speak extemporaneously in <lb/>
            reply, or whether any other cause obliges him to do so, he will <lb/>
            never find himself at a loss or disconcerted, if discipline and <lb/>
            study and exercise have given him the accomplishment of <lb/>
            facility; and, as he is always armed, and standing prepared <lb/>
            as it were for battle, the language of oratory will no more fail <lb/>
            him in supporting a cause than the language of ordinary con­ <lb/>
            versation on daily and domestic subjects; nor will he ever <lb/>
            shrink from his task under such an apprehension, provided <lb/>
            that he has time for studying the cause; for everything else <lb/>
            he will easily command. <note type="footnote"> * Omni pede standum est.] A Greek proverb, <foreign xml:lang="grc">όλψ ποδί</foreign>, said by <lb/>

            affected it, 20—26. The Romans were excelled by the Greeks only <lb/>
            in delivery; cause of the inferiority of the Romans in this respect, <lb/>
            27—34. The Romans exhorted to cultivate force of thought and <lb/>
            brilliancy of language, 35—39. Folly of those who would reject <lb/>
            all ornament, 40—48. Whether a difference should be made in <lb/>
            the styles of speaking and writing, 49—47. Of the simple, grand, <lb/>
            and florid styles, 58—68. Many varieties and mixtures of these <lb/>
            styles, 69—72. Of corrupt taste in eloquence, 73—76. A good <lb/>
            style may be acquired by study and practice; but we must carry <lb/>
            no fancied excellence to excess, 77—80.</p>
          <p>1. IT remains for me to speak of the style of oratory. This, <lb/>
            in the first division of my work,. was proposed as the third <lb/>
            part of it; for I undertook to treat of the art, the artificer, and <lb/>
            the work. But as oratory is the work of the art of rhetoric and <lb/>
            of the orator, and there are, as I shall show, many forms of it, <lb/>
            the influence of the art and the artificer is apparent in all those <lb/>
            forms; yet they differ very much one from another, not only <lb/>
            in species, as one statue differs from another, one picture from <lb/>
            another, and one speech from another, but in genus, as Tuscan <lb/>
            statues from Grecian,† and Asiatic eloquence from Attic. ‡ 2. Yet <lb/>
            these several kinds of work, of which I am speaking, have not <lb/>
            only their artificers, but also their admirers, and it is for this <lb/>
            reason, possibly, that there has not yet appeared a perfect ora­ <lb/>
            tor, and that perhaps no art has reached its full perfection, not <lb/>
            only because certain qualities are more prominent in some indi­ <lb/>
            viduals than in others, but because the same form is not to all <lb/>
            equally attractive, partly from the influence of circumstances <lb/>
            and countries, and partly from varieties in the judgment and <lb/>
            objects of each particular person.</p>
          <p>3. The first painters of eminence, whose works deserve to <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            were Polygnotus and Aglaophon,* whose simple colouring <lb/>
            even now finds such ardent admirers, that they prefer these <lb/>
            imperfect rudiments of an art that was still, as we may say, to <lb/>
            be, to the performances of the greatest masters that arose after <lb/>
            them; but this preference, as it appears to me, is given only <lb/>
            from an affectation of superior intelligence. 4. Subsequently <lb/>
            Zeuxis and Parrhasius, who were very nearly contemporaries, as <lb/>
            they both flourished about the time of the Peloponnesian war, <lb/>
            (for a dialogue of Socrates with Parrhasius is to be found in <lb/>
            Xenophon,†) contributed much to the improvement of the art. <lb/>
            Zeuxis is said to have found out the management of light and <lb/>
            shade ; Parrhasius to have studied outline with great accuracy. <lb/>
            5. Zeuxis gave the human body more than its natural fulness, <lb/>
            thinking that he thus added to its nobleness and dignity, and, <lb/>
            as it is supposed, adopting that idea from Homer, whose <lb/>
            imagination delighted in the amplest figures, even in women. <lb/>
            Parrhasius was so exact in all his figures, that they call him <lb/>
            the legislator of painting, since other painters follow, as a <lb/>
            matter of obligation, the representations of gods and heroes <lb/>
            just as they were given by him. 6. Painting flourished <lb/>
            most, however, about the reign of Philip, and under the suc­ <lb/>
            cessors of Alexander; but with different species of excellence; <lb/>
            for Protogenes was distinguished for accuracy, Pamphilus and <lb/>
            Melanthius for judgment, Antiphilus for ease, Theon of Samoa <lb/>
            for producing imaginary scenes, which the Greeks call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασίαι</foreign>, and Apelles for genius and grace, on which he <lb/>
            greatly prided himself. What made Euphranor remarkable, <lb/>
            was, that while he was among the most eminent in other <lb/>
            excellent attainments, he was also a great master both of <lb/>
            painting and statuary.</p>
          <p>7. There was similar variety in regard to sculpture; Callon ‡ <lb/>
            and Hegesias § made rude statues, like the Tuscan ;ll Calamis <note type="footnote"> * Aglaophon was a native of the island of Thaaos, and is said by <lb/>
            Suidas to have been the father of Polygnotus, who, according to Pliny, <lb/>

            produced some that were less inelegant; and Myron such as <lb/>
            were of a softer character than those of any of his predecessors <lb/>
            Accuracy and grace were highly conspicuous in Polycletus, to <lb/>
            whom pre-eminence in the art is allowed by most critics ; yet, <lb/>
            that they may not grant him every excellence, they intimate <lb/>
            that his figures were deficient in dignity ; for though he gave <lb/>
            supernatural grace to the human form, he is said not to have <lb/>
            adequately expressed the majesty of the gods. 8. The represen­ <lb/>
            tation of old age, too, he is said to have declined, and to have <lb/>
            attempted nothing beyond a smooth cheek. But what was <lb/>
            wanting in Polycletus, is said to have been fully exhibited in <lb/>
            Phidias and Alcamenes* 9. Phidias, however, is thought to <lb/>
            have been a better sculptor of gods than of men ; certainly in <lb/>
            ivory he was far beyond any rival, even if he had produced <lb/>
            nothing more than his Minerva at Athens, and his Olympian <lb/>
            Jupiter at Elis, the majesty of which is thought to have added <lb/>
            something to the impressiveness of the received religion ; so <lb/>
            exactly did the nobleness of that work represent the god. In <lb/>
            adhering to nature Lysippus and Praxiteles are said to have <lb/>
            been most successful; as for Demetrius, † he is censured for <lb/>
            too much exactness in that respect, having been fonder of <lb/>
            accurate likeness than of beauty.</p>
          <p>10. So it is with oratory. If we contemplate the varieties <lb/>
            of it, we find almost as much diversity in the minds as in the <lb/>
            bodies of orators. There were some forms of eloquence of a <lb/>
            rude nature, in agreement with the times in which they <lb/>
            appeared, but indicating mental power in the speakers; <lb/>
            among whom we may number the Lælii, African!, Catos, and <lb/>
            Gracchi; and these we may call the Polygnoti and Callones of <lb/>
            oratory. Of the middle kind Lucius Crassus and Quintus <lb/>
            Hortensius may be thought the chief representatives. 11 <lb/>
            There may be contemplated a vast multitude of orators, all <lb/>
            flourishing about the same time. Among them we find the <lb/>
            energy of Cæsar,‡ the natural talent of Cælius,§ the subtilty <lb/>
            of Calidius,|| the accuracy of Pollio,|| the dignity of Messala,** <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            ness of Sulpicius,* and the severity of Cassius.t Among <lb/>
            those, also, whom we have ourselves seen, we recollect the <lb/>
            copiousness of Seneca,‡ the force of Julius Africanus,§ the <lb/>
            mature judgment of Domitius Afer,|| the agreeableness of <lb/>
            Crispus. || the sonorous pronunciation of Trachalus,** and the <lb/>
            elegance of Secundus.</p>
          <p>12. But in Cicero we have not merely a Euphranor, distin­ <lb/>
            guished by excellence in several particular departments of art, <lb/>
            but eminent in every quality that is commended in any orator <lb/>
            whatever. Yet the men of his own time presumed to censure <lb/>
            him as timid, Asiatic, redundant, too fond of repetition, in­ <lb/>
            dulging in tasteless jests, loose in the structure of his sentences, <lb/>
            tripping †† in his manner, and (what is surely very far from <lb/>
            truth) almost too effeminate in his general style for a man. 13. <lb/>
            And after that he was cut off by the proscription of the triumvirs, <lb/>
            those who had hated, envied, and rivalled him,‡‡ and who were <lb/>
            anxious to pay their court to the rulers of the day, attacked <lb/>
            him from all quarters, when he was no longer able to reply to <lb/>
            them. But the very man who is now regarded by some as <lb/>
            meagre and dry, appeared to his personal enemies, his con <lb/>
            temporaries, censurable only for too flowery a style and too <lb/>
            much exuberance of matter. Both charges are false, but for <lb/>
            the latter there is the fairer ground.‡</p>
          <p>14. But his severest critics were those who desired to be <lb/>
            thought imitators of the Attic orators. This band of calum­ <lb/>
            niators, as if they had leagued themselves in a solemn con­ <lb/>
            federacy, attacked Cicero as though he had been quite of <lb/>
            another country, neither caring for their customs nor bound <lb/>
            by their laws ; of which school are our present dry, sapless, and <lb/>
            frigid orators. 15. These are the men who give their meagre­ <lb/>
            ness the name of health, which is the very opposite to it; and <lb/>
            who, because they cannot endure the brighter lustre of Cicero's <lb/>
            eloquence, any more than they can look at the sun, shelter <note type="footnote"> * X. 1, 116. </note><note type="footnote">‡ X. 1,116. </note><note type="footnote">‡ X. 1, 125. </note><note type="footnote"> § X. 1, 118. </note><note type="footnote">|| X. it 118. </note><note type="footnote">|| X. 1, 121. </note><note type="footnote"> ** See c. 5, sect. 5, and x. 1, 119. </note><note type="footnote"> tt Exultantem.] ix. 4, 108; x. 2, 16. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡‡ Endeavoured to equal him, not in virtue and merit, but in <lb/>

            themselves under the shade of the great name of Attic ora. <lb/>
            tory. But as Cicero himself has fully answered such crimes, <lb/>
            in many parts of his works, brevity in touching on this point <lb/>
            will be the rather excusable in me.</p>
          <p>16. The distinction between Attic and Asiatic orators is <lb/>
            indeed of great antiquity; the Attics being regarded as com­ <lb/>
            pressed and energetic in their style, the Asiatics as inflated <lb/>
            and deficient in force; in the Attics it was thought that <lb/>
            nothing was redundant, in the Asiatics that judgment and <lb/>
            restraint were in a great measure wanting. This difference <lb/>
            some, among whom is Santra, * suppose to have arisen from <lb/>
            the circumstance that, when the Greek tongue spread itself <lb/>
            among the people of Asia nearest to Greece, certain persons, <lb/>
            who had not yet acquired a thorough mastery over the lan­ <lb/>
            guage, desired to attain eloquence, and began to express some <lb/>
            things, which might have been expressed closely,! in a peri­ <lb/>
            phrastic style, and afterwards continued to do so. 17. To me, <lb/>
            however, the difference in the character of the speakers and <lb/>
            their audiences, seems to have caused the difference in their <lb/>
            styles of oratory; for the people of Attica,‡ being polished <lb/>
            and of refined taste, could endure nothing useless or redun <lb/>
            dant; which the Asiatics, a people in other respects vain and <lb/>
            ostentatious, were puffed up with fondness for a showy kind of <lb/>
            eloquence. 18. Those who made distinctions in these matters <lb/>
            soon after added a third kind of eloquence, the Rhodian, which <lb/>
            they define to be of a middle character between the other two, <lb/>
            and partaking of each; for the orators of this school are not <lb/>
            concise like the Attics, nor exuberant like the Asiatics, but <lb/>
            appear to derive their styles partly from the country, and partly <lb/>
            from their founder; 19. for Æschines, who fixed on Rhodes <lb/>
            for his place of exile,§ carried thither the accomplishments <lb/>
            then studied at Athens, which, like certain plants that dege. <note type="footnote"> * A grammarian, of whom little is known but his name. He is <lb/>
            cited by Festus and Paulus. </note><note type="footnote"> † Quæ propriè signari poterant.] That is, if the Asiatics had had a <lb/>
            greater knowledge of the Greek language. What, in their ignorance, <lb/>
            they could not express exactly, they gave in a circumlocution. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ See sect. 85. </note><note type="footnote"> § That Æschines opened a school of rhetoric at Rhodes, is related by <lb/>
            very good authors, as Plutarch in his Life of Demosthenes, and Philos­ <lb/>

            nerate when they are removed to a foreign climate and soil, <lb/>
            formed a union of the Attic flavour with that of the country <lb/>
            to which they were transplanted. The orators of the Rhodian <lb/>
            school are accordingly accounted somewhat deficient in vigour <lb/>
            and spirit, though nevertheless not without force, resembling, <lb/>
            not pure springs, nor turbid torrents, but calm floods.</p>
          <p>20 Let no one doubt, then, that of the three styles, that of <lb/>
            the Attics is by far the best. But though there is something <lb/>
            common to all that have written in this style, namely, a keen <lb/>
            and exact judgment, yet there are great varieties in the cha­ <lb/>
            racters of their genius. 21. Those, therefore, appear to me to <lb/>
            be very much mistaken, who think that the only Attic orators <lb/>
            are such as are simple, clear, expressive, restricting themselves, <lb/>
            as it were, to a certain frugality in the use of their eloquence, <lb/>
            and always keeping their hand within their cloak.* For who <lb/>
            shall be named as such an Attic orator? Suppose it be <lb/>
            Lysias; for the admirers of that style recognize him as a <lb/>
            model of it.t But may we not as well, then, be sent to <lb/>
            Coccus and Andocides ?‡ 22. Yet I should like to ask whether <lb/>
            Isocrates spoke after the Attic manner; for no one can be <lb/>
            more unlike Lysias. They will say that he did not; yet his <lb/>
            school sent forth the most eminent of the Greek orators. Let <lb/>
            us look, then, for some one more like Lysias. Was Hyperides <lb/>
            Attic? Doubtless. Yet he studied agreeableness of style <lb/>
            more than Lysias. I say nothing of many others; as <lb/>
            Lycurgus,§ Ariatogeiton,|| and their predecessors, Isæus and <lb/>
            Antiphon,|| whom, though resembling each other .in kind, w <note type="footnote"> * Which was a sign of modesty and sedateness. Compare xi 3, 138 <lb/>
            “ Orators who spoke with animation and vehemence," says Turnebus <lb/>
            “ used to extend and flourish about the arm.” </note><note type="footnote"> t Istius nominis modum.] Mensuram omnis ejus, quod Atticum <lb/>

            Andocides is well known as one of the ten Attic orators mentioned by <lb/>
            Plutarch and others. He was contemporary with Alcibiades, who <lb/>
            mutilated the statue of Hermes at his gate. The name of Coccus is <lb/>
            more obscure. He is said by Suidas to have been a scholar of Isocrates. <lb/>

            should call different in species. 23. What was AEschines, whom <lb/>
            I just now mentioned? Was he not broader, and bolder, and <lb/>
            loftier in style than they ? What, to come to a conclusion, <lb/>
            was Demosthenes? Did he not surpass all those dry and <lb/>
            cautious speakers in force, sublimity, animation, polish, and <lb/>
            structure of periods ? Does he not elevate his style by moral <lb/>
            observations ? Does he not delight in figures ? Does he not <lb/>
            give splendour to his language by metaphors ? Does he not <lb/>
            attribute, by figurative representations, speech to inanimate <lb/>
            objects ? 24. Does not his oath by the defenders of his <lb/>
            country, slain at Marathon and Salamis,* plainly show that <lb/>
            Plato was his master? and shall we call Plato an Asiatic, a <lb/>
            man comparable in so many respects to the bards of old, fired <lb/>
            with divine inspiration? What shall we say of Pericles? <lb/>
            Shall we pronounce him similar to the unadorned Lysias, him <lb/>
            whose energy the comic writers, even while they ridicule him, <lb/>
            compare to thunder and lightning from heaven ?</p>
          <p>So. What is the reason, then, that they imagine the Attic <lb/>
            taste to be apparent in those only who flow, as it were, like a <lb/>
            slender stream of water making its way through pebbles? <lb/>
            What is the reason that they say the odour of thyme arises <lb/>
            only from among them ?† I suppose that if they find in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of those orators any piece of ground more for <lb/>
            tile, or any crop more luxuriant than ordinary, they will deny <lb/>
            that the soil is Attic, because it reproduced more than it has <lb/>
            received, when Menander jestingly says that exact fidelity is <lb/>
            the characteristic of Attic ground.‡ 26. So, if any one shall <lb/>
            add to the excellences which that great orator Demosthenes <lb/>
            had, those which appear, either naturally or by the law of his <lb/>
            country,§ to have been wanting to him, and shall display in <lb/>

            hear some critic say, Demosthenes never did so! Or if any <lb/>

            none ean be, but still if any should,* will it be said that they <lb/>
            are not Attic ? Let these censors judge more favourably of <lb/>
            this distinction, and be convinced that to speak in the Attic style <lb/>
            is to speak in the best style.† 27. And yet I would sooner bear <lb/>
            with Greeks than Latins persisting in this opinion.</p>
          <p>The Latin eloquence, though it appears to me on a level <lb/>
            with the Greek in invention, arrangement, judgment, and <lb/>
            other qualities of that kind, and seems to be, indeed, in all <lb/>
            respects its pupil, yet in regard to elocution, it scarcely has <lb/>
            the power even of imitation; for, first of all, it has more of <lb/>
            harshness in the sound of its words; as we are quite destitute <lb/>
            of two of the most euphonious letters of the Greeks, one a <lb/>
            vowel, the other a consonant,‡ than which indeed none even <lb/>
            of theirs sound more sweetly, and which we are in the habit <lb/>
            of borrowing whenever we adopt any of their words. 28. <lb/>
            When this is the case, our language, I know not how, imme­ <lb/>
            diately assumes a more pleasing tone, as, for example, in <lb/>
            using the words Ephyri § and Zephyri; for if these words are <lb/>
            written in our characters.|| they will give something of a dull <lb/>
            and barbarous sound, as there will be substituted, in the place <lb/>
            of agreeable letters, those harsh repulsive letters with which <lb/>
            Greece is utterly unacquainted. 29. For that which is the <lb/>
            sixth of our letters ¶ requires to be uttered with a voice <lb/>
            scarcely human, or rather not with a voice at all, between <lb/>
            the lower teeth and the upper lips; ** a letter which, even <note type="footnote"> * Si quid exierit numeris aptius; fortasse non possit; sed tamen si <lb/>

            sound, and when it unites with any consonant,* as in the word <lb/>

            also, which we use in saying servus and cervus, though we <lb/>
            reject the shape, yet the sound adheres to us. 30. That letter, ‡ <lb/>
            too, which is of use only for joining vowels that follow it, <lb/>
            being otherwise quite superfluous, forms harsh syllables, as <lb/>
            when we write equos and equum, especially as the two vowels <lb/>
            give such a sound as is quite unknown to the Greeks, and <lb/>
            accordingly cannot be expressed in Greek letters. 31. Besides <lb/>
            we close many of our words with the letter m, which has a <lb/>
            sound something like the lowing of an ox, and in which no <lb/>
            Greek word terminates; since they put in place of it the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>, <lb/>
            which has an agreeable, and, especially at the end of a word, <lb/>
            a kind of ringing sound; a letter which is rarely put at the <lb/>
            close of a word with us. 32. Moreover we have syllables <lb/>
            ending in b and d, so disagreeable, that most even of our old <lb/>
            writers (not indeed our oldest, but still writers of antiquity,) <lb/>
            attempted to soften them, not only by saying aversus for <lb/>
            abversus, but by adding to the b in the preposition an a, which <lb/>
            is itself an unpleasantly sounding letter.</p>
          <p>33. But we find our accents also less agreeable than those <lb/>
            of the Greeks, as well from a certain rigidity in our pronun­ <lb/>
            ciation, ‡ as from want of variety ; for with us the last syllable <lb/>
            of a word is never raised with an acute accent, or flattened <lb/>
            with a circumflex, but a word always ends with one or two <lb/>
            grave accents.§ So much more pleasing, in consequence, is <lb/>
            the Greek tongue than the Latin, that our poets, whenever <lb/>
            they wish their verse to be particularly melodious, grace it with <lb/>
            a number of Greek words. 34. But what is a still stronger proof <lb/>
            of the inferiority of our tongue is, that many things are with­ <note type="footnote"> * Quoties aliquam consonantem frangit.] See note on i. 4, 11. The <lb/>
            sense of the word frango, in such phrases, is, as Soheller observes in <lb/>

            out proper terms,* so that we are obliged to express them by <lb/>
            metaphor or circumlocution; and even in regard to those <lb/>
            which have names, the great poverty of our language very <lb/>
            often forces us upon repetitions, while the Greeks have not <lb/>
            only abundance of words, but even of dialects varying one <lb/>
            from another.</p>
          <p>35. He, therefore, that shall require from the Latin the graces <lb/>
            of the Attic tongue, must give it a similar sweetness of tone, <lb/>
            and a similar abundance of words. If this be impossible, we <lb/>
            must adapt our thoughts to the words which we have, and not <lb/>
            clothe extremely delicate matter in phraseology which is <lb/>
            too strong, not to say too gross, for it, lest the excellences of <lb/>
            both t be diminished by the union. 36. The less able our <lb/>
            language is to assist us, the more efforts we must make in the <lb/>
            production of thought. Sublime and varied conceptions must <lb/>
            be brought forth. Every feeling must be excited, and our <lb/>
            speech illumined by the splendour of metaphor. We cannot <lb/>

            them; let us go beyond them in fulness. 37. The Greek <lb/>

              any shallows; I shall find a part somewhat, though not much <lb/>
              deeper, in which my boat may be in no danger of sinking. <lb/>
              38. For if the Greeks succeed better than we in plainer and <lb/>
              simpler subjects, so that we are beaten on such ground,* and <lb/>
              accordingly in comedy do not even venture to compete with them, <lb/>
              we must not altogether abandon this department of literature, <lb/>
              but must cultivate it as far as we can, and we can, at least, rival <lb/>
              the Greeks in the temper and judgment with which we treat <lb/>
              our subjects; while grace of style, which we have not among <lb/>
              us by nature, must be sought from a foreign source.† 39. Is <lb/>
              not Cicero, in causes of an inferior character, acute and not <lb/>
              inelegant, clear and not unduly elevated? Is not similar <lb/>
              merit remarkable in Marcus Calidius?‡ Were not Scipio, <lb/>
              Lælius, and Cato, the Attics of the Romans, as it were, in <lb/>
              eloquence ? Surely those, then, must satisfy us in that sort of <lb/>
              style, than whom none can be imagined more excellent in it.</p>
          <p>40. I must observe further, that some think there is no <lb/>
            natural eloquence but such as is of a character with the lan­ <lb/>
            guage of ordinary conversation, the language in which we <lb/>
            address our friends, wives, children, and servants, and which <lb/>
            is intended only to express our thoughts, and requires no <lb/>
            foreign or elaborate ornament; they say that all that is super­ <lb/>
            added to such language is mere affectation, and vain ostenta­ <lb/>
            tion of style, at variance with truth, and invented only with a <lb/>
            view to a display of words, to which, they assert, the only <lb/>
            office attributed by nature is to be instrumental in expressing <lb/>
            our thoughts; comparing an eloquent and brilliant style to <lb/>
            the bodies of athletes, which, though they are rendered <lb/>
            stouter by exercise, and by regularity of diet, are yet not in a <lb/>
            natural condition, or in conformity with that appearance which <lb/>
            has been assigned to man. 41. Of what profit is it, they <lb/>
            ask, to clothe our thoughts in circumlocution and metaphor, <lb/>
            that is, in words unnecessarily numerous, and in unnatural <lb/>
            words, when everything has its peculiar term appropriated to <note type="footnote"> * In eoque vincimur solo.] Qu'en oela seul ils l'emportent BUT les <lb/>

            it ? 42. They contend that the most ancient speakers were <lb/>
            most in conformity with nature; and that there subsequently <lb/>
            arose others, with a greater resemblance to the poets, who <lb/>
            showed (less openly, indeed, than the poets, but after the <lb/>
            same fashion,) that they regarded departures from truth and <lb/>
            nature as merits. In this argument there is certainly some <lb/>
            foundation of truth, and accordingly we ought not to depart so <lb/>
            far as some speakers do from exact and ordinary language. <lb/>
            Yet if any orator, as I have said in the part in which I spoke <lb/>
            of composition,. should add something ornamental to that <lb/>
            which is merely necessary, and than which less cannot be <lb/>
            given, he will not be deserving of censure from those who <lb/>
            hold this opinion.</p>
          <p>43. To me, indeed, ordinary discourse, and the language of a <lb/>
            truly eloquent man, appear to be of a different nature; for if <lb/>
            it were sufficient for an orator to express his thoughts plainly, <lb/>
            he would have nothing to study beyond mere suitableness of <lb/>
            words; but since he has to please, to move, and to rouse the <lb/>
            minds of his audience to various states of feeling, he must have <lb/>
            recourse, for those purposes, to the means which are afforded <lb/>
            us by the same nature that supplies us with ordinary speech; <lb/>
            just as we are led by nature to invigorate our muscles with <lb/>
            exercise, to increase our general strength, and to acquire a <lb/>
            healthy complexion. 44. It is from this cause that in all <lb/>
            nations one man is esteemed more eloquent, and more agree­ <lb/>
            able in his mode of expression, than another; for if such were <lb/>
            not the case, all would be on an equality in this respect, <lb/>
            and the same way of speaking would become every man alike; <lb/>
            but, as it is, men speak in different methods,† and preserve a <lb/>
            distinction of character. Thus I conceive that the greater <lb/>
            impression a man produces by his words, the more he speaks <lb/>
            in conformity with the natural intention of eloquence.‡ I, <note type="footnote"> * B. x. c. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> t At loquuntur.] That there is something wrong in these words has <lb/>
            been believed by most editors. But the only correction proposed is <lb/>
            that of Obrecht, at aliter loquuntur. Spalding doubts whether aliter <lb/>
            could thus be used for diversimodè. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Secundum naturam eloquentiæ.] By those who are always talking <lb/>
            of nature it ought to be observed that those only act naturally in <lb/>

            If, therefore, eloquence be anything, they only speak naturally who <lb/>
            speak according to the nature of eloquence. Buttmann. </note> <pb n="443"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH X.]"/><lb/>
            therefore, have not much to say against those who think that <lb/>
            we must accommodate ourselves in some degree to circum­ <lb/>
            stances, and to the ears of audiences that require something <lb/>
            more refined and studied than ordinary language. 45. I am so <lb/>
            far from thinking, therefore, that an orator should be restricted <lb/>
            to the style of those who preceded Cato and the Gracchi, that <lb/>
            I do not consider he should be restricted to the style even of <lb/>
            these. I see that it was the practice of Cicero, though he did <lb/>
            nothing but with a view to the interest of his cause, to study <lb/>
            in some measure the gratification of his audience, saying that <lb/>
            he thus promoted his object, and contributed in the best pos­ <lb/>
            sible way to the success of his client. He in fact profited in <lb/>
            proportion as he pleased. 46. To the attractions of his style <lb/>
            I do not know, for my own part, what can be added, unless <lb/>
            indeed we introduce, to suit modern taste, a few more brilliant <lb/>
            thoughts; for this may certainly be done * without damage to <lb/>
            a cause, and without diminution to the impressiveness of a <lb/>
            pleader, provided that the embellishments be not too numerous <lb/>
            and close together, so as to destroy the effects of each other. <lb/>
            47. But though I am thus far complaisant, let no man press <lb/>
            for any further concession; I allow, in accordance with the <lb/>
            fashion of the day, that the toga should not be of rough wool, <lb/>
            but not that it should be of silk; that the hair should not be <lb/>
            uncut, but not that it should be dressed in stories and ringlets ;t <lb/>
            it being also considered that what is most becoming is also <lb/>
            most elegant, provided that elegance be not carried to the <lb/>
            extent of ostentation and extravagance. 48. But as to what we <lb/>
            call brilliant thoughts, which were not cultivated by the <lb/>
            ancients, and not, above all, by the Greeks, (I find some in <lb/>
            Cicero,) who can deny that they may be of service, provided <lb/>
            that they bear upon the cause, ‡ are not redundant in number, <lb/>
            and tend to secure success ? They strike the mind of the <lb/>
            hearer, they frequently produce a great effect by one impulse ; <note type="footnote"> * The text has Neque enim fieri potest, but Buttmann justly says that <lb/>

            hardly applicable. He is inclined to read dum re contineantur, but <lb/>

            they impress themselves, from being short, more effectually on <lb/>
            the memory; and they persuade while they please.</p>
          <p>49. But there are some, who, though they will allow an orator <lb/>
            to utter such dazzling thoughts, consider that they are wholly to <lb/>
            be excluded from speeches that are written. This is an opi­ <lb/>
            nion, accordingly, which I must not pass unnoticed; as indeed <lb/>
            many men of great learning have thought that the modes of <lb/>
            speaking and writing are essentially different; and that it is <lb/>
            from this cause that some who were highly distinguished for <lb/>
            speaking have left nothing to posterity, nothing in writing that <lb/>
            would be at all lasting, as Pericles* and Demades;t and that <lb/>
            others again, who were excellent in writing, have been unfitted <lb/>
            for speaking, as Isocrates. 50. Besides, they say that impe­ <lb/>
            tuosity, and thoughts merely intended to please, and perhaps <lb/>
            somewhat too boldly hazarded, have often the very greatest <lb/>
            effect in speaking, as the minds of the ignorant part of an <lb/>
            audience must frequently be excited and swayed; but that what <lb/>
            is committed to writing, and published as something good, <lb/>
            ought to be terse and polished, and in conformity with every <lb/>
            law and rule of composition, because it is to come into the <lb/>
            hands of the learned, and to have artists as judges of the art <lb/>
            with which it is executed. 51. These acute teachers (as they <lb/>
            have persuaded themselves, and many others, that they are,‡) <lb/>
            tell us that <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱάδειγμα</foreign>, or "rhetorical induction,” is better <lb/>
            adapted for speaking, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθύμημα</foreign>, or “rhetorical syllo­ <lb/>
            gism,” § for writing. To me it appears that to speak well and <lb/>
            to write well are but the same thing; and that a written ora­ <lb/>
            tion is nothing else but a record of an oration delivered. <lb/>
            Written oratory must accordingly, I think, be susceptible of <lb/>
            every species of excellence; I say every species of excellence, <lb/>
            not every species of fault,|| for I know that what is faulty some­ <note type="footnote"> * III. 1, 12. </note><note type="footnote">t II. 17, IS. </note><note type="footnote">‡ All the texts have Quin illi subtiles, ut similes ac multos persuase­ <lb/>

            than Burmann's conjecture, Quin illi subtiles (ut sibi ac multis persuase­ <lb/>

            times pleases the ignorant. 52. How, then, will what is written <lb/>
            and what is spoken differ ? I reply that if I were to address <lb/>
            myself to a tribunal composed only of wise men,* I would cut <lb/>
            off much from the speeches, not only of Cicero, but even of <lb/>
            Demosthenes, who is much less verbose; for, in speaking to <lb/>
            such an audience, there will be no necessity for exciting the <lb/>
            feelings, or for soothing the ear with delight; since Aristotle† <lb/>
            thinks that in such a case even exordia are superfluous, as <lb/>
            wise men will not be moved by them; and to state the subject <lb/>
            in proper and significant words, and establish proofs, will be <lb/>
            sufficient. 53. But when the people, or some of the people, <lb/>
            are before us as judges, and when illiterate persons, and even <lb/>
            ploughmen, are to pass sentence, every art which we think <lb/>
            likely to conduce to the attainment of the object which we <lb/>
            have in view, must be employed ; and such arts are to be dis­ <lb/>
            played not only when we speak, but when we write, that we may <lb/>
            show how the speech should be spoken. 54. Would Demosthenes <lb/>
            have spoken badly in speaking exactly as he wrote, or would <lb/>
            Cicero ? Or do we know them to have been excellent orators <lb/>
            from any other source than from their writings? Did they <lb/>
            speak, we may ask, better than they wrote, or worse ? if worse, <lb/>
            they ought to have spoken as they wrote; if better, they ought <lb/>
            to have written as they spoke.</p>
          <p>55. What, then, it may be said, shall an orator always <lb/>
            speak just as he will write ? If possible, I answer, always <lb/>
            But if the time allow ed by the judge prevents him from doing <lb/>
            so by its shortness, much that might have been said will be <lb/>
            withheld; but the speech, if published, will contain the whole. <lb/>
            But what may have been introduced to suit the capacity of the <lb/>
            judges, will not be transmitted unaltered to posterity, lest it be <lb/>
            thought to be the offspring of his judgment, and not a conces­ <lb/>
            sion to circumstances. 56. For it is of the greatest importance <lb/>
            to a pleader to know to what the judge may be disposed to <lb/>
            listen; and the judge's look, as Cicero directs,‡ must often be <lb/>
            the orator's guide We must consequently dwell upon those <lb/>
            points which we observe to give him satisfaction, and touch but <lb/>
            lightly on those to which he seems averse. The very style <lb/>
            that is most desirable is such as will render us most easily <lb/>
            intelligible to the judge. Nor is this at all surprising, when <note type="footnote"> * See ii. 17, 28; iiL 8, 2; iv. 1, 21. </note><note type="footnote">† See iv. 1, 72. </note><note type="footnote">‡ No one has as yet pointed out the passage in Cicero. Buttmann. </note> <pb n="446"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            many things are altered in our language merely to suit too <lb/>
            characters of witnesses. 67. Thus the orator who had asked <lb/>
            an illiterate witness, whether he knew Amphion, and he had <lb/>
            answered that he did not, acted wisely in taking away the <lb/>
            aspiration, and shortening the second syllable of the name, <lb/>
            when the witness replied that he knew him very well. Occur­ <lb/>
            rences such as these often make us speak otherwise than we <lb/>
            write, it being impossible to speak exactly as we write.</p>
          <p>58. There is another mode of characterizing style, which <lb/>
            also resolves itself into three divisions,. and by which the dif. <lb/>
            ferent forms of eloquence seem to be very well distinguished <lb/>
            one from another. One style, according to this method, the <lb/>
            Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσχνόν</foreign>, or plain; another they term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδϱόν</foreign>, or grand <lb/>
            and energetic; and a third which they have added, some call a <lb/>
            mean between these two, others the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθηϱόν</foreign>, or florid style. <lb/>
            69. Of these the nature is such that the first seems adapted to <lb/>
            the duty of stating facts, the second to that of moving the <lb/>
            feelings, and the third, by whichsoever name it be designated, <lb/>
            to that of pleasing, or conciliating; as perspicuity seems neces­ <lb/>
            sary for instructing, gentleness of manner for conciliating, and <lb/>
            energy for exciting the hearer.</p>
          <p>It is accordingly in the plain sort of style that narrative and <lb/>
            proofs will be stated; a style which, requiring no assistance <lb/>
            from other qualities of diction,! is complete in its own kind. <lb/>
            60. The middle sort will abound more with metaphors, and be <lb/>
            rendered more attractive by figures of speech ; it will seek to <lb/>
            please by digressions; it will be elegant in phraseology, with <lb/>
            perfectly natural thoughts, but flowing gently, like a clear <lb/>
            stream overshadowed on either side by banks of green wood. <lb/>
            61. But the energetic style will resemble an impetuous torrent, <lb/>
            which carries away rocks, disdains a bridge, ‡ and makes banks <lb/>
            for itself; it will impel the judge, even though he strive against <lb/>
            it, whithersoever it pleases, and oblige him to take the course <lb/>
            into which it hurries him. An orator who employs this style <lb/>
            will evoke the dead, as Appius Cæcus ; § in the speeches of <lb/>
            such an orator his country will lament, and sometimes call <note type="footnote"> * See sections 16, 18. </note><note type="footnote"> t Detractis ceteris Requiring nothing either from the <lb/>

            upon him as she calls upon Cicero in his speech against <lb/>
            Catiline in the senate.* 62. Such an orator will elevate his <lb/>
            oratory with amplification, and rise into hyperbole: What <lb/>
            Charybdis was ever so insatiable ? and, The Ocean itself. <lb/>
            assuredly, † &amp;c.; for these striking passages are well known to <lb/>
            the studious. Such an orator will bring down the gods them­ <lb/>
            selves to form portion of his audience, and almost to take part <lb/>
            in what he says: For you, 0 A lban hills and groves, you, 0 <lb/>
            ruined altars of the Albans, united and coeval with the sacred <lb/>
            rites of the Roman people,‡ &amp;c. Such an orator will inspire <lb/>
            his hearers with rage or pity; he will say, He saw you, called <lb/>
            upon you, and wept; § and the judge, excited with every <lb/>
            variety of emotion, will follow the speaker hither and thither, <lb/>
            without requiring any proof of what is stated.</p>
          <p>63. If, then, it were necessary to choose one of these three <lb/>
            kinds, who would hesitate to prefer to the others that which, <lb/>
            besides being in other respects the most effective, is also best <lb/>
            suited to the most important causes ? 64. Homer || has <lb/>
            attributed to Menelaus a style of eloquence agreeably concise, <lb/>
            appropriate, (for such is the quality meant by not mistaking in <lb/>
            words, ¶) and free from superfluity; and these are the merits <lb/>
            of our first species of eloquence; from the mouth of Nestor he <lb/>
            says.. that language sweeter than honey flowed, than which no <note type="footnote"> * See Cic. in Catil. i. 7. The text has aliquandoque Ciceronem in <lb/>

            When Atreus' son harangued the listening train, <lb/>
            Just was his sense, and his expression plain, <lb/>
            His words succinct, yet full, without a fault; <lb/>
            He spoke no more than just the thing he ought. <lb/>
            But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound, <lb/>
            His modest eyes he fix'd upon the ground ; <lb/>
            As one unskiU'd or dumb, he seemed to stand, <lb/>
            Nor rais'd his head, nor stretch'd his sceptred hand ; <lb/>
            But, when he speaks, what elocution flows; <lb/>
            Soft as the fleeces of descending snows, <lb/>
            The copious accents fall, with easy art; <lb/>
            Melting they fall, and sink into the heart. </note> <pb n="448"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            greater sweetness can certainly be imagined; but desiring to <lb/>
            give a notion of the highest power of eloquence in Ulysses, he <lb/>
            has given him grandeur, and ascribed to him language equal in <lb/>
            copiousness and continuity of flow to showers of snow in winter. <lb/>
            65. With him, therefore, as he adds. no mortal will contend, <lb/>
            such an orator men will venerate as a god. Such is the force <lb/>
            and impetuosity which Eupolis admires in Pericles,* and <lb/>
            which Aristophanes compares to thunder and lightning. Such <lb/>
            is the power of true eloquence.</p>
          <p>66. But neither is- eloquence confined to these three kinds <lb/>
            of style; for as a third kind has its place between the simple <lb/>
            and the energetic, so there are degrees in each of those kindf, <lb/>
            and between any two of those degrees there is something <lb/>
            intermediate partaking of the nature of each. 67. There is <lb/>
            something fuller, and something more simple, than the simple <lb/>
            kind; there is something more gentle, and more energetic, <lb/>
            than the energetic kind ; and the middle kind both rises to <lb/>
            what is stronger, and stoops to what is weaker. Thus almost <lb/>
            innumerable species are found, which are distinguished from <lb/>
            each other at least by some shade of difference ; as we are told, <lb/>
            generally, that the four winds blow from the four cardinal <lb/>
            points of the heaven, though there are often observed many <lb/>
            winds between those points, and many peculiar to certain coun­ <lb/>
            tries and even to certain rivers. 68. The case, too, is similar <lb/>
            with regard to the practice of musicians, who, after making <lb/>
            five principal notes on the lyre, fill up the intervals between <lb/>
            them with a great variety of other notes, and then, again, <lb/>
            insert others between those which they have previously in­ <lb/>
            sorted ; so that those main divisions admit many intermediate <lb/>
            degrees of sound.</p>
          <p>69. There are, therefore, many species of eloquence, but it <lb/>
            would be extremely foolish to inquire which of them an orator <lb/>
            should follow, since every species, if it be but of a genuine <lb/>
            character, has its use, and all that people commonly call ways <lb/>
            of speaking falls under the management of the orator; for he <lb/>
            will employ every variety of speech so as to suit, not merely <lb/>
            any particular cause, but particular parts of any cause. 70. <lb/>
            Thus he will not speak in the same strain in defence of a man <lb/>
            who is accused of a capital crime, in a suit respecting an in­ <lb/>
            neritance, and in cases of interdicts, sponsions,t and loans; to <note type="footnote"> * See ii. 16,19; x. 1, 82. </note><note type="footnote">t See ii. 10, 5; iv. 2, 61. </note> <pb n="449"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH X.]"/><lb/>
            will observe distinctions between the delivery of opinions in <lb/>
            the senate, in the assembly of the people, and in private deli­ <lb/>
            berations ; he will vary his style greatly in conformity with the <lb/>
            difference of persons, occasions, and places; he will adopt <lb/>
            different arts for conciliating, even in the same speech;. he will <lb/>
            not try to excite anger and pity by dwelling on similar topics; <lb/>
            he will employ one style to state his case to the judge, and <lb/>
            another to move the judge's feelings. 71. The same colour <lb/>
            of diction will not be observable in his exordium, his state­ <lb/>
            ment of facts, his arguments, his digressions, and his perora­ <lb/>
            tion. He will be able to speak gravely, austerely, sharply, <lb/>
            strongly, spiritedly, copiously, bitterly, affably, gently, artfully, <lb/>
            soothingly, mildly, agreeably, succinctly, politely; he will not <lb/>
            be always alike, yet always consistent with himself. 72. Thus <lb/>
            he will not only attain that object for which the use of <lb/>
            speech was chiefly intended; I mean, that of speaking to the <lb/>
            purpose, and with ability sufficient to establish that which he <lb/>
            has in view ; but he will also obtain applause, not merely from <lb/>
            the learned, but even from the common people.</p>
          <p>73. They indeed are greatly deceived, who imagine that a <lb/>
            vicious and corrupt style of eloquence, which exults in a licen­ <lb/>
            tious kind of diction, wantons in puerile fancies, swells with <lb/>
            inordinary tumour, expatiates on empty common-places, decks <lb/>
            itself with flowers that will fall if they are in the slightest <lb/>
            degree shaken, prefers extravagance to sublimity, or raves <lb/>
            madly under the pretext of freedom, will be the most gratify­ <lb/>
            ing to the people, and most likely to gain applause. 74. That <lb/>
            such a style does however please many, I do not deny, nor do <lb/>
            I wonder; for eloquence of any kind whatsoever is pleasing to <lb/>
            the ear, and likely to be favourably heard; all exertion of the <lb/>
            human voice naturally draws the mind with a pleasing kind of <lb/>
            attraction; it is from no other cause that there are such <lb/>
            groups of listeners in market-places and cause-ways ;† and it <note type="footnote"> * In eddem oratione aliter conciliabit.] Rollin considers that some­ <lb/>

            is therefore the less surprising that for every pleader a ring of <lb/>
            the rabble is ready. 75. But when anything more happily <lb/>
            expressed than ordinary falls upon the ears of the illiterate, of <lb/>
            whatever kind it be, provided that they themselves cannot <lb/>
            hope to speak equally well, it gains their admiration; and not <lb/>
            without reason ; for even to speak just beyond the capacity of <lb/>
            the uneducated is not easy. Such moderate excellence, how­ <lb/>
            ever, fades and dies away when it is compared with anything <lb/>
            better; as wool dyed red pleases, says Ovid, in the absence <lb/>
            of purple, but if it be contrasted even with the purple of a <lb/>
            common riding-cloak,* it will be thrown into the shade by the <lb/>
            presence of something brighter than itself. 76. If, again, we apply <lb/>
            the light of a keen judgment to such tasteless eloquence, as <lb/>
            that of sulphur to inferior dye, it will immediately lose the <lb/>
            false lustre, with which it had deceived the eye, and grow pale <lb/>
            with an indescribable deformity. Such eloquence will accord <lb/>
            ingly shine only in the absence of the sun, as certain small <lb/>
            animals appear to be little fires in the darkness. In short, <lb/>
            many admire what is bad, but none condemn what is good.</p>
          <p>77. But the orator must do all that I have mentioned not <lb/>
            only in the best manner, but also with the greatest ease ; for <lb/>
            the utmost power of eloquence will deserve no admiration if <lb/>
            unhappy anxiety perpetually attends it, and harasses and wears <lb/>
            out the orator, while he is laboriously altering his words, and <lb/>
            wasting his life in weighing and putting them together. 78. <lb/>
            The true orator, elegant, sublime, and rich, commands copious <lb/>
            materials of eloquence pouring in upon him from all sides. He <lb/>
            that has reached the summit, ceases to struggle up the steep. <lb/>
            79. Difficulty is for him who is making his way and is not <lb/>
            far from the bottom; but the more he advances, the easier <lb/>
            will be the ascent, and the more verdant the soil; and if, <lb/>
            with persevering efforts, he pass also these gentler slopes, <lb/>
            fruits will spontaneously present themselves, and all kinds of <lb/>
            flowers will spring up before him, which however, unless they <lb/>
            are daily plucked, will be sure to wither. Yet even copious- <note type="footnote"> Aggere in aprico spatiari, where the public path or road on the <lb/>
            Esquiline hill is meant; see also Juv. v. 153. </note><note type="footnote"> * Si contuderis etiam lacernæ.] I know not what other turn can be <lb/>
            given to these words than I have given, if we retain etiam. Dan. <lb/>

            These words are from some lost portion of Ovid's works. </note> <pb n="451"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="CH XI.]"/><lb/>
            ness should be under the control of judgment, without which <lb/>
            nothing will be either praiseworthy or beneficial; elegance <lb/>
            should have a certain manly air, and good taste should attend <lb/>
            on invention. 80. Thus what the orator produces will be <lb/>
            great, without extravagance; sublime, without audacity; ener <lb/>
            getic, without rashness, severe, without repulsiveness; grave, <lb/>
            without dulness; plenteous, without exuberance; pleasing. <lb/>
            without meretriciousness; grand, without tumidity. Such <lb/>
            judgment will be shown with regard to other qualities; and <lb/>
            the path in the middle is generally the safest, because error <lb/>
            lies on either side.</p>

            far as nature will allow, that he has specified, 8—20. He proves, <lb/>
            from the examples of great men, how much may be done, and <lb/>
            observes that even moderate attainments in eloquence are attended <lb/>

          <p>I THE orator, after displaying these excellences of elo­ <lb/>
            quence on trials, in councils, at the assemblies of the people, <lb/>
            in the senate, and in every province of a good citizen, will <lb/>
            think of bringing his labours to an end worthy of an honour­ <lb/>
            able man and a noble employment, not because it is ever time <lb/>
            to leave off doing good, or because it is not proper for one <lb/>
            endowed with such understanding and talents to spend the <lb/>
            longest possible time in so dignified an occupation, but because <lb/>
            it becomes him to take care that he may not speak worse than <lb/>
            he has been in the habit of speaking. 2. The orator does not­ <lb/>
            depend merely on knowledge, which increases with years, but <lb/>
            on strength of voice, lungs, and constitution, and if these are <lb/>
            weakened or impaired by age or in-health, he must beware lest <lb/>
            something of his usual excellence be missed lest he should be <lb/>
            obliged to stop from fatigue, lest he should perceive that what <lb/>
            he says is imperfectly heard, and lest he sht uld not recognize <note type="footnote"> G G 2 </note> <pb n="452"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            his former in his present self. 3. I myself saw Domitius <lb/>
            Afer, by far the most eminent orator of all whom it has been <lb/>
            my fortune to know, losing daily, at an advanced period of life, <lb/>
            something of the authority which he had so justly acquired; <lb/>
            since when he, who had doubtless once been the prince of the <lb/>
            forum, was speaking, some (what may well be thought dis­ <lb/>
            graceful) laughed, while others blushed for him; and his <lb/>
            inefficiency gave occasion to the remark, that he. had rather <lb/>
            faint than leave off.. Yet his pleading, such as it was, was <lb/>
            not bad, but inferior in energy to what it had been. 4. The <lb/>
            orator, therefore, before he falls into the grasp of old age, will <lb/>
            do well to sound a retreat, and gain the harbour while his <lb/>
            vessel is still undamaged.</p>
          <p>Nor, when he has done so, will less honourable advantages <lb/>
            from his acquirements attend on him. He will transmit the <lb/>
            history of his own times to posterity, or, as Lucius Crassus, <lb/>
            in the books of Cicero,t expresses his intention to do, will ex­ <lb/>
            plain points of law to those who consult him, or will compose <lb/>
            a treatise on eloquence, or will set forth the finest precepts of <lb/>
            morality in a style worthy of the subject.‡ 5. In the mean­ <lb/>
            time well-disposed youth, as was customary with the ancients, <lb/>
            will frequent his house, and will consult him, as an oracle, on <lb/>
            the best mode of attaining eloquence; and he, as a father in <lb/>
            the art, will form them, and, as an old pilot on the ocean of <lb/>
            oratory, will give them instruction respecting coasts and har­ <lb/>
            hours, and show them what are the signs of tempests, and <lb/>
            what management a ship may require under favourable or <lb/>
            adverse winds ;§ being induced to do so, not only by the <lb/>
            common obligations of humanity, but by his love for his pro­ <lb/>
            fession ; for no man would like that art, in which he himself <lb/>
            has been great, to fall into decay. 6. What, indeed, can be <lb/>
            more honourable to a man, than to teach that of which he <note type="footnote"> * Malle eum deficere quàm desinere.] Seneca, Controv. i. 8 : Optimus <lb/>

            himself has a thorough knowledge? It was thus that Cicero* <lb/>
            says Cælius was brought to him by his father; and it was <lb/>
            thus that, like a master, he exercised Pansa, Hirtius, and <lb/>
            Dolabella,t daily speaking and listening to them. 7. And I <lb/>
            know not whether an orator ought not to be thought happiest <lb/>
            at that period of his life, when, sequestered from the world, <lb/>
            devoted to retired study, unmolested by envy, and remote <lb/>
            from strife, he has placed his reputation in a harbour of safety; <lb/>
            experiencing, while yet alive, that respect which is more <lb/>
            commonly offered after death, and observing how his character <lb/>
            will be regarded among posterity.</p>
          <p>8. For my own part, I know that, as far as I could, with my <lb/>
            moderate ability, I have imparted, candidly and ingenuously, <lb/>
            whatever I previously knew, and whatever I could discover in <lb/>
            furtherance of my present work, for the improvement of such as <lb/>
            might wish to learn ; and it is enough for an honourable man <lb/>
            to have taught what he knows. 9. Yet I fear lest I may be <lb/>
            thought, not only to require too much in expecting a man to <lb/>
            be at once good and eloquent, but also to specify too many <lb/>
            qualifications, by giving, in addition to so many accomplish <lb/>
            ments necessary to be gained in youth, precepts on morals, <lb/>
            and enjoining a knowledge of civil law, not to mention the <lb/>
            rules which I have laid down concerning eloquence; and I am <lb/>
            apprehensive lest even those who allow that all these require­ <lb/>
            ments were necessary to my design, should nevertheless dread <lb/>
            them as too oppressive, and despair of fulfilling them before <lb/>
            they proceed to a trial. 10. But let those who think thus, reflect, <lb/>
            in the first place, how great the power of the human mind is, <lb/>
            and how capable of accomplishing whatever it makes its object; <lb/>
            since even arts of less importance than oratory, though more <lb/>
            difficult of attainment, have been able to effect voyages over <lb/>
            the ocean, to discover the courses and number of the stars, and <lb/>
            to measure almost the whole universe. Next let them consider <lb/>
            how honourable is the end which they desire to attain, and that <lb/>
            no labour should be spared when such a reward is in view. <lb/>
            11. If they allow such conceptions to have due weight with <lb/>
            them, they will the more easily be induced to believe that the <note type="footnote"> * Orat. pro Cælio, c. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> t Cic. ad Div. ix. 16, though Pansa is not mentioned there. See <lb/>
            also Quint. vii. 3, 54; Suet de Clar. Rhet. sub init.; Sen. Controv. L <lb/>
            Proem. Buttmann. </note> <pb n="454"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            way to eloquence is not impracticable, or indeed extremely <lb/>
            difficult; for that which is the first and more important point, <lb/>
            that an orator should be a good man, depends chiefly on the <lb/>
            will; and he who shall sincerely cherish a resolution to be <lb/>
            good, will easily attain those qualifications that support virtue. <lb/>
            12. The duties incumbent upon us* are not so complex or so <lb/>
            numerous, that they may not be learned by the application of <lb/>
            a very few years.- What makes it so long a labour, is our own <lb/>
            reluctance ; the ordering of an upright and happy life is but a <lb/>
            short task, if we but give our inclination to it. Nature formed <lb/>
            us for attaining the highest degree of virtue; and so easy is it, <lb/>
            for those who are well disposed, to learn what is good, that to <lb/>
            him who looks fairly on the world, it is rather surprising that <lb/>
            there should be so many bad men. 13. As water, indeed, is <lb/>
            suitable to fishes, as the dry land to terrestrial animals, and <lb/>
            the air that surrounds us to birds, so it ought to be more <lb/>
            agreeable to us to live conformably to nature than at variance <lb/>
            with her.</p>
          <p>As to other qualifications, although we should include in our <lb/>
            estimate of life, not the years of old age, but merely those <lb/>
            of youth and manhood, it is apparent that there is time enough <lb/>
            for acquiring them; for order, and method, and judgment, <lb/>
            will shorten all labour. 14. But the fault lies, first, with <lb/>
            teachers, who love to retain under them those whom they have <lb/>
            taken in hand, partly from covetousness, in order to be longer <lb/>
            in receipt of fees, partly from vanity, to make it appear that <lb/>
            what they profess is very difficult, and partly perhaps from <lb/>
            ignorance or neglect of the proper mode of teaching; and, <lb/>
            secondly, in ourselves, who are fonder of dwelling on what we <lb/>
            have learned than of learning what we do not yet know. 15. For, <lb/>
            co confine myself chiefly to oratorical studies, of what advantage <lb/>
            is it to declaim so many years in the schools as is customary <lb/>
            with many, (to say nothing of those by whom a great portion <lb/>
            of life is wasted in that exercise,) and to bestow so much labour <lb/>
            on imaginary subjects, when it is possible to gain, in but a <lb/>
            short time, a sufficient notion of real pleading, and of the rules <lb/>
            of oratory? 16. In making this remark, I do not intimate <lb/>
            that exercise in speaking should ever be discontinued, but <lb/>
            only signify that we should not grow old in one species of <note type="footnote"> * Neque enim—tam numerosa sunt quæ premunt.] For premunt Butt­ <lb/>
            mann would read præcipiuntur. </note> <pb n="455"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            exercise. We may be gaining general knowledge, learning <lb/>
            the duties of ordinary life, and trying our strength in the <lb/>
            forum, while we are still scholars.- The course of study is <lb/>
            such, that it does not require many years; for any of those <lb/>
            sciences, to which I have just alluded,! may be comprised in <lb/>
            a few treatises, so far are they from requiring infinite time and <lb/>
            application. All else depends on practice, which will soon <lb/>
            increase our ability. 17. Our knowledge of things in general <lb/>
            will daily increase ; though it must be admitted that the <lb/>
            perusal of many books, by means of which examples of things <lb/>
            may be gained from historians, and of eloquence from orators, <lb/>
            is necessary for great advancement in it. It is requisite also <lb/>
            that we should read, as well as some other things, the opinions <lb/>
            of philosophers and eminent lawyers.</p>
          <p>All this knowledge we may acquire; but it is we ourselves <lb/>
            that make time short. 18. For how much time do we seriously <lb/>
            devote to study ? The empty ceremony of paying visits ‡ steals <lb/>
            some of our hours, leisure wasted in idle conversation others, <lb/>
            public spectacles and entertainments others. Take into con­ <lb/>
            sideration also our great variety of private amusements, and <lb/>
            the extravagant care which we bestow on our persons; let <lb/>
            travelling, excursions into the country, anxious meditations on <lb/>
            our losses and gains,§ a thousand incentives to the gratification <lb/>
            of the passions, wine, and the corruption of the mind with every <lb/>
            species of pleasure, claim their several portions of our time; <lb/>
            and not even that which remains will find us in a proper con­ <lb/>
            dition for study. 19. But if all these hours were allotted to <lb/>
            study, our life would seem long enough, and our time amply <lb/>
            sufficient, for learning, even if we take into account only our <lb/>
            days; while our nights, of which a great part is more than <lb/>
            enough for all necessary sleep, would add to our improvement <lb/>
            We now compute, not how many years we have studied, but how <lb/>
            many we have lived. 20. Nor, if geometricians and gram­ <lb/>
            marians, and professors of other sciences, have spent all their <lb/>
            lives, however long they were, in their respective pursuits, <note type="footnote"> * See c. 6, sect. 6. </note><note type="footnote">t Sect. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> t Salutandi.] Visits of ceremony, to pay respect to great men, which <lb/>
            were made in the morning. See Virg. Georg. ii. 461: Ingentem foribus <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[B XII."/><lb/>
            does it follow that we should require several lives to learn <lb/>
            several sciences ; for they did not continue adding to their <lb/>
            knowledge in these sciences to the time of old age, but were <lb/>
            content with having merely learned them, and spent that <lb/>
            great number of years rather in practising than in acquiring.</p>
          <p>21. To say nothing of Homer, in whom either instruction, <lb/>
            or at least indisputable indications of knowledge in every kind <lb/>
            of art are to be found; to make no mention of Hippias of <lb/>
            Elis, who not only professed a knowledge of every liberal <lb/>
            science, but used to have his dress, and ring, and shoes, all <lb/>
            made with his own hand, and had so qualified himself as to <lb/>
            require no one's assistance in anything;* Gorgias,† even in <lb/>
            extreme old age, was accustomed to ask his auditors in his <lb/>
            lecture-room to name the subject on which they wished him to <lb/>
            speak. 22. What knowledge, of any value for literature, was <lb/>
            wanting in Plato ? How many lives did Aristotle spend in <lb/>
            learning, so as not only to embrace within his knowledge all <lb/>
            that relates to philosophers and orators, but to make researches <lb/>
            into the nature of all animals and plants ? Those great men <lb/>
            had to discover branches of knowledge which we have only to <lb/>
            learn. Antiquity has provided us with so many teachers, and <lb/>
            so many models, that no age can be imagined more eligible <lb/>
            for us, in regard to being born in it,‡ than our own, for the <lb/>
            instruction of which preceding ages have toiled.</p>
          <p>23. If we look to our own countrymen, we see that Marcus Cato <lb/>
            the Censor, an orator, a writer of history, eminently skilled alike <lb/>
            in law and agriculture, amidst so many occupations in war, and so <lb/>
            many contentions at home, and in an unpolished age, learned the <lb/>
            Greek language in the very decline of life, as if to give an example <lb/>
            to mankind that even old men may acquire what they desire to <lb/>
            learn. 24. How much has Varro told us, or, let us rather <lb/>
            say, has he not told us almost everything ? What qualification <lb/>
            for speaking was deficient in Cicero ? But why should I <lb/>
            multiply examples, when even Cornelius Celsus, a man of but <note type="footnote"> * Cic. de Orate iii. 32. </note><note type="footnote"> t Buttmann very justly remarks that he does not see why Quintilian <lb/>
            should pass over Homer and Hippias, to fix, as it were, upon Gorgias; <lb/>
            and therefore thinks that there must be some corruption in the text. <lb/>
            He proposes, accordingly, to read, instead of what we now have, ut <lb/>
            Gorgiam (sc. transeam), qui summæ senectutis, &amp;c., qux tandem ars — <lb/>
            Platoni defuit? This would be a great improvement. </note><note type="footnote"> t Sorte nascendi.] Non omni sorte, sed ea quâ nascimur. Buttmann. </note> <pb n="457"/>

            moderate ability,. has not only written on all literary studies, <lb/>
            but has besides left treatises on the military art on husbandry, <lb/>
            and on medicine ? Well worthy was he. if only for the extent <lb/>
            of his design, to enjoy the credit of having known everything <lb/>
            on which he wrote.</p>
          <p>25. But, it may be said, to accomplish such a task is <lb/>
            difficult, and no one has accomplished it. I answer, that in <lb/>
            the first place, it is sufficient for encouragement in study, to <lb/>
            know that it is not a law of nature that what has not been <lb/>
            done cannot be done; and, in the second, that everything <lb/>
            great and admirable had some peculiar time at which it was <lb/>
            brought to its highest excellence. 26. Whatever lustre poetry <lb/>
            received from Homer and Virgil, eloquence received equal <lb/>
            lustre from Demosthenes and Cicero. Whatever is best, had <lb/>
            at one time no existence. But though a man despair of <lb/>
            reaching the highest excellence, (and yet why should he despair <lb/>
            who has genius, health, aptitude, and teachers?) yet it is <lb/>
            honourable, as Cicero says, † to gain a place in the second or <lb/>
            third rank. 27. If a man cannot attain the glory of Achilles <lb/>
            in war, he is not, therefore, to despise the merit of Ajax or <lb/>
            Diomede; if he cannot rival the fame of Homer, he is not to <lb/>
            contemn that of Tyrtæus. If men, indeed, had been inclined <lb/>
            to think that no one would be better than he who was best at <lb/>
            any given time, those who are now accounted best would never <lb/>
            have distinguished themselves; Virgil would not have written <lb/>
            after Lucretius and Macer; ‡ Cicero would not have pleaded <lb/>
            after Crassus and Hortensius; nor would others, in other <lb/>
            pursuits, have excelled their predecessors.</p>
          <p>28. Even though there be no hope of excelling the greatest <lb/>
            masters of eloquence, it is yet a great honour to follow closely <lb/>
            behind them. Did Pollio and Messala, who began to plead <lb/>
            when Cicero held the highest place in eloquence, attain but <lb/>
            little estimation during their lives, or transmit but little repu­ <lb/>
            tation to posterity ? The advancement of the arts to the high­ <lb/>
            est possible excellence would be but an unhappy service to <lb/>
            mankind, if what was best at any particular moment was to be <note type="footnote"> * See x. 1, 24. That the judgment of Quintilian on Celsus may not <lb/>
            appear too unfavourable to those who have given their attention to <lb/>

            the last.- 29. It may be added, that moderate attainments in <lb/>
            eloquence are productive of great profit; and, if an orator esti <lb/>
            mates his studies merely by the advantage to be derived from <lb/>
            them, the gain from inferior oratory is almost equal to that <lb/>
            from the best. It would be no difficult matter to show, as well <lb/>
            from ancient as from modem instances, that from no other <lb/>
            pursuit has greater wealth, honour, and friendship, greater <lb/>
            present and future fame, resulted to those engaged in it, than <lb/>
            from that of the orator, were it not dishonourable to learning <lb/>
            to look for such inferior recompence from one of the noblest of <lb/>
            studies, of which the mere pursuit and acquirement confer on <lb/>
            us an ample reward for our labour; for to be thus mercenary <lb/>
            would be to resemble those philosophers t who say that virtue <lb/>
            is not the object of their pursuit, but the pleasure that arises <lb/>
            from virtue.</p>
          <p>30. Let us then pursue, with our whole powers, the true dignity <lb/>
            of eloquence, than which the immortal gods have given nothing <lb/>
            better to mankind, and without which all nature would be <lb/>
            mute, and all our acts would be deprived alike of present <lb/>
            honour and of commemoration among posterity; and let us <lb/>
            aspire to the highest excellence, for, by this means, we shall <lb/>
            either attain the summit, or at least see many below us.</p>
          <p>31. Such were the observations, Marcellus Victor, from which <lb/>
            thought that the art of oratory might, as far as was in my <lb/>
            power, derive some assistance from me; and attention to what <lb/>
            I have said, if it does not bring great advantage to studious <lb/>
            youth, will at least excite in them, what I desire even more, a <lb/>
            love for doing well. <note type="footnote"> * All the texts have si, quod optimum fuisset, defuisset. My transit <lb/>
