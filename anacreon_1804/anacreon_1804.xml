          </ab>
          <p>THERE is little known with certainty <lb/>
            of the life of Anacreon. Chamaeleon Hera­ <lb/>
            cleotes,* who wrote upon the subject, has <lb/>
            been lost in the general wreck of ancient <lb/>
            literature. The editors of the poet have <lb/>
            collected the few trifling anecdotes, which <lb/>
            are scattered through the extant authors of <lb/>
            antiquity, and supplying the deficiency of <lb/>
            materials by fictions of their own imagina­ <lb/>
            tion, they have arranged, what they call, a <lb/>
            life of Anacreon. These specious fabrica­ <lb/>
            tions are intended to indulge that interest <lb/>
            which we naturally feel in the biography of <note type="footnote"> * He is quoted by Athenseus it <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">τω ω̄ερι</foreign></hi> <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ</foreign>« <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναϰρςοντος</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            illustrious men; but it is rather a dangerous <lb/>
            kind of illusion, as it confounds the limits <lb/>
            of history and romancer and is too often <lb/>
            supported by unfaithful citation. †</p>
          <p>Our poet was born in the city of Teos, <lb/>
            in the delicious region of Ionia, where every <lb/>
            thing respired voluptuousness·‡ The time <note type="footnote"> * The History of Anacreon, by Monsieur Ga&lt;;on <lb/>
            (le poete sans fard), is professedly a romance; nor <lb/>
            does Mademoiselle Scuderi, from whom he borrowed <lb/>
            the idea, pretend to historical veracity in her account <lb/>
            of Anacreon and Sappho. These, then, are allowable. <lb/>
            But how can Barnes be forgiven, who, with all the <lb/>
            confidence of a biographer, traces every wandering <lb/>
            of the poet, and settles him in his old age at a country <lb/>
            villa near Teos ? </note><note type="footnote"> t The learned Monsieur Bayle has detected some <lb/>
            infidelities of quotation in Le Fevre. See Dictionaire <lb/>
            Historique, &amp;c. Madame Dacier is notmore accurate <lb/>
            than her father: they have almost made Anacreon <lb/>
            prime minister to the monarch of Samos. </note> <note type="footnote"> t The Asiatics were as remarkable for genius as for <lb/>
            luxury. " Ingenia Asiatica inclyta per gentes fecere <lb/>

            of his birth appears to have been in the sixth <lb/>
            century before Christ, and he flourished <lb/>
            at that remarkable period, when, under the <lb/>
            polished tyrants Hipparchus and Polycrates, <lb/>
            Athens and Samos were the rival asylums of <lb/>
            genius. The name of his father is doubt­ <lb/>
            ful, and therefore cannot be very interesting. <lb/>
            His family was, perhaps, illustrious; but <lb/>
            those who discover in Plato that he was a <lb/>
            descendant of the monarch Codrus, exhibit, <lb/>
            as usual, more zeal than accuracy. t <note type="footnote">* I have not attempted to define the particular <lb/>
            Olympiad, but have adopted the idea of Bayle, who <lb/>
            says, u Je n'ai point marque d'Olympiade; car pour <lb/>
            un homme qui a vec<foreign xml:lang="grc">ιι</foreign> 85 ans, il me semble que l'on <lb/>
            ne doit point s'enfermer dans des bornes si etroites." </note><note type="footnote"> t This mistake is founded on a false interpretation <lb/>
            of a very obvious passage in Plato's Dialogue on <lb/>
            Temperance; it originated with Madame Dacier, <lb/>
            and has been received implicitly by many. Gail, a <lb/>
            late editor of Anacreon, seems to claim to himself <lb/>
            the merit of detecting this error; but Bayle had <lb/>
            observed it before him. </note> <pb n="20"/>
            </p>
          <p>The disposition and talents of Anacreon <lb/>
            recommended him to the monarch of Samos, <lb/>
            and he was formed to be the friend of such <lb/>
            a prince as Polycrates. Susceptible only <lb/>
            to the pleasures, he felt not the corruptions <lb/>
            of the court; and while Pythagoras fled <lb/>
            from the tyrant, Anacreon was celebrating <lb/>
            his praises on the lyre. We are told too <lb/>
            by Maximus Tyrius, that by the influence <lb/>
            of his amatory songs, he softened the mind <lb/>
            of Polycrates into a spirit of benevolence <lb/>
            towards his subjects.*</p>
          <p>The amours of the poet, and the rival­ <lb/>
            ship of the tyrant,† I shall pass over in <note type="footnote"> * <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναϰρεον Σαμιοις</foreign></hi> <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυϰρατην</foreign> <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ημερωσε</foreign></hi> Maxim. <lb/>
            Tyr. § 21. Maximus Tyrius mentions this among <lb/>
            other instances of the influence of poetry. If GaiT <lb/>
            had read Maximus Tyrius, how could he ridicule <lb/>
            this idea in Moutonnet, as unauthenticated ? </note><note type="footnote"> t In the romance of Clelia, the anecdote to which I <lb/>

            silence; and there are few, I presume, who <lb/>
            will regret the omission of most of those <lb/>
            anecdotes, which the industry of some edi­ <lb/>
            tors has not only promulged, but discussed. <lb/>
            Whatever is repugnant to modesty and vir­ <lb/>
            tue is considered in ethical science, by a <lb/>
            '· <lb/>
            supposition very favourable to humanity, <lb/>
            as impossible; and this amiable persuasion <lb/>
            should be much more strongly entertained, <lb/>
            where the transgression wars with nature <lb/>
            as well as virtue. But why are we not <lb/>
            allowed to indulge in the presumption? <lb/>
            Why are we offìciously reminded that there <lb/>
            have been such instances of depravity ?</p>
          <p>Hipparchus, who now maintained at <lb/>
            Athens the power which his father Pisis­ <lb/>
            tratus had usurped, was one of those ele­ <lb/>
            gant princes who have polished the fetters <note type="footnote"> a mask. But here Mademoiselle Scuderi consulted <lb/>
            nature more than truth. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            of their subjects. He was the first, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Plato, who edited the poems of Ho­ <lb/>
            mer, and commanded them to be sung by <lb/>
            the rhapsodists at the celebration of the <lb/>
            Panathenaea. As his court was the galaxy <lb/>
            of genius, Anacreon should not be absent. <lb/>
            Hipparchus sent a barge for him; the poet <lb/>
            embraced the invitation, and the muses and <lb/>
            the loves were wafted with him to Athens.*</p>
          <p>The manner of Anacreon's death was <lb/>
            singular. We are told that in the eighty­ <lb/>
            fifth year of his age he was choked by a <lb/>
            grape-stone ; t and however we may smile <note type="footnote"> * There is a very interesting French poem founded <lb/>
            upon this anecdote, imputed to Desyvetaux, and <lb/>
            called " Anacreon Citoven." </note><note type="footnote">t Fabricius appears not to trust very implicitly in <lb/>
            this story. " Uvae passae acino tandem suffocatus, <lb/>
            si credimus Suidae in <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οινοποτης</foreign>;</hi> alii enim hoc mort<foreign xml:lang="grc">ί</foreign>s <lb/>
            genere periisse tradunt Sophoclem." Fabricii Bib­ <lb/>
            bliothec. Græc. lib. ii. cap. 15. It must be confessed <lb/>
            that Lucian, who tells us that Sophocles was choked <lb/>
            by a grape-stone; in the very same treatise mentions </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            at their enthusiastic partiality, who pretend <lb/>
            that it was a peculiar indulgence of Heaven <lb/>
            which stole him from the world by this <lb/>
            easy and characteristic death, we cannot <lb/>
            help admiring that his fate should be so <lb/>
            emblematic of his _disposition. Caelius <lb/>
            Calcagninus alludes to this catastrophe in <lb/>
            the following epitaph on our poet: <lb/>
            * Then, hallow'd Sage, those lips which poured along <lb/>
            The sweetest lapses of the cygnet's song, <lb/>
            A grape has clos'd forever! <lb/>
            Here let the ivy kiss the poet's tomb, <lb/>
            Here let the rose he lov'd with laurels bloom, <lb/>
            In bands that ne'er shall sever! <note type="footnote"> the longevity of Anacreon, and yet is silent on the <lb/>
            manner of his death. Could he have been ignorant <lb/>
            of such a remarkable coincidence, or, knowing, could <lb/>
            he have neglected to remark it? See Regnier's in­ <lb/>
            troduction to his Anacreon. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign> </note><note type="footnote"> * At te, .sancte senex, acinus sub tartara misit; <lb/>

            interchange between hearts so congenial in <lb/>
            warmth of passion and delicacy of genius, <lb/>

            was therefore rude and unvaried, and the <lb/>
            poetry of love deprived of its most capti­ <lb/>
            vating graces. Anacreon, however, attained <lb/>
            some ideas of this gallantry; and the same <lb/>
            delicacy of mind which led him to this re­ <lb/>
            finement, prevented him from yielding to <lb/>

            endeavoured to imitate, because all have <lb/>
            confessed them to be inimitable. Simplicity <lb/>
            is the distinguishing feature of these odes, <lb/>

          <p>In the age of Anacreon music and poetry <lb/>
            were inseparable. These kindred talents <lb/>
            were for a long time associated, and the <lb/>
            poet always sung his own compositions to <lb/>
            the lyre. It is probable that they were not set <lb/>
            to any regular air, but rather a kind of musi­ <lb/>
            cal recitation, which was varied according <lb/>
            to the fancy and feelings of the moment.* <note type="footnote"> * In the Paris edition there are four of the original <lb/>
            odes set to music, by Citizens Le Sueur, Gossec, <lb/>

            entendre; qui empeche que nous ne chantions des <lb/>

            composers is very unlike what we are told of the <lb/>
            simple melody of the ancients; and they have all <lb/>

          <p>The singular beauty of our poet's style, <lb/>

            he appears to have trifled, have induced, as <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ι</foreign>_ remarked, a number of imitations. Some <lb/>
            have succeeded with wonderful felicity, as <lb/>

            elegant, are always laboured. The beauti­ <lb/>

            those allegorical fables, which, frequently <lb/>
            passing through the mediums of version <lb/>
            and imitation, have generally lost their <lb/>
            finest rays in the transmission. Many of <lb/>
            the Italian poets have sported on the sub­ <lb/>
            jects, and in the manner of Anacreon. <lb/>
            Bernardo Tasso first introduced the metre, <lb/>
            which was afterwards polished and enriched <lb/>
            by Chabriera and others. t If we may judge <lb/>
            by the references of Degen, the German <lb/>

            who have assumed him as a model. La <lb/>
            Farre, Chaulieu, and the other light poets <lb/>
            of France, have professed too to cultivate <lb/>
            the muse of Teos; but they have attained <lb/>
            all her negligence with little of the grace <lb/>
            that embellishes it. In the delicate bard of <lb/>
            Schiras* we find the kindred spirit of <lb/>
            Anacreon: some of his gazelles, or songs, <lb/>
            possess all the character of our poet.</p>
          <p>We come now to a retrospect of the <lb/>
            editions of Anacreon. To Henry Stephen <lb/>
            we are indebted for having first recovered <lb/>
            his remains from the obscurity in which <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φ</foreign> <lb/>
            they had reposed for so many ages. He <lb/>
            found the seventh Ode, as we are told, on <lb/>
            the cover of an old book, and communicated <lb/>
            it to Victorius, who mentions the circum­ <note type="footnote"> * See Toderini on the learning of the Turks, as <lb/>

            stance in his " Various Readings." Stephen <lb/>
            was then very young; and this discovery <lb/>
            was considered by some critics of that day <lb/>
            as a literary imposition.* In 1554, however <lb/>
            he gave Anacreon to the world, t accompa­ <lb/>
            nied with annotations and a Latin version <lb/>
            of the greater part of the odes. The learned <lb/>
            still hesitated to receive them as the relics <lb/>
            of the Teian bard, and suspected them to <lb/>
            be the fabrication of some monks of the <lb/>
            sixteenth century. This was an idea from <note type="footnote"> * Robertellus, in his work " De Ratione corrigendi," <lb/>

            which the classic muse recoiled; and the <lb/>
            Vatican MS. consulted by Scaliger and <lb/>
            Salmasius, confirmed the antiquity of most <lb/>
            of the poems. A very inaccurate copy of <lb/>
            this MS. was taken by Isaac Vossius, and <lb/>
            this is the authority which Barnes has <lb/>
            followed in his collation; accordingly he <lb/>
            misrepresents almost as often as he quotes; <lb/>
            and the subsequent editors, relying upon <lb/>
            him, have spoken of the manuscript with <lb/>
            not less confidence than ignorance. The <lb/>
            literary world has at length been gratified <lb/>
            with this curious memorial of the poet, by <lb/>
            the industry of the Abbe Spaletti, who, in <lb/>
            1781, published at Rome a fac-simile of <lb/>
            the pages of the Vatican manuscript, which <lb/>
            contained the odes of Anacreon. <note type="footnote"> * This manuscript, which Spaletti thinks as old <lb/>

          <p>This ode is the first of the series in the Vatican <lb/>

            iv. p. 335; and some others. See Gail de Editionibus.</p>
          <p>We are referred by Degen to that stupid book, the <lb/>
            Epistles of Alciphron, tenth epistle, third book; where <lb/>
            Iophon complains to Eraston of being wakened by the <lb/>

            as an indefinite epithet of excellence, from the <lb/>
            association of beauty with that flower. Salvini has <lb/>

          <p>ONE day, the Muses twined the hands <lb/>

            And to celestial Beauty gave <lb/>

          <p>By this allegory of the Muses making Cupid the <lb/>

            the softening influence which a cultivation of poetry <lb/>

            philosophy. Monsieur Gail very wisely thinks that <lb/>
            the poet uses the epithet <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελαινη</foreign>, because black earth <lb/>
            absorbs moisture more quickly than any other; and <lb/>

          <p>While life was mine, the little hour <lb/>

            I drank as earth imbibes the shower, <lb/>

            As ocean quaffs the rivers up, <lb/>

             Was once a weeping matrons form; <lb/>
            And Progne, hapless, frantic maid, <lb/>
            Is now a swallow in the shade.</p>
          <p>Ogilvie, in his Essay on the Lyric. Poetry of the <lb/>
            Ancients, in remarking upon the Odes of Anacreon, <lb/>
            says, " In some of his pieces there is exuberance and <lb/>
            even wildness of imagination; in that particularly, <lb/>
            which is addressed to a young girl, where he wishes <lb/>
            alternately to be transformed to a mirror, a coat, a <lb/>
            stream, a bracelet, and a pair of shoes, for the <lb/>
            different purposes which he recites: this is mere <lb/>
            sport and wantonness."</p>
          <p>It is the wantonness however of a very graceful <lb/>
            Muse; ludit amabiliter. The compliment of this <lb/>
            ode is exquisitely delicate, and so singular for the <lb/>
            period in which Anacreon lived, when the scale of <lb/>
            love had not yet been graduated into all its little <lb/>
            progressive refinements, that if we were inclined to <lb/>
            question the authenticity of the poem, we should <lb/>
            find a much more plausible argument in the features <lb/>

            Of roses laid his weary head; <lb/>
            Luckless urchin, not to see <lb/>
            Within the leaves a slumbering bee!</p>
          <p>Theocritus has imitated this beautiful ode in his <lb/>
            nineteenth idyll, but is very inferior, I think, to his <lb/>
            original, in delicacy of point and naivete of expres­ <lb/>
            sion. Spencer, in one of his smaller compositions, <lb/>
            has sported more diffusely on the same subject. <lb/>
            The poem to which I allude, begins thus: <lb/>
            Upon a day, as Love lay sweetly slumbering <lb/>
            All in his mothers lap; <lb/>

            one by Luxorius, correspondent somewhat with the <lb/>
            turn of Anacreon, where Love complains to his <lb/>
            mother of being wounded by a rose.</p>
          <p>The ode before us is the very flower of simplicity. <lb/>
            The infantine complainings of the little god, and</p><pb n="162"/>
            
          <p>The bee awak'd-with anger wild <lb/>

          <p>the natural and impressive reflection which they <lb/>

            I hope I shall be pardoned for introducing another <lb/>
            Greek Anacreontic of Monsieur Menage, not for <lb/>
            its similitude to the subject of this ode, but for <lb/>
            some faint traces of this natural simplicity, which <lb/>

            I</p>
          <p>The fastidious affectation of some commentators <lb/>
            has denounced this ode as spurious. Degen pro­ <lb/>
            nounces the four last lines to be the patch-work of <lb/>
            some miserable versificator, and Brunck condemns <lb/>
            the whole ode. It appears to me to be elegantly <lb/>
            graphical; full of delicate expressions and luxuriant <lb/>
            imagery. The abruptness of clde <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ϖως</foreign></hi> <foreign xml:lang="grc">εαρος</foreign> <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕανεντος</foreign></hi> is <lb/>

            languidly by Horace; <lb/>

            Soracte</p>
          <p>The imperative <foreign xml:lang="grc">ιδε</foreign> is infinitely more impressive, <lb/>

            Their plumes in the reflecting wave;</p>
          <p>Barnes conjectures, in his life of our poet, that this <lb/>
            ode was written after he had returned from Athens, <lb/>
            to settle in his paternal seat at Teos; there, in a <lb/>
            little villa at some distance from the city, which <lb/>
            commanded a view of the JEgean Sea and the <lb/>
            islands, he contemplated the beauties of nature and <lb/>
            enjoyed the felicities of retirement. Vide Barnes, <lb/>
            in Anac. vita, § XXXV. This supposition, however <lb/>
            unauthenticated, forms a pleasant association, which <lb/>
            makes the poem more interesting.</p>
          <p>Monsieur Chevreau says, that Gregory Nazian­ <lb/>
            zenus has paraphrased somewhere this description <lb/>
            of Spring; I cannot find it. See Chevreau CEuvres <lb/>
            Melees.</p>
          <p>" Compare with this ode (says Degen) the verses <lb/>

            likely they were the effusions of the moment of con­ <lb/>
            viviality, and were sung, we imagine, with rapture <lb/>
            in Greece; but that interesting association, by which <lb/>
            they always recalled the convivial emotions that <lb/>
            produced them, can be very little felt by the most <lb/>
            enthusiastic reader; and much less by a phlegmatic <lb/>

            " This ode is written upon a picture which repre­ <lb/>
            sented the rape of Europa." Madame Dacier.</p>
          <p>It may perhaps be considered as a description of <lb/>
            one of those coins, which the Sidonians struck off in <lb/>
            honour of Europa, representing a woman carried <lb/>
            across the sea by a bull. Thus Natalis Comes, lib. <lb/>
            vii. cap. 23. tC Sidonii numismata cum fœminâ <lb/>
            tauri dorso insidente ac mare transfretante, cuderunt <lb/>
             <lb/>
            in ejus honorem." In the little treatise upon the <lb/>
            goddess of Syria, attributed very falsely to Lucian, <lb/>
            there is mention of this coin, and of a temple dedi­ <lb/>
            cated by the Sidonians to Astarte, whom some, it <lb/>
            appears, confounded with Europa.</p>
          <p>Moschus has written a very beautiful idyll on the <lb/>

          <p>WHILE we invoke the wreathed spring, <lb/>
            Resplendent rose! to thee we'll sing; <lb/>
            Resplendent rose, the flower of flowers, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign> Whose breath perfumes Olympus' bowers;</p>
          <p>This ode is a brilliant panegyric on the rose. " All <lb/>
            antiquity (says Barnes) has produced nothing more <lb/>
            beautiful."</p>
          <p>From the idea of peculiar excellence, which the <lb/>
            ancients attached to this flower, arose a pretty pro­ <lb/>
            verbial expression, used by Aristophanes, according <lb/>
            to Suidas, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξοΰα</foreign> <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μ'ειρηϰας</foreign>,</hi> " You have spoken roses," <lb/>
            a phrase somewhat similar to the " dire des fleu­ <lb/>
            rettes" of the French. In the same idea of excellence <lb/>
            originated, I doubt not, a very curious application of <lb/>
            the word goSev, for which the inquisitive reader may <lb/>
            consult Gaulminus upon the epithalamium of our <lb/>
            poet, where it is introduced in the romance of Theo­ <lb/>
            dorus. Muretus, in one of his elegies, calls his <lb/>
            mistress his rose:</p>
          <p>Jam te igitur rursus teneo, formosula, jam te <lb/>
            t (Quid trepidas?) teneo; jam, rosa, te teneo. <lb/>
            Eleg. 8.</p><pb n="217"/>
            
          <p>Whose virgin blush, of chastened dye, <lb/>
            Enchants so much our mortal eye. <lb/>
            When pleasure's bloomy season glows, <lb/>
            The Graces love to twine the rose;</p>
          <p>Now I again embrace thee, dearest, <lb/>
            (Tell me, wanton, why thou fearest?) <lb/>
            Again my longing arms infold thee, <lb/>
            Again, my rose, again I hold thee.</p>
          <p>W <lb/>
            This, like most of the terms of endearment in <lb/>
            the modern Latin poets, is taken from Plautus; they <lb/>
            were vulgar and colloquial in his time, and they are <lb/>
            among the elegancies of the modern Latinists.</p>
          <p>Passeratius alludes to the ode before us, in the <lb/>
            beginning of his poem on the Rose: <lb/>
            Carmina digna rosa est; vellem caneretur ut illam <lb/>
            Teius argutâ cecinit testudine vates.</p>

            every anxiety. A French writer, with very elegant <lb/>
            gallantry, conjectures that this spell, which made the <lb/>
            bowl so beguiling, was the charm of Helen's conver­ <lb/>

            Upon this disk the ocean's bed ? !</p>
          <p>-\ <lb/>
            This ode is a very animated description of a pic­ <lb/>
            ture of Venus on a discus, which represented the <lb/>
            goddess in her first emergence from the waves. <lb/>
            About two centuries after our poet wrote, the pencil <lb/>
            of the artist Apelles embellished this subject, in his <lb/>
            famous painting of the Venus Anadyomene, the <lb/>
            model of which, as Pliny informs us, was the beau­ <lb/>
            tiful Campaspe, given to him by Alexander; though, <lb/>
            according to Natalis Comes, lib. vii. cap. 16, it was <lb/>
            Phryne who sat to Apelles for the face and breast <lb/>
            of this Venus. !</p>
          <p>There are a few blemishes in the reading of the <lb/>
            ode before us, which have influenced Faber, Heyne, <lb/>
            Brunck, &amp;c. to denounce the whole poem as spurious.' <lb/>

          <p>AWAKE to life, my dulcet shell, <lb/>
            To Phoebus all thy sighs shall swell; <lb/>
            And though no glorious prize be thine, <lb/>
            No Pythian wreath around thee twine, <lb/>
            Yet every hour is glory's hour ' <lb/>
            To him who gathers wisdom's flower ! <lb/>
            Then wake thee from thy magic slumbers, <lb/>
            Breathe to the soft and Phrygian numbers,</p>
          <p>This hymn to Apollo is supposed not to have been <lb/>
            written by Anacreon, and it certainly is rather a <lb/>
            sublimer flight than the Teian wing is accustomed <lb/>
            to soar. But we ought not to judge from this diver­ <lb/>
            sity of style, in a poet of whom time has preserved <lb/>
            such partial relics. If we knew Horace but as a <lb/>
            satirist, should we easily believe there could dwell <lb/>
            such animation in his lyre? Suidas says that our <lb/>
            poet wrote hymns, and this perhaps is one of them. <lb/>
            We can perceive in what an altered and imperfect <lb/>
            state his works are at present, when we find a scho­ <lb/>
            liast upon Horace citing an ode from the third book <lb/>
            of Anacreon.</p><pb n="242"/>
            
          <p>Which, as my trembling lips repeat, <lb/>
            Thy chords shall echo back as sweet. <lb/>
            The cygnet thus, with fading notes, <lb/>
            As down Cayster's tide he floats, <lb/>
            Plays with his snowy plumage fair <lb/>
            Upon the wanton murmuring air, <lb/>
            Which amorously lingers round, <lb/>
            And sighs responsive sound for sound! <lb/>
            Muse of the Lyre! illume my dream, <lb/>
            Thy Phoebus is my fancy's theme; <lb/>
            And hallowed is the harp I bear, <lb/>
            And hallowed is the wreath I wear, <lb/>
            Hallowed by him, the god of lays, <lb/>
            Who modulates the choral maze! <lb/>
            I sing the love which Daphne twined <lb/>
            Around the godhead's yielding mind; <lb/>
            I sing the blushing Daphne's flight <lb/>
            From this aethereal youth of light; <lb/>
            And how the tender, timid maid <lb/>
            Flew panting to the kindly shade, <lb/>
            Resigned a form, too tempting fair, <lb/>
            And grew a verdant laurel there; <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            Whose leaves, with sympathetic thrill, <lb/>
            In terror seemed to tremble still! <lb/>
            The God pursu'd, with winged desire; <lb/>
            And when his hopes were all on fire, <lb/>
            And when he thought to hear the sigh <lb/>
            With which enamoured virgins die, <lb/>
            He only heard the pensive air <lb/>
            Whispering amid her leafy hair! <lb/>
            But, oh my soul! no more-no more! <lb/>
            Enthusiast, whither do I soar ?</p>

          <p>Here ends the last of the odes in the Vatican MS. <lb/>
            whose authority confirms the genuine antiquity of <lb/>
            them all, thongh a few have stolen among the number, <lb/>
            which we may hesitate in attributing to Anacreon. <lb/>
            In the little essay prefixed to this translation, I <lb/>
            observed that Barnes has quoted this manuscript <lb/>
            incorrectly, relying upon an imperfect copy of it, <lb/>
            which Isaac V ossius had taken; I shall just mention <lb/>
            two or three instances of this inaccuracy, the first <lb/>
            which occur to me. In the ode of the Dove, on the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πτερισι</foreign> <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">συγϰαλυψω</foreign>,</hi> he says, " Vatican MS. <lb/>

            too, on the same line, is somewhat in error. In the <lb/>
            twenty-second ode of this series, line thirteenth, the <lb/>
            MS. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">τενιη</foreign> with <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">χι</foreign></hi> interlined, and Barnes imputes <lb/>

            written (as Madame Dacier conjectures) on the <lb/>
            occasion of some battle, in which the Magnesians <lb/>

          <p>This ode, which is addressed to some Thracian <lb/>

            frequently by Horace, as all the annotators have <lb/>
            remarked. Madame Dacier rejects the allegory, <lb/>
            which runs so obviously throughout it, and supposes <lb/>
            it to have been addressed to a young mare belonging <lb/>
            to Polycrates: there is more modesty than ingenuity <lb/>
            in the lacly's conjecture.</p>
          <p>Pierius, in the fourth book of his Hieroglyphics, <lb/>
            cites this ode, and informs us, that a horse was the <lb/>

            attributed to her, which some romancers have sup­ <lb/>
            posed to be her answer to Anacreon. " Mats par <lb/>

          <p>Among the Epigrams of the Anthology <lb/>
            there are some panegyrics on Anacreon, which <lb/>
            I had translated, and originally intended as a <lb/>
            kind of Coronis to the work; but I found, upon <lb/>
            consideration, that they wanted variety; a fre­ <lb/>
            quent recurrence of the same thought, within <lb/>
            the limits of an epitaph, to which they are con­ <lb/>
            fined, would render a collection of them rather <lb/>
            uninteresting. I shall take the liberty, however, <lb/>
            of subjoining a few, that I may not appear to <lb/>
            have totally neglected those elegant tributes to <lb/>
            the reputation of Anacreon. The four epi­ <lb/>
            grams which I give are imputed to Antipater <lb/>
            Sidonius. They are rendered, perhaps, with <lb/>
            too much freedom; but designing a translation <lb/>
            of all that are on the subject, I imagined it was <lb/>
            necessary to enliven their uniformity by some­ <lb/>
            times indulging in the liberties of paraphrase.</p><pb n="285"/>

            Long may the deathless ivy twine, <lb/>
            And Summer pour her waste of roses!</p>
          <p>Antipater Sidonius, the author of this epigram, <lb/>
            lived, according to Vossius, de Poetis Grsecis, in the <lb/>
            second year of the 169th Olympiad. He appears, <lb/>
            from what Cicero and Quintilian have said of him, <lb/>
            to have been a kind of improvvisatore. See Institut. <lb/>
            Orat. lib. x. cap. 7. There is nothing more known <lb/>
            respecting this poet, except some particulars about</p><pb n="286"/>

            I And every fount be milky showers. <lb/>
            r</p>
          <p>Thus, shade of him, whom Nature taught <lb/>
            To tune his lyre and soul to pleasure, <lb/>
            Who gave to love his warmest thought, <lb/>
            Who gave to love his fondest measure!</p>
          <p>his illness and death, which are mentioned as curious <lb/>
            by Pliny and others; and there remain of his works <lb/>
            but a few epigrams in the Anthologia, among which <lb/>
            are these I have selected, upon Anacreon. Those <lb/>
            remains have been sometimes imputed to another <lb/>
            poet* of the same name, of whom Vossius gives us <lb/>
            the following account: " Antipatel" Tllessalonicensis <lb/>
            vixit tempore August! Csesaris, ut qui saltantem <lb/>
            viderit Pyladem, sicut constat ex quodam ejus epi­ <lb/>

          <p>Thus, after death, if spirits feel, <lb/>
            :Thou ma)is't, from odours round thee <lb/>
            | streaming, <lb/>
            A pulse of past enjoyment steal, <lb/>
            ;And live again in blissful dreaming!</p>
          <p>The reader, who thinks it worth observing, may <lb/>
            find a strange oversight in Hoffman's quotation of <lb/>
            this article from Vossius, Lexic. Univers. By the <lb/>
            omission of a sentence he has made Vossius assert <lb/>
            that the poet Antipater was one of the first panto­ <lb/>
            mime dancers in Rome.</p>
          <p>Barnes, upon the epigram before us, mentions a <lb/>
            version of it by Brodaeus, which is not to be found in <lb/>
            that commentator; but he more than once confounds <lb/>
            Brodaeus, with another annotator on the Anthologia, <lb/>
            Vincentius Obsopoeus, who has given a translation of <lb/>

          <p>We may judge from the lines I have just quoted, <lb/>

            works of Anacreon were perfect in the times of <lb/>
