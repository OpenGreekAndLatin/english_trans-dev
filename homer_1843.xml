          <p>THE translation of Homer was amongst the latest of <lb/>
            Hobbes' works; a signal of retreat from those mathe­ <lb/>
            matical contests in which he had spent so much of <lb/>
            his time:—“ Silentibus tandem adversariis, annum <lb/>
            agens octogesimum septimum, Homeri Odysseam <lb/>
            edidit.”-See VITA Themæ Hobbes.</p>
          <p>In 1673 appeared, " The travels of Ulysses, as they <lb/>
            were related by himself in Homer's 9th, 10th, 11th, <lb/>
            and 12th books of his Odysses, to Alcinous king of <lb/>
            Phæacia," published by Wm. Crook, in 12mo. The <lb/>
            date of 1674, given by Anthony Wood and others, <lb/>
            seems to be a mistake ; they may perhaps have been <lb/>
            misled by Hobbes' telling us, that he translated the <lb/>
            Odyssey in his 87th year.</p>
          <p>Whether Hobbes had at this time finished any <lb/>
            other part of Homer, and put forth those four books <lb/>
            of the Odyssey as a specimen of the performance, or <lb/>
            to ascertain what reception might be expected from <lb/>
            the public for the remainder of it, is unknown. In <lb/>
            about a year afterwards (see VITA) they were <lb/>
            followed by the translation of the entire Iliad and <lb/>
            Odyssey. Copies are to be found of various dates;</p><pb n="-"/>

          <p>as 1676, 1677, 1684, 1686, and perhaps others: but <lb/>
            there were but three editions, the second dated 1677, <lb/>
            and the third, 1686. The biographers appear to have <lb/>
            been mistaken in repeating one after the other, (see <lb/>
            Biog. Britan., Brit. Biog., Gen. Diet., Aikin's Biog.), <lb/>
            that in the course of ten years this translation went <lb/>
            through three large editions.</p>
          <p>Pope, in the preface to his translation, observes, <lb/>
            that the poetry of Hobbes' version is “ too mean for <lb/>
            criticism." Some, however, may possibly find the un­ <lb/>
            studied and unpretending language of Hobbes convey <lb/>
            an idea less remote from the original, than the smooth <lb/>
            and glittering lines of Pope and his coadjutors.</p>
          <p>Pope's remark upon the habitual carelessness dis­ <lb/>
            played in the execution of the work, is well founded. <lb/>
            It was possibly never meant for criticism, and may <lb/>
            be fairly looked upon, as the translator has told us <lb/>
            in his preface, as the amusement of his old age.</p>
          <p>The present edition is printed from that of 1677.</p>

            <title type="main">TO THE READER, CONCERNING THE VIRTUES OF AN HEROIC POEM.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE virtues required in an heroic poem, and indeed in all <lb/>
            writings published, are comprehended all in this one word­ <lb/>
            discretion.</p>
          <p>And discretion consisteth in this, that every part of the <lb/>
            poem be conducing, and in good order placed to the end and <lb/>
            design of the poet. And the design is not only to profit, <lb/>
            but also to delight the reader.</p>
          <p>By profit, I intend not here any accession of wealth, either <lb/>
            to the poet, or to the reader; but accession of prudence, <lb/>
            justice, and fortitude, by the example of such great and noble <lb/>
            persons as he introduceth speaking, or describeth acting. <lb/>
            For all men love to behold, though not to practise virtue. <lb/>
            So that at last the work of an heroic poet is no more but to <lb/>
            furnish an ingenuous reader, when his leisure abounds, with <lb/>
            the diversion of an honest and delightful story, whether true <lb/>
            or feigned.</p>
          <p>But because there be many men called critics, and wits, <lb/>
            and virtuosi, that are accustomed to censure the poets, and <lb/>
            most of them of divers judgments, how is it possible, you'll <lb/>
            say, to please them all? Yes, very well; if the poem be as <lb/>
            it should be. For men can judge what is good, that know <lb/>
            not what is best. For he that can judge what is best, must <lb/>
            have considered all those things, though they be almost in­ <lb/>
            numerable, that concur to make the reading of an heroic <lb/>
            poem pleasant. Whereof I'll name as many as shall come <lb/>
            into my mind. <note type="footnote"> b 2 </note></p><pb n="IV"/>
            
          <p>And they are contained, first, in the choice of words. <lb/>
            Secondly, in the construction. Thirdly, in the contrivance <lb/>
            of the story or fiction. Fourthly, in the elevation of the <lb/>
            fancy. Fifthly, in the justice and impartiality of the poet. <lb/>
            Sixthly, in the clearness of descriptions. Seventhly, in the <lb/>
            amplitude of the subject.</p>
          <p>And, to begin with words: the first indiscretion is, the use <lb/>
            of such words as to the readers of poesy (which are commonly <lb/>
            persons of the best quality) are not sufficiently known. For <lb/>
            the work of an heroic poem is to raise admiration, principally, <lb/>
            for three virtues, valour, beauty, and love; to the reading <lb/>
            whereof women no less than men have a just pretence, <lb/>
            though their skill in language be not so universal; and there­ <lb/>
            fore foreign words, till by long use they become vulgar, arc <lb/>
            unintelligible to them. Also the names of instruments and <lb/>
            tools of artificers, and words of art, though of use in the <lb/>
            Schools, are far from being fit to be spoken by a hero. He <lb/>
            may delight in the arts themselves, and have skill in some of <lb/>
            them, but his glory lies not in that, but in courage, nobility, <lb/>
            and other virtues of nature, or in the command he has over <lb/>
            other men. Nor does Homer in any part of his poem attri­ <lb/>
            bute any praise to Achilles, or any blame to Alexander, for <lb/>
            that they had both learnt to play upon the guitar. The <lb/>
            character of words that become a hero are property and sig­ <lb/>
            nificancy, but without both the malice and lasciviousness of <lb/>
            a satyr.</p>
          <p>Another virtue of an heroic poem is the perspicuity and <lb/>
            the facility of construction, and consisteth in a natural con­ <lb/>
            texture of the words, so as not to discover the labour, but the <lb/>
            natural ability of the poet; and this is usually called a good <lb/>
            style. For the order of words, when placed as they ought <lb/>
            to be, carries a light before it, whereby a man may foresee <lb/>
            the length of his period, as a torch in the night shows a man <lb/>
            the stops and unevenness in his way. But when placed un­ <lb/>
            naturally, the reader will often find unexpected checks, and <lb/>
            be forced to go back and hunt for the sense, and suffer such <lb/>
            unease, as in a coach a man unexpectedly finds in passing <lb/>
             <pb n="V"/>
            over a furrow. And though the laws of verse (which have <lb/>
            bound the Greeks and Latins to number of feet, and quan­ <lb/>
            tity of syllables, and the English and other nations to number <lb/>
            of syllables and rhyme) put great constraint upon the natural <lb/>
            course of language, yet the poet, having the liberty to depart <lb/>
            from what is obstinate, and to choose somewhat else that is <lb/>
            more obedient to such laws, and no less fit for his purpose, <lb/>
            shall not be, neither by the measure, nor by the necessity of <lb/>
            rhyme, excused; though a translation often may.</p>
          <p>A third virtue lies in the contrivance. For there is dif­ <lb/>
            ference between a poem and a history in prose. For a history <lb/>
            is wholly related by the writer; but in an heroic poem the <lb/>
            narration is, a great part of it, put upon some of the persons <lb/>
            introduced by the poet. So Homer begins not his Iliad <lb/>
            with the injury done by Paris, but makes it related by <lb/>
            Menelaus, and very briefly, as a thing notorious; nor begins <lb/>
            he his Odysseys with the departure of Ulysses from Troy, <lb/>
            but makes Ulysses himself relate the same to Alcinous, in the <lb/>
            midst of his poem; which I think much more pleasant and <lb/>
            ingenious, than a too precise and close following of the time.</p>
          <p>A fourth is in the elevation of fancy, which is generally <lb/>
            taken for the greatest praise of heroic poetry; and is so, <lb/>
            when governed by discretion. For men more generally <lb/>
            affect and admire fancy than they do either judgment, or <lb/>
            reason, or memory, or any other intellectual virtue, and for <lb/>
            the pleasantness of it, give to it alone the name of wit, <lb/>
            accounting reason and judgment but for a dull entertainment. <lb/>
            For in fancy consisteth the sublimity of a poet, which is that <lb/>
            poetical fury which the readers, for the most part, call for. <lb/>
            It flies abroad swiftly to fetch in both matter and words; <lb/>
            but if there be not discretion at home to distinguish which <lb/>
            are fit to be used and which not, which decent and which <lb/>
            undecent for persons, times, and places, their delight and <lb/>
            grace is lost. But if they be discreetly used, they are greater <lb/>
            ornaments of a poem by much than any other. A metaphor <lb/>
            also (which is a comparison contracted into a word) is not <lb/>
            unpleasant; but when they are sharp and extraordinary, <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            they are not fit for an heroic poet, nor for a public consulta­ <lb/>
            tion, but only for an accusation or defence at the bar.</p>
          <p>A fifth lies in the justice and impartiality of the poet, and <lb/>
            belongeth as well to history as to poetry. For both the poet <lb/>
            and the historian writeth only, or should do, matter of fact. <lb/>
            And as far as the truth of fact can defame a man, so far they <lb/>
            are allowed to blemish the reputation of persons. But to do <lb/>
            the same upon report, or by inference, is below the dignity, <lb/>
            not only of a hero, but of a man. For neither a poet nor a <lb/>
            historian ought to make himself an absolute master of any <lb/>
            man'is good name. None of the Emperors of Rome whom <lb/>
            Tacitus, or any other writer, hath condemned, was ever sub­ <lb/>
            ject to the judgment of any of them; nor were they ever <lb/>
            heard to plead for themselves, which are things that ought to <lb/>
            be antecedent to condemnation. Nor was, I think, Epicurus <lb/>
            the philosopher, (who is transmitted to us by the Stoics for <lb/>
            a man of evil and voluptuous life), ever called, convented, <lb/>
            and lawfully convicted, as all men ought to be before they be <lb/>
            defamed. Therefore it is a very great fault in a poet to <lb/>
            speak evil of any man in their writings historical.</p>
          <p>A sixth virtue consists in the perfection and curiosity of <lb/>
            descriptions, which the ancient writers of eloquence call <lb/>
            icones, that is images. And an image is always a part, or <lb/>
            rather a ground of the poetical comparison. As, for example, <lb/>
            when Virgil would set before our eyes the fall of Troy, he <lb/>
            describes perhaps the whole labour of many men together in <lb/>
            the felling of some great tree, and with how much ado it fell. <lb/>
            This is the image. To which if you but add these words, <lb/>
            " So fell Troy," you have the comparison entire ; the grace <lb/>
            whereof lieth in the lightsomeness, and is but the description <lb/>
            of all, even the minutest, parts of the thing described; that <lb/>
            not only they that stand far off, but also they that stand <lb/>
            near, and look upon it with the oldest spectacles of a critic, <lb/>
            may approve it. For a poet is a painter, and should paint <lb/>
            actions to the understanding with the most decent words, as <lb/>
            painters do persons and bodies with the choicest colours, to <lb/>
            the eye; which if not done nicely, will not be worthy to be <lb/>
            placed in a cabinet.</p><pb n="VII"/>
            
          <p>The seventh virtue, which lying in the amplitude of the <lb/>
            subject, is nothing but variety, and a thing without which a <lb/>
            whole poem would be no pleasanter than an epigram, or one <lb/>
            good verse; nor a picture of a hundred figures better than <lb/>
            any one of them asunder, if drawn with equal art. And <lb/>
            these are the virtues which ought especially to be looked <lb/>
            upon by the critics, in the comparing of the poets, Homer <lb/>
            with Virgil, or Virgil with Lucan. For these only, for their <lb/>
            excellency, I have read, or heard compared.</p>
          <p>If the comparison be grounded upon the first and second <lb/>
            virtues, which consist in known words and style unforced, <lb/>
            they are all excellent in their own language, though perhaps <lb/>
            the Latin than the Grerk is apter to dispose itself into an <lb/>
            hexameter verse, as having both fewer monosyllables and <lb/>
            fewer polysyllables. And this may make the Latin verse <lb/>
            appear more grave and equal, which is taken for a kind of <lb/>
            majesty; though in truth there be no majesty in words, but <lb/>
            then when they seem to proceed from a high and weighty <lb/>
            employment of the mind. But neither Homer, nor Virgil, <lb/>
            nor Lucan, nor any poet writing commendably, though not <lb/>
            excellently, was ever charged much with unknown words, <lb/>
            or great constraint of style, as being a fault proper to trans­ <lb/>
            lators, when they hold themselves too superstitiously to their <lb/>
            author's words.</p>
          <p>In the third virtue, which is contrivance, there is no doubt <lb/>
            but Homer excels them all. For their poems, except the <lb/>
            introduction of their Gods, are but so many histories in <lb/>
            verse: where Homer has woven so many histories together <lb/>
            as contain the whole learning of his time (which the Greeks <lb/>
            call cyclopœdia), and furnished both the Greek and Latin <lb/>
            stages with all the plots and arguments of their tragedies.</p>
          <p>The fourth virtue, which is the height of fancy, is almost <lb/>
            proper to Lucan, and so admirable in him, that no heroic <lb/>
            poem raises such admiration of the poet, as his bath done, <lb/>
            though not so great admiration of the persons he introducetli. <lb/>
            And though it be a mark of a great wit, yet it is fitter for a <lb/>
            rhetorician than a poet, and rebelleth often against discre­ <lb/>
            tion, as when he says, <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            Victrix causa Diis placuit, sed victa Catoni. <lb/>
            that is, <lb/>
            The side that won the Gods approved most, <lb/>
            But Cato better lik'd the side that lost.</p>
          <p>Than which nothing could be spoken more gloriously to the <lb/>
            the exaltation of a man, nor more disgracefully to the de­ <lb/>
            pression of the Gods. Homer indeed maketh some Gods for <lb/>
            the Greeks, and some for the Trojans, but always makes <lb/>
            Jupiter impartial; and never prefers the judgment of a man <lb/>
            before that of Jupiter, much less before the judgment of all <lb/>
            the Gods together.</p>
          <p>The fifth virtue, which is the justice and impartiality of a <lb/>
            poet, is very eminent in Homer and Virgil, but the contrary <lb/>
            in Lucan. Lucan shows himself openly in the Pompeian <lb/>
            faction, inveighing against Cæsar throughout his poem, like <lb/>
            Cicero against Cataline or Marc Antony, and is therefore <lb/>
            justly reckoned by Quintilian as a rhetorician rather than a <lb/>
            poet. And a great part of the delight of his readers pro­ <lb/>
            ceedeth from the pleasure which too many men take to hear <lb/>
            great persons censured. But Homer and Virgil, especially <lb/>
            Homer, do everywhere what they can to preserve the repu­ <lb/>
            tation of their heroes.</p>
          <p>If we compare Homer and Virgil by the sixth virtue, <lb/>
            which is the clearness of images, or descriptions, it is mani­ <lb/>
            fest that Homer ought to be preferred, though Virgil himself <lb/>
            were to be the judge. For there are very few images in <lb/>
            Virgil besides those which he bath translated out of Homer; <lb/>
            so that Virgil's images are Homer's praises. But what if he <lb/>
            have added something to it of his own ? Though he have, <lb/>
            yet it is no addition of praise, because it is easy. But he <lb/>
            hath some images which are not in Homer, and better than <lb/>
            his. It may be so; and so may other poets have which <lb/>
            never durst compare themselves with Homer. Two or three <lb/>
            fine sayings are not enough to make a wit. But where is <lb/>
            that image of his better done by him than Homer, of those <lb/>
            that have been done by them both ? Yes, Eustathius, as <lb/>
            Mr. Ogilby hath observed, where they both describe the <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            falling of a tree, prefers Virgil's description. But Eustathius <lb/>
            is in that, I think, mistaken. The place of Homer is in the <lb/>
            fourth of the Iliads, the sense whereof is this: <lb/>
            As when a man bath fell'd a poplar tree, <lb/>
            Tall, straight, and smooth, with all the fair boughs on ; <lb/>
            Of which he means a coach-wheel made shall be, <lb/>
            And leaves it on the bank to dry i' th' sun ; <lb/>
            So lay the comely Simoisius, <lb/>
            Slain by great Ajax, son of Telamon.</p>
          <p>It is manifest that in this place Homer intended no more <lb/>
            than to show how comely the body of Simoisius appeared as <lb/>
            he lay dead upon the bank of Scamander, straight and tall, <lb/>
            with a fair head of hair, and like a straight and high poplar <lb/>
            with the boughs still on; and not at all to describe the <lb/>
            manner of his falling, which, when a man is wounded through <lb/>
            the breast, as he was with a spear, is always sudden.</p>
          <p>The description of how a great tree falleth, when many <lb/>
            men together hew it down, is in the second of Virgil's <lb/>
            Æneads. The sense of it, with the comparison, is in English <lb/>
            this: <lb/>
            And Troy, methought, then sunk in fire and smoke, <lb/>
            And overturned was in every part: <lb/>
            . As when upon the mountain an old oak <lb/>
            Is hewn about with keen steel to the heart, <lb/>
            And plied by swains with many heavy blows, <lb/>
            It nods and every way it threatens round, <lb/>
            Till overcome with many wounds, it bows, <lb/>
            And leisurely at last comes to the ground.</p>
          <p>And here again it is evident that Virgil meant to compare <lb/>
            the manner how Troy, after many battles, and after the <lb/>
            losses of many cities, conquered by the many nations under <lb/>
            Agamemnon in a long war, and thereby weakened, and at <lb/>
            last overthrown, with a great tree hewn round about, and <lb/>
            then falling by little and little leisurely.</p>
          <p>So that neither these two descriptions, nor the two com­ <lb/>
            parisons can be compared together. The image of a man <lb/>
            lying on the ground is one thing; the image of falling, <lb/>
            especially of a kingdom, is another. This therefore gives no <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            advantage to Virgil over Homer. It is true, that this de­ <lb/>
            scription of the felling and falling of a tree is exceeding <lb/>
            graceful, but is it therefore more than Homer could have <lb/>
            done if need had been ? Or is there no description in Homer <lb/>
            of somewhat else as good as this ? Yes, and in many of our <lb/>
            English poets now alive. If it then be lawful for Julius <lb/>
            Scaliger to say, that if Jupiter would have described the fall <lb/>
            of a tree, he could not have mended this of Virgil; it will <lb/>
            be lawful for me to repeat an old epigram of Antipater, to <lb/>
            the like purpose, in favour of Homer.</p>
          <p>The writer of the famous Trojan war, <lb/>
            And of Ulysses' life, 0 Jove make known, <lb/>
            Who, whence he was; for thine the verses are, <lb/>
            And he would have us think they are his own.</p>
          <p>The seventh and last commendation of an heroic poem <lb/>
            consisteth in amplitude and variety; and in this Homer <lb/>
            exceedeth Virgil very much, and that not by superfluity of <lb/>
            words, but by plenty of heroic matter, and multitude of <lb/>
            descriptions and comparisons (whereof Virgil hath translated <lb/>
            but a small part into his Æneads), such as are the images of <lb/>
            shipwracks, battles, single combats, beauty, passions of the <lb/>
            mind, sacrifices, entertainments, and other things, whereof <lb/>
            Virgil, abating what he borrows of Homer, has scarce the <lb/>
            twentieth part. It is no wonder therefore if all the ancient <lb/>
            learned men both of Greece and Rome have given the <lb/>
            first place in poetry to Homer. It is rather strange that <lb/>
            two or three, and of late time, and but learners of the Greek <lb/>
            tongue, should dare to contradict so many competent judges <lb/>
            both of language and discretion. But howsoever I defend <lb/>
            Homer, I aim not thereby at any reflection upon the follow­ <lb/>
            ing translation. Why then did I write it ? Because I had <lb/>
            nothing else to do. Why publish it ? Because I thought <lb/>
            it might take off my adversaries from showing their folly <lb/>
            upon my more serious writings, and set them upon my <lb/>
            verses to show their wisdom. But why without annotations ? <lb/>
            Because I had no hope to do it better than it is already done <lb/>
            by Mr. Ogilby. <lb/>

            <title type="main">THE LIFE OF HOMER, COLLECTED AND WRITTEN BY J. WALLIAM.</title>
          </head>
          <p>HOMER, whose proper name was Melesigenes, was born in <lb/>
            the country of Æolia, about 160 years after the siege of <lb/>
            Troy, which was about the year of the world 3665, of <lb/>
            Critheis, daughter of Melanopus and Omyris, who, after her <lb/>
            father and mother's death, was left to a friend of her father's <lb/>
            at Cuma, who, when he found she was with child, in dis­ <lb/>
            pleasure he sent her away to a friend's at a place nigh the <lb/>
            River Meles; where, at a feast among other young women, <lb/>
            she was delivered of a son, whose name she called Melesigenes, <lb/>
            from the place where he was born. Critheis went with her <lb/>
            son to Ismenias, and after to Smyrna, where she dressed <lb/>
            wool to get a livelihood for herself and son. Phemius, the <lb/>
            schoolmaster, taking a fancy to her, married her, and took <lb/>
            her son into the school, who by his sharpness of wit outwent <lb/>
            all the school in wisdom and learning. In a short time after, <lb/>
            his master dying, he taught the same school, and gained <lb/>
            great reputation by his learning, not only at Smyrna, but all <lb/>
            the countries round about; for the merchants that did fre­ <lb/>
            quent Smyrna, with corn, &amp;c. did spread his fame about; <lb/>
            amongst which merchants, one Mentes, master of a ship of <lb/>
            Leucadia, took that kindness for him, that he persuaded him <lb/>
            to leave his school and travel with him, which he did, by <lb/>
            whom he was maintained well and plentifully in his travels.</p><pb n="XII"/>
            
          <p>They went to Spain, from thence to Italy, and from Italy <lb/>
            through several countries, and at last came to Ithaca, where <lb/>
            a violent rheum fell into the eyes of Homer, that he could <lb/>
            not travel any further, so that Mentes left him with a friend <lb/>
            of his called Mentor, a person of great riches and honour in <lb/>
            Ithaca, where Homer learned the principal matters relating <lb/>
            to Ulysses' life; but Mentes the next year came back the <lb/>
            same way, and finding Homer recovered in his eyes, took <lb/>
            him in his travels. They went through many countries till <lb/>
            they came to Colophen, where he fell into his old distemper <lb/>
            of his eyes, and there grew quite blind; after which he <lb/>
            addicted himself to poetry; but being poor, he went to <lb/>
            Smyrna, expecting to get better encouragement there; but <lb/>
            being disappointed of his expectation, he went to Cuma, and <lb/>
            as he went he rested at a town called New-wall, where he <lb/>
            repeated some of his verses; and one Tichio, a leather-seller, <lb/>
            took such delight to hear them, that he entertained him <lb/>
            kindly for a long time. After, he proceeded on his journey <lb/>
            to Cuma, and when he came there he was well received, and <lb/>
            he had some friends in the senate that did propose to have <lb/>
            had a maintenance settled on him for life, but it could not <lb/>
            be carried. At this place he first received the name of <lb/>
            Homer, from his blindness.</p>
          <p>From Cuma he went to Phocæa, where lived one Thes­ <lb/>
            torides, a schoolmaster, who invited Homer to live with him, <lb/>
            and by that means he got some of his verses, and after <lb/>
            went to Chios, where he taught them as his own verses, <lb/>
            and got great reputation by them. When Homer heard <lb/>
            that Thestorides had thus abused him, he followed him to <lb/>
            Chios, and by the way, at a place called Bollisus, was taken <lb/>
            up by a shepherd, as he was keeping his master's sheep; <lb/>
            the shepherd did relieve him, and carried him to his master, <lb/>
            where he lived some time, and taught his children; yet <lb/>
            he could not rest till he had been at Chios to discover <lb/>
            the cheat of Thestorides, who when he heard of Homer's <lb/>
            coming, he left Chios, where Homer tarried some time, and <lb/>
            taught a school, grew rich, married, and had two daughters, <lb/>
            one of which died young, the other he married to the shep­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XIII"/>
            herd's master that took him in at Bollisus. When he grew <lb/>
            old he left Chios, and went to Samoa, where he staid some <lb/>
            time singing of verses at feasts and at new moons, at the <lb/>
            chiefest men's houses in all places where he was. From <lb/>
            Samos he was going to Athens, but fell sick at Ios, and <lb/>
            there died, and was buried on the sea-shore. Long after, <lb/>
            when his poems had gotten an universal applause, the people <lb/>
            of Ios built him a sepulchre.</p>

            King Agamemnon and Achilles stout. <lb/>
            That so it should be was the will of Jove, <lb/>
            But who was he that made them first fall out ? <lb/>
            Apollo; who incensed by the wrong <lb/>

            Sent a great pestilence the Greeks among ; <lb/>
            Apace they died, and remedy was none. <lb/>
            For Chryses came unto the Argive fleet, <lb/>
            With treasure great his daughter to redeem ; <lb/>
            And having in his hands the ensigns meet, <lb n="15"/>
            That did the priestly dignity beseem, <lb/>
            A golden sceptre and a crown of bays, <lb/>

            But to the two Atrides chiefly prays, <lb/>

            O sons of Atreus, may the Gods grant you <lb/>

            Frighted with this, away the old man went; <lb/>
            And often as he walked on the sand, <lb/>
            His prayers to Apollo up he sent. <lb/>
            Hear me, Apollo, with thy bow in hand, <lb n="40"/>
            That honoured art in Tenedos and Chryse, <lb/>
            And unto whom Cylla great honour bears, <lb/>
            If thou accepted hast my sacrifice, <lb/>
            Pay th' Argives with thy arrows for my tears. <lb/>
            His prayer was granted by the deity; <lb n="45"/>
            Who with his silver bow and arrows keen, <lb/>
            Descended from Olympus silently <lb/>
            In likeness of the sable night unseen. <lb/>
            His bow and quiver both behind him hang, <lb/>
            The arrows chink as often as he jogs, <lb n="50"/>
            And as he shot the bow was heard to twang, <lb/>
            And first his arrows flew at mules and dogs. <lb/>
            But when the plague into the army came, <lb/>
            Perpetual was the fire of funerals; <lb/>
            And so nine days continued the same. <lb n="55"/>
            Achilles on the tenth for counsel calls; <lb/>
            And Juno 'twas that put it in his head, <lb/>
            Who for the Argive army was afraid : <lb/>
            The lords to counsel being gathered, <lb/>
            Up stood Achilles, and thus to them said, <lb n="60"/>
            We must, I think, Atrides, run from hence, <lb/>
            Since war and plague consume us both at once, <lb/>
            Let's think on how to stay the pestilence, <lb/>
            Or else at Troy resolve to leave our bones. <lb/>
            Let's with some priest or prophet here advise, <lb n="65"/>
            That knows the pleasure of the gods above, <lb/>
            Or some that at expounding dreams are wise, <lb/>
            For also dreams descend on men from Jove: <lb/>
            That we may from him know Apollo's mind, <lb/>
            If we for sacrifice be in arrear, <lb n="70"/>
            Or if he will for lambs and goats be kind, <lb/>
            And to destroy us from henceforth forbear. <lb/>
            Achilles then sat down, and Chalchas rose, <lb/>
            That was of great renown for augury, <lb/>
            And any thing was able to disclose, <lb n="75"/>
            That had been, is, or should hereafter be; <lb/>
            And guided had the Greeks to Ilium ; <lb/>
            Achilles, said he, since you me command <lb/>
            To tell you why this plague is on us come, <lb/>

            Of all the Greeks it will offend the best; <lb/>
            Who though his anger for awhile he smother, <lb/>
            Will not, I fear, long time contented rest, <lb/>
            But will revenged be some time or other. <lb/>
            Chalchas, replied Achilles, do not fear, <lb n="85"/>
            But what the god has told you bring to light: <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>

            As long as 1 enjoy my life and sight; <lb/>
            Though Agamemnon be the man you dread, <lb/>
            Who is of all the army most obeyed. <lb n="90"/>
            The prophet by these words encouraged, <lb/>
            Said what before to say he was afraid. <lb/>
            'Tis not neglect of vow or sacrifice <lb/>
            That doth the God Apollo thus displease; <lb/>
            But that we do his priest so much despise, <lb n="95"/>
            As not his child for ransom to release. <lb/>
            And more, till she be to her father sent, <lb/>
            And with a hecatomb, and ransomless, <lb/>
            The anger of the god will not relent, <lb/>
            Nor will the sickness 'mongst the people cease. <lb n="100"/>
            This said, he sat. The king look'd furiously, <lb/>
            And anger flaming stood upon his eyes, <lb/>
            While many black thoughts on his heart did lie; <lb/>
            And to the prophet Chalchas thus replies: <lb/>
            Unlucky prophet, that didst never yet <lb n="105"/>
            Good fortune prophecy to me, but ill, <lb/>
            And ever with a mind against me set <lb/>
            Inventest prophecies to cross my will; <lb/>
            And now again you fain would have it thought, <lb/>
            Because I would not let Chryseis go, <lb n="110"/>
            The gifts refusing which her father brought, <lb/>
            Therefore this plague was sent amongst us now. <lb/>
            With Clytemnestra she may well contend, <lb/>
            For person, or for beauty, or for art; <lb/>
            Yet so, to send her home I do intend, <lb n="115"/>
            For of our loss I bear the greatest part. <lb/>
            But you must then some prize for me provide; <lb/>
            Shall no man unrewarded go but I ? <lb/>
            This said, Achilles to the king replied, <lb/>
            Atrides, that on booty have your eye, <lb n="120"/>
            You know divided is, or sold the prey <lb/>
            Which never can resumed be again. <lb/>
            But send her home. When we shall have sack'd Troy, <lb/>
            Your loss shall be repaid with triple gain. <lb/>
            No, said Atrides, that I never meant; <lb n="125"/>
            D'ye think 'tis fit that you your shares retain? <lb/>
            And only mine unto the God be sent, <lb/>
            That unrewarded none but I remain ? <lb/>
            I thought it reason th' Argives should collect <lb/>
            Amongst themselves the value (how they list) <lb n="130"/>
            And give it me before they did expect <lb/>
            This prize of mine should be by me dismist. <lb/>
            If they'll do that, 'tis well. If not, I'll go <lb/>
            To your, or Ajax, or Ulysses' tent, <lb/>
            And take his prize, and right myself will so, <lb n="135"/>

            Let's ready make a ship with able rowers, <lb/>
            And th' hecatomb, to go with fair Chryseis, <lb/>
            And, to direct, one of the counsellors ; <lb n="140"/>
            Ajax, Idomeneus, Ulysses, or <lb/>
            Yourself may go, Achilles, if you please, <lb/>

            And, if you can, th' offended God appease. <lb/>
            0 impudence ! Achilles then replied, <lb n="145"/>
            What other of th' Achæans willingly, <lb/>
            Will, when you only for yourself provide, <lb/>
            Go where you bid, or fight with th' enemy ? <lb/>
            Against the Trojans I no quarrel have. <lb/>
             In Pthia plund'ring they were never seen, <lb n="150"/>
            Nor ever thence my kine or horses drave, <lb/>
            Nor could; the sea and great hills are between. <lb/>
            Only for yours and Menelaus' sake, <lb/>
            To honour gain for you we came to Troy, <lb/>
            Whereof no notice, dogs-head, now you take, <lb n="155"/>
            But threaten me my prize to take away ; <lb/>
            Which by my labour I have dearly bought, <lb/>
            And by th' Achæans given me has been. <lb/>
            And when the city Troy we shall have got, <lb/>
            Your share will great, mine little be therein. <lb n="160"/>
            For though my part be greatest in the pain, <lb/>
            Yet when unto division we come, <lb/>
            You will expect the greatest part o' th' gain, <lb/>
            And that with little I go weary home. <lb/>
            Then farewell Troy. To sea I'll go again, <lb n="165"/>
            And back to Pthia. Then it will be seen <lb/>
            When you without me shall at Troy remain, - <lb/>
            What honour and what riches you shall win. <lb/>
            Go when you will, said Agamemnon, fly, <lb/>
            I'll not entreat you for my sake to stay. <lb n="170"/>
            When you are gone more honoured shall be I, <lb/>
            Nor Jove, I hope, will with you go away. <lb/>
            In you I shall but lose an enemy <lb/>
            That only loves to quarrel and to fight. <lb/>
            The Gods have given you strength I not deny. <lb n="175"/>
            Go 'mongst your myrmidons and use your might. <lb/>
            I care not for you, nor your anger fear, <lb/>
            For after I have sent away Chryseis, <lb/>
            And satisfi'd the God, I'll not forbear <lb/>
            To fetch away from you the fair Briseis, <lb n="180"/>
            And that by force. For I would have you see <lb/>
            How much to mine inferior is your might, <lb/>
            And others fear t' oppose themselves to me. <lb/>
            This swell'd Achilles' choler to the height, <lb/>
            And made him study what to do were best, <lb n="185"/>

            His sword was drawn, yet doubtful was his will. <lb/>
            But Juno, that of both of them took care, <lb/>
            Sent Pallas down, who coming stood behind <lb n="190"/>
            Achilles, and laid hold upon his hair. <lb/>
            Whereat Achilles wond'ring in his mind, <lb/>
            Turn'd back, and by the terror of her eyes <lb/>
            Knew her ; but by none else perceiv'd was she. <lb/>
            Come you, said he, to see the injuries <lb n="195"/>
            That are by Agamemnon done to me ? <lb/>
            So great, 0 Goddess Pallas, is his pride, <lb/>
            As I believe it cost him will his life. <lb/>
            I hither came, Athena then reply'd, <lb/>
            To put an end to this unlucky strife. <lb n="200"/>
            From heaven I hither was by Juno sent, <lb/>
            That loves you both, and of you both takes care, <lb/>

            But as for evil words you need not spare. <lb/>
            For the wrong done you he shall trebly pay <lb n="205"/>
            Another time. Hold then. Your sword forbear. <lb/>
            I must then, said Achilles, you obey, <lb/>
            Tho'wrong'd. Who hears not Gods, the Gods not hear. <lb/>
            This said, his mighty sword again he sheath'd, <lb/>
            And Pallas up unto Olympus flew. <lb n="210"/>
            Achilles still nothing but choler breath'd, <lb/>
            And Agamemnon thus revil'd anew. <lb/>
            Dog's-face, and drunkard, coward that thou art, <lb/>
            That hat'st to lead the people out to fight; <lb/>
            Nor yet to lie in ambush hast the heart, <lb n="215"/>
            And painfully watch in the field all night. <lb/>
            But thou to take from other men their due, <lb/>
            Safe lying in the camp, more pleasure hast. <lb/>
            But fools they are that ruled are by you, <lb/>
            Or else this injury had been your last. <lb n="220"/>
            But this I'll say, and with an oath make good. <lb/>
            (Now by this sceptre, which hath left behind <lb/>
            The stock whereon it once grew in the wood, <lb/>
            And never more shall have nor leaf nor rind, <lb/>
            And by Achæan princes now is borne <lb n="225"/>
            By whom Jove's laws to th' people carried be.) <lb/>
            You hear now what a great oath I have sworn : <lb/>
            If ere the Acheans shall have need of me, <lb/>
            And Agamemnon cannot them relieve, <lb/>
            When Hector fills the field with bodies slain, <lb n="230"/>
            And Agamemnon only for them grieve, <lb/>
            They my assistance wish for shall in vain. <lb/>
            This said, Achilles threw the sceptre down <lb/>
            That stuck all over was with nails of gold ; <lb/>
            And Nestor rose, of Pyle that wore the crown, <lb n="325"/>

            Two ages he in battle honour gained. <lb/>
            For all that while he youthful was and strong, <lb/>
            And with the third age now in Pyle he reign'd. <lb n="240"/>
            What grief t' Achæa coming is, said he, <lb/>
            0 Gods, what joy to Priam and his seed, <lb/>
            How glad will all the Trojans be to see <lb/>
            You two, that all the rest in pow'r exceed, <lb/>
            With your own hands shed one another's blood ! <lb n="245"/>
            I elder am, do then as I advise. <lb/>
            For I conversed have with men as good, <lb/>
            That yet my counsel never did despise. <lb/>
            Perithous and Dryas were great men, <lb/>
            And Polyphemus and Exadius, <lb n="250"/>
            Such as for strength I ne'er shall see again ; <lb/>
            And so were Cæneus, and Theseus, <lb/>
            The strongest of mankind were these, and slew <lb/>
            The strongest of wild beasts that haunt the wood. <lb/>
            These strong men I conversed withal and knew ; <lb n="255"/>
            And with them also I did what I could. <lb/>
            With these no other could contend in fight. <lb/>
            Yet they from Pyle thought fit to call me forth <lb/>
            Far off; nor ever did my counsel slight. <lb/>
            Think not therefore my counsel nothing worth. <lb n="260"/>
            Atrides take not from him, though you can, <lb/>
            The damsel which the Greeks have given him. <lb/>
            Forbear the king, Pelides. For the man <lb/>
            Whom Jove hath crown'd is made of Jove a limb. <lb/>
            Though you be strong, and on a Goddess got, <lb n="265"/>
            Atrides is before you in command. <lb/>
            Atrides, be but you to peace once brought, <lb/>
            T' appease Achilles I will take in band, <lb/>
            Who is (while we are lying here) our wall. <lb/>
            To this Atrides answered again, <lb n="270"/>
            I nothing can deny of this at all. <lb/>
            But he amongst us thinks he ought to reign, <lb/>
            And give the law to all as he thinks fit. <lb/>
            But I am certain that shall never be. <lb/>
            He well can fight ; the Gods have granted it, <lb n="275"/>
            But they ne'er taught him words of infamy. <lb/>
            Then interrupting him, Achilles said, <lb/>
            I were a wretch and nothing worth indeed, <lb/>
            If I whatever you command obey'd. <lb/>
            I will no more to what you say take heed. <lb n="280"/>
            But this I tell you, if you take away <lb/>
            The damsel which is mine by your own gift, <lb/>
            I do not mean for that to make a fray <lb/>
            Amongst the Greeks, or once my hand to lift. <lb/>
            Fetch her yourself, Atrides, but take heed <lb n="285"/>

            Patroclus with him and his other friends. <lb/>

            Ulysses went commander of the men. <lb n="295"/>
            And swiftly then the ship cuts out her way. <lb/>
            And then Atrides th' army purifi'd, <lb/>
            And threw into the sea the purgament. <lb/>
            Then sacrific'd o' th' sands by the sea side <lb/>
            A hecatomb. (To heaven up went the scent, <lb n="300"/>
            And busy were the people.) But the king <lb/>
            Still on his quarrel with Achilles thought, <lb/>
            And how Briseis from his tent to bring. <lb/>
            For what he threatened he had not forgot. <lb/>
            But sent Talthybius and Eurybates <lb n="305"/>
            T' Achilles' tent to fetch Briseis thence. <lb/>
            (Two public servants of the king were these, <lb/>
            Ordained to carry his commandments.) <lb/>
            If he refuse, said he, to let her go, <lb/>
            I'll thither go myself with greater force <lb n="310"/>
            And take her thence, whether he will or no. <lb/>
            Which, angry as he is, will vex him worse. <lb/>
            The messengers, though not well pleased, went <lb/>
            Unto the fleet o' th' Myrmidons, and there <lb/>
            They found Achilles sitting by his tent. <lb n="315"/>
            Well pleas'd he was not. And they silent were, <lb/>
            And stood still, struck with fear and reverence. <lb/>
            Achilles seeing that, spake first, and said, <lb/>
            Come near. To me you have done no offence. <lb/>
            Go you, Patroclus, and lead forth the maid, <lb n="320"/>
            And give her to these men, that they may be <lb/>
            To Gods and men, and to th' unbridled man, <lb/>
            My witnesses, when they have need of me <lb/>
            To save th' Achæans, which he never can. <lb/>
            For what can he devise of any worth ? <lb n="325"/>
            Or how can he the Greeks in battle save ? <lb/>
            This said, Patroclus led Briseis forth, <lb/>
            And to Atrides' messengers her gave. <lb/>
            She with them went, though much against her heart. <lb/>
            Achilles from his friends went off and pray'd. <lb n="330"/>
            And sitting with his face to the sea apart <lb/>
            Weeping, unto his mother Thetis said, <lb/>

            Except King Agamemnon. He alone, <lb/>
            And with sharp language from the fleet him sent. <lb/>
            Away the old man goes, and as he went, <lb n="365"/>
            Against the Greeks he to Apollo pray'd ; <lb/>
            Who heard him, and the plague amongst them sent, <lb/>
            Which daily multitudes of them destroy'd. <lb/>
            Of which the prophet, being ask'd the cause, <lb/>
            Said, 'twas for th' injury to Chryses done. <lb n="370"/>
            I mov'd to send her back. Then angry was <lb/>
            Atrides, though beside Atrides, none. <lb/>
            And though he too has sent her now away, <lb/>
            Yet what he threaten'd he has brought to pass. <lb/>
            His officers from me have fore'd my prey, <lb n="375"/>
            And Agamemnon now Briseis has. <lb/>
            And now, if ever, let me have your aid, <lb/>
            If you have holpen Jove with word or deed ; <lb/>
            (For in my father's house you oft have said, <lb/>
            That heretofore you stood him in great stead, <lb n="380"/>
            When other Gods to bind him had decreed, <lb/>
            Juno and Neptune, Pallas and the rest, <lb/>
            You to him came and from his bonds him freed. <lb/>
            For up you fetch'd Briareus, the best <lb/>
            Of Titans all, whom men Ægæom call. <lb n="385"/>
            The gods Briareus, with a hundred hands, <lb/>

            Put Jove in mind of this, and him intreat <lb/>
            The Trojan hands to fortify in fight, <lb n="390"/>
            And to repel the Greeks with slaughter great, <lb/>
            That in their goodly king they may delight, <lb/>
            And Agamemnon count what he hath won <lb/>
            By doing such dishonour to the best <lb/>
            Of th' Argives, and that has such service done. <lb n="395"/>
            Ay me, said Thetis, would you could here rest <lb/>
            Unhurt, ungriev'd. For I have born you to <lb/>
            Short life. And not far from you is your fate. <lb/>
            And grievous 'tis to be dishonour'd too. <lb/>
            But I to Jove will all you say relate <lb n="400"/>
            When I go to Olympus. Till then stay, <lb/>
            And angry though you are, from war forbear. <lb/>
            To black moor-land the Gods went yesterday, <lb/>
            And twelve days hence again they will be there. <lb/>
            This said, the Goddess went away, and left <lb n="405"/>
            Her son Achilles with his anger striving, <lb/>
            For that he had been of his prize bereft. <lb/>
            And then Ulysses at the port arriving <lb/>
            Of Chryse, first his sails he furl'd, and stow'd <lb/>
            Them on the deck together with the mast ; <lb n="410"/>
            And with their oars their ship ashore they row'd, <lb/>
            And out their anchors threw ; and ty'd her fast. <lb/>
            And on the beach the men descending laid <lb/>
            The victims in good order on the sand. <lb/>
            When this was done, they disembark'd the maid. <lb n="415"/>
            And then Ulysses took her by the hand, <lb/>
            And brought her to the altar, where the priest <lb/>
            Her father stood, and to him spake, and said, <lb/>
            O Chryses, see, Atrides hath dismissed <lb/>
            Your daughter, and this hecatomb hath paid. <lb n="420"/>
            By Agamemnon we are hither sent <lb/>
            The same to offer, and t' Apollo pray, <lb/>
            That he accept it will, and be content <lb/>
            The sickness from the Greeks to take away. <lb/>
            This said, he put Chryseis to his hand, <lb n="425"/>
            And he with great contentment her receiv'd. <lb/>
            Then all with salt and barley ready stand, <lb/>
            And Chryses pray'd with hands to heaven upheav'd. <lb/>
            Hear me, Apollo, with the silver bow, <lb/>
            That dost in Tenedos and Cylla reign, <lb n="430"/>
            And heardst my pray'r against the Greeks; hear now, <lb/>
            And from them send the pestilence again. <lb/>
            When Chryses had thus to Apollo pray'd, <lb/>
            Then pray'd they all; and salt and barley threw <lb/>
            Upon the victims ; which they kill'd and flay'd. <lb n="435"/>

            And round about they cover them with fat, <lb/>
            And one part on the other laid again. <lb/>
            The priest himself came when they had done that, <lb n="440"/>
            And burnt them on a fire of cloven wood ; <lb/>
            And as they burning were pour'd on black wine. <lb/>
            Young men with spits five-branched by them stood. <lb/>
            When burnt the thighs were for the pow'r divine, <lb/>
            And entrails eaten, the rest cut in joints <lb n="445"/>
            Before the fire they roasted skilfully, <lb/>
            Pierced through with the spits that had five points ; <lb/>
            And took it up when roasted thoroughly. <lb/>
            When ended was their work, began the feast; <lb/>
            Where nothing wanting was of what was good. <lb n="450"/>
            And having thirst and hunger dispossest, <lb/>
            And filled with sweet wine the temp'rers stood. <lb/>
            Then round the cups were borne ; and all day long <lb/>
            Sitting they celebrated Phœbus' might, <lb/>
            And magnified his goodness in sweet song, <lb n="455"/>
            And he in his own praises took delight. <lb/>
            But when the sun had borne away his light, <lb/>
            Upon the sands they laid them down to sleep. <lb/>
            And when again Aurora came in sight, <lb/>
            Again they launch their ship into the deep. <lb n="460"/>
            A good fore-wind Apollo with them sent. <lb/>
            Then with her breast the ship the water tore <lb/>
            (Which by her down on both sides roaring went) <lb/>
            And soon arrived at the Trojan shore. <lb/>
            And there they drew her up again to land, <lb n="465"/>
            And ev'ry man went which way he thought best. <lb/>
            Achilles yet not able to command <lb/>
            The anger that still boiled in his breast, <lb/>
            No longer would the Greeks at council meet, <lb/>
            Nor with them any more to battle come ; <lb n="470"/>
            But sullen sat before his tent and fleet, <lb/>
            Wishing to see the Argives beaten home. <lb/>
            Twelve times the sun had risen now and set, <lb/>
            The Gods t' Olympus all returned were ; <lb/>
            Thetis her son's complaints did not forget, <lb n="475"/>
            But up she carried them to Jupiter. <lb/>
            Upon the highest top alone sat he <lb/>
            Of the great many-headed hill, and laid <lb/>
            One hand on's breast, th' other on his knee. <lb/>
            And in that posture thus unto him said, <lb n="480"/>

            Repay it now I pray you to my son, <lb/>

            Thus prayed she. But Jove made no reply. <lb/>
            Nor took she off her hands ; but pray'd anew ; <lb n="490"/>
            O Jove, my prayer grant me, or deny, <lb/>
            That I may know what power I have in you. <lb/>
            Then Jove much grieved, spake to her, and said, <lb/>
            'Twixt me and Juno 'twill a quarrel make. <lb/>
            For she before the Gods will me upbraid, <lb n="495"/>
            When she shall know the Trojans' part I take. <lb/>
            But go, lest she observe what you do here. <lb/>
            I'll give a nod to all that you have spoken, <lb/>
            That you may safely trust to and not fear. <lb/>
            A nod from me is an unfailing token. <lb n="500"/>
            This said, with his black brows he to her nodded, <lb/>
            Wherewith displayed were his locks divine ; <lb/>
            Olympus shook at stirring of his Godhead ; <lb/>
            And Thetis from it jump'd into the brine, <lb/>
            And Jupiter unto his house went down. <lb n="505"/>
            The Gods arose and waited on him thither : <lb/>
            But unto Juno it was not unknown <lb/>
            That he and Thetis had conferr'd together, <lb/>
            Who presently to Jove her husband went, <lb/>
            And angry him rebuk'd with language keen. <lb n="510"/>
            You that still in my absence tricks invent, <lb/>
            What God bath with you now in counsel been ? <lb/>
            Though unto me you hate to tell your mind. <lb/>
            Juno, said Jove, you must not hope to hear <lb/>
            All whatsoe'er it be, I have design'd. <lb n="515"/>
            But what I mean shall come unto the ear <lb/>
            Of all the Gods, you first of all shall know. <lb/>
            But what from all together I shall hide <lb/>
            Ask me no more, I will not tell you, though <lb/>
            My wife you be. Juno then thus repli'd. <lb n="520"/>
            Harsh Chronides, what words of yours are these! <lb/>
            To ask you questions I'll henceforth forbear, <lb/>
            And quietly let you do what you please. <lb/>
            But one thing I must tell you that I fear. <lb/>
            Thetis, I fear, has gotten your consent, <lb n="525"/>
            For her son's sake the Argives to oppress. <lb/>
            Suspect you can, said Jove, but not prevent, <lb/>
            Which doth but give me cause to love you less. <lb/>
            Though it be true, 'twas I would have it so. <lb/>
            Therefore sit still and do as I would have you. <lb n="530"/>
            Lest when my mighty hands about you go, <lb/>
            Nor all the other Gods in lieav'n shall save you. <lb/>
            Then Juno silent sat with grief and fear ; <lb/>
            And all the Gods i' th' house of Jove did grieve. <lb/>
            But Vulcan, the renoun'd artificer, <lb n="535"/>
            Stood up his mother Juno to relieve. <pb n="12"/>

            If you for mortals thus shall be at odds! <lb/>
            The tumult than the cheer will greater be. <lb/>
            What pleasure can this be unto the Gods ? <lb n="540"/>
            And though my mother wiser be than I, <lb/>
            Yet thus much I'll not doubt her to advise, <lb/>
            That with my father's will she would comply, <lb/>
            That no such quarrel may hereafter rise. <lb/>
            For by the roots he can the world pluck up. <lb n="545"/>
            Therefore I pray you mother speak him fair ; <lb/>
            He'll soon be pleas'd. Then filled he a cup <lb/>
            Of nectar sweet, and bore it to her chair ; <lb/>
            And to her said, mother, I pray you hold, <lb/>
            And do no more my father's choler move. <lb n="550"/>
            If you be beaten I shall but behold, <lb/>
            And grieve I am not strong enough for Jove. <lb/>
            I would have helpt you once, when by the foot <lb/>
            He threw me down to Lemnos from the sky. <lb/>
            All the day long I was a falling to't, <lb n="555"/>
            Where more than half dead taken up was I. <lb/>
            And there by th' Sincians I was taken up. <lb/>
            When Vulcan had his history told out, <lb/>
            His mother on him smil'd, and took the cup, <lb/>
            And to the Gods he nectar bore about. <lb n="560"/>
            And then the Gods laught all at once outright <lb/>
            To see the lame and sooty Vulcan skink. <lb/>
            And all the day from morning unto night <lb/>
            Ambrosia they eat, and nectar drink. <lb/>
            Apollo played, and alternately <lb n="565"/>
            The Muses to him sung. When night was come, <lb/>
            Then gently Sleep solicited each eye, <lb/>
            And to his house each God departed home. <lb/>
            And Jupiter went up unto the bed <lb/>
            Where he at other times was wont to lie <lb n="570"/>
            When sleep came on him, and laid down his head <lb/>

            And many projects in his mind he tost, <lb/>
            To grace Achilles, and the Greeks annoy. <lb/>
            At last a Dream he call'd. False Dream, said he, <lb n="5"/>
            Go, hie to Agamemnon's tent, and say, <lb/>
            Distinctly as you bidden are by me. <lb/>
            Bid him bring up his army now to Troy; <lb/>

            Up presently unto his head he went. <lb/>
            And in the shape of Nestor to him spake. <lb/>
            Sleep you, said he, Atrides ? 'Tis not fit <lb/>

            This said, the Dream departed. And the king <lb n="30"/>
            Believ'd it as an oracle, and thought <lb/>

            I'll first give them advice to go away, <lb n="65"/>
            As if there were no hope to gain the town. <lb/>
            But you must then be sure to make them stay. <lb/>
            This said, King Agamemnon sat him down, <lb/>
            And Nestor rose. Captains of th' host, said he, <lb/>
            This dream, had it been told b'another man, <lb n="70"/>
            Feigned and foolish would have seem'd to me. <lb/>
            But since the king is th' author (if we can) <lb/>
            Let us persuade the people to take arms. <lb/>
            And having said, began to lead away. <lb/>
            And now the people coming there in swarms. <lb n="75"/>
            For as the bees in a fair summer's day <lb/>
            Come out in clusters from the hollow rock, <lb/>
            And light upon the flow'rs that honey yield ; <lb/>
            So to th' assembly did the people flock, <lb/>
            And bristling stood with expectation fill'd. <lb n="80"/>
            When they sat down, it made the ground to sigh. <lb/>
            The lords nine criers then amongst them sent <lb/>
            To make them silent, or to drown their cry, <lb/>
            And from the press their chairs to defend. <lb/>
            With much ado at last they silent were. <lb n="85"/>
            Then Agamemnon took into his hand <lb/>
            His sceptre (which was made by Mulciber <lb/>
            For Jove to carry when he did command. <lb/>
            Jove gave it afterward to Mercury ; <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            And Mercury to Pelops gave the same. <note type="margin">LIB. II. </note> <note type="margin">The tempting of <lb/>
            the army. </note> <lb n="90"/>
            From Pelops it went down successively <lb/>
            To Atreus, and to Thyestes came. <lb/>
            From him it came to Agamemnon's hand, <lb/>
            Who many islands and all Argos sway'd.) <lb/>
            And leaning now upon it with his hand, <lb n="95"/>
            Unto the princes of the army said. <lb/>
            Servants of Mars, commanders of the Greeks, <lb/>
            0 what great trouble Jove involves me in ! <lb/>
            Disgracefully to send me home he seeks, <lb/>
            Although he told me I the town should win, <lb n="100"/>
            And now (when I have lost so many men) <lb/>
            It seems to play with men he takes delight. <lb/>
            What towns has he destroyed, and will again <lb/>
            Destroy still more, to exercise his might ? <lb/>
            For both to us and our posterity <lb n="105"/>
            'Twill be a great disgrace to go to Troy <lb/>
            With so great multitudes, and baffled be, <lb/>
            And nothing done again to come away. <lb/>
            If we and they should on a truce agree, <lb/>
            And one by one they muster up their men ; <lb n="110"/>
            And we should count how many tens we be, <lb/>
            And make one Trojan fill out wine for ten, <lb/>
            Many a ten would want a man to skink, <lb/>
            So much in number we the town exceed. <lb/>
            But when upon their many aids I think, <lb n="115"/>
            I wonder less that we no better speed. <lb/>
            Nine years are gone ; our cordage spoiled with rain: <lb/>
            Our ships are rotted, and our wives at home, <lb/>
            And children dear expect us back again. <lb/>
            Nor know we of the war what will become. <lb n="120"/>
            Come, then, and all agree on what I say, <lb/>
            Let's put to sea, and back t' Achæa fly. <lb/>
            We shall not win the town although we stay. <lb/>
            This said, the army with applauses high <lb/>
            Consented all (save those that had been by <lb n="125"/>
            In council of the princes of Achæa) <lb/>
            And moved were like to the billows high <lb/>
            That rolled are by some great wind at sea. <lb/>
            Or as, when in a field of well-grown wheat <lb/>
            The ears incline by a sharp wind opprest; <lb n="130"/>
            So bow'd the heads in this assembly great <lb/>
            When their consent they to the king exprest. <lb/>
            Then going to the ships cry'd Ha la la! <lb/>
            Great dust they raised, and encouraged <lb/>
            Each other to the sea his ship to draw, <lb n="135"/>
            And cleans'd the way to th' water from each bed ; <lb/>
            And straight unpropt their ships ; and to the sky <lb/>
            Went up the noise. Then Juno sent away <lb/>
            Pallas. Pallas, quoth she, the Greeks will fly, <pb n="16"/>

            And Helen leave behind, for whom at Troy <lb n="140"/>
            So many of the Greeks their lives have lost, <lb/>
            And stay'd so long in vain before the town. <lb/>
            And then will Priam and the Trojans boast, <lb/>
            Unless you quickly to the ships go down. <lb/>
            Go quickly then, try if you can prevail, <lb n="145"/>
            With hopeful words to stay them yet ashore, <lb/>
            And take away their sudden list to sail, <lb/>
            And let the ships lie as they did before. <lb/>
            This said, the Goddess leapt down to the ground, <lb/>
            From high Olympus, and stood on the sand <lb n="150"/>
            Where lay the Greeks. Ulysses there she found <lb/>
            Angry to see the people go from land. <lb/>
            Ulysses, said she, do you mean to fly, <lb/>
            And here leave Helen after so much cost <lb/>
            Of time and blood, and show your vanity; <lb n="155"/>
            And leave the Trojans of their rape to boast ? <lb/>
            Speak to each one, try if you can prevail <lb/>
            With hopeful words to stay them on the shore, <lb/>
            And take away this sudden list to sail, <lb/>
            And let the ships lie where they lay before. <lb n="160"/>
            Ulysses then ran t' Agamemnon's tent, <lb/>
            And took his staff (the mark of chief command) <lb/>
            And laying by his cloak to th' ships he went, <lb/>
            Amongst th' Achæans with that staff in's hand. <lb/>
            And when he met with any prince or peer, <lb n="165"/>
            He gently said, fear does not you become. <lb/>
            You should not only you yourself stay here, <lb/>
            But also others keep from flying home. <lb/>
            Atrides now did but the Argives try, <lb/>
            And those he sees most forward to be gone <lb n="170"/>
            Shall find perhaps least favour in his eye. <lb/>
            For of the secret council you were none. <lb/>
            Deep-rooted is the anger of a king, <lb/>
            To whom high Jove committed has the law, <lb/>
            And justice left to his distributing. <lb n="175"/>
            But when a common man he bawling saw, <lb/>
            He bang'd him with his staff, and roughly spake. <lb/>
            Be silent, and hear what your betters say. <lb/>
            For who of you doth any notice take <lb/>
            In council or in martial array? <lb n="180"/>
            Let one be king (we cannot all be kings) <lb/>
            To whom Jove gave the sceptre and the laws <lb/>
            To rule for him. Thus he the people brings <lb/>
            Off from their purpose, and to council draws. <lb/>
            Then to th' assembly back again they pass'd, <lb n="185"/>
            With noise like that the sea makes when it breaks <lb/>
            Against the shore, and quiet were at last. <lb/>
            Thersites only standeth up and speaks. <lb/>
            One that to little purpose could say much. <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            And what he thought would make men laugh would say. <note type="margin"> LIB. II. <lb/>

            And for an ugly fellow none was such <lb/>
            'Mongst all the Arrives that besieged Troy. <lb/>
            Lame of one leg he was ; and look'd asquint ; <lb/>
            His shoulders at his breast together came ; <lb/>
            His head went tapering up into a point, <lb n="195"/>
            With straggling and short hair upon the same. <lb/>
            Ulysses and Achilles most him hated, <lb/>
            For these two princes he us'd most to chide ; <lb/>
            And Agamemnon now aloud he rated, <lb/>
            And thereby anger'd all the Greeks beside. <lb n="200"/>
            What is't, Atrides, said he, stays you here ? <lb/>
            Your tent is full of brass ; women you have <lb/>
            The best of all that by us taken were, <lb/>
            For always unto you the choice we gave. <lb/>
            Or look you for more gold that yet may come <lb n="205"/>
            For ransom of some prisoner whom I <lb/>
            Or other Greeks shall take at Ilium, <lb/>
            Or for some young maid to keep privately ? <lb/>
            But kings ought not their private ease to buy <lb/>
            With public danger and a common woe. <lb n="210"/>
            Come, women of Achaia, let us fly, <lb/>
            And let him spend his gettings on the foe. <lb/>
            For then how much we help him he will know, <lb/>
            That has a better than himself disgrac'd. <lb/>
            But that Achilles is to anger slow, <lb n="215"/>
            That injury of his had been his last. <lb/>
            This said, Ulysses straightway to him went, <lb/>
            And with sour look, and bitter language said, <lb/>
            Prater, that to thyself seems eloquent, <lb/>
            How darest thou alone the king t' upbraid ? <lb n="220"/>
            A greater coward than thou art there's none <lb/>
            'Mongst all the Greeks that came with us to Troy. <lb/>
            Else 'gainst the king thy tongue would not so run. <lb/>
            Thou seek'st but an excuse to run away. <lb/>
            Because we know not how we shall come off <lb n="225"/>
            As yet from Troy, must you the king upbraid, <lb/>
            And at the princes of the army scoff, <lb/>
            As if they too much honour to him paid ? <lb/>
            But I will tell you one thing, and will do't. <lb/>
            If here again I find you fooling thus, <lb n="230"/>
            Then from my shoulders let my head be cut, <lb/>
            Or let me lose my son Telemachus, <lb/>
            If I not strip you naked to the skin, <lb/>
            And send you soundly beaten to the ships <lb/>
            With many stripes and ugly to be seen. <lb n="235"/>
            This said, he basted him both back and hips. <lb/>
            Thersites shrugg'd, and wept, sat down, and had <lb/>
            His shoulders black and blue, dy'd by the staff; <lb/>
            Look'd scurvily. The people that were sad <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <pb n="18"/>

            But just before, now could not choose but laugh. <lb n="240"/>
            And, oh, said one t' another standing near, <lb/>
            Ulysses many handsome things has done, <lb/>
            When we in council or in battle were, <lb/>
            A better deed than this is he did none, <lb/>
            That has so silenced this railing knave, <lb n="245"/>
            And of his peevish humour stay'd the flood, <lb/>
            As he no more will dare the king to brave. <lb/>
            And then to speak Ulysses ready stood. <lb/>
            Where Pallas like a crier did appear, <lb/>
            And standing by him silence did command, <lb n="250"/>
            That also they that sat far off might hear. <lb/>
            Then spake he, with the sceptre in his hand. <lb/>
            The people, 0 Atrides, go about <lb/>
            To put you on an act will be your shame, <lb/>
            Forgetting what they promised setting out, <lb n="255"/>
            Not to return till Troy they overcame. <lb/>
            But now like widow-women they complain, <lb/>
            Or little children longing to go home. <lb/>
            To be from home a month, it is a pain <lb/>
            To them that to their loving wives would come. <lb n="260"/>
            To sea they'd go though certain to be tost <lb/>
            By many a sturdy wind upon the same. <lb/>
            But they have now lain here nine years almost; <lb/>
            I cannot therefore say they are to blame. <lb/>
            But certainly after so long a stay <lb n="265"/>
            'Tis very shameful empty back to go. <lb/>
            Let us at least abide till know we may <lb/>
            Whether what Chalchas said be true or no. <lb/>
            For this we all know and are witnesses <lb/>
            (Excepting only those that since are dead) <lb n="270"/>
            When we from Aulis went to pass the seas, <lb/>
            And by contrary winds were hindered, <lb/>
            That there we to the gods did sacrifice <lb/>
            Upon an altar close unto a spring, <lb/>
            That of a plane-tree at the root did rise : <lb n="275"/>
            And how we saw there a prodigious thing. <lb/>
            A mighty serpent with a back blood-red <lb/>
            From out the spring glided up to the tree, <lb/>
            The boughs whereof were cv'ry way far spread. <lb/>
            On th' utmost chanc'd a sparrow's nest to be. <lb n="280"/>
            Young ones were in it eight, with th' old one nine ; <lb/>
            The old one near the nest stay'd fluttering, <lb/>
            And grievously the while did cry and whine. <lb/>
            At last the serpent catcht her by the wing. <lb/>
            And when the serpent had devour'd all nine, <lb n="285"/>
            He presently was turn'd into a stone ; <lb/>
            That we might see from Jove it was a sign <lb/>
            Of what should afterward at Troy be done. <lb/>
            We were amaz'd so strange a thing to see, <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            Till Chalchas rose and did the same explain. <note type="margin"> LIB. II. </note><note type="margin"> The tempting of <lb/>
            the army, </note> <lb n="290"/>
            This is a certain sign from Jove, said he, <lb/>
            That he intends to do the like again. <lb/>
            For as the snake devoured nine birds in all; <lb/>
            So nine years long we shall make war at Troy, <lb/>
            And after nine years Ilium shall fall. <lb n="295"/>
            But in the tenth year we shall come away. <lb/>
            This then said Chalchas ; and all hitherto <lb/>
            Is come to pass. Therefore Achæans stay, <lb/>
            Since nothing here remaineth now to do, <lb/>
            But overcoming the old town of Troy. <lb n="300"/>
            This said, the people made a mighty noise, <lb/>
            Which bounding from the ships was twice as great, <lb/>
            Sounding of nothing but Ulysses' praise. <lb/>
            And up then rose old Nestor from his seat. <lb/>
            Fie, fie, said he, why sit we talking here ? <lb n="305"/>
            Where are your promises, and whither gone <lb/>
            Our oaths and vows ? To what end did we swear ? <lb/>
            Where be the bands that we rely'd upon ? <lb/>
            What good will't do to sit upon the shore, <lb/>
            How long soever be our time to stay ? <lb n="310"/>
            Hold fast, Atrides, as you did before <lb/>
            The power you have ; and lead us up to Troy. <lb/>
            A man or two you safely may neglect, <lb/>
            Though they dissent and secret counsel take. <lb/>
            For they'll be able nothing to effect, <lb n="315"/>
            Before to Argos our retreat we make, <lb/>
            And know if Jove have spoken true or no. <lb/>
            For when we went aboard to go for Troy, <lb/>
            Jove light'ned to the right hand, which all know <lb/>
            A sign of granting is for what we pray. <lb n="320"/>
            Let none of you long therefore to be gone, <lb/>
            Till of some Trojan's wife he hath his will, <lb/>
            And ta'en a not unfit revenge upon <lb/>
            The Trojans that have Helen us'd as ill. <lb/>
            But he that for all this is fiercely bent <lb n="325"/>
            On going home, and thinks that counsel best, <lb/>
            And lays hand on his ship, let him be sent <lb/>
            Down into Erebus before the rest. <lb/>
            But you, 0 king, think well, and take advice <lb/>
            First into tribes the army to divide, <lb n="330"/>
            And tribes again into fraternities, <lb/>
            That tribe may tribe and fellow fellow aid. <lb/>
            The leaders and the soldiers then you'll know <lb/>
            Which of them merits praise, and which is naught. <lb/>
            And if the town you do not overthrow, <lb n="335"/>
            Whether on us or Jove to lay the fault. <lb/>
            To this Atrides answer made and said, <lb/>
            O Nestor, father, you exceed all men <lb/>
            In giving counsel. Would the Gods me aid <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <pb n="20"/>

            Let ev'ry man now sharpen well his spear, <lb/>
            His buckler mend, and give his horses meat, <lb n="350"/>
            And look well to his chariot everywhere, <lb/>
            That we may fight all day without retreat, <lb/>
            For we shall fight I doubt not all day long, <lb/>
            And never cease as long as we can see. <lb/>
            Of many a shield sweaty will be the thong, <lb n="355"/>
            And spear upon the hand lie heavily; <lb/>
            And many horses at the chariot sweat. <lb/>
            But he that willingly to avoid the fight <lb/>
            Shall stay behind, or to the ships retreat, <lb/>
            His body shall be food for dog and kite. <lb n="360"/>
            This said, the people pleas'd with what was spoken, <lb/>
            Approved the same with shouts, as loud as when <lb/>
            Betwixt great waves and rocks the sea is broken. <lb/>
            Then from the assembly they return again. <lb/>
            And at their ships they sacrifice and pray <lb n="365"/>
            Each one to th' God in whom he trusted most, <lb/>
            That he might by his favour come away <lb/>
            Alive, with whole limbs from the Trojan host. <lb/>
            But Agamemnon sacrific'd a steer <lb/>
            To Jove, of five years old, and to the feast <lb n="370"/>
            Call'd such as in the army princes were, <lb/>
            Or held to be for chivalry the best, <lb/>
            Nestor, Idomeneus, two Ajaces, <lb/>

            And Menelaus thither came unbid. <lb/>
            For well he knew his brother would be sad. <lb/>
            About the victim then th' assembly stands, <lb/>
            And in their hands they salt and barley had. <lb/>
            Then pray'd Atrides holding up his hands ; <lb n="380"/>

            And Jove was with his sacrifice content. <lb/>

            But from the altar they it first withdrew. <lb/>
            The thighs they slit, and fat upon them laid. <lb/>
            And burnt them in a fire of cloven wood ; <lb/>
            The entrails o'er the fire they broiled eat, <lb/>
            The rest they roast on spits that by them stood ; <lb n="395"/>
            And when they roasted were, fell to their meat. <lb/>
            When the desire of meat and drink was gone, <lb/>
            Nestor stood up, and to Atrides said, <lb/>
            Let us no longer leave the work undone, <lb/>
            Which Jupiter himself has on us laid. <lb n="400"/>
            Let's call the Greeks together out of hand, <lb/>
            That we may make them ready for the war. <lb/>
            Atrides then to th' criers gave command <lb/>
            T' assemble them. They soon assembled are. <lb/>
            And then the princes went into the field, <lb n="405"/>
            And them in tribes and in fraternities <lb/>
            Distinguished. And Pallas with her shield, <lb/>
            (An undecaying shield and of great price, <lb/>
            Rais'd at the brim with orbs of beaten gold <lb/>
            An hundred, worth an hundred cows at least.) <lb n="410"/>
            With this the Goddess went, to make them bold, <lb/>
            Courage inspiring into ev'ry breast. <lb/>
            And now their hearts are all on fire to fight, <lb/>
            And vanished is the thought of their returning. <lb/>
            And such as of a mountain is the sight <lb n="415"/>
            Upon whose top a large thick wood stands burning ; <lb/>
            Such, as they marching were, the splendour was, <lb/>
            And seemed to reach up unto the sky, <lb/>
            Reflected from so many arms of brass <lb/>
            Bright and new polished unto the eye. <lb n="420"/>

            Of all th' Achæans by a Trojan hand, <lb n="635"/>
            And left his wife to tear her hair in vain, <lb/>
            His house at Phylace half finished. <lb/>

            Under Eumelus these were put to sea. <lb/>
            From rugged Olizon and Melibœa, <lb n="645"/>
            The towns Methone and Thomacia sent <lb/>
            Seven ships of fifty oars apiece to sea, <lb/>
            And Philoctetes their commander went. <lb/>
            But him the Achæans left in Lemnos isle, <lb/>

            And of his ships Medon took charge the while. <lb/>

            From Tricca then, and from Methone steep, <lb/>
            And from Oechalia (seat of Euritus), <lb/>
            Thirty good ships to Troy went o'er the sea, <lb n="655"/>
            By Machaon led and Podalirius, <lb/>
            Two skilful sons of AEsculapius. <lb/>
            From chalky Titanus Hyperia, and <lb/>
            Astirius, and from Ormenius, <lb/>
            Eurypilus did forty ships command. <lb n="660"/>
            And from the towns Argissa and Gyrtone, <lb/>
            From Oloosson, Orthe on the Hill, <lb/>
            With those that sent were from the town Elone, <lb/>
            So many went as forty ships did fill. <lb/>
            And had two leaders. Polypœtes one, <lb n="665"/>
            Son of Perithous the son of Jove, <lb/>
            And gotten by him was the day whereon <lb/>
            He and the Lapiths 'gainst the Centaurs strove, <lb/>
            And drave them from the mountain Pelion. <lb/>
            The other leader was Leontius, <lb n="670"/>
            Whose father was Capaneus, who the son <lb/>
            Was of the valiant Lapith Cœneus. <lb/>
            The Ænians and Perrhibœans bold <lb/>
            Did two-and-twenty good black ships set out, <lb/>
            From hollow Cyphus, and Dodona cold, <lb n="675"/>
            And other habitations about <lb/>
            The pleasant river Titaretius, <lb/>
            That into Peneus runs, but doth not mix, <lb/>
            But glides like oil at top of Peneus, <lb/>
            For Titaretius is a branch of Styx. <lb n="680"/>
            These Gonneus led. Then the Magnesians sent <lb/>
            From towns upon the banks of Peneus, <lb/>
            And sides of Pelion mountain eminent, <lb/>
            Forty good ships under swift Prothous. <lb/>
            These were the leaders of the Achæan forces. <lb n="685"/>
            O Goddess, tell me now who was the best <lb/>
            In battle of the leaders, and whose horses <lb/>
            In swiftness and in force excell'd the rest. <lb/>

            Nor other horses could with his compare. <lb/>
            But at his ships he discontented stayed, <lb/>

            Whilst on the beach idle his soldiers play'd <lb n="700"/>

            The horses loosely wander'd here and there <lb/>
            Amongst the people, and had riders none, <lb/>
            Or upon lote and cinquefoil feeding were. <lb/>
            But the Achæans to Scamander march'd <lb n="705"/>

            Then Jove unto the Trojans Iris sent, <lb/>
            Who old and young were then at Priam's gate <lb/>
            Assembled with the king in parliament. <lb n="715"/>
            Over their heads stood Iris as they sate. <lb/>
            Her voice was like to that of Priam's son <lb/>
            Polytes, that was watching at the tomb <lb/>
            Of old Æsuites, there to wait upon <lb/>
            The coming of the Greeks to Ilium. <lb n="720"/>
            Old man, said she, you love to hear men preach <lb/>
            As in a time of peace. But now 'tis war. <lb/>
            The Greeks no more lie idle on the beach, <lb/>

            As sands by the sea-side, or leaves in spring. <lb n="725"/>

            Phœbus himself had given him a bow, <lb n="755"/>

            In prophecy, and both of them forbad <lb/>

            But Fate a greater power with them had, <lb/>

            Under Pylæus and Hyppothous, <lb/>

            As when a lion finds a lusty prey, <lb/>
            A wild goat or a stag well pleased is, <lb/>

            And soon as he his person had well view'd, <lb/>
            Arm'd from his char'ot to the ground leap'd he. <lb/>
            Assured, as he thought, revenge to take. <lb/>
            But soon as Alexander once saw that, <lb n="30"/>
            He fled into the throng, as from a snake <lb/>
            Seen unawares, trembling and pale thereat. <lb/>
            Then Hector him with words of great disgrace <lb/>
            Reprov'd and said, Fine man and lover keen, <lb/>
            Cajoler, that confidest in thy face, <lb n="35"/>
            I would to God thou born hadst never been, <lb/>
            Or never hadst been married. For that <lb/>
            A great deal better had been of the twain, <lb/>
            Than to be scorn'd of men, and pointed at <lb/>
            For one that durst not his own word maintain. <lb n="40"/>
            O how the Greeks are laughing now to see <lb/>
            That so absurdly they themselves mistook, <lb/>
            Supposing you some mighty man to be <lb/>
            That art worth nothing, judging by your look. <lb/>
            Was't you to Lacedemon pass'd the deep, <lb n="45"/>
            And fetch'd fair Helen thence, the bane of Troy, <lb/>
            And now, when it concerns you her to keep, <lb/>
            You dare not in her husband's presence stay ? <lb/>
            For you would quickly know what kind of man <lb/>

            And Hector both to Greeks and Trojans spake. <lb/>
            May you be pleased on both sides to hear <lb/>
            The motion I from Alexander make. <lb/>
            Let arms, said he, on both sides be laid by, <lb n="85"/>
            And in the midst set him and Menelaus, <lb/>
            And which of them shall have the victory, <lb/>
            Be Helen his, with all the wealth she has. <lb/>
            And let the rest an oath on both sides take <lb/>
            The pacts agreed on not to violate. <lb n="90"/>
            When this was said, then Menelaus spake, <lb/>
            And both the armies with great silence sate. <lb/>
            Hear me too then, said Menelaus, who <lb/>
            By Alexander have been most offended. <lb/>
            If you'll do that which I advise you to, <lb n="95"/>
            The quarrel he began will soon be ended. <lb/>
            Which of us two shall fall in single fight, <lb/>
            Let him die only, and the rest agree. <lb/>
            Bring forth two lambs, one black, another white, <lb/>
            To t' Earth and Sun a sacrifice to be. <lb n="100"/>
            Another we will sacrifice to Jove. <lb/>
            And let the old King Priam present be, <lb/>
            (His proud sons think themselves all oaths above) <lb/>
            That what is sworn he may performed see. <lb/>
            No hold is to be taken of an oath <lb n="105"/>
            Which young men make, whose likings change like wind. <lb/>
            But old men can foresee what's good for both. <lb/>
            'Tis good for both that makes a contract bind. <lb/>
            These words did to both armies sweetly sound ; <pb n="32"/>

            They thought the worst was past; and up they tied <lb n="110"/>
            Their horses ; and their spears stuck in the ground, <lb/>
            With spaces left between them, but not wide. <lb/>
            Then Hector to the king two heralds sent, <lb/>
            To fetch the lambs, and Priam to implore <lb/>
            To take the oath. From Agamemnon went <lb n="115"/>
            Talthybius to the fleet to fetch two more. <lb/>
            Meanwhile to the fair Helen Iris came, <lb/>
            So like t' Antenor's wife Laodice, <lb/>
            King Priam's daughter, that she seem'd the same. <lb/>
            Quickly she found her ; for at work was she <lb n="120"/>
            Upon a double splendid web, wherein <lb/>
            Many a cruel battle she had wrought <lb/>
            The Trojans and th' incensed Greeks between, <lb/>
            That for her own sake only had been fought. <lb/>
            Come nymph, said Iris, see one battle more <lb n="125"/>
            Between the gallant men of Greece and Troy. <lb/>
            They fight not altogether as before, <lb/>
            But silent sit, and from their arms away. <lb/>
            Shields are their cushions, planted are their spears ; <lb/>
            Paris and Menelaus only fight. <lb n="130"/>
            Save these two no man any armour wears ; <lb/>
            And you his wife are, that has greatest might. <lb/>
            Thus Iris said, and her inspired anew <lb/>
            With love to Menelaus as before. <lb/>
            Then o'er her head a milk-white scarf she threw, <lb n="135"/>
            And out went weeping at the chamber door, <lb/>
            But not alone; two maidens follow'd her, <lb/>
            Fair Æthre Pittheus' child, and Clymene. <lb/>
            And quickly at the Scæan gate they were, <lb/>
            Where Priam sate ; and in his company <lb n="140"/>
            Were the old lords, Lampus and Clytius, <lb/>
            And Icetaon, and Ucalegon, <lb/>
            Antenor, Thymetes, and Panthous, <lb/>
            Whence both the armies they might look upon. <lb/>
            Old men they were, but had brave captains been, <lb n="145"/>
            And now for consultation prized were. <lb/>
            As soon as Helen came into their sight, <lb/>
            They whisper'd one another in the ear, <lb/>
            I cannot blame the man that for her strives, <lb/>
            Like an immortal God she is. Yet so, <lb n="150"/>
            Rather than we should hazard all our lives, <lb/>
            I should advise the king to let her go. <lb/>
            Thus said they one t' another. But the king <lb/>
            Call'd her and said, daughter, sit down by me, <lb/>
            (Not you, but the immortal powers bring <lb n="155"/>
            Upon the Trojans this calamity.) <lb/>
            And tell me who that great Achæan is. <lb/>
            I see some higher by the head than he, <lb/>
            But comelier man I never saw than this, <lb/>

            Oking, then answered Helen, to whom I <lb/>
            Of all men owe most reverence and fear, <lb/>
            Would I had rather chosen there to die, <lb/>
            Than to your son's ill counsel given ear, <lb/>
            Leaving my house, my child, and brothers two, <lb n="165"/>
            And all my sweet companions for his sake. <lb/>
            But since I cannot what is done undo, <lb/>
            Unto your question I'll now answer make. <lb/>
            The man you point to Agamemnon<lb/>
            A good king, and a valiant man in fight, <lb n="170"/>
            And brother to the husband is of this <lb/>
            Unworthy woman, me, that did him slight. <lb/>
            And Priam then the man admiring said, <lb/>
            Happy Atrides, great is thy command, <lb/>
            Whose soldiers though now very much decay'd, <lb n="175"/>
            In such great multitude before us stand. <lb/>
            At a great fight I was in Phrygia, <lb/>
            And brought to Otreus and Mygdon aid <lb/>
            Against the Amazons. I never saw <lb/>
            Till then, so many for a fight array'd, <lb n="180"/>
            As were the Amazons, upon the banks <lb/>
            Of Sangareus, and yet they fewer were, <lb/>
            Than are contained in the bristled ranks <lb/>
            Of th' armed Greeks that stand before us here. <lb/>
            Again Ulysses coming in his sight, <lb n="185"/>
            Tell me, said he, sweet daughter, who is this ? <lb/>
            He wants the head of Agamemnon's height, <lb/>
            But at the breast and shoulders broader is. <lb/>
            His arms lie still upon the ground ; but he <lb/>
            In no one certain place himself can keep, <lb n="190"/>
            But through the ranks and files runs busily, <lb/>
            Just as a ram runs in a fold of sheep. <lb/>
            To this Jove's daughter, Helen, thus replies. <lb/>
            Ulysses 'tis, the old Laertes' son, <lb/>
            Of Ithaca; to counsel and devise, <lb n="195"/>
            In all the army like him there is none. <lb/>
            0 Helen, said Antenor, you say right; <lb/>
            On your affair he once came into Troy <lb/>
            With Menelaus. I did them both invite <lb/>
            To sup with me; and in my house they lay. <lb n="200"/>
            I them compar'd. When at their audience <lb/>
            They both stood up, Atrides taller seem'd ; <lb/>
            Sitting Ulysses won most reverence, <lb/>
            And was amongst the people most esteem'd. <lb/>
            And when they were orations to make, <lb n="205"/>
            Atrides' words went easily and close, <lb/>
            For little he, but to the purpose spake, <lb/>
            Though th' younger man. But when Ulysses rose, <lb/>
            Upon the ground a while he fix'd his eyes, <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>

            Nor ever mov'd the sceptre in his hand; <lb n="210"/>
            You would have thought him sullen or unwise, <lb/>
            That did not yet his bus'ness understand. <lb/>
            But when his voice was raised to the height, <lb/>
            And like a snow upon a winter's day <lb/>
            His gentle words fell from him, no man might <lb n="215"/>
            With him compare; so much his words did weigh. <lb/>
            Then Priam seeing Ajax, ask'd again, <lb/>
            What Greek is that, that taller by the head <lb/>
            And shoulders is than all the other men ? <lb/>
            And Helen to the king thus answered, <lb n="220"/>
            Great Ajax; who of th' Argives is the sconce: <lb/>
            And he o' th' other side Idomeneus, <lb/>
            Who was the guest of Menelaus once, <lb/>
            And lodg'd at Lacedemon in his house. <lb/>
            And now I see the rest, and could them name. <lb n="225"/>
            But Castor I and Pollux cannot see. <lb/>
            Two princes are they, and well known by Fame, <lb/>
            And by one mother brothers are to me. <lb/>
            Did they not pass the sea? Yes sure they did <lb/>
            Come with the rest; but are asham'd of me. <lb n="230"/>
            And in the Argive fleet lie somewhere hid, <lb/>
            And will not in my shame partakers be. <lb/>
            Thus Helen said, because she could not tell <lb/>
            Whether her brothers were alive or dead. <lb/>
            But dead they were ; and, where they both did dwell, <lb n="235"/>
            In Lacedemon they were buried. <lb/>
            The heralds now the two lambs had brought in, <lb/>
            That for their sacrifice appointed were, <lb/>
            And full of noble wine a great goat skin. <lb/>
            Idæus with the golden cups stood near, <lb n="240"/>
            And pray'd the king to go down to the plain. <lb/>
            There stay for you the Greeks and Trojans both ; <lb/>
            A peace agreed on is ; but all in vain <lb/>
            Unless you also go and take the oath. <lb/>
            For Paris must with Menelaus fight, <lb n="245"/>
            And he must Helen and her wealth enjoy <lb/>
            Upon whose side the victory shall light; <lb/>
            The Greeks return ; and peace remain at Troy. <lb/>
            These words to th' old man's heart came cold as ice. <lb/>
            But straight he bade his coach made ready be. <lb n="250"/>
            The servants made it ready in a trice, <lb/>
            And up into 't Antenor went and he ; <lb/>
            And pass'd the Scæan gate into the plain. <lb/>
            And when they came near to Scamander's banks, <lb/>
            From out the coach alighted they again, <lb n="255"/>
            And stood between the adverse armies' ranks. <lb/>
            Then Agamemnon and Ulysses came, <lb/>
            And to the contract for the Greeks did swear. <lb/>
            And Priam and Antenor swore the same. <lb/>

            And poured water on the princes hands. <lb/>
            Atrides at his sword a knife did wear, <lb/>

            Cuts with it from their foreheads locks of hair, <lb/>
            Which by the heralds were distributed, <lb n="265"/>
            Till ev'ry leader part had of the hair. <lb/>
            The ceremonies being finished, <lb/>
            Atrides to the Gods then made this prayer. <lb/>
            0 mighty Jove, the monarch of the Gods, <lb/>
            0 glorious Sun, with thy all-seeing eye, <lb n="270"/>

            Beneath the earth, scourges of perjury, <lb/>
            Hear me, and be you witnesses of this. <lb/>
            If Menelaus be by Paris slain, <lb/>
            Let Helen and the wealth she has be his, <lb n="275"/>
            And to Achæa we return again. <lb/>
            If slain by Menelaus Paris be, <lb/>
            Let Helen with her wealth to Greece be sent <lb/>
            With some amends made for the injury, <lb/>
            To be of tli' wrong done an acknowledgment. <lb n="280"/>
            If such amends the Trojans will not make, <lb/>
            I will pursue the war, and here abide, <lb/>
            Till I the town of Ilium shall take, <lb/>
            Or till the Gods the quarrel shall decide. <lb/>
            This said, the victims with his knife he slew. <lb n="285"/>
            And sprawling there upon the place they lay. <lb/>
            Then into golden cups the wine they drew, <lb/>
            And pour'd it on the lambs. Then prayed they <lb/>
            Both Greeks and Trojans ; Jove, and pow'rs divine, <lb/>
            Who first to break this peace shall go about, <lb n="290"/>
            As poured on the victims is this wine, <lb/>
            So they, and their sons' brains be poured out. <lb/>
            Thus prayed they. But Jove that pray'r did slight. <lb/>
            Then Priam said, To Troy return will I. <lb/>
            It cannot please me to behold the fight. <lb n="295"/>
            For none but Gods know which of them shall die. <lb/>
            And then into the char'ot went again <lb/>
            He and Antenor, and drave t' Ilium, <lb/>
            And with them carried their victims slain. <lb/>
            Then in Ulysses and great Hector come, <lb n="300"/>
            And having measur'd out the lists, wherein <lb/>
            They were to fight, then the two lots they drew <lb/>
            For who to throw his spear should first begin. <lb/>
            And then the Greeks and Trojans pray'd anew. <lb/>

            Let him that of the war the author was <lb/>
            Be slain, and all the rest firm peace enjoy. <lb/>
            Then mighty Hector shook the skull of brass. <lb/>

            Which gave to Paris the right to begin. <lb n="310"/>
            Then down upon the ground the people sate <lb/>
            In order as their armour plac'd had been. <lb/>
            And Paris arm'd himself, and first puts on <lb/>
            His leg-pieces of brass, and closely ties, <lb/>
            That silver'd over were at th' ancle-bone. <lb n="315"/>
            And then his breast-plate to his breast applies. <lb/>

            As just upon him sat, as it had done <lb/>
            Upon Lycaon when he used it. <lb/>
            And next to this his good sword he puts on. <lb n="320"/>
            And then his broad shield and his helmet good. <lb/>
            And last of all a spear takes in his hand. <lb/>
            And in like armour Menelaus stood. <lb/>
            Then come they forth, and in the lists they stand. <lb/>
            And one did on another fiercely look. <lb n="325"/>
            (The people stupid sat 'twixt hope and fear.) <lb/>
            And when they come were nigh, their spears they shook. <lb/>
            But Paris was the first to throw his spear, <lb/>
            And threw, and smote the shield of Menelaus, <lb/>
            But through the mettle tough it passed not, <lb n="330"/>
            But turn'd, and bended at the point it was. <lb/>
            Then Menelaus was to throw by lot. <lb/>
            But first he prayed. Grant me, 0 Jove, said he, <lb/>
            That this my spear may Alexander slay, <lb/>
            Who was the first that did the injury; <lb n="335"/>
            That they who shall be born hereafter may <lb/>
            Not dare to violate the sacred laws <lb/>
            Of hospitality. Having thus said, <lb/>
            He threw his spear, which Paris' shield did pass, <lb/>
            And through his breast-plate quite, and there it stay'd; <lb n="340"/>
            But tore his coat. And there he had been dead, <lb/>
            But that his belly somewhat he drew back. <lb/>
            Then with his sword Atrides smote his head <lb/>
            Which arm'd was, and the sword in pieces broke. <lb/>
            Then Menelaus grieved at the heart, <lb n="345"/>
            Looking to heaven did on Jove complain. <lb/>
            0 Jove, that of the Gods most cruel art, <lb/>
            Broken my sword, my spear is thrown in vain. <lb/>
            Then suddenly laid hold on Paris' crest, <lb/>
            And to the Greeks to drag him did begin, <lb n="350"/>
            And Paris then was mightily distrest, <lb/>
            Choakt by the latchet underneath his chin. <lb/>
            And to the Greeks had dragg'd been by the heal, <lb/>
            If Venus te his aid had not come in, <lb/>
            Who broke the string and him delivered. <lb n="355"/>
            Atrides' conquest else had famous been. <lb/>
            Then to the Greeks the empty cask he threw. <lb/>

            When Paris to his chamber was convey'd, <lb/>
            His chamber which of perfumes sweetly smelt, <lb/>
            Then puts she on the form of an old maid <lb/>
            That Helen serv'd when she at Sparta dwelt. <lb/>
            And in that shape went to call Helen home, <lb n="365"/>
            That stood with other ladies of the town <lb/>
            Upon a tow'r. When she was to her come, <lb/>
            She gently with her finger stirr'd her gown. <lb/>
            Helen, said she, Paris has for you sent, <lb/>
            And on his glorious bed doth for you stay, <lb n="370"/>
            Not as a man that came from fight, but went <lb/>
            To dance, or from it were new come away. <lb/>
            Helen at this was mov'd, and mark'd her eyes, <lb/>
            And of her lovely neck did notice take, <lb/>
            And knew 'twas Venus though in this disguise; <lb n="375"/>
            And troubled as she was, thus to her spake. <lb/>
            Venus, why seek you to deceive me still, <lb/>
            Since Menelaus has the victory ? <lb/>
            Though I have wrong'd him, he receive me will, <lb/>
            And you come hither now to hinder me. <lb n="380"/>
            Whither dye mean to send me further yet; <lb/>
            To Phrygia or to Mœonia, <lb/>
            That there I may another husband get ? <lb/>
            You shall not me to Alexander draw. <lb/>
            Go to him you, and Heaven for ever quit; <lb n="385"/>
            Grieve with him; have a care the man to save, <lb/>
            And by his side continually to sit, <lb/>
            Till he his bride have made you, or his slave. <lb/>
            I will not to him go (for 'twere a shame) <lb/>
            Nor any longer meddle with his bed, <lb n="390"/>
            Nor longer bear the scorns, nor mocks, nor blame <lb/>
            Which from the wives of Troy I suffered. <lb/>
            Then Venus vext, Hussie, said she, no more <lb/>
            Provoke my anger. If I angry be, <lb/>
            And hate you as I loved you before, <lb n="395"/>
            The armies both will to your death agree. <lb/>
            This said, the beauteous Helen frighted was, <lb/>
            And with the Goddess went, who led the way, <lb/>
            And by the Trojan wives did quiet pass <lb/>

            I'th' rooms below at work her women were, <lb/>

            And when to Alexander they were near, <lb/>
            The Goddess unto Helen fetcht a chair. <lb/>
            Then sat she down, and look'd at him again. <lb n="405"/>
            You come from battle. I would you had there <lb/>
            And by my former husband's hand, been slain. <lb/>

            But had to Menelaus him betray'd. <lb/>
            So hateful to the Trojans was his sight. <lb/>
            Then stood King Agamemnon up and said, <lb/>
            Hear me ye Trojans and your aids. 'Tis plain <lb/>

            By Priam and his sons, that you should so <lb/>
            Fiercely the ruin of the town pursue ? <lb/>
            I think if you int' Ilium should go, <lb/>
            And eat up Priam and his children all, <lb/>
            And every Trojan in the town beside, <lb n="30"/>
            Man, woman, child alive within the wall, <lb/>
            Your anger will at last be satisfied. <lb/>
            Do as you please. It shall breed no contention <lb/>
            'Twixt you and me. But then remember this, <lb/>
            When I to raze a city have intention <lb n="35"/>
            That yours, and greatly in your favour is, <lb/>
            To let me do't without plea or request; <lb/>
            Since to give you your will I lose my own. <lb/>
            For Ilium I love above the rest, <lb/>
            Though under Heaven be many a goodly town. <lb n="40"/>
            For I by Priam and his people still <lb/>
            Have honoured been, my altars richly serv'd <lb/>
            With wine and sacrifices to my will, <lb/>
            Which is the honour to the Gods reserved. <lb/>
            To this the Goddess Juno then replied, <lb n="45"/>
            Three cities I prefer before the rest, <lb/>
            Argos, and Sparta, and Mycena wide. <lb/>
            Destroy you may which of them you think best, <lb/>
            If you see cause; I'll not stand in your way. <lb/>
            Or if I do, what mends can I have so ? <lb n="50"/>
            For since your power does mine so much outweigh, <lb/>
            It will be done whether I will or no. <lb/>
            But you ought not t'undo what I have done, <lb/>
            For I a Goddess am, and have the same <lb/>
            Parents, of whom you boast to be the son. <lb n="55"/>
            And further of your wife I bear the name, <lb/>
            Whom mortals and immortals all obey. <lb/>
            Then let us not in such things disagree. <lb/>
            But I to you, and you to me give way. <lb/>
            For of our two minds all the Gods will be. <lb n="60"/>
            Let Pallas to the army straight be sent <lb/>
            To make the Trojans first the peace to break. <lb/>
            And Jupiter to do so was content, <lb/>
            And did (as he was bid) to Pallas speak. <lb/>
            Pallas, said he, down to the armies go, <lb n="65"/>
            Let not this peace be by the Trojans kept. <lb/>
            When Pallas heard her father Jove say so, <lb/>
            Glad of the errand, from the sky she leapt, <lb/>

            The armies that were in the field array'd, <lb/>
            Both Greeks and Trojans wondered at the sight; <lb n="75"/>
            And one unto another next him said, <lb/>

            Pallas the form took of Laodocus, <lb/>
            Antenor's son, and went into the throng <lb/>
            O' th' Trojans to inquire for Pandarus. <lb/>
            At last she found him his own troops among, <lb/>
            That were of Lycaonia the bands, <lb n="85"/>
            And from Zeleia led by Pandarus <lb/>
            To Ilium. There PaRas by him stands <lb/>
            Like to Antenor's son; and to him thus: <lb/>
            Lycaon's son, says she, dare you let fly <lb/>
            A shaft at Menelaus ? For I know <lb n="90"/>
            The Trojans all would thank you, specially <lb/>
            Paris, the son of Priam, and bestow <lb/>
            Great presents on you if you should him kill. <lb/>
            Shoot at him then, and to Apollo pray, <lb/>
            The God of archers, that he help you will. <lb n="95"/>
            And vow a hecatomb of lambs to pay, <lb/>
            When to Zeleia safely you come home. <lb/>
            For there your people to Apollo vow. <lb/>
            When this was. said, the vain man overcome, <lb/>
            From off his shoulders taketh down his bow, <lb n="100"/>
            (Which did a lusty goat's head once adorn, <lb/>
            Which with a shaft he killed had among <lb/>
            The rocks, and taken from his head the horn, <lb/>
            Which was no less than sixteen handfuls long. <lb/>
            And to a fletcher gave it to be wrought, <lb n="105"/>
            Shaven, and polish'd, and gilt at the hand.) <lb/>
            This bow he bent; and lest the foe should know't, <lb/>
            He crouched down, and laid it on the sand. <lb/>
            But lest the Greeks should rush on him, before <lb/>
            He ready were to shoot, they that stood near, <lb n="110"/>
            Before him with their bucklers stood good store. <lb/>
            And being now delivered of that fear, <lb/>
            From out the quiver takes an arrow keen, <lb/>
            And new, well wing'd to carry mischief true, <lb/>
            Which shot before that time had never been. <lb n="115"/>
            But yet his vow before his arrow flew. <lb/>
            Phoebus, said he, if I Atrides slay; <lb/>
            As soon as I shall to Zelcia come, <lb/>
            I vow unto your deity to pay <lb/>

            Then to his breast he drew the leather string, <lb/>
            And to the bow returned the arrow head. <lb/>
            Out leapt the shaft, and as it went did sing <lb/>
            Amongst the throng, as pleas'd man's blood to shed. <lb/>
            And, Menelaus, now the Gods you blest, <lb n="125"/>
            And chiefly Pallas, that before you stood, <lb/>
            And turn'd the deadly arrow from your breast, <lb/>
            About as much as a kind mother could <lb/>
            From her child's face divert a busy fly; <lb/>
            And made it on the golden buckle fall, <lb n="130"/>
            Where of his breast-plate double was the ply, <lb/>
            And though it pass'd through buckle, plate, and all, <lb/>
            And girdle which his coat unto him bound, <lb/>
            The shaft into his body penetrated, <lb/>
            And made, though not a great one, yet a wound, <lb n="135"/>
            The force it went with being much abated; <lb/>
            Yet out the blood ran. As when ivory <lb/>
            Is stain'd with crimson, to adorn the cheeks <lb/>
            Of the proud steeds, and please the driver's eye, <lb/>
            Many a cavalier to have it seeks. <lb n="140"/>
            The dame that stain'd it then holds up the prize, <lb/>
            And keeps it by her as a precious thing; <lb/>
            So lovely seems the colour to her eyes, <lb/>
            As to be sold to none but to a king. <lb/>
            So look'd his body when the streams of blood <lb n="145"/>
            His iv'ry legs and insteps did defile. <lb/>
            But Agamemnon stiff with horror stood; <lb/>
            And so did Menelaus for a while. <lb/>
            But when he saw the arrow barbs appear ; <lb/>
            Above the nerve, his courage came again. <lb n="150"/>
            But Agamemnon, not yet out of fear, <lb/>
            Did of the Trojans' perjury complain. <lb/>
            Brother, said he, and took him by the hand, <lb/>
            Dear brother, 'tis the oath that has you slain, <lb/>
            Making you thus before the Trojans stand. <lb n="155"/>
            But sure I am the oath cannot be vain, <lb/>
            Confirmed with so great solemnity. <lb/>
            They shall, though late, pay for it with their lives ; <lb/>
            (For Jove ne'er fails to punish perjury) <lb/>
            Both they themselves, their children, and their wives. <lb n="160"/>
            For I well know the fatal day will come <lb/>
            To Priam, and to Priam's people all. <lb/>
            Jove will his black shield shake o'er Ilium, <lb/>
            And for this ugly action make it fall. <lb/>
            This, Menelaus, is a thing to come. <lb n="165"/>
            But what if of your wound you chance to die ? <lb/>
            The Argives straight will think of going home. <lb/>
            How by the Greeks then scorned shall be I! <lb/>

            Not mortal is the wound. 'Twixt me and death <lb/>
            My armour and the clasps stood, all of brass; <lb/>
            Besides a good tough girdle underneath. <lb/>
            Pray God 't be true, said he to Menelaus, <lb/>
            But we must send for a chirurgeon, <lb n="185"/>
            To mitigate with lenitives the pain. <lb/>
            Talthybius, said he, call Machaon, <lb/>
            And having found him quickly come again. <lb/>
            Tell him he must to Menelaus come, <lb/>

            This said, the herald went and looked about <lb/>

            Nor was it long before he found him out <lb n="195"/>
            With many targetiers environed. <lb/>
            You must, said he, to Menelaus come, <lb/>

            Trojan or Lycian, I know not whom, <lb/>
            That, with great grief to us, has honour got. <lb n="200"/>
            'Tis Agamemnon calls you. Then they pass <lb/>
            Together through the host, and hastened <lb/>
            Till they were come where Menelaus was <lb/>
            With many other lords encompassed. <lb/>
            There Machaon the arrow first pulls out. <lb n="205"/>
            (The barbs were broken as they came away) <lb/>
            Then took he off his armour and his coat. <lb/>
            Then sucked he the wound the blood to stay; <lb/>
            And laid on unguents to allay the pain. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the Trojans arm'd were coming in. <lb n="210"/>
            And then the Greeks were forc'd to arm again. <lb/>
            And Agamemnon's virtue now was seen. <lb/>
            He did not at their coming sleep nor start, <lb/>
            But speedily prepared for the fight, <lb/>
            And of a chief commander did the part, <lb n="215"/>
            His own commanders first to disaffright. <lb/>
            His horses and his chariot he sent off. <lb/>
            T' Eurymeaon, the son of Ptolemy, <lb/>
            The son of Pirus he gave charge thereof, <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            And bad him with it always to be nigh, <note type="margin"> LIB.IV. <lb/>
             </note><note type="margin"> The first battle. </note> <lb n="220"/>
            lo use when labour tired had his knees. <lb/>
            Through the great army then on foot he went, <lb/>
            And where them hasting to the fight he sees, <lb/>
            He gives them in few words encouragement. <lb/>
            On, Argives, and be sure Jove never fights <lb n="225"/>
            Against good men for such perfidious knaves, <lb/>
            But leave them will for food to dogs and kites, <lb/>
            And to their foes their wives and children slaves. <lb/>
            But where he saw the soldiers negligent, <lb/>
            His admonition was then severe. <lb n="230"/>
            Fie, Argives, what d' you fear ? To what intent <lb/>
            Stand you thus staring like a herd of deer ? <lb/>
            Just like so many deer that had been chased <lb/>
            O'er some great plain looking about they stay, <lb/>
            So stand you here like frighted deer amazed, <lb n="235"/>
            Till to our ships come down the troops of Troy, <lb/>
            To try if Jove will help you there or no. <lb/>
            Thus he commanding went the host throughout. <lb/>
            And when the martial Cretans he came<lb/>
            Where armed stood Idomeneus stout. <lb n="240"/>
            (Meriones the rear led, he the van) <lb/>
            And Agamemnon look'd on them with joy; <lb/>
            And to Idomeneus thus began. <lb/>
            Of all the Greeks that me assist at Troy <lb/>
            I value you the most, both in the war <lb n="245"/>
            And otherwise. And when at feast we drink, <lb/>
            Other men's cups by measure stinted are, <lb/>
            But yours, as mine, stands always full to th' brink. <lb/>
            The King of Crete replied, I shall, said he, <lb/>
            Continue still your good confederate, <lb n="250"/>
            As heretofore I promis'd you to be. <lb/>
            But go, and th' other leaders animate, <lb/>
            That we may with the Trojans quickly fight. <lb/>
            Then woe be to them, sure they are to die <lb/>
            Who of the Gods and sacred oaths make light. <lb n="255"/>
            Then on went Agamemnon joyfully; <lb/>
            And came to the quarters of the Ajaxes, <lb/>
            There armed both complete, and followed <lb/>
            With a huge multitude of Greeks he sees, <lb/>
            And ready to the battle to be led. <lb n="260"/>
            As when a shepherd from a hill espies <lb/>
            A full-charg'd cloud march tow'rds him in the deep, <lb/>
            It seems as black as pitch unto his eyes, <lb/>
            And makes him seek a shelter for his sheep; <lb/>
            So black the squadrons of the Ajaxes, <lb n="265"/>
            And horrible with thick and upright spears <lb/>
            T' Atrides seem, and well it did him please, <lb/>
            And both of them he thus commends and cheers. <lb/>
            O Ajaxes, expect not I should bid <pb n="44"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> The first battle. </note> <lb/>
            You hearten up your army for the fight; <lb n="270"/>
            'Tis done so well already, there's no need. <lb/>
            0 Jove, Apollo, Pallas, that I might <lb/>
            Find all the other leaders such as you, <lb/>
            We should not need from Argos long to stay <lb/>
            Ere we the town of Priam should subdue <lb n="275"/>
            And rifle. And this said, he went away, <lb/>
            And came to Nestor, who was ordering <lb/>
            His troops and bands of horse and foot, each one <lb/>
            Against the enemy encouraging. <lb/>
            And with him stood Alastor, Pelagon, <lb n="280"/>
            Hæmon, and Chromius, skilful men in war. <lb/>
            I’ th' front the char'ots and the horsemen were. <lb/>
            The most and best infantry placed are <lb/>
            (A hedge unto the battle in the rear.) <lb/>
            The middle ranks were filled up with those, <lb n="285"/>
            Upon whose courage he did least rely. <lb/>
            For these would fight because they could not choose; <lb/>
            Since they could neither back nor forward fly. <lb/>
            And Nestor to the horsemen spake. Let none, <lb/>
            Said he, before another go, to shew <lb n="290"/>
            His manhood or his skill. But all go on <lb/>
            At once. To single is to weaken you. <lb/>
            Further, If any of you should have need <lb/>
            To mount into another's chariot, <lb/>
            There let him use his spear; but still take heed <lb n="295"/>
            That with the horses reins he meddle not. <lb/>
            Our fathers have before us us'd these laws, <lb/>
            And thereby many cities level laid. <lb/>
            Thus Nestor taught them. Glad Atrides was, <lb/>
            And with great approbation to him said, <lb n="300"/>
            0 Nestor, that your arms were but as strong <lb/>
            As is your mind! But they're decay'd by age. <lb/>
            Or could you give your age to some man young, <lb/>
            And with the youngest of the foes engage. <lb/>
            Atrides, then said Nestor, so wish I. <lb n="305"/>
            Would I were as when Eruthalyon <lb/>
            I slew. But Gods' gifts come successively. <lb/>
            I then was young; and age is now come on. <lb/>
            But as I am I'll ride amongst my horse, <lb/>
            And as becomes an old man, give advice, <lb n="310"/>
            While they that may presume upon their force, <lb/>
            With spear in hand charge on their enemies. <lb/>
            Atrides pass'd on to th' Athenians <lb/>
            That by Menestheus commanded were. <lb/>
            And by these stood the Cephalonians <lb n="315"/>
            Ulysses' bands. Neither of these did hear <lb/>
            The clamour of the battle new begun, <lb/>
            But stood unmoved, because they did expect <lb/>
            Some greater troops of Greeks should first fall on. <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            For this Atrides grievously them check'd. <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. <lb/>
             </note><note type="margin"> The first battle. </note> <lb n="320"/>
            Menestheus, said he, son of a king, <lb/>
            And you the crafty man Ulysses, why <lb/>
            When you your men should to the battle bring, <lb/>
            Stand you here shrinking from the enemy ? <lb/>
            You hear the first when there will be a feast, <lb n="325"/>
            And stay for no man. For your messes are <lb/>
            Greater than other men's ; your wine the best, <lb/>
            And without stint. And therefore in the war <lb/>
            You should strive who should be the first to fight. <lb/>
            But now, though ten troops were before you there, <lb n="330"/>
            You would not be displeased with the sight. <lb/>
            These words came harshly to Ulysses' ear, <lb/>
            And with a frowning look, what's this, said he, <lb/>
            Are we not making all the haste we can ? <lb/>
            Telemachus his father you shall see <lb n="335"/>
            By and by fighting in the Trojan van, <lb/>
            And that this reprehension needless was. <lb/>
            But Agamemnon smiling then replied, <lb/>
            (Seeing his censure did not kindly pass) <lb/>
            Noble Ulysses, I meant not to chide, <lb n="340"/>
            Nor to direct you, that so skilful are. <lb/>
            For we are both of us of the same mind. <lb/>
            What's said amiss I shall again repair. <lb/>
            But let it now away go with the wind. <lb/>
            Then on he went and came to Diomed, <lb n="345"/>
            Whom mounted on his chariot he found <lb/>
            With Capaneus' son accompanied, <lb/>
            And other lords that him encompassed round. <lb/>
            Ay me, Tydides, wherefore stand you thus, <lb/>
            As if you for some bridge did look about. <lb n="350"/>
            You do not as your father Tydeus,, <lb/>
            Who still before his fellows leaped out. <lb/>
            So said they that had seen him at the war, <lb/>
            Which I did not, but take it upon fame, <lb/>
            Which him above the rest preferred far. <lb n="355"/>
            But certain 'tis, he to Mycena came <lb/>
            With Polynices, to desire their aid <lb/>
            Against the Thebans. And they willingly <lb/>
            Had granted it, but that they were afraid. <lb/>
            For Jove forbad them by a prodigy. <lb n="360"/>
            Then to the brook Asopus back they went, <lb/>
            Which doth the Theban territory bound. <lb/>
            To Tydeus the Greeks a letter sent <lb/>
            To enter Thebes, and terms of peace propound. <lb/>
            To Thebes he went, and with Eteocles <lb n="365"/>
            He found the chief o' th' Thebans at a feast. <lb/>
            And at all manly games the prize with ease, <lb/>
            By Pallas' help, he carried from the best. <lb/>
            And when for spite they sent out fifty men <pb n="46"/>
            <note type="margin"> LID. IV. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>
            The first battle. </note> <lb/>
            With Mæon Hæmon’s son, and Lycophon <lb n="370"/>
            To murder him as he went back again, <lb/>
            Slain by Tydeus they were all but one. <lb/>
            For he sav'd Mæon, warned by the Gods. <lb/>
            Such Tydeus was, but left a son behind <lb/>
            That less could do, but for words had the odds. <lb n="375"/>
            But valiant Diomed reply declined, <lb/>
            Who gave t'Atrides what respect was due. <lb/>
            The other answered him with language rude. <lb/>
            You say, said he, what you know is not true. <lb/>
            We than our fathers there more manhood shew'd. <lb n="380"/>
            For we with fewer men proud Thebes did gain, <lb/>
            By Jove's help, and observances divine, <lb/>
            Whilst the Cadmeans for their pride were slain. <lb/>
            How from our fathers then do we decline ? <lb/>
            But straight reprov'd he was by Diomed. <lb n="385"/>
            My friend, said he, are you more grieved than I ? <lb/>
            Would you not have the army ordered ? <lb/>
            Atrides, both i' th' loss and victory <lb/>
            Is most concern'd. Let us of battle think, <lb/>
            And down he leapt, as soon as that was said, <lb n="390"/>
            In complete arms, with such a sudden chink, <lb/>
            As might a constant man have made afraid. <lb/>
            As when the billows of the sea rais'd high <lb/>
            By some great wind, go rolling to the shore, <lb/>
            And follow one another to the dry, <lb n="495"/>
            There stopped and broken are, and foam, and roar : <lb/>
            So then the Greeks up to the Trojans come, <lb/>
            Obeying each his leader silently, <lb/>
            (You would have thought them, though so many, dumb) <lb/>
            In glittering arms, and glorious to the eye. <lb n="400"/>
            On th'other side, the Trojans made a noise, <lb/>
            Like ewes a milking kept off from their lambs <lb/>
            When in the field abroad they hear their cries, <lb/>
            And they again bleat back unto their dams. <lb/>
            But did not one another understand ; <lb n="405"/>
            For few there were whose language was the same. <lb/>
            Some were of one, some of another land, <lb/>
            And most of them from far off thither came. <lb/>
            Pallas the Greeks, Mars Trojans favoured. <lb/>
            Then Fright came in, with (Mars his sister) Strife, <lb n="410"/>
            Little when born, but grew until her head <lb/>
            Was in the clouds ; for she grows all her life. <lb/>
            But when the armies were together near, <lb/>
            Then man to man came close, and shield to shield, <lb/>
            And mingled in the front was spear with spear, <lb n="415"/>
            And horrible the noise was in the field ; <lb/>
            Whilst some insult and others groaning die. <lb/>
            And th'earth they stood on covered was with blood. <lb/>
            As when great torrents from the mountains high <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            Pour down into the valleys a great flood ; <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. <lb/>

            The streams through thousand channels falling roar; <lb/>
            The trembling shepherds hear it on the hills. <lb/>
            So much the noise o’ th’ battle the air tore, <lb/>
            And all the region with terror fills. <lb/>
            A Trojan was the first man that was slain, <lb n="425"/>
            Echepolus son of Thalysias. <lb/>
            He smote was with a spear into the brain ; <lb/>
            Antilochus the man that smote him was. <lb/>
            His armour rattled on him as he fell, <lb/>
            As if some tow'r had fall'n. But then Elphenor <lb n="430"/>
            (To strip him of his arms that hoped well) <lb/>
            Dragging him off was killed by Agenor. <lb/>
            For whilst in stooping he his flank unhides. <lb/>
            Agenor quickly his advantage spies, <lb/>
            And pierc'd him with his spear through both his sides. <lb n="435"/>
            Then down he fell, and darkness seiz'd his eyes. <lb/>
            And then about his body rose great strife, <lb/>
            And one upon another falling on, <lb/>
            Antheman's son, a fair youth, lost his life, <lb/>
            Slain by great Ajax, son of Telamon, <lb n="440"/>
            And Simoisius called was by name, <lb/>
            'Cause born upon the bank of Simois, <lb/>
            Whither from Ida both his parents came <lb/>
            To view their flocks, lest aught should be amiss; <lb/>
            But had no joy of him. He was unblest <lb n="445"/>
            To be the first that came in Ajax's way, <lb/>
            Who smote him with his spear quite through the breast. <lb/>
            There dead he fell, and by the river lay. <lb/>
            As when a man has fell'd a poplar tree, <lb/>
            Tall, straight, and smooth, with many fair boughs on, <lb n="450"/>
            Of which he meant a cart-wheel made shall be, <lb/>
            And leaves it on the bank to dry i' th' sun; <lb/>
            So lay the comely Simoisius, <lb/>
            Slain by great Ajax, son of Telamon. <lb/>
            At Ajax then a spear threw Antiphus, <lb n="455"/>
            Bright-arm'd Antiphus, King Priam's son. <lb/>
            Death the spear carries, but of Ajax misses, <lb/>
            And deadly wounds the groin of Leucus bold, <lb/>
            And well beloved soldier of Ulysses, <lb/>
            Who dragg'd the dead, but now lets go his hold. <lb n="460"/>
            Ulysses, angry that his friend was slain, <lb/>
            Went out before the rest, and coming close <lb/>
            To th' Trojan front, some fit revenge to gain. <lb/>
            Democoon, King Priam's son, he chose, <lb/>
            (A lawful son where nature is the law). <lb n="465"/>
            The Trojans when they saw him look about, <lb/>
            Into the shelter of the ranks withdraw. <lb/>
            Then soon his spear Democoon pick'd out, <lb/>
            And through both temples forward went the head. <pb n="48"/>

            Then heavily he falls, his armour chinks, <lb n="470"/>
            His eyes with endless night are covered, <lb/>
            And Hector with his Trojans from him shrinks. <lb/>
            The Greeks then shouted, and drew off their slain, <lb/>
            And on the Trojans pressing further were. <lb/>
            But then Apollo cried out amain <lb n="475"/>
            From Pergam tow'r, 0 Trojans, what dye fear ? <lb/>
            Go on upon the Greeks; no more give way. <lb/>
            Their bodies neither are of stone nor steel, <lb/>
            Nor able are the force of brass to stay, <lb/>
            No less than you the wounds it makes they feel. <lb n="480"/>
            Nor fights Achilles here, but angry lies, <lb/>
            And wishes that the Greeks were overthrown. <lb/>
            So Phoebus. ’Mongst the Argives Pallas flies, <lb/>
            Through ranks and files encouraging each one. <lb/>
            And then Diores slain was with a stone, <lb n="485"/>
            By Pyros, whom the Thracians obey'd. <lb/>
            Crush'd of his right leg was the ankle-bone, <lb/>
            And in the dust upon his back was laid, <lb/>
            Unto his fellows holding up his hands. <lb/>
            Ready to die he for assistance cries. <lb n="490"/>
            Pyros comes quickly in, and o'er him stands, <lb/>
            And wounds him in the belly. Then he dies. <lb/>
            But Thoas then slew Pyros with his spear, <lb/>
            That pass'd his breast till in his lungs it stopped. <lb/>
            Then coming in he drew his sword, and there <lb n="495"/>
            His belly ripp'd till out his bowels dropped, <lb/>
            But to disarm him could not stay, because <lb/>
            So many Thracians about him stood. <lb/>
            Then back retir'd he, and well pelted was, <lb/>
            Leaving two leaders wrapp'd in dust and blood, <lb n="500"/>
            One an Epeian, th' other Thracian, <lb/>
            And many others lying by them dead. <lb/>
            This battle was well fought. Although a man <lb/>
            Through both the armies safely had been led <lb/>
            By Pallas, and protected by her shield, <lb n="505"/>
            He had no want of courage seen that day, <lb/>
            So many Greeks and Trojans in the field <lb/>
            Deprived of life by one another lay.</p>

            Amongst the Greeks, with force did him inspire, <lb/>
            Whereby his heart and bands were strengthened ; <lb/>

            (Set on by Pallas and encouraged) <lb/>
            Into the throng, where were the two good sons <lb/>
            Of Dares, who was Vulcan's priest. Well skill'd <lb/>
            They both were in the war. Idæus one, <lb n="10"/>
            The other Phegus. These seeing him i' th' field <lb/>
            On foot, and not far from them, and alone, <lb/>
            Met him; and Phegus threw, but hit him not. <lb/>

            Then Diomedes threw, and Phegus smote, <lb n="15"/>
            Clean through the breast. When Phegus thus was slain <lb/>
            Down leap'd Idaeus from the chariot; <lb/>
            But durst not by his brother's body stay. <lb/>
            For if he had, the like fate he had got. <lb/>
            But Vulcan in a smoke took him away, <lb n="20"/>
            Not willing that his priest should childless die. <lb/>
            Tydides to the ships the horses sent. <lb/>
            To see these two, one slain, the other fly, <lb/>
            To the proud Trojans' very hearts it went. <lb/>
            But Pallas then took Mars by th* hand, and said, <lb n="25"/>
            Mars, bloody Mars, to what end stay we here ? <lb/>
            Let's neuters be. For I am much afraid <lb/>
            We both shall too much anger Jupiter. <lb/>
            This said, she led him out, and set him on <lb/>
            Scamander's bank. And then the Trojans fled <lb n="30"/>
            Before the Greeks. Each leader killed one, <lb/>
            Pressing them at their backs uncovered. <lb/>
            Then Dalius first his char'ot turn'd about, <lb/>
            And open lay to Agamemnon's spear, <lb/>
            Which in at's back, and at his breast went out. <lb n="35"/>
            Down fell the Alizonian charioteer. <lb/>
            Idomcneus slew Phaestus with a thrust, <lb/>
            As up into his chariot he went, <lb/>
            The spear at the right shoulder passed just, <lb/>
            And back again unto the earth him sent. <lb n="40"/>
            And Menelaus slew Scamandrius, <lb/>
            That well the art of hunting understood. <lb/>
            I' th' hills and woods none was more dexterous, <lb/>
            But Dian, and his skill did him no good. <lb/>
            For Menelaus pierc'd him back and breast, <lb n="45"/>
            Between the shoulders with a deadly spear, <lb/>
            And down he tumbled of life dispossest, <lb/>
            His eyes with endless darkness covered were. <lb/>
            Meriones slew Phoriclus, the son <lb/>
            Of Harmonides, the great architect, <lb n="50"/>
            That, but by Pallas, taught had been by none. <lb/>

            But he, as from the fight he fled, was here <lb/>
            O'ertaken by Meriones, and slain. <lb/>
            At his right buttock entered the spear; <lb/>
            And at his groin the point came out again. <lb n="60"/>
            Meges Pedæus slew, Antenor's son, <lb/>
            Though not his wife's, yet was his wife so kind <lb/>

            And look'd upon him with a mother's mind. <lb/>
            Him Meges overtaking as he fled <lb n="65"/>
            Slew with his strong sharp-pointed spear, which lighting <lb/>
            Behind upon the noddle of his head, <lb/>
            Forward he fell, the senseless weapon biting. <lb/>
            And then Eurypylus, Euæmon’s son, <lb/>
            Hypsenor slew, new made Scamander's priest, <lb n="70"/>
            That from him, but not fast enough, did run. <lb/>
            Eurypylus shav'd off his hand at th' wrist. <lb/>
            For at his shoulder though he aim'd the stroke, <lb/>
            The quick sword finding there the brass resist, <lb/>
            Slipt down unto his hand with force unbroke, <lb n="75"/>
            And there in streams of blood his soul dismiss'd. <lb/>
            Meanwhile Tydides, like a man enraged, <lb/>
            Ran up and down the field. One could not know <lb/>
            With whom and where he was in fight engaged, <lb/>
            Whether amongst the Greeks, or with the foe. <lb n="80"/>
            As when a torrent falling from the hills <lb/>
            Distends itself with fury on the plain, <lb/>
            And suddenly the river overfills, <lb/>
            Supplied by Jove with mighty showers of rain, <lb/>
            And beareth down the bridges as it goes; <lb n="85"/>
            No fence of vineyard can against it stand, <lb/>
            But all the husbandry of men o’erthrows, <lb/>
            And uncontrolled passes o'er their land; <lb/>
            Tydides so brake through each Trojan band, <lb/>
            And made them fly before him as he went. <lb n="90"/>
            And Pandarus then took his bow in hand, <lb/>
            And a sharp arrow from it to him sent, <lb/>
            Which pass'd through the right shoulder of his coat <lb/>
            Of mail, and fetch'd the blood, and with great joy, <lb/>
            Trojans, cried he, no more stand so remote. <lb n="95"/>
            For wounded is the stoutest foe of Troy, <lb/>
            And long he cannot the sore pain endure, <lb/>
            Unless my faith in Phœbus be in vain. <lb/>
            Thus said he boasting. For he thought 'twas sure <lb/>
            The wound was mortal, and Tydides slain. <lb n="100"/>
            Tydides to his char'ot did then retreat, <lb/>

            O Pallas, Jove s all-conquering child, said he, <lb/>
            If e'er you did me or my father aid, <lb/>
            Within my spear's reach let me this man see, <lb/>
            That with his arrow me prevented has, <lb/>
            And boasting says, I have not long to live. <lb n="110"/>
            Athena to his wish indulgent was, <lb/>
            And to him did more strength and courage give. <lb/>
            rear not, said she, to go into the throng, <lb/>
            And charge i' th' thickest of the enemies. <lb/>
            For I have made thee as thy father strong, <lb n="115"/>
            And taken have the mist off from thy eyes, <lb/>
            That thou mayst see who Gods are, who are men. <lb/>
            If any God oppose thee, give him way, <lb/>
            Except if Venus thou encounter; then <lb/>
            Spare her no more than mortals in the fray. <lb n="120"/>
            This said, away the Goddess Pallas went, <lb/>
            And Diomed went to the fight again, <lb/>
            And though before he were upon it bent, <lb/>
            His courage now was trebled by his pain. <lb/>
            As when a shepherd sees a lion come, <lb n="125"/>
            And wounds him slightly as he leaps the pen; <lb/>
            Then leaves his sheep, and frighted runneth home, <lb/>
            And dares not in the field appear again; <lb/>
            The lion now made fiercer than before, <lb/>
            Lays all the sheep one by another dead, <lb n="130"/>
            And back again the pen once more leaps o'er: <lb/>
            So rag'd amongst the Trojans Diomed. <lb/>
            Astynous there, and Hypenor died ; <lb/>
            One through the breast he pierced with his spear; <lb/>
            And th' other's head did from his neck divide <lb n="135"/>
            With his broad sword. And slain he left them there, <lb/>
            And overtook Abas and Polyeide, <lb/>
            Sons of Eurydamas, who could tell what <lb/>
            Upon a dream should to a man betide, <lb/>
            And slew them both. No dream had told him that. <lb n="140"/>
            Thoon and Xanthus then he followed, <lb/>
            Phænop’s two sons, gotten when he was old, <lb/>
            And of them both the vital blood did shed; <lb/>
            Th' estate to strangers came to have and hold. <lb/>
            Then Chromius and Echemon he slew, <lb n="145"/>
            Two sons of Priam, in one chariot, <lb/>
            Whom from the seat unto the ground he threw, <lb/>
            And till he had disarm'd them left them not. <lb/>
            But to the ships he sent away the horses. <lb/>
            AEneas seeing how he disarray'd <lb n="150"/>

            Aim a shaft at him whosoe'er he be, <lb/>
            For many valiant Trojans he has slain. <lb/>
            (Unless he be one of the Gods above <lb/>
            Neglected by us) 'twill not be in vain. <lb/>
            Shoot boldly then, but first invoking Jove. <lb n="160"/>
            Then Pandarus replying, to him said, <lb/>
            'Tis Diomed as far as can be guess'd. <lb/>
            His horses, and his shield I have surveyed, <lb/>
            And plaited horse-hair hanging at his crest. <lb/>
            Though it be he, as I believe it is, <lb n="165"/>
            Yet sure some God does on his shoulders sit. <lb/>
            For else of killing him how could I miss, <lb/>
            When I his shoulder with my arrow hit ? <lb/>
            For I one arrow shot at him before, <lb/>
            And verily believed I had him slain. <lb n="170"/>
            His armour all besmeared was with gore, <lb/>
            But slew him not. Now here he is again. <lb/>
            I did not on a char'ot hither come, <lb/>
            Although Lycaon have eleven new, <lb/>
            With handsome curtains to each one, at home, <lb n="175"/>
            And horses fit to draw them not a few. <lb/>
            The old knight too advis'd me earnestly <lb/>
            That when to battle I the Trojans led, <lb/>
            I from a car should charge the enemy; <lb/>
            But to his counsel I not hearkened. <lb n="180"/>
            (Which I repent.) It came into my head <lb/>
            That when within Troy's walls we should be pent, <lb/>
            My horses, which were us'd to be well fed, <lb/>
            Would there be useless wanting nourishment. <lb/>
            This made me come without a chariot, <lb n="185"/>
            And march, as far as 'twas, to Troy on foot, <lb/>
            And trust unto my bow, which helps me not, <lb/>
            But faileth me as often as I shoot. <lb/>
            For two of them I have already shot, <lb/>
            Tydides and Atrides, and good store <lb n="190"/>
            Of blood have drawn from both, though killed not, <lb/>
            But made them fiercer than they were before. <lb/>
            In an in hour sure I took down my bow <lb/>
            To fight for Hector and the Trojan men; <lb/>
            But if I safely to my country go, <lb n="195"/>
            And to my house and wife get back again, <lb/>
            Let any man that will cut off my head, <lb/>
            If presently ray bow I do not burn, <lb/>
            That never yet my hopes has answered. <lb/>

            To Pandarus Æneas then replied : <lb/>
            No, say not so, but first let's to him go. <lb/>

            Or if you please, when to him we are nigh <lb/>
            I’ll hold the whip and reins, and you alight. <lb/>
            No, no, said he, keep you the reins in hand, <lb/>

            This said, they mounted both; and coming on <lb/>
            Towards Tydides, both observed were <lb/>
            By Sthenelus Copaneus his son, <lb n="220"/>
            Who warning to Tydides gave. I see <lb/>

            I loath to sit upon a chariot, <lb/>

            For of my strength deprived I am not, <lb/>

            Of heavenly race they are, and got by those, <lb/>
            Which Jove, to make amends for Ganymed, <lb/>
            Was pleas'd to give unto his father Tros. <lb n="240"/>
            Anchises privily convey'd to these, <lb/>
            Six mares, and had a colt by ev'ry one ; <lb/>
            Whereof he gave two to his son Æneas. <lb/>
            To take these horses now were bravely done. <lb/>
            While they were talking, th'other two came nigh, <lb n="245"/>
            And then said Pandarus, 0 Diomed, <lb/>
            Since my swift arrow could not make you die, <lb/>
            I come to try now how my spear will speed. <lb/>
            And as he spoke the spear flew from his hand <lb/>
            And pass'd his shield, but in his armour stayed. <lb n="250"/>
            Y'are hit, said he, and long you cannot stand. <lb/>
            But Diomed, nothing at all dismayed, <lb/>
            No, no, cried out, your spear is thrown in vain. <lb/>

            Tydides then took up a mighty stone <lb n="265"/>

            The same with ease did at AEneas throw, <lb/>

            Then down upon his knees and hands he fell, <lb/>

            That Venus saw him lying thus 'twas well; <lb n="275"/>

            For then came Venus down, and with the lap <lb/>

            But took Tydides' horses, and with these <lb/>
            To try went if Tydides he could meet. <lb/>
            But he in chase of Venus now was gone <lb/>
            (Knowing that she a tender Goddess was, <lb n="290"/>
            And for the war commission had none, <lb/>
            Nor had as Pallas any shield of brass.) <lb/>
            And had when he came to her wounded her. <lb/>
            For through her robe, though by the Graces made, <lb/>
            Without resistance quickly pass'd the spear, <lb n="295"/>
            And at her wrist did her fair hand invade. <lb/>
            And from the wound out sprang the blood divine, <lb/>

            Iris the reins held, and away they went; <lb/>
            The time they spent in going was not great. <lb/>
            When they were there, Iris the steeds untied, <lb/>

            But Venus fell into Diones' lap, <lb/>

            Strok'd her, and said, how came this sad mishap ? <lb n="335"/>

            This said, she wip'd the ichor from her hand, <lb/>

            Venus some Argive dame has courting been <lb/>
            To take the Trojan's part, whom she doth love, <lb/>
            And stroking her, her hand scratch'd with a pin. <lb/>
            Jove smil'd at this, and then to Venus said, <lb/>

            That charge on Mars and Pallas I have laid. <lb/>

            While they were thus discoursing, Diomed <lb/>

            To gain his armour and his blood to shed, <lb n="395"/>
            Knowing he was in th' hands now of Apollo. <lb/>
            Undaunted then, with shield before his breast, <lb/>

            Since they are here, and very far from home ; <lb n="440"/>
            And though from me the Greeks can nothing get, <lb/>
            Neither to carry nor to drive away. <lb/>
            But you to th' Trojans have not spoken yet, <lb/>

            (Made them by Mars and Strife) no time had they <lb/>

            The Argives were by th' Ajaxes to stay, <lb/>

            For with the foremost he was still in fight. <lb/>
            And at his buckler went the weapon in, <lb/>

            And Mars himself it was that set him on <lb/>

            Antilochus then, Nestor s valiant son, <lb/>
            Fearing lest Menelaus should be slain, <lb/>

            Æneas then, as valiant as he was, <lb/>
            Retired, eschewing th' odds of two to one. <lb n="520"/>
            And when they had brought off the bodies slain, <lb/>
            And left them in their fellow -soldiers' hands, <lb/>
            Unto the skirmish they returned again, <lb/>
            And slew the Prince of Paphlagonians <lb/>
            Pylaemines. Atrides threw the spear <lb n="525"/>
            Which near the shoulder pass'd into his neck. <lb/>
            By Nestor's son slain was his charioteer, <lb/>

            As he his char'ot turning was to fly, <lb/>
            Antilochus him wounded with a stone <lb n="530"/>
            On th' elbow, and benumb'd his hand, whereby <lb/>
            The sense he had to hold the reins was gone. <lb/>
            The reins fell down, and then with sword in hand <lb/>
            Antilochus divides his head in twain, <lb/>
            And headlong fell he where it chanc'd the sand <lb n="535"/>
            Was very deep, and there he did remain <lb/>
            With head and shoulders sticking in the sands. <lb/>
            But upright in the air were both his hips. <lb/>
            The horses laid him flat. Which by the hands <lb/>

            Hector saw this, and in came with great cry, <lb/>

            Bellona brought in tumult and affright. <lb n="545"/>

            And sometimes after Hector went i' th' fight, <lb/>
            Sometimes before, and oft did by him stand. <lb/>
            Tydides when he saw him was afraid, <lb/>

            And Hector there had slain two men that sat <lb/>
            Together, Mnestheus and Anchialus, <lb/>
            Both warriors good. But Ajax griev’ d thereat, <lb/>
            (The greater Ajax, Telamonius) <lb/>
            Darted his heavy spear at Amphius. <lb n="565"/>
            Rich was he both in lands and goods, and dwelt <lb/>
            At Pæsus : and fought here for Priamus. <lb/>
            But by the spear which pass'd quite through his belt <lb/>
            Upon his belly took a mortal wound. <lb/>
            And as he fell, Ajax ran fiercely in <lb n="570"/>
            To strip him of his armour on the ground, <lb/>
            And stript him had, had lie not hindered been. <lb/>
            For from the Trojans came a shower of spears, <lb/>
            Whereof his shield received not a few. <lb/>
            Then to be hemm'd in by the foe he fears. <lb n="575"/>
            His own spear he recover'd and withdrew. <lb/>
            Whilst they in stubborn war thus toiling were, <lb/>
            Unlucky fate Tlepolemus brought on <lb/>
            To charge Sarpedon ; and when they were near <lb/>
            Together come, Jove's grandson and his son, <lb n="580"/>
            Tlepolemus said then, what need had you, <lb/>
            Unskilful in the war, to tremble here ? <lb/>
            Jove's son men say you are, but 'tis not true. <lb/>
            No such weak men by Jove begotten were ; <lb/>
            But such as Hercules is said t'have been, <lb n="585"/>
            Courageous as a lion; with few men <lb/>
            In but six ships, this strong town he did win, <lb/>
            And rifled it, and safe went off again. <lb/>
            But you are weak, your men a great part dead, <lb/>
            And can but little help afford to Troy, <lb n="590"/>
            And though from Lycia you were strengthened, <lb/>
            I mean to send you now another way. <lb/>
            To this Sarpedon answered, 'Tis true <lb/>
            That Hercules sack'd Troy, because the steeds <lb/>
            Laomedon kept back that were his due, <lb n="595"/>
            And gave him evil language for good deeds. <lb/>
            But you from me shall present death receive, <lb/>
            For which I shall have honour truly paid, <lb/>
            And you your soul shall now to Pluto leave. <lb/>
            And this Sarpedon had no sooner said, <lb n="600"/>
            Than from their hands the spears together started. <lb/>
            Tlepolemus clean through the neck was struck, <lb/>
            And from him presently his life departed. <lb/>

            Yet on his left thigh he receiv'd a wound: <note type="margin"> LIB. V. <lb/>

            For through it went the spear close by the bone. <lb/>
            Sarpedon, by his friends borne off the ground, <lb/>
            Was plac'd apart where battle there was none, <lb/>
            Tormented with the spear still in his thigh. <lb/>
            To pull it out they all had quite forgot. <lb n="610"/>
            In so great haste they were, the foe so nigh, <lb/>
            The time so little, and the fight so hot. <lb/>
            Meanwhile Tlepolemus his body dead <lb/>
            The Greeks fetched off. The wise Ulysses then <lb/>
            Within himself a while considered, <lb n="615"/>
            Whether to charge Sarpedon or his men. <lb/>
            But since by fate Sarpedon was to die <lb/>
            By other, and not by Ulysses' hands, <lb/>
            Athena made him lay that purpose by, <lb/>
            And turn his anger on the Lycians. <lb n="620"/>
            Alastor then he slew, and Cceramus, <lb/>
            Alcander, Prytanis, and Noemon. <lb/>
            And Halius he slew, and Chromius, <lb/>
            And many Lycians more had overthrown, <lb/>
            But mighty Hector now approached near <lb n="625"/>
            In glittering arms, and brought with him affright. <lb/>
            But glad Sarpedon was to see him there; <lb/>
            And when he was come up unto him quite, <lb/>
            Himself lamenting, thus to Hector said, <lb/>
            Leave me not, Hector, to the Greeks a prey, <lb n="630"/>
            But let my body in your ground be laid, <lb/>
            Since I my country must no more enjoy, <lb/>
            Nor my beloved wife and tender son. <lb/>
            So said Sarpedon. Hector not replies, <lb/>
            But to the enemy he passeth on ; <lb n="635"/>
            And as he goes the ground with blood he dies. <lb/>
            Under a beech, sacred to Jupiter <lb/>
            Sarpedon placed was upon the ground, <lb/>
            And gently Pelagon pull'd out the spear; <lb/>
            The pain hereof put him into a swound. <lb n="640"/>
            Lost was his sight; but by a gentle wind <lb/>
            And cool, that from the north upon him blew, <lb/>
            He soon recovered both his sight and mind, <lb/>
            And all the company about him knew. <lb/>
            To Mars and Hector still the Greeks gave way <lb n="645"/>
            And still their faces to the Trojans were, <lb/>
            But for to charge none durst advance or stay. <lb/>
            For Diomed had told them Mars was there. <lb/>

            This slaughter of the Greeks when Juno saw, <lb/>
            She then to Pallas spake. Pallas, said she, <lb/>
            If we let Mars still play the madman here, <lb/>
            Our word to Menelaus false will be, <lb/>
            That he from Troy return should conqueror. <lb n="660"/>
            Let's courage take, and try what we can do. <lb/>
            Pallas contented, 'twas agreed upon. <lb/>
            And Juno ready made herself to go, <lb/>
            And quickly the coachwheels Hebe sets on. <lb/>
            Eight spokes each wheel had, and were all of brass, <lb n="665"/>
            And fixed round about at th' axle-tree. <lb/>
            The axle-tree itself of iron was, <lb/>
            The circle gold, and wonderful to see. <lb/>
            But arm'd it was above with plates of brass. <lb/>
            The naves on both sides were of silver white, <lb n="670"/>
            With gold and silver wire extended was <lb/>
            The seat, which had two silver rings and bright, <lb/>
            In which the beam of silver fast'ned stayed; <lb/>
            At the other end th' golden yoke she tied, <lb/>
            And on the yoke the golden reins she laid. <lb n="675"/>
            And Juno then no longer could abide, <lb/>
            But to the coach herself the horses brought, <lb/>
            From quarrels so impatiently she stayed. <lb/>
            Pallas threw off her robe, and took Jove's coat, <lb/>
            And with the same she there herself array'd. <lb n="680"/>
            And then her breast with armour covered, <lb/>
            And on her shoulder hung her frightful shield, <lb/>
            Wherein Strife, Force, Flight, Chase, were figured, <lb/>
            With all the horror of a foughten field; <lb/>
            And in the middle stood out Gorgoe's head. <lb n="685"/>
            Then put she on her golden helmet, that <lb/>
            Ten thousand men's heads might have covered, <lb/>
            And to the chariot up she went, and sat, <lb/>
            And her great heavy spear takes in her hands <lb/>
            The spear wherewith, when she displeased is, <lb n="690"/>
            She scatters of proud kings the armed bands. <lb/>
            Then Juno with the whip was not remiss, <lb/>
            And of itself flew open heaven-gate, <lb/>
            Though to the Seasons, Jove the power gave <lb/>

            Where Simois doth with Scamander meet. <lb/>
            And with ambrosia, Simois them supplied. <lb n="720"/>
            Then swift as doves, to give the Argives aid, <lb/>
            They went to where they saw the greatest throng. <lb/>
            There was Tydides, and about him stayed <lb/>
            Many as lions valiant and strong. <lb/>
            And Juno there in shape of Stentor stood, <lb n="725"/>
            And spake as loud as any fifty men. <lb/>
            Argives, said she, cowards, for nothing good, <lb/>
            Although you make a goodly show. For when <lb/>
            Achilles went before you to the fight, <lb/>
            Out at their gates the Trojans durst not peep, <lb n="730"/>
            So much they of his spear abhorred the sight, <lb/>
            But from your ships you scarce now can them keep. <lb/>
            When Juno thus the Greeks encouraged, <lb/>
            To Diomed went Pallas ; whom she found <lb/>
            Hard by his horses sitting, wearied. <lb n="735"/>

            Given by Pandarus ; which with the sweat <lb/>

            As at the yoke Athena leaning stood, <lb/>

            Though I not bade him, he went boldly on. <lb/>

            And others by my counsel here abide. <lb/>
            To this the Goddess then replied again, <lb/>
            Nor Mars nor any of th' Immortals spare, <lb/>
            That shall advance against you in the field. <lb n="770"/>
            And for your safety trust unto my care, <lb/>
            And know you are protected by my shield. <lb/>
            But first to Mars drive up your horses close, <lb/>
            And strike the blockhead with your spear in hand, <lb/>
            That fights sometimes for these, sometimes for those, <lb n="775"/>
            And with the Trojans now you see him stand, <lb/>
            And yet to help the Greeks he promis'd me <lb/>
            And Juno, but a little while before, <lb/>
            And now amongst the Trojans fighteth he, <lb/>
            And thinks upon his promises no more. <lb n="780"/>
            This said, they mount into the chariot, <lb/>
            And Sthenelus descending left his seat. <lb/>
            The axle-tree groaned under them. Why not ? <lb/>
            A great man he, she was a Goddess great. <lb/>
            And then to Mars directly they drive on, <lb n="785"/>
            Who had but newly slain great Periphas, <lb/>
            Of old Ochesius the valiant son, <lb/>
            And far the best of all th' Ætolians was. <lb/>
            Athena then puts Pluto's helmet on, <lb/>
            Lest she by Mars should be discovered. <lb n="790"/>
            When Mars there saw Tydides all alone, <lb/>
            He Periphas forsook, who there lay dead; <lb/>
            And turn'd to meet Tydides on the way; <lb/>
            And when to one another they were near, <lb/>
            Mars making full account the man to slay, <lb n="795"/>
            Over the yoke thrusts at him with his spear. <lb/>
            But Pallas with her hand the point suppress'd, <lb/>
            And made it light beneath the seat in vain. <lb/>
            Tydides then to Mars a spear address'd, <lb/>
            Which had he been a mortal had him slain; <lb n="800"/>
            For Pallas in his belly stuck the spear, <lb/>
            And presently the same pluck'd out again. <lb/>
            Mars ronr'd as loud as if in battle there <lb/>
            Fighting had been nine or ten thousand men, <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            And frighted both the armies with the noise. <note type="margin"> LIB. V. </note><note type="margin"> The first bat tle <lb/>

            Then like a black cloud which some wind makes rise, <lb/>
            He left th' unlucky field and went his ways, <lb/>
            And in a little time was in the skies. <lb/>
            And sitting down hard by his father's throne, <lb/>
            Shew'd him the blood that from the wound did flow, <lb n="810"/>
            And grievously lamenting made his moan. <lb/>
            Father, said he, do you such work allow ? <lb/>
            That we the Gods such harm from mortals take, <lb/>
            While some for Trojans, some for Argives fight, <lb/>
            And partial be for one another's sake, <lb n="815"/>
            The fault is to be laid on you by right. <lb/>
            For you brought forth this mad, pernicious maid, <lb/>
            Whose study is her malice to effect, <lb/>
            When by us other Gods you are obey'd; <lb/>
            And this you saw, but never would correct. <lb n="820"/>
            'Twas she that on the Gods set Diomed, <lb/>
            Who wounded Venus first, then flew at me. <lb/>
            And there in pain I lain had ’mongst the dead, <lb/>
            Or crippled been, had not my feet been free. <lb/>
            Uncertain Mars, then Jupiter replied, <lb n="825"/>
            Of all the Gods most hateful to my sight, <lb/>
            That quarrel lov'st to make, but not decide ; <lb/>
            Thou hast thy mother Juno's nature right, <lb/>
            That oft provokes me with her peevish tongue, <lb/>
            And by her order, I think, this was done. <lb n="830"/>
            But in this pain I'll not detain you long, <lb/>
            Seeing you are as well mine as her son. <lb/>
            But had another got you, you had sure <lb/>
            To Pluto and th' infernal Gods been sent. <lb/>
            This said, to Pæon he commits his cure; <lb n="835"/>
            And Pæon presently about it went. <lb/>
            As quickly as the milk is turn'd to curd, <lb/>
            When with a proper rennet it is mix'd, <lb/>
            And with a housewife's hand together stirr'd, <lb/>
            So quickly was the wide wound clos'd and fix'd. <lb n="840"/>
            Then bath'd he was by Hebe, and new clad ; <lb/>
            And that he so came off was well content. <lb/>

            Betwixt the streams Xanthus and Simseis. <lb/>
            And first great Ajax killed Acamas, <lb n="5"/>
            And for his fellows opened a door <lb/>
            For slaughter ’mongst the files and ranks to pass, <lb/>
            And caus'd thereby the loss of many more. <lb/>
            And by Tydides Axylus was slain, <lb/>
            That at Arisbe dwelt near the highway, <lb n="10"/>
            Rich, and the Greeks did often entertain ; <lb/>
            But none of them would save him in the fray, <lb/>
            For slain be was by Diomedes there, <lb/>
            Together with his squire, Calesius, <lb/>
            That by him sat, and was his charioteer. <lb n="15"/>
            Euryalus then slew Opheltius <lb/>
            And Dresus. After Pedasus he runs, <lb/>
            And Æsepus, sons of Bucalion, <lb/>
            Who by Abarbarea had two sons, <lb/>
            But he for father had Laomedon, <lb n="20"/>
            And th' eldest was, but not in wedlock got; <lb/>

            But from Euryalus they 'scaped not, <lb/>
            Nor long they lay there with their armour on. <lb/>
            Then Polypcetes by Astyalus, <lb n="25"/>
            Pidytes by Ulysses, and by Teuc­ <lb/>
            er Areton, and by Antilochus <lb/>
            Ablerus; by Atrides Eleteus <lb/>

            From the delightful bank of Satnius. <lb n="30"/>
            And Leitus Philacus slew as he fled. <lb/>
            Eurypylus then slew Melanthius; <lb/>
            And then Adrestus taken was alive <lb/>
            By Menelaus. For his horses frighted, <lb/>
            Whilst to the town they laboured to arrive, <lb n="35"/>
            Upon two branches of a tree they lighted, <lb/>

            The horses loose away ran tow'rd the town, <lb/>
            As did the rest that from the battle fled. <lb/>
            Adrestus headlong from the seat fell down, <lb n="40"/>

            Adrestus then lays hold upon his knee. <lb/>

            This said, Atrides was thereto inclin'd, <lb/>
            And ready for to send him to the ships. <lb n="50"/>
            But Agamemnon came and chang'd his mind <lb/>
            Before he had confirm d it with his lips. <lb/>
            Brother, said he, what makes you be so kind <lb/>
            To any of these men ? Is it because <lb/>
            You did at home the Trojans faithful find, <lb n="55"/>
            And that they had well served Menelaus ? <lb/>
            No, no, we must no quarter give at Troy, <lb/>
            Nor spare the child yet in his mother's womb, <lb/>
            But utterly the nation destroy, <lb/>
            And pluck up by the root proud Ilium. <lb n="60"/>
            Then Menelaus pitied him no more, <lb/>
            But violently push'd him from his knee, <lb/>
            Wherewith he backward tumbled o'er and o'er, <lb/>
            And soon by Agamemnon slain was he. <lb/>
            Then Nestor to the Greeks, with voice as high <lb n="65"/>
            As he could raise it, cried out, Let none <lb/>
            Yet on the spoil and booty set his eye, <lb/>
            But follow killing now, plunder anon : <lb/>
            The dead will stay till back again we come. <lb/>
            The Greeks by Nestor thus encouraged, <lb n="70"/>
            Had chas'd the Trojans unto Ilium, <lb/>
            But that by Helenus was hindered. <lb/>
            For standing near to Hector and Æneas, <lb/>
            Since all the work, said he, lies on your hand, <lb/>
            And you in fight and counsel chiefly please <lb n="75"/>
            Both Lycians and Trojans, make them stand; <lb/>
            About them go, and put yourselves between <lb/>
            The gates and them, lest followed by the foe <lb/>
            They should be by their loving wives there seen, <lb/>
            And the Argives stand triumphing in our woe. <lb n="80"/>
            And when you once have them encouraged, <lb/>
            Æneas and myself will with them stay, <lb/>
            And fight against the Greeks, though wearied. <lb/>
            But Hector to the town go you away, <lb/>
            And bid your and my mother take with her <lb n="85"/>
            The eldest Trojan matrons, and make haste <lb/>
            To Pallas' temple, and present her there <lb/>
            With the best robe she has; and having plac'd <lb/>
            It on her knee, vow to her deity <lb/>
            (If she protect our wives and children will, <lb n="90"/>
            And city from this raging enemy, <lb/>

            Twelve heifers at her altar. For in fight <lb/>

            Then Hector armed leapt down to the ground, <lb/>
            And with two spears about the army goes, <lb/>
            Courage inspiring to the Trojans round, <lb/>
            And straight they turn'd their faces to the foes. <lb n="100"/>
            The Greeks retiring then no longer fought. <lb/>
            Some God from heav'n descended was, they thought, <lb/>

            And play the men, whilst I to Ilium <lb/>

            And as he walk'd, the edges of his shield <lb/>
            By turns his ankle and his neck did smite. <lb n="110"/>
            Tydidesthen, and Glaucus, on the field <lb/>
            Met one another, and prepared to fight. <lb/>
            Tydides speaking first, Brave man, said he, <lb/>
            Who are you ? Let me know your name and race, <lb/>
            That dares so boldly thus advance on me. <lb n="115"/>
            I never yet in battle saw your face. <lb/>
            Men mortal to provoke me thus none dare, <lb/>
            But they whose parents are condemn'd to woe. <lb/>
            But if some God come down from heaven you are, <lb/>
            Do what you will I'll not return a blow. <lb n="120"/>
            Licurgus, son of Dryas, chas'd the train <lb/>
            Of Bacchus with a goad at Nyssa, where <lb/>
            The Mænades threw from them on the plain <lb/>
            Their ivy-twined staves, and fled for fear; <lb/>
            Bacchus himself leapt into Thetis' lap, <lb n="125"/>
            Trembling and frighted, and the Goddess kind <lb/>
            Receiv'd him, and defended from mishap. <lb/>
            But for this act Jove struck Licurgus blind, <lb/>
            Who died soon after. For the Gods above <lb/>
            All hated him. And that's the cause that I <lb n="130"/>
            Dare not the anger of the Gods to move. <lb/>
            But if thou mortal art, come near and die. <lb/>
            O brave Tydides, Glaucus answer'd then, <lb/>
            To what end serves it you to know my race ? <lb/>
            As with green leaves, so fareth it with men; <lb n="135"/>

            But since you ask me (though it be well known) <lb/>
            My pedigree at large I shall you tell. <lb/>
            Within a creek of Argos stands a town <lb/>
            Call'd Ephyre. There Sisyphus did dwell; <lb n="140"/>
            The subtle Sisyphus, who Glaucus got. <lb/>
            Glaucus, the father of Bellerophon, <lb/>

            For so enamour'd of him was the queen <lb/>
            Anteia, who of Prætus was the wife, <lb/>
            That she a suitor to him oft had been. <lb/>

            The fury of her love then turn'd to hate. <lb n="150"/>
            And spitefully she to her husband went, <lb/>
            And weeping bitterly, down by him sate, <lb/>
            And to him said, 0 king, resolve to die <lb/>
            Yourself, or else Bellerophon to kill, <lb/>
            For he attempted has my chastity, <lb n="155"/>
            And would have lain with me against my will. <lb/>
            The king incens'd, to kill him did intend, <lb/>
            But loth to do it there, he thought it better <lb/>
            Unto the King of Lycia him to send <lb/>
            (Who was Anteia's father) with a letter, <lb n="160"/>
            Wherein he had declar'd his cruel mind, <lb/>
            And many ways to bring it to effect. <lb/>
            He. ignorant of what was then designed, <lb/>
            The king's commandement did not neglect. <lb/>
            To Lycia he went, and coming thither, <lb n="165"/>
            In favour with the Gods, was honoured <lb/>
            And treated like a God, nine days together. <lb/>
            0' th' tenth his letter he delivered. <lb/>
            The letter read, the king him first employ'd <lb/>
            The terrible Chimæra to assail, <lb n="170"/>
            That by the monster he might be destroy'd. <lb/>
            A lion's head it had and dragon's tail, <lb/>
            And in the midst the body of a goat; <lb/>
            A flame of burning fire was its breath. <lb/>
            Bellerophon with this foul monster fought, <lb n="175"/>
            And put it (by the aid o' th' Gods) to death. <lb/>
            The next adventure that he set him on, <lb/>
            Was th' expedition 'gainst the Solymi. <lb/>
            The third when from the Amazons he won <lb/>
            (Those martial females) a great victory. <lb n="180"/>
            And as he came from thence the king had laid <lb/>
            An ambush for him on the way in vain, <lb/>
            Of choicest Lycians, whom he destroy'd, <lb/>
            That not a man of them return'd again. <lb/>
            The king receiv'd him then, believing now <lb n="185"/>
            That he descended was of heavenly race, <lb/>
            And gave him half his pow'r, and land enough, <lb/>
            And with his daughter's marriage did him grace. <lb/>

            And one fair daughter, call'd Laodamie, <lb/>
            On whom by Jove Sarpedon gotten was. <lb/>

            To Troy he sent me, and especially <lb/>

            Than which in Ephyre none nobler is, <lb/>

            Between your ancestors and mine of old, <lb/>
            A mutual bond of hospitality. <lb/>
            Bellerophon, as I have oft been told, <lb/>
            Was by my grandsire, CEneus, freely treated, <lb/>
            And stayed with him twenty days and nights, <lb n="210"/>
            And when again lie from his house retreated, <lb/>
            They tokens gave of hospitable rights; <lb/>
            (Eneus to him a belt, most glorious, <lb/>

            Which I not with me brought, but in my house <lb n="215"/>
            When I came thence I safely left lock'd up. <lb/>
            My father I remember not. For he <lb/>
            Left me too young when last he went from home. <lb/>
            Henceforth my guest in Argos you must be, <lb/>
            I yours in Lycia, when I thither come. <lb n="220"/>
            Meantime, let's one another's spear decline; <lb/>
            For many Trojans more I have to kill, <lb/>
            Unless I cross'd be by some pow'r divine. <lb/>
            And of the Achæans kill you whom you wilL <lb/>
            And that our friendship may the more appear, <lb n="225"/>
            I will present you with these arms of mine; <lb/>

            This said, they lighted and their hands did join. <lb/>
            But Glaucus surely here bewitched was, <lb/>
            Or cursed by the Gods, that had forgot <lb n="230"/>
            His arms were gold, and Diomed's but brass. <lb/>
            An hundred his, nine beeves the other bought. <lb/>
            Hector was now come to the Scæan gates; <lb/>
            To him the Trojan wives and daughters run <lb/>
            To ask their husbands' and their brothers' fates, <lb n="235"/>
            But to those questions he answer'd none. <lb/>

            Here Hecuba, as she conducted home <lb/>
            Laodice, her beautifulest daughter, <lb n="250"/>
            Met her son Hector that was newly come <lb/>
            In dusty bloody armour from the slaughter. <lb/>
            And took him by the hand, and to him said, <lb/>
            Why come you from the fight ? Have we the worst, <lb/>
            And you come to solicit Jove for aid, <lb n="255"/>
            And after that is done to quench your thirst ? <lb/>
            A little wine will much the strength sustain <lb/>

            No, no, from wine (said he) I must abstain, <lb/>
            Lest I forget and leave my work undone. <lb n="260"/>
            Besides, to Jove I dare not offer wine <lb/>
            With bloody hands, lest I should him incense. <lb/>
            But, mother, go you to Minerva's shrine <lb/>
            With other ladies, and with frankincense; <lb/>
            And of the robes in your perfumed chest <lb n="265"/>
            Take with you that which in your judgment is <lb/>
            Amongst them all the largest and the best, <lb/>
            And lay it down upon the Goddess' knees. <lb/>
            And vow that at her altar you will kill <lb/>
            Twelve yearling heifers of the best you have, <lb n="270"/>
            If at your prayer condescend she will <lb/>
            Your children with yourselves and Troy to save, <lb/>
            And from the fight this Diomed remove. <lb/>
            To th' temple presently go you away. <lb/>
            But I to Paris now must go, and prove <lb n="275"/>
            If he th' advice I give him will obey. <lb/>
            Then Hecuba into the chamber came <lb/>
            Where many divers-colour'd vestures lay, <lb/>
            The work of many a Sidonian dame, <lb/>
            Which then from Sidon Paris brought to Troy, <lb n="280"/>
            When thither he from Sparta Helen brought. <lb/>
            Of these, to give the Goddess, she took one <lb/>

            And that like to a star in heaven shone. <lb/>
            And when unto the temple come they were, <lb n="285"/>
            Theano opened the door; for she <lb/>
            (Antenor's wife) was Pallas' priest. And there <lb/>
            She took the robe, and laid it on her knee. <lb/>
            Then prayed she (whilst with a mighty cry <lb/>

            Built by himself the citadel within, <lb/>
            With all the art the Trojans understood. <lb/>
            There Hector with his spear in hand went in, <lb/>
            That was in length eleven cubits good, <lb/>
            And pointed at the head with polish'd brass, <lb n="305"/>
            Fastened into the staff with a gold ring. <lb/>
            Busy about his armour Paris was, <lb/>
            And Helen work to th' maids distributing. <lb/>
            Here Hector Paris chid. Is this, said he, <lb/>
            The fittest time to manifest your spite <lb n="310"/>
            Against the Trojans, when the enemy <lb/>
            Under our walls is killing them in fight ? <lb/>
            When none but you the cause is of the war <lb/>
            And tumult, which surrounds the town of Troy. <lb/>
            I think it would become you better far <lb n="315"/>
            To rate those men that from the battle stay. <lb/>
            Brother, said Paris, what you say is right. <lb/>
            But hear me, too. I stayed not behind <lb/>
            Because I to the Trojans bear a spite, <lb/>
            But from their slanders to avert my mind. <lb n="320"/>
            And now my wife too has persuaded me, <lb/>
            Who of myself was ready to begone. <lb/>
            Not sure to any side is victory. <lb/>
            Stay only while I put my armour on. <lb/>
            Or go. I'll follow you and find you out. <lb n="325"/>
            Thus he. But Hector to it nothing said. <lb/>
            And to begone his face he tum'd about, <lb/>
            But Helen saw about to speak, and stayed. <lb/>
            Brother, said she, though I unworthy am <lb/>

            This said, home Hector went, and there was told <lb/>
            His wife Andromache at home was not. <lb/>
            For with the nurse the battle to behold, <lb n="355"/>
            Into the tow'r on Scaea gate was got. <lb/>
            Then Hector of the women ask'd again, <lb/>
            Is she gone to some sister or some brother ? <lb/>
            Or to the Goddess temple in the train <lb/>
            Of those that thither waited on my mother ? <lb n="360"/>
            To this one of the women said again, <lb/>
            She neither went to sister nor to brother, <lb/>
            Nor to the Goddess' temple, in the train <lb/>
            Of those that thither waited on your mother. <lb/>
            But when I know not who Informed her had <lb n="365"/>
            That th' Argives did the Trojans overpower, <lb/>
            With her young son and nurse as one that's mad <lb/>
            Ran to the gate, and up into the tower. <lb/>
            Then back went Hector passing the same streets <lb/>
            Through which he went when he came from the fight, <lb n="470"/>
            Where in the way Andromache he meets <lb/>
            That now was running home in great affright. <lb/>
            The daughter she was of Eetion, <lb/>
            Who of Cilicia the sceptre carried, <lb/>
            And dwelt at Thebe in Hypoplacion, <lb n="375"/>
            But unto noble Hector she was married. <lb/>
            Now Hector met her with their little boy <lb/>
            That in the nurse's arms was carried, <lb/>
            And like a star upon her bosom lay <lb/>
            His beautiful and shining golden head. <lb n="380"/>
            Scamandrius he called was by Hector, <lb/>
            Astyanax he named was in Troy. <lb/>
            Because his father was their sole protector, <lb/>
            The people from his honour nam'd the boy. <lb/>
            Then Hector smiling look'd upon his son. <lb n="385"/>
            And to him weeping said Andromache, <lb/>

            Planted about it many elmen-trees. <lb/>
            My seven brothers all were killed there. <lb/>
            In one day by Achilles slain were these, <lb/>
            As they defending were their kine and sheep. <lb n="405"/>
            My mother with the booty he brought hither, <lb/>
            And her he at the ships did prisoner keep <lb/>
            Until her friends her ransom had sent thither. <lb/>
            Then to her country back they sent my mother, <lb/>

            For there it was the Argives thrice fell on <lb/>

            The two Atrides, and Tydeus' son. <lb n="420"/>
            Whether they had some God for their director, <lb/>
            Or had observ'd some weakness in the place, <lb/>
            I know not. And to this replied Hector, <lb/>
            Dear wife, this might be done. But what disgrace <lb/>
            Shall I be in ? How will the Trojans scoff, <lb n="425"/>

            And bringeth with him home his spoil to Troy, <lb/>
            In battle he his father doth outdo, <lb/>
            And fill his loving mother's heart with joy. <lb/>
            This said, he gave the child t' Andromache, <lb/>
            Which she receiving hugg'd, and laugh'd, and cried. <lb n="470"/>
            Which Hector with compassion did see, <lb/>
            And thus with gentle words his wife did chide. <lb/>
            Dear wife, do not afflict yourself for me. <lb/>
            No man can die before his hour is come; <lb/>
            And when 'tis come, put off it cannot be <lb n="475"/>
            By weak nor strong. Therefore I pray go home, <lb/>
            And tend your work, and give your women theirs, <lb/>
            And sit still at your spindle and your loom, <lb/>
            And leave to men these martial affairs, <lb/>
            And me that have the charge of Ilium. <lb n="480"/>
            Then up he takes his helmet and departs, <lb/>
            And homewards she; but often turn'd her head. <lb/>
            At home with grief she fill'd her women's hearts, <lb/>
            And made them mourn for Hector not yet dead. <lb/>
            Nor Paris at his house did longer stay <lb n="485"/>
            Than he must needs his armour to put on, <lb/>
            And up and down the streets went ev'ry way, <lb/>
            To see if he could Hector light upon. <lb/>
            As when a horse i' th' stable pampered, <lb/>
            And used to be washed in the river <lb n="490"/>
            His headstall breaks, or be delivered <lb/>
            From that which held him by what means soever; <lb/>
            Then proudly he sets up his tail and head, <lb/>

            Brother, I fear I've made you stay too long. <lb/>
            No, he replied, your courage no man can <lb/>
            Accuse, but such as mean to do you wrong. <lb/>
            But when you, out of humour, will not fight, <lb n="505"/>

            Speak all the ill they can of you in spite. <lb/>

            There Paris slew Menesthius, the son <lb n="5"/>

            He for the Trojans, for the Argives she, <lb/>

            Daughter of Jove, what great necessity <lb n="20"/>
            Brought you to Troy? Was it to please your mind, <lb/>
            Or give unto the Greeks the victory ? <lb/>
            For well I know to Troy you are not kind. <lb/>
            But for the present be advis'd by me. <lb/>

            And fight it out hereafter, till they know <lb/>
            What end the Fates assigned have to Troy, <lb/>
            Since you and Juno needs will have it so. <lb/>
            Your counsel's good, said Pallas, and the same <lb/>
            I thought upon. But tell me how to do it. <lb n="30"/>
            For to that end I from Olympus came. <lb/>
            Tell me but how, and I'll consent unto it. <lb/>
            Why then, said Phœbus, Hector I'll excite <lb/>
            In duel all the Argives to defy; <lb/>
            And they some one will choose with him to fight, <lb n="35"/>
            And both the armies quietly stand by. <lb/>
            This counsel was by both agreed upon ; <lb/>
            And known to Helenus by augury, <lb/>
            To Helenus, that was King Priam's son. <lb/>
            And he to Hector did himself apply. <lb n="40"/>
            Hector, said he, will you do that which I, <lb/>
            That am your brother, shall advise you to ? <lb/>
            Go to th' Achæan army, and defy <lb/>
            The best of all the Argives; boldly<lb/>
            For in this combat you are not to die: <lb n="45"/>
            The Gods have told me so. Then never fear. <lb/>
            Then to the front came Hector joyfully, <lb/>
            With both his hands o' th' middle of his spear <lb/>
            To keep the Trojans back and make them stand; <lb/>
            And straight King Agamemnon seeing it, <lb n="50"/>
            Unto the Argives gave the like command. <lb/>
            Then on the ground both Greeks and Trojans sit. <lb/>
            Phœbus and Pa'Has flew up to the tree, <lb/>
            The high beech-tree that sacred was to Jove, <lb/>
            P th' likeness of two vultures, thence to see <lb n="55"/>
            How the two armies looked from above. <lb/>
            As when a west wind ruffled has the main, <lb/>
            It black and horrid to the eye appears; <lb/>
            So look'd the Greeks and Trojans on the plain, <lb/>
            Grisly and dark with helmets, shields, and spears. <lb n="60"/>
            Into the midst between them Hector stept. <lb/>
            You, Trojans and well-armed Greeks, said he, <lb/>
            Since 'twas Jove's will our oath should not be kept, <lb/>
            But that the war continued shall be <lb/>
            Till either you shall win the town of Troy, <lb n="65"/>
            Or we your army and your ships confound, <lb/>
            Fighting till one another we destroy; <lb/>
            I to you, Argives, somewhat will propound. <lb/>
            The best of all the Greeks are present here. <lb/>
            Let one of them come forth and fight with me, <lb n="70"/>
            On these conditions (witness Jupiter) <lb/>
            If by his hand I slain in combat be, <lb/>
            Let him do with my armour what he will, <lb/>
            But send my body into Ilium. <pb n="78"/>

            Upon the shore of Hellespont, and say, <lb/>
            Here lies a valiant Greek by Hector slain <lb/>
            Long since, when th' Argives were besieging Troy. <lb/>
            My honour thus for ever will remain. <lb/>
            So Hector said. The Greeks all silent were. <lb n="85"/>
            For shame the challenge they could not refuse; <lb/>
            And to accept it ev'ry one did fear. <lb/>
            But Menelaus then his valour shews, <lb/>
            And rising up in anger, thus he said, <lb/>
            Women of Argos, what a shame is this, <lb n="90"/>
            That you should all of Hector be afraid ! <lb/>
            What now become of all your threat'ning is ? <lb/>
            There (dust and water, heartless, nameless), sit. <lb/>
            Myself I'll arm (for I perceive no odds) <lb/>
            And will this sturdy champion Hector meet. <lb n="95"/>
            For victory comes only from the Gods. <lb/>
            This said, he rose and arm'd himself; and there <lb/>
            Depriv'd of life had Menelaus been <lb/>
            (So much too weak he was) by Hector's spear, <lb/>
            But that the princes starting up came in. <lb n="100"/>
            And Agamemnon seizing on his hand, <lb/>
            Why, Menelaus, are you mad, said he, <lb/>
            In fight you cannot against Hector stand, <lb/>
            How much soever you concerned be. <lb/>
            Avoid him in the field as others do. <lb n="105"/>
            Achilles, who than you much stronger is, <lb/>
            Strong as he is, considers Hector too, <lb/>
            And cooler grows as oft as he him sees. <lb/>
            Therefore, good brother, sit still at your troop. <lb/>
            Some other well oppose to Hector's might, <lb n="110"/>
            That, haughty as he is, shall make him stoop, <lb/>
            And thank the Gods if safe he come from fight. <lb/>
            To this good counsel yielded Menelaus. <lb/>
            Whereat his servants not a little joy'd, <lb/>
            Came in, and soon by them unarm'd he was, <lb n="115"/>
            And to the Greeks then Nestor rose, and said, <lb/>
            0 how unwelcome will this story be <lb/>

            If he should know how much you Hector dread, <lb/>
            How oft would he hold up his hands, and pray <lb/>
            The Gods to send him down amongst the dead, <lb/>

            When war was twixt Arcadia and P yle, <lb/>
            And at the walls of Pheia stood the men <lb/>
            Ready for bloody fight in rank and file! <lb/>
            Amongst them stood one Ereuthalion, <lb/>
            And of the great man Areïthous <lb n="130"/>
            Upon his shoulders had the armour on, <lb/>
            Who Clubman commonly surnamed was, <lb/>
            Because he used neither bow nor spear, <lb/>
            But with an iron club the battles brake. <lb/>
            Lycurgus slew him though he weaker were, <lb n="135"/>
            (When at advantage great he did him take) <lb/>
            By craft, not strength. For in a narrow way <lb/>
            He watch'd him at a turning with his spear, <lb/>
            And on a sudden took his life away, <lb/>
            So that the club had nothing to do there. <lb n="140"/>
            Then took he off his arms, and wore the same <lb/>
            In battle when there was occasion, <lb/>
            But gave them, when old age upon him came, <lb/>
            To this his squire Ereuthalion. <lb/>
            Who wearing them our army did defy, <lb n="145"/>
            At which, when others trembling stood and shook, <lb/>
            Although the youngest of them all was I, <lb/>
            Great as he was, the man I undertook, <lb/>
            And slew him by the Goddess Pallas' aid, <lb/>
            The strongest and tallest that I e'er slew, <lb n="150"/>
            As when upon the ground he stretch'd was laid, <lb/>
            The place he covered did plainly show. <lb/>
            If I were now as young and strong as then, <lb/>
            The Greeks for Hector soon a match should find, <lb/>
            Though none of you that are their bravest men <lb n="155"/>

            In single fight with Hector to contend) <lb/>
            Armed, and Agamemnon was the first. <lb n="160"/>
            And next the strong and valiant Diomed, <lb/>
            And then the greater Ajax, then the less, <lb/>
            Then King Idomeneus, of Crete the head, <lb/>
            And with him his good squire Meriones, <lb/>
            Who as the God of battle valiant was, <lb n="165"/>
            Besides Eurypylus Euæmon's son, <lb/>
            And of Andremon the stout son Thoas, <lb/>
            And wise Ulysses last of all made one. <lb/>
            So many Greeks durst Hector undertake. <lb/>
            Bring in your lots, said Nestor then, and we <lb n="170"/>
            Will in a helmet them together shake. <lb/>
            And who by lot our champion shall be <lb/>

            Meanwhile the people lift their hands, and pray, <lb/>

            Rose up, and lets it fall before his feet. <lb/>
            And to the princes said, This lot is mine, <lb/>

            So that, at least, the Trojans may not hear. <lb/>
            Or, now I think on't, plain and openly. <lb/>
            For I see nothing that I need to fear. <lb n="195"/>
            I am not forc'd to fight unwillingly, <lb/>
            Nor rashly undertook the enterprise. <lb/>
            For I was born and bred in Salamis, <lb/>
            And hope I am not so weak or unwise. <lb/>
            As soon as mighty Ajax had said this, <lb n="200"/>
            The people looking up to heav'n pray'd. <lb/>
            O Jove, said one, grant Ajax victory, <lb/>
            Or if you be inclined Hector to aid, <lb/>
            Then let their strength and glory equal be. <lb/>
            When Ajax had his arms put on complete, <lb n="205"/>
            He walked away with a majestic pace, <lb/>
            As Mars goes to the war. His strides were great, <lb/>
            And scornful smiles with terror in his face. <lb/>
            And as he went he shook his mighty spear, <lb/>
            Which joyfully the Argives did behold ; <lb n="210"/>
            But by the Trojans look'd on was with fear; <lb/>
            And Hector at the heart himself was cold, <lb/>
            But was ashamed back again to fly, <lb/>
            Since he provok'd him had into the field. <lb/>
            And Ajax now was come unto him nigh, <lb n="215"/>

            Ajax, said Hector, I am not a child, <lb/>
            Nor woman, to be threaten'd, but a man <lb/>
            That understands the bus'ness of the field, <lb/>

            And know to guide my horses in a fight, <lb/>
            And move my feet to Mars his melody. <lb/>
            But no such cunning will I use with you, <lb/>
            My spear I'll send unto you openly. <lb/>
            And at that word the long spear from him flew, <lb n="235"/>
            And pierc'd his target to the seventh ply. <lb/>
            But there it staid. Then Ajax threw his spear, <lb/>
            Which Hector's shield, armour, and coat went thro'; <lb/>
            But Hector shrunk his belly in for fear, <lb/>
            For else it pierced had his belly too. <lb n="240"/>
            Then from their shields the spears they plucked out, <lb/>
            And them no more at one another threw, <lb/>
            But came unto each other close, and fought, <lb/>
            And like two lions on each other flew. <lb/>
            And Hector made a thrust at Ajax' shield <lb n="245"/>
            Which enter'd not, resisted by the brass: <lb/>
            But Hector's shield to Ajax' spear did yield, <lb/>
            Which pierc'd it through, and so far in did pass, <lb/>
            That grazing on his neck it fetch'd the blood. <lb/>
            But Hector, not dismay'd, took up a stone. <lb n="250"/>
            Ajax took 't on his shield and firmly stood, <lb/>
            And with his hand took up a greater one, <lb/>
            And rougher, which did Hector's buckler tear, <lb/>
            And with the weight unto the ground him threw, <lb/>
            But up again Apollo did him rear. <lb n="255"/>
            Then both of them, the combat to renew, <lb/>
            Their swords were drawing. But the heralds then, <lb/>
            Idæus and Talthibius, came in, <lb/>
            The sacred messengers of Gods and men, <lb/>
            And put themselves the combatants between. <lb n="260"/>
            Troy's herald then, Idæus, to them spake. <lb/>
            Good sons, belov'd of Jove, give over fight, <lb/>

            'Twas he that challeng'd all the Argive lords. <lb/>
            Let him give over first, and then will I. <lb/>
            Then Hector spake. Ajax, since you, said he, <lb/>

            Let for to-day the quarrel ended be. <lb/>

            These two men fought and sought each other's death, <lb/>
            Yet parted friends. This said, he to him gave <lb/>
            His belt with his good sword and iv'ry sheath ; <lb/>
            Ajax to him his shining girdle brave. <lb/>
            Thus parted, Ajax to the Argives went; <lb n="285"/>
            And Hector back into the troops of Troy; <lb/>
            Who mightily rejoic'd at the event <lb/>
            That past all hope they saw him come away. <lb/>
            The lords conducted him to Ilium: <lb/>
            The Greeks to Agamemnon Ajax led. <lb n="290"/>
            And when they all unto his tent were come, <lb/>
            He for them sacrificed a bull well fed, <lb/>
            Which flay'd, divided, roasted, taken up, <lb/>
            The carvers into messes cut. This done, <lb/>
            King Agamemnon and the princes sup. <lb n="295"/>
            The chine at Ajax' table was set on, <lb/>
            And when their thirst and hunger were subdu'd, <lb/>
            Nestor, whose counsel still had been the best, <lb/>
            What further was to be consider'd shew'd, <lb/>
            And to the princes all his speech address'd. <lb n="300"/>
            Atrides, and you other princes, know <lb/>
            How Mars with Argives strewed hath the plain, <lb/>
            And sent their souls down to the pow'rs below, <lb/>
            Whose bloody bodies in the field remain. <lb/>
            Tomorrow, therefore, let us cease from war, <lb n="305"/>
            And early in the morning fetch the dead, <lb/>
            And burn them somewhere from the ships not far, <lb/>
            That t' Argos back they may be carried, <lb/>
            When we depart from hence; that their bones may <lb/>
            By their own friends and children buried be. <lb n="310"/>
            Let's raise a mount upon the shore of Troy, <lb/>
            One for them all, for passengers to see, <lb/>
            And fortify our good ships with a wall, <lb/>
            And turrets in it, and a ditch without, <lb/>
            Lest unawares the Trojans on us fall, <lb n="315"/>
            And gates for char'ots to go in and out. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the Trojan lords at counsel were <lb/>
            Loud and discordant. Then Antenor said, <lb/>
            Trojans and aids, I pray to me give ear, <lb/>
            For of the worst I greatly am afraid. <lb n="320"/>
            Let Menelaus have his wife again, <lb/>

            Then let her go, or never look to speed. <lb/>

            The best advice you could have given, or <lb/>
            (If what you say dissent not from your thought) <lb/>
            You are not now so wise as heretofore: <lb/>
            Thus much to you. But to the Trojans this: <lb/>
            Her wealth I'll render, with more of mine own, <lb n="330"/>
            But my wife Helen I will not dismiss. <lb/>
            And when he that had said, again sat down. <lb/>
            Then Priam rose. Trojans and aids, said he, <lb/>
            Now take your supper as you us'd to do, <lb/>
            And sentinels set, such as careful be; <lb n="335"/>
            To-morrow I will send Idæus to <lb/>
            The Greeks with Paris' answer, and to try <lb/>
            If they from battle for so long will cease, <lb/>
            That we may burn our slain men quietly, <lb/>
            And fight again hereafter when they please. <lb n="340"/>
            This said, the Trojans to their suppers went. <lb/>
            Next morn Idæus found the Argive lords <lb/>
            Together met at Agamemnon's tent, <lb/>
            And coming in, unto them said these words: <lb/>
            Atrides, and you Argives all, I come <lb n="345"/>
            With terms from Paris, and by Priam sent, <lb/>
            On which you may depart from Ilium, <lb/>
            And end the war, if thereto you consent. <lb/>
            The wealth which he with Helen brought ashore, <lb/>
            (I would before he brought it he had died) <lb n="350"/>
            To Menelaus he will give, and more; <lb/>
            But his wife Helen shall with him abide. <lb/>
            Besides, the people have commanded me <lb/>
            To ask you if you will the war suspend, <lb/>
            Until our dead fetch'd off and burned be, <lb n="355"/>
            And after fight till Jove the war shall end. <lb/>
            So said Idæus. The Greeks silent were <lb/>
            Awhile. At last Tydides rose and spake. <lb/>
            Let not the Greeks so much the Trojans fear <lb/>
            As Helen's goods, or her herself to take <lb n="360"/>
            At Alexander's hands. The hour is come <lb/>
            (As any child may manifestly see) <lb/>
            That must o'erthrow the state of Ilium. <lb/>
            So said Tydides, and much prais'd was he. <lb/>
            Then Agamemnon answer'd to Idæus, <lb n="365"/>
            You hear what the Argives say. I say the same. <lb/>
            As for the dead men, burn them if you please ; <lb/>
            They're good for nothing. I contented am. <lb/>
            And of this truce let Jove a witness be. <lb/>
            This said, to Jove his sceptre up he heav'd. <lb n="370"/>
            Idæus back to Troy went speedily, <lb/>
            The answer to relate he had receiv'd. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the states of Troy in council sat, <lb/>

            The offer made by Paris was rejected, <lb/>
            But that a truce was granted for a day. <lb/>
            Next morn the Trojans, early as they could, <lb/>

            So did the Argives some to Ida go <lb/>

            But could not then distinguish friend from foe. <lb/>
            But by and by the sun began to gild <lb/>

            But Priam had forbidden them to roar, <lb/>
            Or cry outright, though grieved at their hearts. <lb/>
            When they had burnt them, back they went again. <lb/>
            The Greeks too, when they had consumed with fire <lb n="390"/>
            And done their lamentation for the slain, <lb/>
            Unto their ships did back again retire. <lb/>

            And the incursion of the foe to stay, <lb n="395"/>
            Their navy they inclosed with a wall, <lb/>
            With turrets high, and a great ditch without, <lb/>
            (Upon the sides whereof sharp pales they fix) <lb/>
            And gates for char'ots to go in and out. <lb/>
            And all the day thus toiling were the Greeks. <lb n="400"/>
            Meanwhile the Gods together sat above, <lb/>
            And wond'ring look'd upon this work of men ; <lb/>
            And Neptune then address'd his speech to Jove. <lb/>
            What mortals will the Gods consult again ? <lb/>
            See you not what a wall the Greeks have rear'd, <lb n="405"/>
            And what a ditch about it made, said he, <lb/>
            The fame whereof 'mongst people will be heard <lb/>
            As far as the sun-beams extended be ? <lb/>
            Yet to the Gods they hecatomb gave none. <lb/>
            Whereas the walls that I and Phoebus raised <lb n="410"/>
            About the city for Laomedon, <lb/>
            Obscur'd by this, no longer will be prais'd. <lb/>
            Then answer'd Jove. Neptune, I never thought <lb/>
            That such a word would e'er have come from you, <lb/>
            That have the pow'r to bring their work to nought. <lb n="415"/>
            A lesser God might have complain'd, 'tis true; <lb/>

            Hard hoof'd, swift-footed horses two. Like gold <lb/>
            Their manes profound well-combed shined far. <lb/>
            Then arm'd himself, and on the whip laid hold. <lb n="40"/>
            No sooner had the horses felt the whip, <lb/>
            But up they start, and 'twixt the earth and sky <lb/>
            The winds themselves with swiftness they outstrip, <lb/>
            And came unto the top of Ida high <lb/>
            To Gargarus, and there Jove took them out, <lb n="45"/>
            And hiding them with air on th' hill sat down; <lb/>
            And as he sat he cast his eyes about <lb/>
            With great content upon the fleet and town. <lb/>
            The Argives at their tents short breakfast make, <lb/>
            And arm'd themselves as soon as they had done. <lb n="50"/>
            The Trojans, for their wives' and children's sake, <lb/>
            (Though fewer) arm'd and made haste to be gone. <lb/>
            Then open'd were the gates, and to the field <lb/>
            Out came they horse and man ; and being met, <lb/>
            They man to man came up with shield to shield, <lb n="55"/>
            And spear to spear; and on each other set. <lb/>
            Some groan'd, some vaunted, mighty was the din <lb/>
            Of those that kill, and those that falling cry. <lb/>
            And this condition they continued in <lb/>
            Until the sun had mounted half the sky. <lb n="60"/>
            Then Jove took up a pair of scales of gold, <lb/>
            And weigh'd the fates of both the nations, <lb/>
            And equally suspended them did hold; <lb/>
            But not so equal were their inclinations. <lb/>
            For th' Argive scale sat still upon the ground, <lb n="65"/>
            While th' other lifted was up to the skies. <lb/>
            Heaven and earth did then with thunder sound, <lb/>
            And Jove threw lightning in the Argives' eyes, <lb/>
            Then all the Greeks amazed ran away. <lb/>
            Idomeneus and Agamemnon ran ; <lb n="70"/>
            Nor either of the Ajaxes durst stay: <lb/>
            Except old Nestor they fled ev'ry man. <lb/>
            And Nestor too had fled, had he known how: <lb/>
            For of his horses Paris one had shot, <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            And pierc'd his forehead just above the brow <note type="margin"> LIB. VIII. </note><note type="margin"> The second <lb/>

            Into the brain, so that his chariot <lb/>
            Now useless was, and the horse troublesome. <lb/>
            Then cuts he th' harness; but so long did stay, <lb/>
            That Hector now was almost to him come, <lb/>
            And th' old man surely had been cast away, <lb n="80"/>
            But that Tydides saw him in this pain, <lb/>
            And terribly t' Ulysses cried out, <lb/>
            Whether dye fly, Ulysses ? Come again, <lb/>
            Help to defend old Nestor; face about. <lb/>
            While he said this, Ulysses still ran on, <lb n="85"/>
            Not minding what he said. And Diomed, <lb/>
            To succour Nestor, to him went alone, <lb/>
            And with him stood before his chariot's head, <lb/>
            And said, 0 Nestor, youthful is the foe <lb/>
            That cometh on, and you now very old, <lb n="90"/>
            Your charioteer not strong, your horses slow, <lb/>
            Come up into my char'ot, and behold <lb/>
            My Trojan horses how well they can run <lb/>
            When there is cause t'approach or shun the fight; <lb/>
            From Venus' son Æneas I them won, <lb n="95"/>
            A man of much experience in flight: <lb/>
            Send back your horses, and with mine we'll go <lb/>
            And fight the Trojans. 'Twill not be amiss <lb/>
            To let the mighty champion Hector know, <lb/>
            A spear as mad is in my hand as his. <lb n="100"/>
            This said, both Sthen'lus and Eurymedon <lb/>
            With Nestor's horses went to Nestor's tent: <lb/>
            Nestor and Diomed, both mounted on <lb/>
            Tydides' chariot, up to Hector went. <lb/>
            And when they were to one another near, <lb n="105"/>
            At Hector Diomedes threw in haste, <lb/>
            And miss'd of him, and kill'd his charioteer; <lb/>
            Clean through his breast the spear well driven passed; <lb/>
            Down dead he fell, but Hector lets him lie, <lb/>
            And turns aside to seek a charioteer, <lb n="110"/>
            The place of Heniopeus to supply. <lb/>
            And Archeptolemus then being near, <lb/>
            Call'd up by Hector, on the reins laid hold. <lb/>
            Then mighty work and slaughter there had been, <lb/>
            And Trojans shut like lambs within a fold <lb n="115"/>
            In Troy, but that it was by Jove foreseen; <lb/>
            For in a clap of thunder Jove down threw <lb/>
            His bolt at Diomedes' horses' feet, <lb/>
            And th' earth with sulphur flaming looked blue. <lb/>
            Nestor himself astonish'd was to see't; <lb n="120"/>
            Lets go the reins, and down the horses fell. <lb/>
            And Nestor then to Diomedes said, <lb/>
            'Tis Jove, you see, that doth our force repel,. <lb/>
            And Hector, for this day, intends to aid. <pb n="88"/>

            Another day to us he will be kind, <lb n="125"/>
            If he see cause ; for no man can him tie, <lb/>
            Nor able is to make him change his mind, <lb/>
            And therefore now our best course is to fly. <lb/>
            'Tis true, 0 Nestor, said Tydides then, <lb/>
            But what a pain then at my heart will lie, <lb n="130"/>
            When Hector, speaking to the Trojan men, <lb/>
            Shall brag he made Tydides from him fly ? <lb/>
            Then should I wish the earth would swallow me. <lb/>
            Though Hector says so, Nestor then replied, <lb/>
            Believed by the Trojans 'twill not be, <lb n="135"/>
            So many of them by your hand have died. <lb/>
            And at this word his steeds he turn'd about. <lb/>
            A shower of spears then from the Trojans flies, <lb/>
            Who them pursued with a mighty shout. <lb/>
            Then Hector loud unto Tydides cries, <lb n="140"/>
            Ho! Diomed, by th' Argives honoured <lb/>
            Above the most, serv'd with a greater mess, <lb/>
            And higher seat, and wine unlimited, <lb/>
            You will hereafter be esteemed less. <lb/>
            Unmanly Diomed. Fly, baggage, fly; <lb n="145"/>
            You ne'er shall come within the walls of Troy, <lb/>
            To freight your ship with women here; for I <lb/>
            Intend to send you first another way. <lb/>
            This said, Tydides was awhile in doubt <lb/>
            Whether to turn or no and Hector meet, <lb n="150"/>
            And thrice to turn his horses was about, <lb/>
            And Jove thrice thund'ring turn'd them tow'rd the fleets <lb/>
            Shewing that he the honour of that day <lb/>
            Had granted to the Trojans. Hector then <lb/>
            Pursu'd them close, and roaring all the way, <lb n="155"/>
            Trojans, said he, and aids, now play the men, <lb/>
            For sure I am that Jove is on our side, <lb/>
            And give us will the victory this day. <lb/>
            And fools they are that in their wall confide; <lb/>
            For through their trench our horse shall find a way. <lb n="160"/>
            When we are at the ships, let one or other <lb/>
            Have fire to burn them ready, and then fall <lb/>
            Upon the men confounded in the smother. <lb/>
            This said, he did upon his horses call, <lb/>
            Xanthus, Podargus, Æthon, Lampus, see <lb n="165"/>
            You pay now what you owe me for your meat, <lb/>
            Laid in your mangers by Andromache, <lb/>

            And very oft, though I her husband be, <lb n="170"/>
            Your dinner was made ready before mine. <lb/>
            Now, now pursue the Argives lustily, <lb/>
            That Nestor's shield of gold I may obtain; <lb/>

            The Argives will this very night hoist sail. <lb/>
            At Hector's speech Juno upon her throne <lb/>
            Unquiet sitting, made Olympus shake ; <lb/>
            For mov'd she was with his presumption, <lb/>
            And looking upon Neptune to him spake. <lb n="180"/>
            Neptune, said she, are you not stirr'd at this ? <lb/>
            You know at Ægæ, and at Helice, <lb/>
            Their liberality abundant is, <lb/>
            And sure I am you wish them victory. <lb/>
            What! cannot we, who with the Argives side, <lb n="185"/>
            If we our powers together join in one, <lb/>
            Drive back the Trojans, and abate their pride, <lb/>
            And leave Jove here to sit and chafe alone? <lb/>
            Juno, said Neptune, griev'd, these words are bold : <lb/>
            I'll not rebel; for we shall have the worst, <lb n="190"/>
            And so we have by Jupiter been told. <lb/>
            Thus Neptune and the wife of Jove discoursed. <lb/>
            And now between the walls and ships, the place <lb/>
            With horses and with armed men was fill'd, <lb/>
            And crammed were within a narrow space <lb n="195"/>
            By Hector, that was master of the field. <lb/>
            And had not Agamemnon been inspired <lb/>
            By Juno to put courage in his men, <lb/>
            The Argive ships had certainly been fired, <lb/>
            And never had the Greeks gone back again. <lb n="200"/>
            Then 'mongst the ships he went, and stayed at <lb/>
            Ulysses' ship, which was the middlemost <lb/>
            Of all the navy, and the tallest; that <lb/>
            He might be heard to both ends of the host, <lb/>
            Both to Achilles and to Ajax' tent, <lb n="205"/>
            Clad in th' imperial robe, that all might see't; <lb/>
            For these two being the most confident, <lb/>
            Had plac'd themselves at th' utmost of the fleet; <lb/>
            And with a mighty voice to th' Argives cried, <lb/>

            Your brags, that any of you durst abide <lb/>
            An hundred Trojans, and yet dare not show <lb/>
            A face to Hector, who our ships would fire ? <lb/>
            But this was said at Lemnos in your wine, <lb/>
            Which rais'd your language than your nature higher; <lb n="215"/>
            But cooled now the battle you decline. <lb/>
            Was ever king afflicted as I am, <lb/>
            O Jove, or lost a victory so near ? <lb/>
            And yet at all your altars as I came, <lb/>
            My sacrifices duly payed were, <lb n="220"/>
            In hope that I the town of Troy should sack. <lb/>
            But grant at least, 0 Jove, that we may come <lb/>
            Ourselves into Achæa safely back, <lb/>

            And from him presently his eagle came, <lb/>
            And brought the tender issue of a hart, <lb/>
            And near unto his altar dropp'd the same. <lb/>
            The Argives when they saw the bird of Jove, <lb/>
            Were to the fight again encouraged, <lb n="230"/>
            And who should first repass the trenches strove. <lb/>
            And he that first came forth was Diomed. <lb/>
            And much before that any of the rest <lb/>
            Had any slain, he killed Agelaus, <lb/>
            Whom with his spear he piere'd from back to breast, <lb n="235"/>
            When from him he his char'ot turning was. <lb/>
            Then Agamemnon came, and Menelaus, <lb/>
            And then the greater Ajax, then the less. <lb/>
            The sixth the king Idomeneus was, <lb/>
            And with him came his squire Meriones. <lb n="240"/>
            And next Eurypylus, Euæmon's son. <lb/>
            The ninth was Teucer with his bow unbent. <lb/>
            Hid with the shield of Ajax Telamon <lb/>
            His mighty brother, to the field he went, <lb/>
            Which Ajax lifting, Teucer chose his man, <lb n="245"/>
            And having at him aim'd, and shot, and kill'd, <lb/>
            As children to their mothers, back he ran, <lb/>
            And hid himself behind his brother's shield. <lb/>
            How many were the men he killed thus ? <lb/>
            Orstolochus, Ophlestus, Lycophon, <lb n="250"/>
            And Melanippus, Dætor, Ormenus, <lb/>
            And Chromius, and last Amopaon. <lb/>
            All those lay dead together on the sands. <lb/>
            When Agamemnon saw what work was done <lb/>
            By Teucer's arrows on the Trojan's bands, <lb n="255"/>
            He to him came, and said, 0 valiant son <lb/>
            Of Telamon, so, so your shafts bestow, <lb/>
            Unto the Argives all an honour be, <lb/>
            And to your father Telamon ; for though <lb/>
            Unto your mother married not was he, <lb n="260"/>
            Yet has he still maintain'd you as his own. <lb/>
            And if it please Jove and the pow'rs divine <lb/>
            To make me once the master of this town, <lb/>
            Your share shall be the next set out to mine, <lb/>
            And to your honour shall receive from me <lb n="265"/>
            A tripod, and two horses with the car; <lb/>
            Or if you will, your bed shall honour'd be <lb/>
            With some fair woman taken in the war. <lb/>
            Teucer to this then answer made and said, <lb/>
            Of this encouragement no need have I. <lb n="270"/>
            Since we came forth I have no time delay'd, <lb/>
            But done as much as in my pow'r did lie. <lb/>
            Eight shafts already have gone from my bow, <lb/>
            And in as many Trojans fix'd have been. <lb/>

            T hen took he out another arrow keen, <lb/>
            And aim'd at Hector, but he hit him not, <lb/>
            But wounded on the breast Gorgythion, <lb/>
            Who on fair Castianira was begot, <lb/>
            And of King Priam's valiant sons was one. <lb n="280"/>
            Who falling on his knees hung down his head, <lb/>
            Just as a poppy charg'd with fruit and rain, <lb/>
            So had his casque his head o'erburthened. <lb/>
            And Teucer then at Hector shot again, <lb/>
            And miss'd again. Apollo put it by. <lb n="285"/>
            But Archeptolemus, his charioteer, <lb/>
            He missed not. Hector 'scap'd narrowly, <lb/>
            And Archeptolemus expired there <lb/>
            Shot through the breast. Hector was sorry, but <lb/>
            Left him. Cebriones chanced to be nigh, <lb n="290"/>
            And in his hands Hector the reins did put, <lb/>
            And from his chariot leap'd down suddenly, <lb/>
            And took a heavy stone into his hand. <lb/>
            Teucer the while again his bow had bent. <lb/>
            But drawing did so long, and aiming stand, <lb n="295"/>
            The stone from Hector the arrow did prevent, <lb/>
            And near the shoulder on the breast him struck. <lb/>
            And broken was the bow-string with the blow, <lb/>
            And his benumbed arm all sense forsook, <lb/>
            And sinking on his knees he dropped the bow. <lb n="300"/>
            Then Ajax stepp'd before him with his shield. <lb/>
            Mecistheus and Alastor him convey'd <lb/>
            Unto the Argive ships from off the field, <lb/>
            Grievously bruised, groaning and dismayed. <lb/>
            The courage of the Trojans now renew'd, <lb n="305"/>
            They chas'd the Argives back unto their wall, <lb/>
            And till the trenches they had pass'd, pursued, <lb/>
            And Hector at their heels the nearest of all. <lb/>
            As when a hound pursueth a wild boar, <lb/>
            Or lion, and presuming on his feet <lb n="310"/>
            Pinches his haunch or side, and then gives o'er, <lb/>
            Not daring if he turn the beast to meet; <lb/>
            So Hector chasing them still slew the last. <lb/>
            And many of them had the Trojans slain <lb/>
            Ere they the trenches and the pale had pass'd. <lb n="315"/>
            But being in they there themselves contain, <lb/>
            And comfort one another all they can ; <lb/>
            And to the Gods and Goddesses they pray, <lb/>
            Lifting their hands to heaven every man ; <lb/>
            And Hector then turn'd off and went his way. <lb n="320"/>
            Which Juno seeing, unto Pallas said, <lb/>
            Daughter of Jupiter, do you not see <lb/>
            What Greeks one madman, Hector, has destroy'd ? <lb/>
            Shall we sit still in this extremity? <pb n="92"/>

            To Juno then Athena thus replied, <lb n="325"/>
            Had not my father's wits been at a loss, <lb/>
            This furious Hector by the Greeks had died, <lb/>
            But he my counsel always loves to cross. <lb/>
            He has forgot how oft his son I sav'd <lb/>
            Oppressed by Euristheus' tyranny. <lb n="330"/>
            For always when his father's help he crav'd, <lb/>
            Down to the earth from heaven sent was I. <lb/>
            But had I known as much as I do now, <lb/>
            When for the dog he went to Pluto's gate, <lb/>
            He had for me till this time staid below, <lb n="335"/>
            And by the odious Styx for ever sate. <lb/>
            But now he hates me. And by Thetis led, <lb/>
            He must Achilles honour. But my hope is, <lb/>
            The time will come I shall be favoured <lb/>
            By him again, and called his dear Glaucopis. <lb n="340"/>
            But make you ready now your chariot, <lb/>
            While I put on my arms; that we may see <lb/>
            If Hector will thereof be glad or not, <lb/>
            Or if some Trojans rather shall not be <lb/>
            Left dead for dogs and vultures to devour. <lb n="345"/>
            Then Juno to her car the horses brought. <lb/>
            To Jove's house Pallas went, and on the floor <lb/>
            Threw down her long robe, and put on Jove's coat. <lb/>
            And then her breast with armour covered. <lb/>
            And on her shoulder hung her fearful shield. <lb n="350"/>
            Then took her heavy spear with brazen head, <lb/>
            Wherewith she breaketh squadrons in the field. <lb/>
            Then open of itself flew heaven-gate, <lb/>
            (Though to the Seasons Jove the power gave <lb/>
            Alone to judge of early and of late) <lb n="355"/>
            And out the Goddesses the horses drave. <lb/>
            Then Jove to Iris said, Go, to them speak. <lb/>
            Tell them an ill match they will have of me. <lb/>
            I'll lame their horses and their char'ot break, <lb/>
            Unto the ground they both shall tumbled be; <lb n="360"/>
            And with my thunder wounded shall be so, <lb/>
            That ten years after they shall not be welL <lb/>
            For I would have Glaucopis well to know <lb/>
            What 'tis against her father to rebel. <lb/>
            But Juno is so us'd to cross my will, <lb n="365"/>
            That towards her my anger is the less. <lb/>
            Then Iris went her way from Ida hill, <lb/>
            And near Olympus met the Goddesses, <lb/>
            And as she bidden was did to them speak. <lb/>
            What fury's this ? Whither d'ye go, said she. <lb n="370"/>
            Jove will your horses lame, your char'ot break, <lb/>
            And to the ground you both will tumbled be, <lb/>
            And with his thunder wounded will be so, <lb/>

            What 'tis against your father to rebel. <lb/>
            But Juno is so us'd to cross his will <lb/>
            That he affronts from her can better bear; <lb/>
            But, Pallas, at your hands he takes it ill <lb/>
            That you should dare against him lift a spear. <lb n="380"/>
            Iris, her errand done, no longer stay d, <lb/>
            And to Minerva thus said Juno then: <lb/>
            Jove shall no more for me be disobey'd, <lb/>
            By taking part in war with mortal men. <lb/>
            But let one live and let another die, <lb n="385"/>
            As by the chance of war it shall fall out, <lb/>
            And let him do what he thinks equity. <lb/>
            This said, her chariot she turn'd about. <lb/>
            The horses by the Seasons freed and fed, <lb/>
            The char'ot was set up against the wall. <lb n="390"/>
            The Goddesses themselves then entered, <lb/>
            And took their places in the council-hall <lb/>
            With th' other Gods. And Jove himself from Ida <lb/>
            T' Olympus came, and lighted from his car, <lb/>
            And Neptune from the same his steeds untied, <lb n="395"/>
            And set them up, and of them had a care. <lb/>
            The chariot he set to the altar near <lb/>
            Cover'd with linen fine. Then to his throne, <lb/>
            His throne of gold, mounted the Thunderer, <lb/>
            And made Olympus shake as he sat down. <lb n="400"/>
            But Juno and Athena silent sat <lb/>
            Together by themselves from Jove apart <lb/>
            And discontent. But Jove knew well for what; <lb/>
            And answer made to what was in her heart. <lb/>
            Juno, said he, and Pallas, why so sad ? <lb n="405"/>
            Your fight against the Trojans was not long. <lb/>
            And more you had been vexed if it had ; <lb/>
            So much for th' other Gods I am too strong. <lb/>
            The danger scarce begun was when you fled. <lb/>
            But had you dar'd the battle to maintain, <lb n="410"/>
            You had been by my hand so thundered, <lb/>
            You never had t' Olympus come again. <lb/>
            Juno at this and Pallas grumbling sat, <lb/>
            And Pallas from replying did abstain, <lb/>
            Although no less the Trojans she did hate. <lb n="415"/>
            But Juno was not able to contain. <lb/>
            O cruel Jove, said she, what words are these ? <lb/>
            Must we unto our friends be so ingrate, <lb/>
            Because we know you can do what you please, <lb/>
            As not the Argives to commiserate ? <lb n="420"/>
            We are content, since you will have it so, <lb/>
            No longer in the war to give them aid; <lb/>
            But let us give them counsel what to do, <lb/>

            Juno, said Jove, tomorrow you shall know <lb n="425"/>
            If you'll be pleas'd the battle to behold, <lb/>
            How many martial Greeks I'll overthrow. <lb/>
            For Hector shall not be by me control'd <lb/>
            Until Achilles be fetch'd back again, <lb/>
            And at the Argive ships the battle be <lb n="430"/>
            About the body of Patroclus slain. <lb/>
            For so it is ordain'd by destiny. <lb/>
            And for your anger, Juno, I not care, <lb/>
            Though to the end of earth and sea you go, <lb/>
            (Where pent Iäpetus and Saturn are <lb n="435"/>
            In horrid darkness) and complain ; yet so <lb/>
            I will not for your anger care a jot. <lb/>
            For you are grown extremely insolent. <lb/>
            Thus Jupiter; and Juno answer'd not. <lb/>
            Then down the sun into the ocean went, <lb n="440"/>
            Drawing upon the fields a cloudy night, <lb/>
            Which gave the Trojan army no content, <lb/>
            But to the Greeks more welcome was than light. <lb/>
            The army Hector call'd to parliament, <lb/>
            And led them to a clean place, free from blood, <lb n="445"/>
            And there they all on foot about him throng. <lb/>
            Hector unto them giving orders stood <lb/>
            With spear in hand eleven cubits long. <lb/>
            Hear me, you Trojans and you aids, said he, <lb/>
            I thought we should have now the Greeks destroy'd, <lb n="450"/>
            And lodged in the town with victory. <lb/>
            But this my hope is by the night made void, <lb/>
            Nor can we help it. Let us now provide, <lb/>
            For supper, beeves and sheep, and wine and bread <lb/>
            From Troy; and let the horses be untied, <lb n="455"/>
            And care be taken that they be well fed. <lb/>
            Then fetch in wood, and fires abundance make, <lb/>
            That with the flame light'ned may be the sky, <lb/>
            Lest th' Argives in the dark advantage take, <lb/>
            To go aboard and safe to Argos fly. <lb n="460"/>
            Let them embark at least in haste, and bear <lb/>
            Along with them their wounds uncured home, <lb/>
            That others who shall see't may stand in fear, <lb/>
            And say, This 'tis to fight 'gainst Ilium. <lb/>
            And let great boys and old men all night wake <lb n="465"/>
            Upon the walls and tow'rs, and guards be set, <lb/>
            And every wife at home a great fire make, <lb/>
            Lest into Troy the foe by treason get. <lb/>
            This, valiant Trojans, let be done to-night, <lb/>
            To morrow I shall further order give. <lb n="470"/>
            I doubt not but to put these dogs to flight <lb/>
            By th' help of Jove, and Ilium relieve. <lb/>
            But while 'tis night have on your guards a care, <lb/>

            Tomorrow he his strength will better know. <lb n="480"/>
            I would I were as certain not to die, <lb/>

            As Phœbus and Athena do, as I <lb/>
            Am sure we shall defeat these Greeks tomorrow. <lb/>
            Thus ended he. The Trojans, full of joy, <lb n="485"/>
            Their sweating horses soon took out and fed, <lb/>
            And some were sent into the town of Troy, <lb/>

            The Trojans confident of victory <lb/>
            Sat cheerful at their arms throughout the host. <lb/>

            And joyful are the shepherds at the sight: <lb/>

            A thousand fires, and at each fifty men, <lb/>

            My friends, what help can any man devise ? <lb/>
            Jove told me I should conquer Ilium, <lb/>
            And unto Argos safe return again, <lb/>
            And now deceiv'd me has, and sends me home <lb/>
            With shame when I have lost so many men. <lb n="20"/>
            And thus he loves to do to show his might. <lb/>
            Therefore my counsel, Argives, all obey: <lb/>
            Let's hoist our sails and save ourselves by flight; <lb/>
            For we shall never take the town of Troy. <lb/>
            This said, the princes long time silent sit, <lb n="25"/>
            At last Tydides rising thus replied, <lb/>
            King Agamemnon, so far as 'tis fit <lb/>
            In such a public place I must you chide. <lb/>
            Take it not ill, because not long ago <lb/>
            You me with want of courage did upbraid <lb n="30"/>
            Before the Greeks, as old and young well know. <lb/>
            Jove giv'n you has the right to be obey'd, <lb/>
            And grae'd you with the title of our king, <lb/>
            But has denied you a courageous spirit, <lb/>
            Which now is the most necessary thing. <lb n="35"/>
            You think too meanly of your people's merit. <lb/>
            As for yourself, if you will needs away, <lb/>
            Go. That's your way. Your ships there ready lie <lb/>
            That from Mycene brought you unto Troy, <lb/>
            But leave the rest their fortune here to try. <lb n="40"/>
            If none else stay, yet Sthenelus and I <lb/>
            Will not give over fighting till we know <lb/>
            To what side Jove will give the victory. <lb/>
            The Gods, I'm sure, will favour to us show. <lb/>
            This speech the lords commended very much. <lb n="45"/>
            Then Nestor rose, and to Tydides said, <lb/>
            There is not of your age another such, <lb/>
            For counsel wise, in battle not afraid. <lb/>
            None will deny but what you say is right; <lb/>
            But you have not said all you could have done ; <lb n="50"/>
            And no great wonder, since for age you might <lb/>
            (So young you are) have been my youngest son. <lb/>
            Yet the advice you given have is best; <lb/>
            I that am elder what wants will supply, <lb/>
            Adding thereto what you have not express'd, <lb n="55"/>
            To take from Agamemnon all reply. <lb/>
            For none but such as have no law, nor kin, <lb/>
            Nor house, in civil discord can delight. <lb/>
            But let us first our chiefest work begin, <lb/>
            And make the young men keep good watch all night. <lb n="60"/>
            And let them all from you, Atridcs, take <lb/>
            Their orders. For you are our general. <lb/>
            And for the princes a good supper make, <lb/>
            And all the eldest captains to it call. <lb/>

            For in your tents of wine you have good store, <lb/>
            And easlier provided than the rest, <lb/>
            So many ships you have to bring in more. <lb/>

            Betwixt the pale and wall, and supped there. <lb/>
            And the old leaders t' Agamemnon's tent, <lb/>
            And by him nobly entertained were. <lb/>
            But when they had an end made of the feast, <lb n="85"/>
            Nestor his counsel further open laid, <lb/>
            Which formerly had always been the best; <lb/>
            And, looking t' Agamemnon, thus he said. <lb/>
            King Agamemnon, I'll with you begin, <lb/>
            And with you end, since you the sceptre bear, <lb n="90"/>
            And in your care it lies to lose or win. <lb/>
            You chiefly should good counsel give and hear. <lb/>
            Hear then what now is my opinion, <lb/>
            Than which a better, I think, you'll not find, <lb/>
            Nor is it now the first time thought upon. <lb n="95"/>
            But heretofore I was of the same mind, <lb/>
            When from Achilles you Briseis took, <lb/>
            And I advised you to let her stay, <lb/>
            Though my good counsel then you could not brook, <lb/>
            But to your own great heart too much gave way, <lb n="100"/>
            Dishonouring the man of greatest might <lb/>
            In all the army, and most honoured <lb/>
            By all the Gods, and, contrary to right, <lb/>
            Taking the prize which he had purchased. <lb/>
            So that the bus'ness we have now to do <lb n="105"/>
            Is how to reconcile him if we can, <lb/>
            What gifts to give him, who shall with them go, <lb/>
            And with sweet language pacify the man. <lb/>
            This said, Atrides penitent replied, <lb/>
            O Nestor, all you charge me with is true, <lb n="110"/>
            And for Achilles' sake, 'tis not denied, <lb/>
            Jove does th' Achæan army now subdue. <lb/>
            He whom Jove loves worth a whole army is. <lb/>
            But since I made Achilles discontent, <note type="footnote"> VOL. x. </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IX. </note><note type="margin"> The Greeks <lb/>

            I'll make amends for what I did amiss, <lb n="115"/>
            And send a noble present to his tent. <lb/>
            I'll name the gifts I'll give him one by one. <lb/>
            Seven fire new trivets. Talents ten of gold. <lb/>
            Twenty black cauldrons. Twelve steeds that have won <lb/>
            Each one their prizes, and yet are not old. <lb n="120"/>
            A man that hath so many and so fleet <lb/>
            I think not poor, but gold may quickly win, <lb/>
            When I consider with their nimble feet <lb/>
            How many prizes they have brought me in. <lb/>
            And women seven, the best of women kind <lb n="125"/>
            For beauty and for works of housewifery. <lb/>
            And unto these Briseis shall be join'd, <lb/>
            And I'll be sworn she goes untouch'd from me. <lb/>
            And all this shall be sent him presently. <lb/>
            Hereafter, if we win the town of Troy, <lb n="130"/>
            Let him, before the prey divided be, <lb/>
            Come in and carry to his ship away <lb/>
            As much as it can bear of gold and brass. <lb/>
            And twenty Trojan women which he please, <lb/>
            Helen except. But if it come to pass <lb n="135"/>
            That safe to Argos we repass the seas, <lb/>
            My son in law he shall be if he will, <lb/>
            And as my son Orestes honour'd be; <lb/>
            Within my house three daughters I have still, <lb/>
            Iphianassa and Laodice, <lb n="140"/>
            And fair Chrysothemis, take which he list, <lb/>
            And to his father's house convey. For I <lb/>
            On settling of estate will not insist, <lb/>
            But of my own do that sufficiently. <lb/>
            Seven cities he shall have: Pheræ divine, <lb n="145"/>
            Enope, Ire, and Cardamyle, <lb/>
            And Pedasus that fertile is of wine, <lb/>
            Anthria, Æpia, all on the sea <lb/>
            Of sandy Pyle; and rich in sheep and kine <lb/>
            The people are, and will his laws obey, <lb n="150"/>
            And tribute pay as to a pow'r divine. <lb/>
            All this I'll give his anger to allay. <lb/>
            And this content him may if anything. <lb/>
            Inexorable none but Pluto is, <lb/>
            But hated for't. I am the greater king, <lb n="155"/>
            And elder man: he should consider this. <lb/>
            Thus Agamemnon. And then Nestor said, <lb/>
            The gifts, 0 king, no man can reprehend. <lb/>
            The next thing to be thought upon and weigh'd, <lb/>
            Is whom we shall unto Achilles send, <lb n="160"/>
            I think that Phoenix ought to lead the way, <lb/>
            Then Ajax and Ulysses, and with these <lb/>
            The public heralds two, Eurybates <lb/>
            And Odius, and here no longer stay <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            Than to bring water for our hands, that we <note type="margin"> LIB. IX. </note><note type="margin"> Ambassadors <lb/>

            May first send up our prayers unto Jove, <lb/>
            That our embassage may successful be. <lb/>
            This said by Nestor, all the rest approve. <lb/>
            When water was brought in they wash'd and pray'd; <lb/>
            The young men fill'd the temperers with wine; <lb n="170"/>
            And round about the full cups were convey'd, <lb/>
            And offer'd up unto the powers divine. <lb/>
            When they had offer'd, and drunk what they would, <lb/>
            And parting were from Agamemnon's tent, <lb/>
            Old Nestor to instruct them how they should <lb n="175"/>
            Achilles best persuade, out with them went. <lb/>
            And one by one advis'd them what to say, <lb/>
            Especially Ulysses. Then they went <lb/>
            Saying their prayers to Neptune all the way, <lb/>
            Until they came unto Achilles' tent. <lb n="180"/>
            Who sitting, in his hand had a guitar <lb/>
            To pass the time, and sung unto the same <lb/>
            The noble acts that had been done in war <lb/>
            By th' ancient heroes, men of greatest fame. <lb/>
            Patroclus sat before him, looking when <lb n="185"/>
            He should have done. Ulysses then led in <lb/>
            Ajax and Phoenix. And Achilles then <lb/>
            Leap'd up as one that had surprised been. <lb/>
            And them receiving kindly to them said, <lb/>
            Welcome, my friends, whate'er your bus'ness be. <lb n="190"/>
            To see you I am not a little joy'd, <lb/>
            Although th' Achæans have provoked me. <lb/>
            And to his friend Patroclus order gave, <lb/>
            A larger temperer, said he, set up, <lb/>
            For these the dearest friends are that I have. <lb n="195"/>
            Pure be the wine, and give each man a cup. <lb/>
            Patroclus did so. And sets on a pot <lb/>
            Upon the flaming fire, and puts into't <lb/>
            A good sheep's chine, another of a goat, <lb/>
            Besides the chine of a fat boar to boot. <lb n="200"/>
            The blood boil'd out, Automedon it takes <lb/>
            And holds it to Achilles to divide, <lb/>
            Who of it many equal portions makes. <lb/>
            Patroclus makes a fire of wood well dried; <lb/>
            And when the flame was spent, the coals he rakes <lb n="205"/>
            Till they lay even; then the meat he spits <lb/>
            And roasts; and when 'twas roasted up it takes, <lb/>
            And on clean dresser-boards the same he sets; <lb/>
            And brought, in baskets, to the table bread; <lb/>
            And by Achilles was set on the meat. <lb n="210"/>
            Who when he saw the table furnished <lb/>
            Over against Ulysses took his seat, <lb/>
            And bade Patroclus sacrifice, who then <lb/>
            The first cut took and threw into the fire, <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>

            And freely to their meat then fell the men. <lb n="215"/>
            But when of food they had no more desire, <lb/>
            Then Ajax Phoenix jogg'd, which was the sign <lb/>
            When to begin, for which Ulysses staid. <lb/>
            Ulysses then fill'd up his cup with wine, <lb/>
            And speaking to Achilles, thus he said. <lb n="220"/>
            All health t'Achilles. Noble is your fare, <lb/>
            And by Atrides treated well we were. <lb/>
            Your tables plentifully furnished are, <lb/>
            But that's not it for which we now are here. <lb/>
            Our ships in danger are to be destroy'd; <lb n="225"/>
            The Trojans are encamped near our wall. <lb/>
            Unless you condescend to give us aid, <lb/>
            By Hector they are like to perish all; <lb/>
            Who threatens he will set them all on fire, <lb/>
            And is encouraged to't by signs from Jove. <lb n="230"/>
            To see the morning rise is his desire, <lb/>
            And feareth neither men nor pow'rs above. <lb/>
            And like a dog enrag'd, and looking grim, <lb/>
            Assures the Trojans he our ships will burn, <lb/>
            And either put us for our lives to swim, <lb n="235"/>
            Or never to Achæa to return. <lb/>
            I am afraid the Gods perform it will, <lb/>
            And so to perish here will be our fate. <lb/>
            Rise, then; if but a little you sit still, <lb/>
            All you can do for us will come too late. <lb n="240"/>
            And then I am assured you will grieve, <lb/>
            When remedy there can be none, in vain: <lb/>
            Therefore, while yet you can, the Greeks relieve; <lb/>
            Your fathers counsel call to mind again. <lb/>
            My son, said he (when you took leave for Troy), <lb n="245"/>
            May Juno and Athena strengthen you. <lb/>
            But this one lesson take from me. I pray <lb/>
            Remember still your anger to subdue ; <lb/>
            recline all contestation of the tongue, <lb/>
            And let your conversation gentle be; <lb n="250"/>
            So shall you win the hearts of old and young <lb/>
            In the Achæan host. Thus counsell'd he. <lb/>
            Though you have this forgot, yet now be friends, <lb/>
            And since he sorry is, forget th' offence, <lb/>
            And take the gifts he offers for amends, <lb n="255"/>
            Which we esteem a worthy recompence. <lb/>
            I'll name the gifts he offers one by one. <lb/>
            Seven fire-new trivets. Talents ten of gold. <lb/>
            Twenty black cauldrons. Twelve steeds that have won <lb/>
            Their sev'ral prizes, and yet are not old. <lb n="260"/>
            A man that has so many and so fleet <lb/>
            I think not poor, but gold will quickly win, <lb/>

            You may, before the prey divided be, <lb/>

            Iphianassa and Laodice, <lb n="280"/>
            And fair Chrysothemis, take which you list, <lb/>
            And to your father's house convey her; he <lb/>
            On settling of estate will not insist, <lb/>
            But of his own do that sufficiently. <lb/>
            Seven cities you shall have. Phæræ divine, <lb n="285"/>
            Enope, Ire, and Cardamyle, <lb/>
            And Pedasus that fertile is of wine, <lb/>
            Anthria, Æpia, all on the sea <lb/>
            Of sandy Pyle; and rich in sheep and kine <lb/>
            The people are, and will your laws obey, <lb n="290"/>
            And tribute pay as to a pow'r divine. <lb/>
            All this he'll give your anger to allay. <lb/>
            And though Atrides and his gifts you hate; <lb/>
            Honoured you are by th' other Argives all, <lb/>
            And should have pity on their sad estate, <lb n="295"/>
            Who in such numbers before Hector fall; <lb/>
            Whom you may have the honour now to kill; <lb/>
            For now he will your spear no longer shun, <lb/>
            But stand you in the open field he will; <lb/>
            For'mongst theGreeks he thinks there's like him none. <lb n="300"/>
            To this Achilles answered, and thus said, <lb/>
            Ulysses, I perceive I must be plain. <lb/>
            For if I be not so, I am afraid <lb/>
            I shall be put to speak my mind again. <lb/>
            But to prevent more importunity, <lb n="305"/>
            What once I say I'll do. Those men I hate <lb/>
            Whose tongues and hearts I find to disagree, <lb/>
            As much as I abominate hell-gate. <lb/>
            I will no more persuaded be to fight <lb/>
            By Agamemnon or by any Greek, <lb n="310"/>
            Since they my labour do so ill requite, <lb/>
            And they that fight, and fight not fair alike. <lb/>
            For good and bad are equal when they die. <lb/>
            Then for my pain and danger in the wars, <pb n="102"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IX. </note><note type="margin"> Ambassadors <lb/>

            What more than any other man have I ? <lb n="315"/>
            With me as with a bird i' t' field it fares, <lb/>
            That to her unfledg'd young ones bringeth meat. <lb/>
            She has it in her mouth and hungry is, <lb/>
            Yet she forbears and gives it them to eat. <lb/>
            With the Atrides twain my case is this, <lb n="320"/>
            In blood by day I lead a weary life, <lb/>
            And sleepless am the greatst part of the night. <lb/>
            And why ? That Menelaus may win his wife <lb/>
            Achilles must against the Trojans fight. <lb/>
            I did so; and from Troy twelve cities won <lb n="325"/>
            Upon the shore, i' th' land eleven more, <lb/>
            And all the prey I sent to Atreus' son, <lb/>
            Wherein of precious treasure was great store. <lb/>
            A small part he divided 'mongst the host. <lb/>
            Somewhat he gave for honour to the best; <lb n="330"/>
            But to himself made sure to keep the most. <lb/>
            And firm is whatsoe'er he gave the rest; <lb/>
            From none but me his gift he takes away. <lb/>
            I am content, and let him keep her still <lb/>
            And her enjoy. But why then came to Troy <lb n="335"/>
            Atrides with such strength ? What was his will ? <lb/>
            Was it not only for fair Helen's sake ? <lb/>
            What then must no man love his wife but they ? <lb/>
            Yes, all men of their own wives much should make, <lb/>
            If they have either wit or honesty. <lb n="340"/>
            And I love mine as well as he loves his, <lb/>
            Although she be my captive. But since she <lb/>
            By Agamemnon from me taken is, <lb/>
            Ne'er think, Ulysses, to prevail with me. <lb/>
            He shall not twice deceive me. But provide, <lb n="345"/>
            Ulysses, that your ships not burned be. <lb/>
            I know a wall, a ditch pal'd, deep and wide, <lb/>
            Is made by Agamemnon without me. <lb/>
            But all this will not Hector long keep out. <lb/>
            But with the Greeks when I went to the fight <lb n="350"/>
            He never durst to show his face without <lb/>
            The Scæan gate, save once. And then by flight <lb/>
            He 'scap'd. And since I am no more his foe, <lb/>
            To morrow to the Gods I'll sacrifice, <lb/>
            And launch and lade my ships, and homewards go. <lb n="355"/>
            And you shall see me, e'er the sun shall rise, <lb/>
            Upon the Hellespont if you think fit, <lb/>
            And how my lusty Myrmidons can row. <lb/>
            And so, if Neptune please, the wind may fit, <lb/>
            As in three days we may to Phthia go, <lb n="360"/>
            Where treasure plenty I behind me left: <lb/>
            And now shall carry thither gold and brass, <lb/>

            He could deceive me once. He shall not twice. <lb/>
            There let him rest. The Gods have made him mad. <lb/>
            I hate his gifts. And him I value not. <lb/>

            I'll not his daughter take. Bid him bestow her <lb/>

            I shall choose one, and with her lead my life, <lb/>
            And with my father live contentedly. <lb/>
            For all the wealth of stately Ilium, <lb/>
            Which they enjoyed in tranquillity <lb n="395"/>
            When yet the Argives were not hither come, <lb/>
            And all Apollo's sacred treasury <lb/>

            Horses, and kine, and sheep, and household stuff, <lb n="400"/>
            May be recover'd, but man's life cannot. <lb/>
            My mother Thetis told me as my end, <lb/>
            That if I fight 'gainst Troy, 'twill be my lot <lb/>
            To die there, but that Fame would me commend. <lb/>
            But on the other side assured me, <lb n="405"/>
            That if 'gainst Ilium I warred not, <lb/>
            But back to Phthia went, my fate would be <lb/>

            At last unto Achilles Phoenix spake; <lb/>
            If you, said he, resolv'd are to be gone, <lb/>
            And leave the war for Agamemnon's sake, <lb/>
            In what estate shall I be here alone ? <lb/>
            When you to Agamemnon first were sent, <lb n="425"/>
            You were a child, and understood not war, <lb/>
            Unable to say clearly what you meant, <lb/>
            Which the first principles of honour are. <lb/>
            And by your father I was with you sent, <lb/>
            To show you how you were to speak and do. <lb n="430"/>
            So that if you to go be fully bent, <lb/>
            You need not doubt but 1 shall be so too, <lb/>
            And should be though I were as young as when <lb/>
            I Hellas left, and from my father fled, <lb/>
            Amyntor, son of Orminus, who then <lb n="435"/>
            A concubine had taken to his bed; <lb/>
            My mother, to the end to make her hate <lb/>
            In such a way the old man's company, <lb/>
            Was with me oftentimes importunate <lb/>
            To court her, and I did thereto agree, <lb n="440"/>
            And got her love. Which when my father knew, <lb/>
            He fell into a mighty passion, <lb/>
            And many bitter curses on me threw, <lb/>
            And pray'd the Gods I ne'er might have a son. <lb/>
            His pray'r by Pluto and by Proserpine <lb n="445"/>
            Was heard, and I no longer would abide <lb/>
            At home; but cross'd awhile was my design, <lb/>
            By friends and nephews that my purpose spy'd, <lb/>
            Who pray'd me and retain'd me with good cheer; <lb/>
            Many good kine they kill'd and lusty sheep, <lb n="450"/>
            And many swine were daily singed there, <lb/>
            And much wine spent, and nightly watch they keep <lb/>
            By turns nine nights together; and fires twain. <lb/>
            One in the court against my chamber-door, <lb/>
            Another in the porch they kept in vain. <lb n="455"/>
            For on the tenth the court-wall I leapt o'er <lb/>
            And undiscerned to king Peleus fled, <lb/>
            Who us'd me as a father would his son, <lb/>
            His only son far off begot and bred ; <lb/>
            Enrich'd, and gave me the dominion <lb n="460"/>
            Of the Dolopians, who are a part <lb/>

            Who not at feast nor in the house would eat, <lb/>
            If first I did not set you on my knee, <lb/>
            And into little pieces cut your meat. <lb/>
            And often on my breast you puk'd your wine. <lb/>
            But since I knew my line with me would end, <lb n="470"/>
            To take you for my heir was my design, <lb/>
            Who in my feeble age might me defend. <lb/>
            Master your heart, Achilles ; for you know <lb/>
            The Gods, though stronger and more fear'd than you, <lb/>
            With incense and with pray'rs are made to bow, <lb n="475"/>
            Although from men they not receive their due. <lb/>
            For Prayers of high Jove the daughters are, <lb/>
            Though lame their feet, and squinting be their eyes; <lb/>
            And follow Wrath (though she runs faster far), <lb/>
            And to the hurt she does give remedies, <lb n="480"/>
            And cure all those that show them due respect. <lb/>
            But when an angry man they cannot move, <lb/>
            That reconcilement always will reject, <lb/>
            They call for judgment from their father Jove. <lb/>
            Therefore, Achilles, give respect unto <lb n="485"/>
            These Goddesses, the daughters of high Jove, <lb/>
            As other mighty men and princes do. <lb/>
            Had not Atrides, to redeem your love, <lb/>
            Offer'd you presents great, and promised more, <lb/>
            I never had advis'd you to agree <lb n="490"/>
            To save their ships from burning on the shore. <lb/>
            Till that were done you could not blamed be. <lb/>
            But since he does so amply make amends, <lb/>
            And chosen has good men to intercede, <lb/>
            Who are of all the Greeks your greatest friends, <lb n="495"/>
            Refuse them not the grace for which they plead, <lb/>
            Such was the hero's custom heretofore, <lb/>
            When one had done another injury, <lb/>
            The damage they had done first to restore, <lb/>
            And then with gifts and pray'rs buy amity. <lb n="500"/>
            But I will tell you how it came to pass <lb/>
            At Calydon long since, not yesterday, <lb/>
            War 'twixt the Curets and th' Ætolians was, <lb/>
            These to defend, the other to destroy. <lb/>
            For CEneus having got his harvest in, <lb n="505"/>
            To all the Gods made a great sacrifice ; <lb/>
            Only Diana had no part therein, <lb/>
            Forgot she was ; he did not her despise. <lb/>
            But she in anger sent a great wild boar, <lb/>
            That wasted and made havoc of his field, <lb n="510"/>
            And up by the roots, his goodly fruit-trees tore. <lb/>
            This boar Meleager, son of Œneus kill'd, <lb/>
            Assisted by the youth of many a state <lb/>
            That to the chase with men and hounds came in. <pb n="106"/>

            Between them then Diana rais'd debate <lb n="515"/>
            About who was to have the head and skin. <lb/>
            While Meleager with them went to war, <lb/>
            The Curets never durst approach the wall, <lb/>
            Although they were the greater number far. <lb/>
            But when with choler swelled was his gall, <lb n="520"/>
            (Which often happens to a man, though wise) <lb/>
            He kept his chamber and abstain'd from fight, <lb/>
            Offended with his mother's injuries, <lb/>
            And of all company eschew'd the sight, <lb/>
            But Cleopatra, consort of his bed, <lb n="525"/>
            Child of Marpissa, who (by stealth) was bride <lb/>
            Of Idas, who at that time carried <lb/>
            For strength the reputation far and wide. <lb/>
            This Idas' child was Meleager's wife. <lb/>
            But Idas rashly for his dear wife's sake <lb n="530"/>
            Against Apollo did engage his life, <lb/>
            And him at bow and arrows undertake. <lb/>
            But Cleopatra then surnamed was <lb/>
            Halcyone, that was not so before <lb/>
            Her father with Apollo fought, because <lb n="535"/>
            She did her mother's death so much deplore. <lb/>
            With her now grieving Meleager lay, <lb/>
            And angry at the curses of his mother; <lb/>
            Who to the Gods continually did pray <lb/>
            Against his life for killing of her brother; <lb n="540"/>
            And from her eyes the tears ran down her breast, <lb/>
            And often with her hand the ground she smote. <lb/>
            Making to Pluto and his queen request <lb/>
            To kill her son; which they rejected not. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the uproar heard was at the gates, <lb n="545"/>
            And thumping of the tow'rs of Calydon. <lb/>
            To Meleager then came priests and states <lb/>
            Intreating him his armour to put on, <lb/>
            And save the town, and offer'd for his pain, <lb/>
            As much good land (so take it where he would, <lb n="550"/>
            One half for wine, the other half for grain) <lb/>
            As fifty able oxen labour could. <lb/>
            Then came his father rattling at his door, <lb/>
            His brothers, and his angry mother too: <lb/>
            But he persisted in his will the more ; <lb n="555"/>
            His dearest friends could with him nothing do. <lb/>
            But when the cry and danger now was nigher, <lb/>
            And on the tow'rs the Curets mounted were, <lb/>
            And ready now to set the town on fire, <lb/>
            Then Cleopatra to her husband dear <lb n="560"/>
            Show'd th' image of a town won by the foe. <lb/>
            How butcher'd are the men, the houses burned, <lb/>
            Their wives and children dragg'd away ; and so <lb/>
            Her husband's heart again to pity turned. <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            Then went he and repell'd the enemies, <note type="margin"> LIB. IX. </note><note type="margin"> Ambassadors <lb/>

            Though what they promis'd him they never gave. <lb/>
            But that's not it to which I you advise; <lb/>
            But first the ships, and then the Greeks to save; <lb/>
            But not without these gifts to go to war: <lb/>
            For more unto your honour it will be <lb n="570"/>
            To give them aid when satisfied you are, <lb/>
            By Agamemnon for the injury. <lb/>
            Thus Phoenix said. Achilles then replied, <lb/>
            Such honour I seek none. Jove honours me, <lb/>
            Since by his will I at my ships abide, <lb n="575"/>
            And will do till I dead or strengthless be. <lb/>
            No more molest me for Atrides' sake, <lb/>
            But stay with me, and equal to me reign, <lb/>
            And such as are my friends for your friends take, <lb/>
            And do not lose my friendship his to gain. <lb n="580"/>
            Stay, then, this night, and take your lodging here ; <lb/>
            My answer t' Agamemnon these will carry; <lb/>
            As soon as morning shall again appear, <lb/>
            We'll talk of whether we shall go or tarry. <lb/>
            And as he spake those words, he wink'd upon <lb n="585"/>
            Patroclus to give order for his bed, <lb/>
            That he himself prepare might to be gone. <lb/>
            Amongst them then great Ajax spake and said, <lb/>
            Ulysses come, our labour here is lost; <lb/>
            Let's carry back his answer, such as 'tis, <lb n="590"/>
            To Agamemnon and the Argive host, <lb/>
            Who us expect, since obstinate he is, <lb/>
            And can a thought so savage entertain, <lb/>
            Unkind and unregardful of his friends, <lb/>
            When others for a son or brother slain <lb n="595"/>
            Can be contented to receive amends, <lb/>
            And let the man that slew him live in rest, <lb/>
            As soon as they have paid for their misdeed. <lb/>
            But you, Achilles, harbour in your breast <lb/>
            An everlasting anger without need, <lb n="600"/>
            And hurtful to your friends no less than foes, <lb/>
            For 'tis but for one maid he took away; <lb/>
            And for her now he seven on you bestows, <lb/>
            And much beside, your anger to allay. <lb/>
            Regard your house. We your domestics are, <lb n="605"/>
            Nearer than any of the Greeks beside, <lb/>
            And in your honour more concerned by far. <lb/>
            Thus Ajax said. Achilles then replied, <lb/>
            O Ajax, noble son of Telamon, <lb/>
            I not deny but all you say is well; <lb n="610"/>
            But always when that man you mention, <lb/>
            My choler rising, makes my heart to swell. <lb/>
            He made me has to th' Argives despicable, <lb/>
            As if I were a fool or inmate who <pb n="108"/>

            Of honour in a town is incapable, <lb n="615"/>
            And with the public nothing has to do. <lb/>
            Go, therefore, let Atrides know my mind. <lb/>
            I will no more against the Trojans fight, <lb/>
            Till Hector at my tents and ships I find, <lb/>
            And th' Argive fleet be flaming in my sight. <lb n="620"/>
            For if he come unto my ships, I think, <lb/>
            Keen as he is, I shall his fury stay. <lb/>
            This said, unto the Gods above they drink, <lb/>
            And then they with his answer went away. <lb/>
            Patroclus then gave order for a bed <lb n="625"/>
            With woolly cov'rings soft and linen fine <lb/>
            For Phoenix, where he lay till day was spread. <lb/>
            But with Achilles slept a concubine, <lb/>
            Fair Diomeda, whom he brought away <lb/>
            From Lesbos when he had that city sack'd. <lb n="630"/>
            And in another part Patroclus lay, <lb/>
            Nor he a beautiful bed-fellow lack'd, <lb/>
            Fair Iphis, whom Achilles gave him when <lb/>
            He newly rifled had the town of Scyros, <lb/>
            And now th' ambassadors were come again, <lb n="635"/>
            And to them store of people flock, desirous <lb/>
            To hear the news, and wine unto them brought. <lb/>
            But Agamemnon first inquired and said, <lb/>
            Ulysses, will he save the fleet or not, <lb/>
            Or is his choler not to be allay'd ? <lb n="640"/>
            And he Achilles' answer then related. <lb/>
            The man, said he, retains his anger still. <lb/>
            And now 'tis greater rather than abated, <lb/>
            And says, tomorrow put to sea he will. <lb/>
            And your alliance and your gifts rejects, <lb n="645"/>
            And says he would advise us to go home; <lb/>
            Since Jupiter himself the town protects, <lb/>
            He says in vain we stay at Ilium. <lb/>
            And bids you order take to save the fleet. <lb/>
            Thus said he, as these know as well as I, <lb n="650"/>
            Ajax and both the heralds, men discreet, <lb/>
            Who all the while he spake were standing by, <lb/>
            And Phoenix too. But he lies there all night, <lb/>
            That o'er the sea together they may go, <lb/>
            If Phoenix will, as soon as it is light; <lb n="655"/>
            But fore'd is not whether he will or no. <lb/>
            When thus Ulysses ended had his story, <lb/>
            All silent were awhile and much dismay'd <lb/>
            With his denial flat and peremptory. <lb/>
            At last Tydides to them spake and said, <lb n="660"/>
            0 king Atrides, we have done amiss <lb/>
            With gifts and prayers thus to seek his aid, <lb/>
            That proud before, by this made prouder is. <lb/>
            Let him go when he will. Be not afraid, <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            But let's refresh ourselves tonight with bread <note type="margin"> LIB. X. </note> <lb n="665"/>
            And wine; for that gives men both strength and heart, <lb/>
            And see your men i' th' morn embatteled, <lb/>
            And at the head of them do you your part. <lb/>
            This said, the princes of the host admired <lb/>
            The gallant speech of valiant Diomed : <lb n="670"/>
            And every one unto his tent retired, <lb/>
            With a good will to sleep, and went to bed.</p>

          <p>ALL night the princes of the Argives slept, <note type="margin"> Encounter of the <lb/>

            Save Agamemnon, who could take no rest, <lb/>
            But with unquiet thoughts was waking kept, <lb/>
            And casting for his safety what was best. <lb/>
            And frequent as the lightning flashes are <lb n="5"/>
            When Jove is making rain or hail i' th' skies, <lb/>
            Or somewhere punishing the proud by war ; <lb/>
            So frequent then were Agamemnon's sighs. <lb/>
            And when the fires he saw upon the plain <lb/>
            Made by the foe, and th' acclamation <lb n="10"/>
            And shouts he heard, he wondered. But again <lb/>
            When he his ships and people look'd upon, <lb/>
            Then by the roots he pluck'd off from his head <lb/>
            Handfuls of hair, and sigh'd and groaned more; <lb/>
            And thought it best then to be counselled <lb n="15"/>
            By Nestor how he might himself restore. <lb/>
            And rising up, his coat he first puts on, <lb/>
            And to his smooth white feet his shoes he tied; <lb/>
            And then, above his coat, he cast upon <lb/>
            His back a great and tawny lion's hide. <lb n="20"/>
            And Menelaus, too, that waking lay <lb/>
            And trembling in his bed all night, for fear <lb/>
            The Greeks that for his sake were come to Troy <lb/>
            Should fall into some great disaster there, <lb/>
            Rose up and to his brother's tent went in. <lb n="25"/>
            A spear he had in's hand, and armed was, <lb/>
            Having upon his back a leopard's skin, <lb/>
            And on his head a helmet good of brass. <lb/>
            And said to Agamemnon, Brother, why <lb/>
            So early up ? Have you a mind to send <lb n="30"/>
            Into the army of the foe some spy ? <lb/>
            I fear you will not find so bold a friend <lb/>
            As thither dares to go i' th' night alone. <lb/>
            Brother, said Agamemnon, you and I <pb n="110"/>

            Encounter of the <lb/>
            scouts by night </note> <lb/>
            Must better counsel take than we have done, <lb n="35"/>
            Since Jove now favoureth the enemy, <lb/>
            And takes in Hector's sacrifice delight. <lb/>
            For so much harm so soon was never done, <lb/>
            As he to us has done in one day's fight; <lb/>
            Yet nor of God nor Goddess is the son. <lb n="40"/>
            His this day's acts the Greeks will ne'er forget. <lb/>
            But go you to the princes quickly. Run. <lb/>
            Call up Idomeneus the King of Crete, <lb/>
            And the great Ajax son of Telamon, <lb/>
            While I call Nestor up and bring him to <lb n="45"/>
            The place which is appointed for the guard, <lb/>
            T' instruct the men with what they have to do, <lb/>
            Because his counsel they will most regard. <lb/>
            For by his son the watch commanded<lb/>
            And with him we Meriones have join'd. <lb n="50"/>
            Then Menelaus farther ask'd him this, <lb/>
            That he might fully understand his mind, <lb/>
            When they are call'd, what next is to be done ? <lb/>
            Must I stay here till you come back again, <lb/>
            Or after you about the army run ? <lb n="55"/>
            No, no, said he, where you are now, remain. <lb/>
            But going call upon each one aloud, <lb/>
            And by the name he from his father takes, <lb/>
            And praise them all, let them not think you proud; <lb/>
            Pain is no shame when 'tis for our own sakes. <lb n="60"/>
            This said, they part, and Agamemnon went <lb/>
            To seek out Nestor; whom he found a-bed, <lb/>
            And all his armour by him in his tent, <lb/>
            His shield, two spears, and helmet for his head, <lb/>
            And belt of many colours finely wrought, <lb n="65"/>
            Which always he was wont in war to use <lb/>
            When he his people unto battle brought. <lb/>
            No labour would he on his age excuse. <lb/>
            Now raised on his elbow, Who, said he, <lb/>
            Are you that walk abroad when others sleep ? <lb n="70"/>
            Stay there, I say, and come no nearer me; <lb/>
            Until your name you tell, at distance keep. <lb/>
            Seek you some officer or camerade ? <lb/>
            I Agamemnon am, said he, your friend, <lb/>
            Whom Jove to bear such miseries hath made, <lb n="75"/>
            As while I live will never have an end; <lb/>
            And in my bed no sleep at all I take <lb/>
            For fear of some unfortunate event. <lb/>
            Unsettled is my heart, my limbs all shake, <lb/>
            And in this plight I wand'red to your tent: <lb n="80"/>
            And now, I pray you, since you waking lie <lb/>
            Come with me to the watch ; for since the foe <lb/>
            Unto our wall encamped is so nigh, <lb/>
            They charge us may by night for aught we know. <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            To this old Nestor answer made and said, <note type="margin"> LIB. X. </note><note type="margin"> Encounter of the <lb/>
            scouts by night. </note> <lb n="85"/>
            Think not, Atrides, Jove will all things do <lb/>
            As they are now in Hector's fancy laid ? <lb/>
            For harder work he would be put unto <lb/>
            If we Achilles can but once appease. <lb/>
            But go, I'll follow you, and call upon <lb n="90"/>
            Tydides and Ulysses if you please, <lb/>
            Ajax the less, and Meges Phyleus' son. <lb/>
            I wish some other man of nimbler feet <lb/>
            Were to great Ajax sent to make him rise, <lb/>
            And to Idomeneus the King of Crete, <lb n="95"/>
            Whose quarter from this place a great way lies. <lb/>
            But Menelaus I intend to chide, <lb/>
            That sleeps and leaves the work to you alone. <lb/>
            'Tis no fit time within his tent t' abide, <lb/>
            But to the princes should himself have gone. <lb n="100"/>
            To Nestor Agamemnon then replied, <lb/>
            0 Nestor, he is often negligent, <lb/>
            And often I have pray'd you him to chide. <lb/>
            Yet 'tis not sloth; but my commandement <lb/>
            He always looks for, though there be no cause. <lb n="105"/>
            And yet'tonight he has prevented me. <lb/>
            For up and arm'd before me now he was; <lb/>
            And when he came I sent him presently <lb/>
            To call up Ajax and the King of Crete. <lb/>
            And at the watch we both of them shall see, <lb n="110"/>
            Where I appointed have the rest to meet. <lb/>
            Nestor again replied. 'Tis well, said he, <lb/>
            The Greeks will of him have a better thought, <lb/>
            And readier obedience he will find. <lb/>
            This said, he put himself into his coat, <lb n="115"/>
            And tied his shoes on, and his cloak well lined, <lb/>
            And took his spear in hand. Then on they went <lb/>
            Among the Argive ships upon the sand. <lb/>
            And when they came unto Ulysses' tent, <lb/>
            To call and waken him, they made a stand. <lb n="120"/>
            And Nestor, with his voice stretch'd to the height, <lb/>
            Call'd to him by his name. Ulysses straight <lb/>
            Came forth and said, Why come you in the night ? <lb/>
            Your bus'ness sure must be of mighty weight. <lb/>
            0 Laërtiades, said Nestor then, <lb n="125"/>
            Take it not ill. Such is our misery. <lb/>
            But come with us to call up other men, <lb/>
            That we may counsel take to fight or fly. <lb/>
            Ulysses then returned into his tent, <lb/>
            And on his shoulders hung his painted shield; <lb n="130"/>
            And with them first to Diomed he went, <lb/>
            Whom they found armed in the open field, <lb/>
            His soldiers sleeping lay about him round, <lb/>
            And on his buckler each one had his head, <pb n="112"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. X. <lb/>
             </note><note type="margin"> Encounter of the <lb/>

            The butt-ends of their spears fix'd in the ground, <lb n="135"/>
            Whereof the points like lightning glittered. <lb/>
            But he himself slept on a good cow-hide, <lb/>
            His head upon a gaudy carpet laid. <lb/>
            Then Nestor came and standing at his side <lb/>
            Awak'd him with his foot, and to him said, <lb n="140"/>
            Awake, Tydides, hear you not how nigh <lb/>
            The Trojans are encamped to the fleet ? <lb/>
            This said, Tydides leap'd up suddenly, <lb/>
            And when he raised was upon his feet, <lb/>
            Nestor, said he, unhappy restless man, <lb n="145"/>
            That aged as you are take not your ease, <lb/>
            When younger men there are that better can <lb/>
            Call up the Argive princes if they please. <lb/>
            'Tis true, said Nestor, I have at my tent <lb/>
            Sons of my own, and others can command, <lb n="150"/>
            Who might upon such errands have been sent, <lb/>
            But that upon the very brink we stand <lb/>
            Of life and death. And since you pity me, <lb/>
            Call little Ajax up, and Phyleus' son. <lb/>
            For young you are, and can do't easily. <lb n="155"/>
            Tydides then a lion's skin puts on <lb/>
            Tawny and reaching to his heels, and then <lb/>
            Into his hand he took a heavy spear, <lb/>
            And out he went and called up those men. <lb/>
            When to the watch they come together were, <lb n="160"/>
            The captains of the watch were not asleep, <lb/>
            But all were sitting at their arms awake. <lb/>
            As dogs that guarding are a fold of sheep <lb/>
            Hearing the noise the hounds and hunters make, <lb/>
            When in the woods they chase some savage beast, <lb n="165"/>
            And nearer still and nearer hear the cries, <lb/>
            They doubt the worst, and cannot take their rest, <lb/>
            But list'ning stand and sleep forsakes their eyes; <lb/>
            So watchfully spent they the tedious night, <lb/>
            And ever when of feet they heard the tread <lb n="170"/>
            'Twixt them and Troy, that way they turn'd their sight; <lb/>
            So much they Hector's coming on did dread. <lb/>
            When Nestor coming by, observ'd them had, <lb/>
            So, so, said he, brave lads, continue so, <lb/>
            And give no cause to Hector to be glad. <lb n="175"/>
            He and the princes then together go <lb/>
            (All that to counsel had been made to rise, <lb/>
            Except Meriones and Nestor's son, <lb/>
            Whom they thought worthy with them to advise) <lb/>
            And part the ditch, and sitting down upon <lb n="180"/>
            The place to which they were pursued before <lb/>
            By Hector, who retiring thence, left clear <lb/>
            The ground from dead men's carcasses and gore, <lb/>
            Of what they next should do consulted there. <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            First Nestor spake. Who dares (said he) to go <note type="margin"> LIB. X. <lb/>
             </note><note type="margin"> Encounter of the <lb/>
            scouts by night. </note> <lb n="185"/>
            Unto the Trojan camp that lies so near, <lb/>
            And kill, or bring thence some outlying foe ? <lb/>
            Or what they shall resolve upon to hear ? <lb/>
            Whether (since they have worsted us) to stay <lb/>
            So near us, or retire into the town. <lb n="190"/>
            If this he do and safely come away, <lb/>
            He to himself acquire will great renown, <lb/>
            And by each one that has of ships command, <lb/>
            He for his service shall be well requited. <lb/>
            Each one an ewe and lamb shall give him, and <lb n="195"/>
            He to our public feastings be invited. <lb/>
            This said, they paused awhile, but by and by <lb/>
            Tydides rising spake. Nestor, said he, <lb/>
            To go into the Trojan camp dare I. <lb/>
            But 'twould be best some other went with me, <lb n="200"/>
            More hope and courage is where there are two ; <lb/>
            What one observeth not the other may. <lb/>
            A man alone can little see or do, <lb/>
            And single judgments see but little way; <lb/>
            At these words many with him would have gone, <lb n="205"/>
            Ajaxes, both the greater and the less, <lb/>
            And stout Antilochus, old Nestor's son, <lb/>
            And Menelaus and Meriones. <lb/>
            But most of all Ulysses long'd to see <lb/>
            What projects in the Trojan camp were laid. <lb n="210"/>
            For none adventure farther durst than he. <lb/>
            Then to Tydides Agamemnon said, <lb/>
            Tydides, whom I love, now choose your man ; <lb/>
            Regard not birth nor sceptres, but the cause. <lb/>
            Take him that you think best assist you can, <lb n="215"/>
            And this he said in fear for Menelaus. <lb/>
            To this Tydides answer made again, <lb/>
            Since of my fellows I the choice must make, <lb/>
            Ulysses I prefer before all men, <lb/>
            And him for my assistant I will take; <lb n="220"/>
            So much in diligence he doth excel, <lb/>
            And so much care Athena of him has, <lb/>
            That I believe we both should come off well <lb/>
            Though through a flaming fire we were to pass. <lb/>
            Then, said Ulysses, Speak no more of me, <lb n="225"/>
            Nor good nor ill. The Argives know me well. <lb/>
            Let's go. Two-thirds o' th' night are spent, you see, <lb/>
            As any man that sees the stars can tell. <lb/>
            Then put they on their arms. And Thrasymed <lb/>
            Gave Diomed a sword (who had forgot <lb n="230"/>
            To bring his own), and to defend his head <lb/>
            A leather cap without crest, call'd a pot. <lb/>
            Meriones unto Ulysses gave <lb/>
            His bow and quiver, sword and dogskin cap, <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. X. </note><note type="margin"> Encounter of the <lb/>

            Pleated with thongs within, his head to save <lb n="235"/>
            If need should be in combat, from mishap. <lb/>
            For 'twixt the leathers tough inserted were <lb/>
            Guards of thick felt; of boar's teeth was the brim. <lb/>
            Eleon was the first that did it wear, <lb/>
            But taken by Autolycus from him, <lb n="240"/>
            And given 'twas unto Amphidamus, <lb/>
            Which he to Melon gave that was his guest, <lb/>
            And to Meriones then left it was, <lb/>
            And now upon Ulysses' head did rest. <lb/>
            And being both thus armed, forth they went <lb n="245"/>
            And by the way a heron dexter flew, <lb/>
            A lucky sign, and by Athena sent, <lb/>
            As by the sound made by her wings they knew. <lb/>
            Ulysses then unto the Goddess pray'd, <lb/>
            Hail virgin daughter of almighty Jove, <lb n="250"/>
            That all my labour seest, and giv'st me aid, <lb/>
            Now more than ever let me find your love. <lb/>
            Grant me that I some good exploit may do <lb/>
            To vex the Trojans, and come safe from thence. <lb/>
            And then Tydides pray'd unto her too. <lb n="255"/>
            Celestial maid, that with my father went'st <lb/>
            When he ambassador to Thebes was sent <lb/>
            With words of peace, and coming back achieved <lb/>
            By your assistance and encouragement <lb/>
            Such noble acts as scarce will be believed, <lb n="260"/>
            If you will aid me as you aided him, <lb/>
            O Goddess, I will to you sacrifice <lb/>
            A heifer, and with gold her horns I'll trim. <lb/>
            This said, their suit the Goddess not denies. <lb/>
            When their devotion now was at an end, <lb n="265"/>
            Away they went, 'mongst carcases and blood, <lb/>
            Like lions that on slaughter love t 'attend. <lb/>
            Nor Hector and the Trojans idle stood, <lb/>
            But call'd a council of the chiefs, and said, <lb/>
            Who's. he will undertake what I'll propound, <lb n="270"/>
            And for his pains be honourably paid, <lb/>
            And for his valour far and near renown'd ? <lb/>
            I give him will two horses and a coach, <lb/>
            The best that shall be taken from the foe, <lb/>
            That will unto the Argive fleet approach, <lb n="275"/>
            And bring me word what they intend to do ; <lb/>
            Whether their ships they guard as heretofore, <lb/>
            Or mean to quit the siege at Ilium. <lb/>
            And beaten thus, haul down their ships from shore, <lb/>
            And ere their work be finished, go home. <lb n="280"/>
            This said, they silent sat. But one there was, <lb/>
            Dolon by name, the squire Eumedes' son, <lb/>
            That master was of store of gold and brass, <lb/>
            A sorry fellow, but that well could run. <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>

            Swear now by Jove, and hold your sceptre high, <lb/>
            I shall Achilles' horses have and coach, <lb/>
            And I for you will be a faithful spy. <lb/>
            For down to Agamemnon's tent I'll go, <lb/>
            Where they consult whether to fight or fly: <lb n="290"/>
            For there their resolution I shall know. <lb/>
            Then Hector held his sceptre up on high. <lb/>
            O Jove, betwixt us witness bear, said he, <lb/>
            No Trojan shall these horses have but you, <lb/>
            And yours they shall perpetually be. <lb n="295"/>
            Thus Hector swore, although it prov'd not true. <lb/>
            Upon his shoulder then his bow he hung. <lb/>
            His cap of cat, a wolfs skin was his coat. <lb/>
            And when he gotten clear was from the throng, <lb/>
            With spear in hand he fell into his trot. <lb n="300"/>
            And first Ulysses heard the sound of feet. <lb/>
            I hear one come, said he to Diomed, <lb/>
            Perhaps a spy that sent is to our fleet, <lb/>
            Or one that has a mind to strip the dead. <lb/>
            'Tis best t' avoid him till he past us be, <lb n="305"/>
            And then to follow him and drive him on. <lb/>
            But lest he swifter be of foot than we, <lb/>
            And to the city back again should run, <lb/>
            Rise and be sure to turn him with your spear. <lb/>
            And when he was a land's length past them gone <lb n="310"/>
            They follow'd him. And lie their feet did hear, <lb/>
            And thought some Trojans had been coming on <lb/>
            By Hector sent to call him back again. <lb/>
            But when they from him were scarce a spear's cast, <lb/>
            He knew then they were Agamemnon's men, <lb n="315"/>
            And frighted was ; and then his feet mov'd fast. <lb/>
            As two hounds in a wood obscure and dim <lb/>
            Pursue a fearful doe or hare, just so <lb/>
            Tydides and Ulysses hunted him, <lb/>
            When back into the herd he could not go. <lb n="320"/>
            When Dolon to the watch was very near, <lb/>
            Athena puts into Tydides' head, <lb/>
            That some man else might at him throw a spear, <lb/>
            And be thereby before him honoured. <lb/>
            To Dolon then Tydides spake, and said, <lb n="325"/>
            Stay, or my spear shall make you stay ; for long <lb/>
            I am assur'd you cannot death avoid. <lb/>
            And as he spake the word, his spear he flung, <lb/>
            And miss'd on purpose, but it lighted near. <lb/>
            Dolon affrighted, pale and trembling stands, <lb n="330"/>
            And in his head chatter'd his teeth with fear. <lb/>
            Then in they came and seiz'd on both his hands; <lb/>
            And Dolon weeping, then for quarter pray'd, <lb/>

            For gold he has enough ; and will, he said, <lb n="335"/>
            Give any price, when here he knows I live. <lb/>
            Then to him said Ulysses, Do not fear, <lb/>
            Nor think of death. But see you tell me true <lb/>
            Upon what weighty bus'ness you are here, <lb/>
            When others sleep, and at a time undue. <lb n="340"/>
            Meant you to rifle any of the dead ? <lb/>
            Or were you sent by Hector as a spy, <lb/>
            Or undertook the same of your own head ? <lb/>
            T' Ulysses Dolon then did thus reply : <lb/>
            I was by Hector's promises set on, <lb n="345"/>
            And should have had Achilles' chariot <lb/>
            And horses, if I to the fleet had gone. <lb/>
            And good intelligence to Hector brought, <lb/>
            Whether the ships be guarded as before, <lb/>
            Or that the Greeks now beaten mean to fly, <lb n="350"/>
            And weary of their labour, watch no more. <lb/>
            To this again Ulysses made reply, <lb/>
            And smiling said, It was no small reward <lb/>
            You aimed at. Achilles' horse, ye say ? <lb/>
            To rule them for a mortal man 'tis hard. <lb n="355"/>
            The Goddess Thetis' son they'll scarce obey. <lb/>
            But tell me further ; when you came away, <lb/>
            Where you left Hector, where his horses are, <lb/>
            And where his arms; where other Trojans stay <lb/>
            To sleep or watch, and whether they prepare <lb n="360"/>
            To go into the town, or mean t' abide <lb/>
            Always so near our ships as they are now. <lb/>
            T' Ulysses Dolon then again replied, <lb/>
            This also I will let you truly know. <lb/>
            I Hector left at Ilus' sepulchre <lb n="365"/>
            With other lords in consultation, <lb/>
            The rest about the bonfires waking were. <lb/>
            But certain watch appointed there was none ; <lb/>
            But those confederates that came from far <lb/>
            Slept at their ease all night and watched not ; <lb n="370"/>
            For that they trusted to the Trojans' care, <lb/>
            Having no wives nor children with them brought. <lb/>
            Ulysses then examin'd him again, <lb/>
            How lie the strangers ? mix'd with those of Troy, <lb/>
            Or by themselves ? Inform me and be plain. <lb n="375"/>
            Nothing, said Dolon, but the truth I'll say. <lb/>
            Paeans, Pelasgians, Caucons, Leleges, <lb/>
            And Cars lie by the sea-side on the sands, <lb/>
            The rest near Thymbra quarter, and are these ; <lb/>
            The Masons, Mysians, Lycians, Phrygians. <lb n="380"/>
            But there's no need to tell you ev'ry thing; <lb/>
            For if upon our quarters you would fall, <lb/>
            There lie the Thracians new come, and their king, <lb/>
            Rhesus by name, and utmost lies of all. <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            Such horses yet I never did behold, <note type="margin"> LIB. X. </note><note type="margin"> Encounter of the <lb/>

            Swift as the wind, and than the snow more white, <lb/>
            With silver covered is his car, and gold ; <lb/>
            Gold are his arms, and make a gallant sight, <lb/>
            And fitter tor a (jod than man to wear. <lb/>
            But try now whether I say true or no, <lb n="390"/>
            And send me to the ships, or bind me here. <lb/>
            Then said Tydides with a frowning brow, <lb/>
            Think not to 'scape, though all you say be true; <lb/>
            For if I let you loose, for aught I know, <lb/>
            You may return again to fight or view ; <lb n="395"/>
            But hurt us cannot if I kill you now. <lb/>
            As Dolon then beginning was to pray, <lb/>
            Tydides' sword lighted on's neck so just, <lb/>
            That from his shoulders fell his head away <lb/>
            As he was speaking, and lay in the dust. <lb n="400"/>
            And from him then they took his cap of cat, <lb/>
            His spear, and wolfs skin coat, and bow unbent, <lb/>
            And in his hands Ulysses took all that, <lb/>
            And to Minerva up his prayer sent. <lb/>
            Hail Pallas, whom we pray'd to for success <lb n="405"/>
            Before all other Gods, receive these gifts, <lb/>
            And us unto the Thracian tents address. <lb/>
            This said, the spoils of Dolon up he lifts, <lb/>
            And lays them in a tree ; and for a mark, <lb/>
            They near the way laid store of boughs and reeds <lb n="410"/>
            To find them coming back, because 'twas dark. <lb/>
            Then with Tydides onward he proceeds, <lb/>
            And ev'ry step on arms or blood they tread, <note type="margin">The surprise of <lb/>
            Rhesus. </note> <lb/>
            And soon amongst the Thracians they were, <lb/>
            That sleeping lay, as if they had been dead, <lb n="415"/>
            And by each one his buckler and his spear. <lb/>
            Their horses to the chariot seats were tied. <lb/>
            Thus in three rows the Thracians were laid, <lb/>
            Rhesus i' th' midst; which first Ulysses spied, <lb/>
            And to Tydides speaking softly, said, <lb n="420"/>
            See there the horses, and see there the man <lb/>
            Rhesus, of whom we were by Dolon told. <lb/>
            Untie the horses ; or kill all you can, <lb/>
            And I upon the horses will lay hold. <lb/>
            Tydides then, made by Minerva bold, <lb n="425"/>
            Amongst them killing went, and never staid <lb/>
            (Like lion fierce in a neglected fold) <lb/>
            Till he a dozen of them dead had laid. <lb/>
            And whomsoever Diomedes slew, <lb/>
            Ulysses following took him by the foot, <lb n="430"/>
            And from the place a little way him drew, <lb/>
            For fear the steeds, not yet accustomed to't, <lb/>
            Should boggle, tremble, and refuse to pass. <lb/>
            To Rhesus last of all went Diomed, <pb n="118"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. X. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>

            And panted as he slept; for at his head <lb/>
            He dreamt Tydides all night standing was. <lb/>
            Ulysses to the horses went; and now <lb/>
            Seiz'd, and their heads together tied has : <lb/>
            But for a whip he made use of his bow. <lb n="440"/>
            And gotten forth, whistled to Diomed <lb/>
            To come away, who gave no ear thereto, <lb/>
            But staying with himself, considered <lb/>
            What further hurt he might the Trojans do. <lb/>
            To draw away the chariot by the pole, <lb n="445"/>
            Wherein the golden arms of Rhesus lay, <lb/>
            Or thence upon his shoulders bear the whole ; <lb/>
            Or whether he more Thracians should destroy. <lb/>
            While thus he studied, Pallas by him stood. <lb/>
            Contented be, said she, with what is done. <lb n="450"/>
            To go unto the ships I think it good, <lb/>
            For fear you thither should be forc'd to run. <lb/>
            Some other God awake the Trojans may. <lb/>
            This said, that Pallas to him spake he thought, <lb/>
            And from the Thracian quarter came away, <lb n="455"/>
            And on one of the horses' backs he got, <lb/>
            And tow'rds the ships at full speed then they ride, <lb/>
            Ulysses with his bow still switching on ; <lb/>
            But Phœbus with Tydides Pallas spy'd, <lb/>
            And angrily call'd up Hippocoon ; <lb n="460"/>
            Who, when he came and empty saw the ground <lb/>
            Where th' horses stood, and dy'd with blood the field, <lb/>
            And sprawling in their blood the Thracians found, <lb/>
            Ay me, said he, they have my uncle kill'd. <lb/>
            The Trojans then in haste and frighted rise, <lb n="465"/>
            And at the place in great disorder meet, <lb/>
            And gaze upon the mischief with their eyes, <lb/>
            But they that did it fled were to the fleet. <lb/>
            When flying they were at the tree, where lay <lb/>
            The spoils of Dolon, there awhile they tarry, <lb n="470"/>
            Until Tydides fetch'd them had away, <lb/>
            And to Ulysses given them to carry, <lb/>
            And mounted was upon his horse again. <lb/>
            Again Ulysses switch'd them tow'rds the fleet; <lb/>
            And when they near it were, old Nestor then, <lb n="475"/>
            Who was the first that heard the horses' feet, <lb/>
            Cried out, The sound of horses' feet I hear ; <lb/>
            I wish Ulysses 'twere and Diomed. <lb/>
            But somewhat else and worse it is, I fear ; <lb/>
            So many sad mishaps run in my head. <lb n="480"/>
            He scarce had spoken this but they came in. <lb/>
            When they alighted were and welcomed <lb/>
            With hands and speeches of their friends had been, <lb/>
            Then Nestor thus Ulysses questioned : <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            Ulysses, glory of the Greeks, said he, <note type="margin"> LIB. X. <lb/>
             </note><note type="margin"> The surprise of <lb/>
            Rhesus. </note> <lb n="485"/>
            Whence are these horses, beauteous as the sun ? <lb/>
            Won from the Trojans ? But that cannot be ; <lb/>
            For such amongst the Trojans I saw none, <lb/>
            Though I amongst them were in ev ry fight. <lb/>
            Or given by the Gods ? which may be true ; <lb n="490"/>
            For both of you are gracious in their sight, <lb/>
            And Jove and Pallas have a care of you. <lb/>
            0 noble Nestor, said Ulysses then, <lb/>
            Gods can give better horses if they please ; <lb/>
            For richer much are they than mortal men. <lb n="495"/>
            Tydidcs from a king of Thrace took these, <lb/>
            Who was come newly to the Trojans' aid ; <lb/>
            And slain him has, besides a dozen more, <lb/>
            And besides these a spy that them betray'd, <lb/>
            By Hector sent your purpose to explore. <lb n="500"/>
            This said, Ulysses with much people went <lb/>
            Triumphing, and the milk-white horses drove <lb/>
            Over the trenches to Tydides' tent. <lb/>
            There sets them up, and wheat unto them gave ; <lb/>
            But Dolon's spoils astern his ship he plac'd, <lb n="505"/>
            Preparing for Athena's sacrifice. <lb/>
            And then into the sea they went and wash'd <lb/>
            The sweat from off their shoulders, legs, and thighs, <lb/>
            And after bathe, and 'noint themselves with oil; <lb/>
            That done, they sit down to their meat and dine ; <lb n="510"/>
            And being thus refreshed from their toil, <lb/>
            Unto the Goddess Pallas offer wine.</p>

            Encourag'd thus, the Greeks took more delight <lb n="15"/>
            In staying at the war than going home. <lb/>
            Fellows, to arms, then Agamemnon cried, <lb/>
            And to put on his arms the first man was. <lb/>
            His leg-pieces he down to th' ankles tied <lb/>
            With silver buckles, leg-pieces of brass ; <lb n="20"/>
            And then puts on an armour on his breast, <lb/>
            That had been given him by Cinyres, <lb/>
            (His ancient acquaintance and his guest,) <lb/>
            Whilst he preparing was to pass the seas : <lb/>
            For long before the Greeks for Troy set sail, <lb n="25"/>
            Their purpose was at Cyprus known by fame, <lb/>
            And thinking such a gift might him avail, <lb/>
            In kindness t' Agamemnon sent the same. <lb/>
            The colour was by pales distinguished, <lb/>
            Ten black, twelve gold, and twenty were of tin : <lb n="30"/>
            And in it three black serpents figured, <lb/>
            As if they creeping were unto his chin. <lb/>
            Their sides like rainbows look'd, which in the sky <lb/>
            Are shown by Jove for men to wonder at. <lb/>
            Then from his shoulder down upon his thigh <lb n="35"/>
            He hung his sword. Studded with gold was that. <lb/>
            Then took his shield which finely varied was ; <lb/>
            Bossed in twenty places with white tin ; <lb/>
            And round about them were ten orbs of brass ; <lb/>
            And black the circle was enclos'd within. <lb n="40"/>
            Then Gorge painted was with killing eyes, <lb/>
            And with her standing Terror and Affright: <lb/>
            His belt of silver was, and to the skies <lb/>
            Returned back again the glittering light. <lb/>
            Wound up lay on it painted a great snake, <lb n="45"/>
            Which had three heads, and crowned was each one. <lb/>
            And last into his hand two spears did take, <lb/>
            Having his helmet on his head put on. <lb/>
            Thus Agamemnon armed was. And then <lb/>
            Juno and Pallas both rais'd such a sound <lb n="50"/>
            (To honour him before the Greeks) as when <lb/>
            A man that's slain falls suddenly to th' ground. <lb/>
            Then every one unto his charioteer <lb/>
            Commandment gave upon the ditch to stay <lb/>
            And ready be. The foot all armed were, <lb n="55"/>
            And forth into the field were march'd away. <lb/>
            But soon again the horses with them stood. <lb/>
            Then Jove amongst them Noise and Tumult sent; <lb/>
            And mingled was the morning dew with blood, <lb/>
            For on that day much blood was to be spent. <lb n="60"/>
            Upon a rising ground now Hector was, <lb/>
            AEneas with him, and Polydamas, <lb/>
            And three sons of An tenor, Acamas, <lb/>
            Agenor, Poly bus, and th'army was. <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            And Hector with a round shield at their head, <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. <lb/>
             </note><note type="margin"> The third fight. </note> <lb n="65"/>
            As when a star does through the clouds appear, <lb/>
            And presently again is covered ; <lb/>
            Sometimes i' th' front was, sometimes in the rear <lb/>
            Giving command ; his arms like lightning show. <lb/>
            As mowers standing one rank 'gainst another, <lb n="70"/>
            A field of barley or of wheat to mow ; <lb/>
            So Greeks and Trojans mow down one the other. <lb/>
            On neither side thought any man of flight, <lb/>
            But like to wolves on one another fly, <lb/>
            In number equal; and gave great delight <lb n="75"/>
            To Eris, who (and no God else) was by. <lb/>
            The other Gods stayed on Olympus Hill, <lb/>
            Within whose folds they dwell, and murmur'd at <lb/>
            Their father Jove for bearing such goodwill <lb/>
            To Ilium. But he car'd not for that. <lb n="80"/>
            And by himself he from them went ; and then <lb/>
            Took pride to see the Greeks and Trojans fight, <lb/>
            And look on killing and on dying men, <lb/>
            And of their arms to see the flashing light. <lb/>
            Now all the while that mounting was the sun, <lb n="85"/>
            The number slain on both sides was the same ; <lb/>
            But when the woodman half his work had done, <lb/>
            And willingly unto his dinner came, <lb/>
            The Greeks then brake the Trojan ranks, and on <lb/>
            Fell Agamemnon, and Bienor slew, <lb n="90"/>
            Both him and Odes his companion, <lb/>
            That drove the horses which the chariot drew. <lb/>
            He lighting and assailing him was slain ; <lb/>
            And Odes had no time his spear to throw : <lb/>
            For Agamemnon's spear had pierc'd his brain, <lb n="95"/>
            Passing both through his helmet and his brow. <lb/>
            These there he left, stript both of arms and coat, <lb/>
            And Antiphus and Isus then drew near, <lb/>
            Both Priam's sons, one legal, th' other not, <lb/>
            Upon one seat, and Isus charioteer. <lb n="100"/>
            Once by Achilles taken were these men, <lb/>
            As they were feeding sheep on Ida's hills, <lb/>
            And for their ransom were set free again ; <lb/>
            But both of them now Agamemnon kills. <lb/>
            For Isus' breast he pierc'd through with his spear; <lb n="105"/>
            The other with his sword he overthrew, <lb/>
            And seen him had when he was prisoner. <lb/>
            And that 'twas Antiphus (when stript) he knew. <lb/>
            As when a lion with his mighty teeth <lb/>
            Crusheth the tender issue of a hind, <lb n="110"/>
            Which the affrighted dam stands by and seeth, <lb/>
            And grieveth, but no remedy can find ; <lb/>
            And skipping in the woods for shelter seeks <lb/>
            To save her own life ; so the Trojans fled, <pb n="122"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>
            The third fight. </note> <lb/>
            Pursu'd by Agamemnon and the Greeks, <lb n="115"/>
            And thought not on their fellows they left dead. <lb/>
            T' Hyppolochus then comes he and Pisander, <lb/>
            Sons of Antimachus, a person noted <lb/>
            For having gold receiv'd of Alexander, <lb/>
            And for it in the common council voted. <lb n="120"/>
            And these two Agamemnon took alive ; <lb/>
            For by mischance the reins slipp'd from their hands, <lb/>
            And then they saw it was in vain to strive, <lb/>
            And Agamemnon now before them stands. <lb/>
            Then as they sat together on one seat, <lb n="125"/>
            Save us (said they) Atrides, let us live, <lb/>
            For we redeem'd shall be with ransom great, <lb/>
            Our father for us what you please will give. <lb/>
            Are you Antimachus's son, said he, <lb/>
            That gave advice to murder Menelaus, <lb n="130"/>
            Contrary to the laws of honesty, <lb/>
            When of the Greeks ambassador he was, <lb/>
            And with Ulysses sent into the town ? <lb/>
            You for your father's evil deed must pay. <lb/>
            Then from his car Pisander he struck down ; <lb n="135"/>
            With breast pierc'd through upon his back he lay. <lb/>
            Hyppolochus was lighted and on foot, <lb/>
            And with the sword of Agamemnon slain, <lb/>
            Who cuts his head off, and his hands to boot, <lb/>
            And then upon the Trojans press'd again. <lb n="140"/>
            And great the slaughter was of them that fled, <lb/>
            And wonderful the dust that raised was ; <lb/>
            And both the field and army covered, <lb/>
            Forc'd up by troops of horses shod with brass. <lb/>
            As boughs fall in a wood that's set on flame, <lb n="145"/>
            And shaken by the violence of wind, <lb/>
            So fast unto the ground the Trojans came, <lb/>
            When Agamemnon follow'd them behind. <lb/>
            And many horses made their chariots rattle, <lb/>
            Which empty ran about when no man drives. <lb n="150"/>
            For they that drove them fall'n were in the battle, <lb/>
            A lovelier sight to vultures than their wives. <lb/>
            But Hector was by Jove set out of sight <lb/>
            Of all this dust and slaughter and disorder: <lb/>
            But Agamemnon still with all his might <lb n="155"/>
            Pursuing killed, and to kill gave order. <lb/>
            Then they that were encamp'd at Ilus' tomb <lb/>
            Retir'd in haste unto the sycamore, <lb/>
            Half the plain over towards Ilium, <lb/>
            And after them Atrides, covered o'er <lb n="160"/>
            With blood and dust. But when the Trojans were <lb/>
            Got back unto the beech near Scæa gate, <lb/>
            Awhile they for their fellows stayed there, <lb/>
            Who swiftly ran, fearing to come too late. <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            As when a lion falleth in the night <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. <lb/>

            Upon a herd or kine, and one must die, <lb/>
            And all the rest are put into a fright, <lb/>
            So Agamemnon made the Trojans fly ; <lb/>
            And all the way he went the hindmost kill'd. <lb/>
            And from their cars some forward fell, and some <lb n="170"/>
            Upon their backs, and lay dead on the field. <lb/>
            But when unto the wall they near were come, <lb/>
            Then Jove came down to Ida from the sky <lb/>
            With thunder in his hand, and t' Iris said, <lb/>
            Go, Iris, quickly, and tell Hector I <lb n="175"/>
            Command him Agamemnon to avoid <lb/>
            As long as in the front he raging is, <lb/>
            And let the fight by others manag'd be. <lb/>
            But when he Agamemnon wounded sees, <lb/>
            And leave the field, I'll give the victory <lb n="180"/>
            To him, and he shall put them all to flight, <lb/>
            And to the fleet go killing all the way, <lb/>
            Until the sun be set, and dark the night. <lb/>
            This said, away she went without delay; <lb/>
            And down from Ida came to Ilium, <lb n="185"/>
            And finding him upon his car, To you <lb/>
            From Jove (said she) 0 Hector, I am come <lb/>
            To warn you Agamemnon to eschew, <lb/>
            As long as in the front he raging is. <lb/>
            And let the fight by others manag'd be ; <lb n="190"/>
            But when by spear or bow he wounded is, <lb/>
            And leaves the field, he'll give the victory <lb/>
            To you, and you shall put them all to flight, <lb/>
            And to the fleet go killing all the way, <lb/>
            Until the sun be set, and dark the night. <lb n="195"/>
            Having thus said, she did no longer stay. <lb/>
            Then Hector armed, leap'd unto the ground, <lb/>
            And with two spears well pointed in his hand <lb/>
            Exhorting went about the army round. <lb/>
            Their faces then the Trojans turn, and stand. <lb n="200"/>
            The first that did advance Atrides was. <lb/>
            But tell me, Muse, who first came in his way ? <lb/>
            One of Antenor's sons, Iphidamas, <lb/>
            That was brought up in Thrace (though born at Troy) <lb/>
            By Cisseus, who his mother's father was, <lb n="205"/>
            From childhood till to man's estate he came, <lb/>
            And made his son in law. But then, because <lb/>
            The coming of the Greeks was known by Fame, <lb/>
            Was thence, although but new espoused, sent <lb/>
            To th' aid of Priam and his sons at Troy, <lb n="210"/>
            And at Percopa landing t' Ilium went, <lb/>
            And now was standing in Atrides' way. <lb/>
            First Agamemnon threw his spear and miss'd : <lb/>
            Iphidamas then at Atrides threw, <pb n="124"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>
            The third fight. </note> <lb/>
            And hit his belt, which did the stroke resist, <lb n="215"/>
            For massy silver was the belt and true, <lb/>
            And bent the point as if it had been lead. <lb/>
            Then Agamemnon with his sword came on, <lb/>
            And smote him on the neck, and laid him dead. <lb/>
            Thus died Iphidamas, Antenor's son : <lb n="220"/>
            And much to be lamented was his case, <lb/>
            That far from his espoused virgin wife, <lb/>
            Without receiving from her any grace, <lb/>
            Should fighting for his country lose his life. <lb/>
            He given for her had a thousand kine, <lb n="225"/>
            And promised sheep and goats a thousand more. <lb/>
            Now slain, and stript was of his armour fine <lb/>
            By Agamemnon, and triumphed o'er. <lb/>
            But Coon then, Antenor's eldest son, <note type="margin"> Agamemnon <lb/>
            wounded. </note> <lb/>
            Incensed by his brother's death, came in, <lb n="230"/>
            And piere'd Atrides' arm close by the bone, <lb/>
            (Unseen) the elbow and the wrist between. <lb/>
            Then cold was Agamemnon's heart with fear, <lb/>
            But gave not over. For as Coon drew <lb/>
            His brother off, he came on with his spear, <lb n="235"/>
            And with a thrust beneath his shield, him slew, <lb/>
            And, on his brother, then cuts off his head. <lb/>
            Thus these two brothers finished their fate. <lb/>
            Atrides still the slaughter followed <lb/>
            With spear, and sword, and stones of mighty weight, <lb n="240"/>
            Not giving over whilst the wound was warm. <lb/>
            But when 'twas cleans'd, and stayed was the blood, <lb/>
            So cruel then the pain was in his arm, <lb/>
            That on the ground no longer stay he could. <lb/>
            Then, mounted on his chariot, he said, <lb n="245"/>
            Drive to the ships; for he was in great pain. <lb/>
            And on the princes then the charge be laid, <lb/>
            The fight against the Trojans to maintain. <lb/>
            My friends, said he, 'tis your part now to stay <lb/>
            The fury of the Trojans from our ships; <lb n="250"/>
            Since Jove not suffers me to fight all day. <lb/>
            This said, the charioteer his horses whips, <lb/>
            Which when they felt, away they swiftly went, <lb/>
            And stain'd with sweat and powder of the plain, <lb/>
            Brought wounded Agamemnon to his tent, <lb n="255"/>
            From off the field bestrew'd with bodies slain. <lb/>
            As soon as Hector saw Atrides gone, <lb/>
            Now Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, he cried, <lb/>
            Now charge the Greeks with resolution, <lb/>
            For he is gone on whom they most relied, <lb n="260"/>
            And Jove assures me that the day is mine. <lb/>
            This said, like hounds encourag'd by the hunter <lb/>
            Against a lion or a tusked swine, <lb/>
            The Trojans boldly marched to th' encounter, <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            And on them fell, with Hector at their head. <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> The Greeks <lb/>
            benten to <lb/>
            their camp. </note> <lb n="265"/>
            And as a down-right wind the sea, so he <lb/>
            The Argive ranks and files disordered, <lb/>
            And them that fled pursued furiously. <lb/>
            But tell me, Muse, whilst Hector, Priam's son, <lb/>
            By Jove assisted, did the Greeks pursue, <lb n="270"/>
            And great renown amongst the Trojans won, <lb/>
            Who and how many were the men he slew. <lb/>
            Assæus first, and then Antonous, <lb/>
            Oplites, Dolops, and Ophelitus, <lb/>
            And then Æsymnus, and Agelaus; <lb n="275"/>
            Then Orus, and the last Hipponous. <lb/>
            All these were princes in the Argive host. <lb/>
            But look how many are the drops of dew, <lb/>
            When into th' air the sea by winds is tost, <lb/>
            So many private soldiers Hector slew. <lb n="280"/>
            And then incurable their loss had been, <lb/>
            And fled had to their ships the Greeks, dismay'd, <lb/>
            Had not Ulysses then the same foreseen, <lb/>
            And to Tydides, not far from him, said, <lb/>
            Tydides, to what purpose stand we here ? <lb n="285"/>
            Come hither, man, and stand close to my side, <lb/>
            To let our ships be lost great shame it were. <lb/>
            Tydides to Ulysses then replied, <lb/>
            Yes, yes, Ulysses, I will with you bide, <lb/>
            Though we shall take but little pleasure here, <lb n="290"/>
            For Jove I see inclineth to their side. <lb/>
            This said, he at Thymbræus threw his spear, <lb/>
            Which lighting on his left pap pierc'd him through. <lb/>
            Ulysses slew Molion, Priam's man; <lb/>
            Upon the field unstript they left these two, <lb n="295"/>
            And then into the Trojan throng they ran, <lb/>
            (Whilst th' other Greeks from Hector swiftly fly) <lb/>
            Like two wild boars that turn upon the hounds, <lb/>
            That know they may upon their strength rely, <lb/>

            And there two valiant sons of Merops kill'd, <lb/>
            As they together on one chariot sate. <lb/>
            This Merops was in prophecy well skill'd, <lb/>
            And bade them stay, and told them had their fate. <lb/>
            But the two forward youths would not obey, <lb n="305"/>
            But led unto the war by destiny, <lb/>
            Unluckily came in Tydides' way, <lb/>
            Where by his hand their fortune 'twas to die. <lb/>
            Hippodamas was by Ulysses kill'd, <lb/>
            As also was Eypirichus; and now <lb n="310"/>
            None knew who had the better in the field <lb/>
            But Jove, who looked on from Ida's brow. <lb/>
            And then Agastrophus, King Pæon's son, <lb/>
            Was by Tydides wounded in the thigh, <pb n="126"/>
            <note type="margin"> LID. XI. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>
            Diomed, Ma­ <lb/>
            chaon, Ulysses, <lb/>
            and Eurypylua <lb/>
            wounded. </note> <lb/>
            And would have fled, but horses he had none, <lb n="315"/>
            His man that held them for him was not nigh. <lb/>
            Yet fought he 'mongst the foremost till he died. <lb/>
            This Hector saw, and towards Diomed <lb/>
            His horses turn'd, and to the Trojans cried, <lb/>
            Come, follow me, and they all followed. <lb n="320"/>
            And Diomed, as soon as he saw this, <lb/>
            Though chill with fear, unto Ulysses said, <lb/>
            To us this plaguy Hector rolling is ; <lb/>
            But stand, and let him see we're not afraid. <lb/>
            This said, he straight at Hector threw his spear, <lb n="325"/>
            Which hit his helmet, but glanc'd from the brass, <lb/>
            And never to his tender skin came near: <lb/>
            This helmet given him by Apollo was. <lb/>
            But stunn'd he was, and resting on his knees, <lb/>
            He kept himself from falling with his hand. <lb n="330"/>
            Dark are his eyes, nothing at all he sees, <lb/>
            And for a while unable is to stand. <lb/>
            But whilst Tydides on the plain advanced, <lb/>
            To get into his hand again the spear, <lb/>
            Which from the place he aim'd at far was glanced, <lb n="335"/>
            Hector was mounted, and his senses clear. <lb/>
            Tydides then upon him looked, and said, <lb/>
            Thou dog, escap'd an evil death thou hast; <lb/>
            And twice been saved by Apollo's aid, <lb/>
            But sure I shall dispatch thee at the last, <lb n="340"/>
            For of a God I also have the aid. <lb/>
            But now to other Trojans I'll go on, <lb/>
            Such as shall come into my way. This said, <lb/>
            Away he went to strip King Pæon's son. <lb/>
            And then, as Diomed was taking from <lb n="345"/>
            Agastrophus the armour of his breast, <lb/>
            Paris, that leaning stood at Ilus' tomb, <lb/>
            To him an arrow unperceiv'd addrest, <lb/>
            Which hit him on the foot above the toes, <lb/>
            And to the ground clean thorough went the shaft. <lb n="350"/>
            Then openly into the field he goes, <lb/>
            And coming nearer to him spake, and laugh'd. <lb/>
            Ye're hit, said he, Tydides. Would it had <lb/>
            Been on your belly, that you might have died; <lb/>
            The Trojans would of that been very glad, <lb n="355"/>
            That are so often by you terrified. <lb/>
            Proud, boasting archer, said Tydides, know, <lb/>
            If in your armour you before me stood, <lb/>
            To try your valour and your force, your bow <lb/>
            And arrows would not do you any good. <lb n="360"/>
            You value such a scratch as this too much. <lb/>
            The weapons of the strengthless blunted are: <lb/>
            Mine is not so; but whom it does but touch, <lb/>
            His wife lamenting tears her cheeks and hair; <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            His children orphans are; and red the ground <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> Diomed, Ma­ <lb/>

            Whereon he rotting lies; and vultures more <lb/>
            Than women standing by him will be found. <lb/>
            Ulysses then, that near him was before, <lb/>
            Stepp'd in, and stood betwixt him and his foes <lb/>
            Whilst from his foot the arrow he pull'd out. <lb n="370"/>
            Then to his char'ot up Tydides goes, <lb/>
            And left the field where he had nobly fought. <lb/>
            And now Ulysses left was all alone, <lb/>
            For from him all the rest were fled for fear, <lb/>
            And then unto himself he made his moan. <lb n="275"/>
            Ay me, said he, what now shall I do here ? <lb/>
            Though many be the foes, 'tis ill to fly, <lb/>
            But yet, since Jove saves all the rest by flight, <lb/>
            It would be worse if I alone should die. <lb/>
            But why dispute I, when I ought to fight ? <lb n="380"/>
            None but a coward from the fight will run. <lb/>
            But he that honour loves will stand his ground, <lb/>
            And be content with what he cannot shun, <lb/>
            Whether it be to give or take a wound. <lb/>
            While thus Ulysses argued in his mind, <lb n="385"/>
            Hector was near him, and enclosed him had <lb/>
            With targetiers before him and behind, <lb/>
            Whereof they had no reason to be glad. <lb/>
            As when the hounds by hunters are set on <lb/>
            A wild boar as he comes out from the wood, <lb n="390"/>
            lIe whets his teeth, they from him will not run ; <lb/>
            Even so Ulysses 'mongst the Trojans stood ; <lb/>
            Where by him slain first Deiopites was, <lb/>
            And Thoon then, and Eunomus he killed ; <lb/>
            And after these he slew Chersidamas, <lb n="395"/>
            As from his car he lighted in the field. <lb/>
            Then leaving these, slew Charops with his spear, <lb/>
            Socus, his brother IIippasus his son. <lb/>
            Then Socus to him came, and standing near <lb/>
            Unto Ulysses, with a speech begun. <lb n="400"/>
            Ulysses, much renown'd for craft and pain, <lb/>
            This day you either must the honour wear <lb/>
            Of having Hippasus his two sons slain, <lb/>
            Or lose your own life, wounded by my spear. <lb/>
            Then threw his spear, and piere'd Ulysses' shield, <lb n="405"/>
            His breast-plate, and his coat, and tore his skin. <lb/>
            But Pallas him preserved from being kill'd; <lb/>
            For to the vital parts it went not in. <lb/>
            Ulysses knew the wound not mortal was; <lb/>
            Made a step back, and then to Socus said, <lb n="410"/>
            Fool that thou art, that wouldst not let me pass <lb/>
            On other Trojans, hast thyself destroy'd, <lb/>
            I do not think you shall this hour outlive, <lb/>
            But from my spear's sharp point receive your death, <pb n="128"/>

            And unto me more reputation give, <lb n="415"/>
            And leave your soul unto the pow'rs beneath. <lb/>
            Then Socus turn'd himself about to fly, <lb/>
            But overtaken by Ulysses' spear, <lb/>
            That pierc'd him back and breast, he fell down dead. <lb/>
            Then scornfully Ulysses did him jeer. <lb n="420"/>
            O Socus, gallant man at arms, said he, <lb/>
            By death prevented is your enterprise; <lb/>
            Your eyes shall not by parents closed be, <lb/>
            But shall be pecked out by crows and pyes. <lb/>
            Then from his shield and body he pull'd out <lb n="425"/>
            The spear which at him was by Socus thrown. <lb/>
            The blood then from the wound did freely spout, <lb/>
            Which when the Trojans saw, they straight came down <lb/>
            And all together tow'rds him went the rabble. <lb/>
            Then he retir'd, and as he going was, <lb n="430"/>
            Thrice called out, as loud as he was able, <lb/>
            For help; and thrice was heard by Menelaus, <lb/>
            Who t' Ajax said, Ulysses' voice I hear, <lb/>
            And like the voice of one that is distrest. <lb/>
            He hemm'd in by the Trojans is, I fear; <lb n="435"/>
            Come, let us to him go, and do our best <lb/>
            To fetch him off. For valiant though he be, <lb/>
            I fear, unless we aid him with great speed, <lb/>
            He by the Trojans will be slain, and we <lb/>
            Lose a good man, of whom we oft have need. <lb n="440"/>
            Then up they went, and found him by the foes <lb/>
            Environ'd round. As when a stag is shot <lb/>
            By some young man, he swiftly from him goes <lb/>
            Whilst strong his knees are, and his blood is hot. <lb/>
            But when he by the arrow tamed is, <lb n="445"/>
            The wolves feed on him in the gloomy wood; <lb/>
            Then comes the lion, and the prey is his. <lb/>
            About Ulysses so the Trojans stood, <lb/>
            Till Ajax, with a target like a tower, <lb/>
            Came to his aid; then several ways they fled. <lb n="450"/>
            Ulysses, now no longer in their power, <lb/>
            Was from the field by Menelaus led, <lb/>
            And mounted on his chariot again. <lb/>
            But on went Ajax, and slew Pandocus, <lb/>
            King Priam's son, and wounded three good men, <lb n="455"/>
            Lisander, Pylartes, and Pyrasus. <lb/>
            Then as a river coming to the plain, <lb/>
            And swell'd by Jupiter with show'rs of rain <lb/>
            More than the banks are able to contain, <lb/>
            Bears oaks and pines before it to the main, <lb n="460"/>
            So Ajax charged the Trojan troops. But this <lb/>
            Hector knew nothing of; for far off now <lb/>
            Upon Scamander's banks he fighting is, <lb/>
            And to the ground doth many an Argivc throw. <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            There was the noise, there aged Nestor stood, <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> Diomed, Ma­ <lb/>

            And there Idomeneus, with their steeds. <lb/>
            And Hector, that the use well understood <lb/>
            Of spears and horses, there did mighty deeds. <lb/>
            And yet the Greeks retir'd not; nor had done <lb/>
            If Paris had not with an arrow smote <lb n="470"/>
            Machaon on the shoulder to the bone. <lb/>
            Three-forked was the arrow which he shot; <lb/>
            And mightily the Argives were afraid <lb/>
            Since now the foe prevailed, he would be slain. <lb/>
            To Nestor then Idomeneus said, <lb n="475"/>
            O Nestor, to your char'ot mount again, <lb/>
            And with Machaon make haste to the ships. <lb/>
            A surgeon many other men is worth. <lb/>
            For many other men alive he keeps <lb/>
            By making salves and drawing weapons forth. <lb n="480"/>
            Then Nestor mounteth and the horses whips, <lb/>
            Which they no sooner feel than they are gone, <lb/>
            And quickly brought unto the hollow ships <lb/>
            Machaon AEsculapius his son. <lb/>
            Mean while Cebriones, the charioteer <lb n="485"/>
            Of Hector, saw the Trojans were distress'd, <lb/>
            And to him said, To what end stay we here, <lb/>
            Since yonder by the Greeks our friends are press'd? <lb/>
            'Tis Ajax that disorders them, I see; <lb/>
            I know him by the largeness of his shield. <lb n="490"/>
            Now where they fighting are most furiously, <lb/>
            Let us go down to that side of the field. <lb/>
            This said, he crack'd his whip, his horses ran <lb/>
            Unto the place where greatest was the cry, <lb/>
            O'er many a shield, and over many a man <lb n="495"/>
            That gasping on the bloody field did lie. <lb/>
            The horses' bellies and the chariot wheels <lb/>
            And axletrees with blood were cover'd o'er, <lb/>
            Forc'd up in drops by the swift horses' heels. <lb/>
            And Hector rushing in, their battles tore. <lb n="500"/>
            But Hector still took heed of Ajax' spear. <lb/>
            And fought in other places of the field. <lb/>
            But Ajax, struck by Jupiter with fear, <lb/>
            Amazed, at his shoulder'hung his shield; <lb/>
            And staring on the foe awhile he stood, <lb n="505"/>
            Then turn'd and softly from them went away. <lb/>
            As when a lion coming from the wood <lb/>
            Down to a pasture, on a cow to prey, <lb/>
            Is hu'd by dogs and peasants in the night, <lb/>
            And hungry sometimes goes and sometimes stands, <lb n="510"/>
            But cannot have his will for all his might, <lb/>
            So many spears are flying from their hands, <lb/>
            And flaming brands which put him in a fright, <lb/>
            Keen as he is, then sullenly he goes <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>

            So then retired Ajax from his foes. <lb/>
            Or as an ass, in spite of many boes, <lb/>
            Is got into the corn, and there abides, <lb/>
            Though they upon him fall with blows and noise, <lb/>
            And many cudgels break upon his sides, <lb n="520"/>
            For he the force of boys but little feels, <lb/>
            He hardly will be driven out though fill'd, <lb/>
            And now and then kicks at them with his heels: <lb/>
            So Ajax at the last went off the field, <lb/>
            By Hector and the Trojans still pursued, <lb n="525"/>
            Upon his shield receiving many a spear; <lb/>
            Sometimes his back, sometimes his face he showed, <lb/>
            So that they could not to the ships come near. <lb/>
            Thus he between the Greeks and Trojans stands, <lb/>
            While spears abundance at him hurled were; <lb n="530"/>
            Some in his shield stuck, driven by strong hands, <lb/>
            Some on the ground fell short and fix'd were there. <lb/>
            But then Eurypylus, Euæmon's son, <lb/>
            That saw him thus oppress'd, came to his side, <lb/>
            And wounded with his spear Apisaon <lb n="535"/>
            The liver through ; and on the place he died. <lb/>
            But as he stripped him lying on the ground <lb/>
            Was shot by Alexander in the thigh, <lb/>
            And broken was the arrow in the wound, <lb/>
            And much increased was his pain thereby. <lb n="540"/>
            Then went Eurypylus into the crowd, <lb/>
            And cried out to the princes of the host, <lb/>
            Turn and save noble Ajax from this cloud <lb/>
            Of Trojan spears, or else he will be lost. <lb/>
            This said, the best commanders to him go <lb n="545"/>
            With spears advanc'd, and bucklers turn'd before, <lb/>
            And place themselves between him and the foe. <lb/>
            And then again the fight was very sore. <lb/>
            Mean while Achilles as he sitting was <lb/>
            On high astern his ship to see them fight, <lb n="550"/>
            Perceived Nestor and Machaon pass, <lb/>
            And to Patroclus called with all his might, <lb/>
            Come hither, friend. Patroclus heard him call, <lb/>
            For he was sitting in Achilles' tent, <lb/>
            And (which was the beginning of his fall) <lb n="555"/>
            Immediately rose up and to him went, <lb/>
            And said, Achilles, what's your will with me ? <lb/>
            Achilles then replied, Patroclus, now <lb/>
            The Argives, I believe, will bend the knee, <lb/>
            For their condition never was so low. <lb n="560"/>
            But go to Nestor and informed be <lb/>
            Who 'tis that he brought with him from the fight. <lb/>
            Machaon by his back he seem'd to me, <lb/>
            But of his face I could not have a sight. <lb/>

            That was the daughter of Arsinous, <lb/>
            And taken by Achilles was when he <lb/>
            Conquer'd and sack'd the city Tenedus, <lb n="575"/>
            And by the Greeks to Nestor giv'n; and she <lb/>
            To Nestor and Machaon setteth up <lb/>
            A table with a black foot smooth and fine, <lb/>
            And on it set a basket, and a cup, <lb/>
            And to each one before him set on wine. <lb n="580"/>
            The cup with nails of gold was studded o'er, <lb/>
            Four ears it had, and two doves at each ear, <lb/>
            And those were gold, and at the foot two more <lb/>
            In posture such as if they feeding were. <lb/>
            Nestor to Troy had with him brought this cup. <lb n="585"/>
            Another scarce could lift it from the table <lb/>
            When fill'd with wine; though he to take it up, <lb/>
            Old as he was, and easily was able. <lb/>
            And in the same the woman made the drink, <lb/>
            With goat's-milk cheese, and white flour sprinkled o'er, <lb n="590"/>
            And left it on the board full to the brink. <lb/>
            Then quenched they their thirst, and drank no more, <lb/>
            But talking sat, to put out of their thought <lb/>
            Their ill success. Now at the door o' th' tent <lb/>
            Patroclus was, and in by Nestor brought, <lb n="595"/>
            And pray'd to sit, but he would not consent, <lb/>
            But said, Achilles bade me ask you who <lb/>
            It is whom you brought with you from the fight. <lb/>
            And this already I can answer to. <lb/>
            Machaon 'tis that sits there in my sight. <lb n="600"/>
            What need then is there of my longer stay ? <lb/>
            Return I will with all the speed I can, <lb/>
            For fear he should some blame upon me lay, <lb/>
            Though I deserve it not. You know the man. <lb/>
            What makes Achilles, aged Nestor said, <lb n="605"/>
            Of th' Argives wounded men to take such care ? <lb/>
            He knows not how the army is dismayed, <lb/>
            Nor yet how many of them wounded are. <lb/>
            Ulysses wounded is, and Diomed, <lb/>
            And Agamemnon, and Eurypylus, <lb n="610"/>
            And this man whom I with me hither led. <lb/>
            Achilles pity has on none of us ; <lb/>
            Although our safety now lie in his hands. <lb/>
            Intends he to sit still till Hector burn <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>

            In spite of us our ships upon the sands, <lb n="615"/>
            And ev'ry one of us kill in his turn ? <lb/>
            For now my strength decayed is with age. <lb/>
            O that I were as strong as I was then <lb/>
            When war 'twixt us and th' Elians did rage, <lb/>
            And we our cattle fetch'd from them again, <lb n="620"/>
            And slew Itymoneus that took our kine, <lb/>
            For I then went his cattle to distrain, <lb/>
            And take amends for those he took of mine. <lb/>
            There he defending them by me was slain, <lb/>
            And all his people from him ran away. <lb n="625"/>
            And there we took of fifty herds of kine <lb/>
            And of as many herds of goats a prey, <lb/>
            As many flocks, as many herds of swine, <lb/>
            And horses three times fifty, females all, <lb/>
            Of colour sandy mix'd with sparks of light; <lb n="630"/>
            And most of them had foals, and to the wall <lb/>
            Of Pyle I brought this booty all by night. <lb/>
            My father Neleus joyful was to see't; <lb/>
            For yet he thought I was for war too young. <lb/>
            Next morn the criers make the people meet, <lb n="635"/>
            (All those to whom the Elians had done wrong) <lb/>
            The lords amongst them then divide the prey. <lb/>
            Many there were that had been injured, <lb/>
            And with their shares contented sent away, <lb/>
            Though Pylus were not well inhabited. <lb n="640"/>
            For Hercules not many years before <lb/>
            Had kill'd the best of them. And Neleus then <lb/>
            Had twelve good sons, whereof he left no more <lb/>
            Alive but me. This made th' Epian men <lb/>
            Despise our number small, and do us wrong. <lb n="645"/>
            And Neleus now unto himself did keep <lb/>
            The best herd of the kine, and from among <lb/>
            The flocks chose one that had three hundred sheep, <lb/>
            And justly, since so great a loss had none. <lb/>
            For he four steeds unto the games had sent <lb n="650"/>
            Of value great, which all had prizes won. <lb/>
            But by Augias his commandement, <lb/>
            When for a tripod they prepared to run, <lb/>
            Together with the cars were there detained. <lb/>
            Chari'teers related what was done. <lb n="655"/>
            And Neleus then the best o' th' prey retain'd; <lb/>
            And ev'ry man had of the rest his share. <lb/>
            This done unto the Gods we sacrifice. <lb/>
            Mean while the Elians for war prepare, <lb/>
            And two days after altogether rise, <lb n="660"/>
            And forth o' th' town went they both foot and horse, <lb/>
            And with them Molion's two sons, not yet <lb/>

            Elis and Pyle, upon Alphæus' side. <lb/>
            Passing the plain they were by Pallas seen ; <lb/>
            And she aloud unto the Pylians cried, <lb/>
            To arms, you men of Pyle. Then in the night <lb/>
            We put on arms, and to the field we hied; <lb n="670"/>
            And cheerfully went ev'ry one to fight. <lb/>
            My horses only were convey'd aside. <lb/>
            For Neleus thought I was in war unskill'd: <lb/>
            But I at home could not be made t' abide, <lb/>
            But with the rest on foot went to the field, <lb n="675"/>
            For on the Goddess Pallas I relied. <lb/>
            Near to Arene falls into the main <lb/>
            A little brook. All night by that we lay, <lb/>
            And in the morn betime we march'd again, <lb/>
            And to Alphæus came in half a day. <lb n="680"/>
            And there to Jove his sacred rites we paid. <lb/>
            To Neptune and Alphæus each a bull; <lb/>
            An heifer to the heav'nly martial maid <lb/>
            We gave; and when the bands of foot were full, <lb/>
            Then sup we in our ranks, and armed slept. <lb n="685"/>
            Th' Epeians still the town besieging lay; <lb/>
            But seeing the war was now so near them crept, <lb/>
            They rose; then presently began the fray. <lb/>
            And there the first man that was slain I slew, <lb/>
            Which Molius was, Augias' son-in-law. <lb n="690"/>
            He wedded Acameda had, who knew <lb/>
            As many med'cines as the world e'er saw. <lb/>
            Him first I slew, and to his char'ot mounted. <lb/>
            Then fled th' Epeians scatter'd here and there: <lb/>
            For he the best amongst them was accounted. <lb n="695"/>
            And as they fled I follow'd with my spear, <lb/>
            And fifty char'ots took, and at each one <lb/>
            Two men I kill'd; for like a storm I went; <lb/>
            Nor had I left to Molius any son, <lb/>
            If Neptune had not hinder'd my intent, <lb n="700"/>
            That took them up and sav'd them in a cloud. <lb/>
            Great honour won the Pyleans that day; <lb/>
            For on the plains we chac'd th' Epeians proud, <lb/>
            Killing and gath'ring armour all the way <lb/>
            Until we came unto Buprasium, <lb n="705"/>
            Alesium, and Rock-Olene; and there <lb/>
            Advis'd we were by Pallas to go home. <lb/>
            To Pylus then we went and welcome were. <lb/>
            And thanks were given to the Gods, but most <lb/>
            To Jupiter the greatest God. And then <lb n="710"/>
            In general were thanked all the host, <lb/>
            And Nestor namely above other men. <lb/>
            Thus I behav'd myself amongst the Greeks, <lb/>
            Whereas Achilles sitting in his tent, <pb n="134"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> Patroclus is <lb/>
            persuaded by <lb/>

            sent to the aid <lb/>

            Neglecting us, his own contentment seeks; <lb n="715"/>
            Though if our fleet be lost he will repent. <lb/>
            But, 0 Patroclus, the advice was good <lb/>
            Menoetius your father gave you then <lb/>
            When I at Phthia was and by him stood, <lb/>
            By Agamemnon sent to levy men. <lb n="720"/>
            To Peleus' house Ulysses came and I, <lb/>
            And there we found Menœtius and you. <lb/>
            And you upon Achilles waited nigh, <lb/>
            And Peleus to the Gods fat cattle slew <lb/>
            I' th' court o' th' grass, a gold cup in his hand, <lb n="725"/>
            And pour'd wine on the burning sacrifice, <lb/>
            And you then saw us in the gate-house stand, <lb/>
            Though busy you were then to burn the thighs. <lb/>
            Achilles to us came and led us in, <lb/>
            And made us sup, and supper being done, <lb n="730"/>
            To tell our bus'ness then I did begin, <lb/>
            Which was to bring with us to Troy his son. <lb/>
            Both he and you desirous were to go; <lb/>
            And Peleus then unto Achilles said, <lb/>
            Strive still to be the best, and let the foe <lb n="735"/>
            Be always of your spear the most afraid. <lb/>
            Then to you spake your father; Son, said he, <lb/>
            Achilles is a better man of war <lb/>
            Than you, and higher in nobility <lb/>
            Of blood; but you in age before him are. <lb n="740"/>
            Give him good counsel therefore, and suggest <lb/>
            What's for his good, although he see it not: <lb/>
            He will obey when for himself 'tis best; <lb/>
            Thus he advis'd you, though you have forgot. <lb/>
            But do it now. For 'tis not yet too late. <lb n="745"/>
            Who knows but you may make him change his mind? <lb/>
            Or if he still continue obstinate, <lb/>
            Or in some oracle a scruple find, <lb/>
            Or Thetis told him somewhat has from Jove, <lb/>
            Yet let him send his Myrmidons with you, <lb n="750"/>
            The Trojans from the navy to remove, <lb/>
            And give th' Achæans time to breathe anew. <lb/>
            But let him give you his own arms. Then they <lb/>
            (When like unto Achilles you appear, <lb/>
            Leading fresh forces) fly will into Troy, <lb n="755"/>
            And rid th' Achæans of their present fear. <lb/>
            This said, Patroclus, grieved, went his way, <lb/>
            And tow'rds Achilles' tent ran back apace, <lb/>
            Passing by where Ulysses' vessels lay. <lb/>
            There were the altars, there the market-place, <lb n="760"/>
            There were the courts of justice. There he met <lb/>
            Eurypylus, with the arrow in his wound, <lb/>
            And from his head and shoulders dropp'd the sweat, <lb/>
            And bled apace, but still his sense was sound. <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            Then, pitying him, Patroclus spake, and said, <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. <lb/>
             </note> <lb n="765"/>
            Ah !poor commanders of the Achæan host, <lb/>
            Must we be all so far from home destroyed, <lb/>
            And lie for dogs'-meat on the Trojan coast ? <lb/>
            But say, Eurypylus, is there no way <lb/>
            To keep off Hector, but must perish all ? <lb n="770"/>
            Nothing I know, said he, can Hector stay, <lb/>
            But in our flaming ships we all must fall. <lb/>
            For all the best of us here wounded lie, <lb/>
            And still the Trojan power grows more and more. <lb/>
            But, 0 Patroclus, cut out of my thigh <lb n="775"/>
            This arrow-head; for it torments me sore, <lb/>
            And with warm water wash away the blood, <lb/>
            And salves apply, the same that Chiron knew, <lb/>
            (The best of Centaurs) to be very good, <lb/>
            And taught Achilles, and Achilles you. <lb n="780"/>
            For of two surgeons in the army, one <lb/>
            As much need of a surgeon hath as I, <lb/>
            And Podalirius to the fight is gone. <lb/>
            Patroclus to him then made this reply. <lb/>
            How can this now be done, Eurypylus, <lb n="785"/>
            Since to Achilles I must go with speed <lb/>
            With Nestor's answer? Yet to leave you thus <lb/>
            In torture, were but an ungentle deed. <lb/>
            Then in his arms he bears him to his tent, <lb/>
            And there, upon a many cow-hides spread, <lb n="790"/>
            Laid him, and with his knife to work he went, <lb/>
            And from his thigh cuts out the arrow-head. <lb/>
            And in his hands he bruis'd a bitter root, <lb/>
            And wash'd away the blood. When that was done. <lb/>
            He cleans'd the wound, applied the medicine toOt, <lb n="795"/>
            And straight the blood was stopp'd, the pain was gone.</p>

            Many a shield and helmet scattered lay, <lb n="25"/>
            And many a Demi-God. These rivers all <lb/>
            Apollo turned from their wonted way, <lb/>
            Directing them unto the Argives' wall. <lb/>
            Nine days perpetually they thither run, <lb/>
            And Jove nine days together pour'd down rain, <lb n="30"/>
            To th' end the work might be the sooner done. <lb/>
            And Neptune with his trident from the main <lb/>
            Before them went and wrenched out the stone <lb/>

            The deep'st of all for the foundation, <lb n="35"/>
            And made it to the sea all smooth again. <lb/>
            And strew'd again with sand the ample shore ; <lb/>

            No otherwise than they were wont before: <lb/>
            But this not yet, but afterwards was done. <lb n="40"/>
            For Hector had the Greeks with show'rs of spears <lb/>

            That rattled terribly about their ears, <lb/>

            And as he goes still makes them to give way; <lb/>
            So Hector 'mongst his friends went here and there, <lb n="50"/>
            Exhorting them the trenches to assay. <lb/>
            The horses when upon the brink they were <lb/>
            Boggled and whinnied, and refus'd to pass ; <lb/>
            For broad it was and not to be leap'd o'er : <lb/>
            And to descend into, too deep it was, <lb n="55"/>
            And on each side bristled with stakes good store, <lb/>
            Fix'd by the Achæans to keep off the foe ; <lb/>
            So that for horse and cars there was no way. <lb/>
            But very willing were the foot to go, <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            And only to receive command did stay. <note type="margin"> LIB. XII. </note><note type="margin"> The fourth fight. </note> <lb n="60"/>
            And then to Hector said Polydamas, <lb/>
            Hector and you, the princes of our friends, <lb/>
            We strive in vain to make our horses pass <lb/>
            O'er such great stakes, so sharpened at the ends, <lb/>
            Having above our heads the enemy. <lb n="65"/>
            Where (though we could get down) we cannot fight, <lb/>
            Though Jove unto our side inclined be, <lb/>
            And to the Greeks should bear as much despite, <lb/>
            As I, that wish their name were rooted out. <lb/>
            Yet if the Greeks, when we encumber'd were <lb n="70"/>
            For want of room, should turn and face about, <lb/>
            And set upon us in the ditch, I fear <lb/>
            A man of us would not be left alive <lb/>
            To tell at Troy what is become of us. <lb/>
            But if you mean to have the bus'ness thrive, <lb n="75"/>
            Then hear my counsel, Let us all do thus : <lb/>
            Till of our horse and chariots we have need <lb/>
            Let servants hold them to the trenches nigh, <lb/>
            And we on foot fight; for if Jove indeed <lb/>
            Intend us victory, the Greeks will By. <lb n="80"/>
            Thus he advis'd ; and Hector thought it best, <lb/>
            And from his chariot leap'd unto the sand, <lb/>
            Arm'd as he was ; and so did all the rest, <lb/>
            And to their charioteers they gave command <lb/>
            All in their order near the trench to stand. <lb n="85"/>
            The Trojans in five parts themselves divide ; <lb/>
            And Hector of the first took the command. <lb/>
            But with himself he joined two beside, <lb/>
            Polydamas and stout Cebriones, <lb/>
            And left a meaner man to hold his car. <lb n="90"/>
            Of all the Trojan host the best were these. <lb/>
            O' th' second party Paris had the care, <lb/>
            Join'd with Agenor and Alcathous. <lb/>
            The third commanded was by leaders three : <lb/>
            First Helenus, and then Deiphobus, <lb n="95"/>
            The third was Asius. From Arisbe he <lb/>
            With mighty horses, colour'd like to flame, <lb/>
            Bred on the bank of Sellis, came to Troy. <lb/>
            The fourth command unto Æneas came ; <lb/>
            And he likewise two seconds had, and they <lb n="100"/>
            Two sons were of Antenor (both well skill'd <lb/>
            In war), Archelochus and Acamas. <lb/>
            Lastly, Sarpedon led into the field <lb/>
            The Trojan aids ; and he assisted was <lb/>
            By valiant Glaucus and Asterapæus. <lb n="105"/>
            For of the Lycians which he led thither <lb/>
            The ablest and the best men he thought these. <lb/>
            And then with bucklers joined close together, <lb/>
            Away they march directly to the foe, <pb n="138"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XII. </note><note type="margin"> The fourth fight. </note> <lb/>
            And to the combat had a great desire. <lb n="110"/>
            The Greeks (they thought) as fast as they could go, <lb/>
            Would presently unto their ships retire, <lb/>
            But Asius would not his horses leave <lb/>
            And man, without the trench, as others did. <lb/>
            Fool as he was himself so to deceive. <lb n="115"/>
            Upon his chariot towards the ships he rid ; <lb/>
            But never came triumphant back again <lb/>
            For all his flaming horses and his car, <lb/>
            But by Idomeneus' spear was slain. <lb/>
            When Hector to the ships had brought the war, <lb n="120"/>
            The Greeks had in their wall a gate, whereat <lb/>
            Their horses to the field were us'd to pass, <lb/>
            And Asius with his chariot drave to that, <lb/>
            Which now left open by the Argives was, <lb/>
            Their people chas'd by Hector to let in. <lb n="125"/>
            And all his party with a mighty cry <lb/>
            March'd after him, as if they sure had been <lb/>
            The Argives to their hollow ships would fly; <lb/>
            But were deceived. For at the gate they found <lb/>
            Two mighty men that like two great oaks stood <lb n="130"/>
            With deep and large roots fixed in the ground, <lb/>
            That many winds and storms had long withstood. <lb/>
            And Lapiths they were both ; Leontes one, <lb/>
            The other Polypœtes gotten by <lb/>
            Pirithous. Both saw them coming on, <lb n="135"/>
            And staying, on their hands and strength rely. <lb/>
            The Trojans led by Asius came on <lb/>
            With mighty noise, Orestes, Adamas, <lb/>
            (This Adamas of Asius was the son) <lb/>
            Thoon, Iamenus, and Œnomaus, <lb n="140"/>
            And o'er their heads they held their shields on high, <lb/>
            For fear of stones and spears from off the wall. <lb/>
            The Greeks within to one another cry <lb/>
            To save the ships, the tents, themselves, and all. <lb/>
            But when they saw the Trojans went about <lb n="145"/>
            To scale the wall, they roar'd and frighted were ; <lb/>
            But the two Lapiths presently leaped out, <lb/>
            And furiously fell on the Trojans there. <lb/>
            As if two boars the men and hounds withstood, <lb/>
            You'd often hear the boughs before them snap, <lb n="150"/>
            While with their bended necks they tear the wood; <lb/>
            So thick they did the Trojan armours rap. <lb/>
            For valiantly they fought, in part relying <lb/>
            Upon their strength, and partly on the showers <lb/>
            Of mighty stones perpetually flying <lb n="155"/>
            Upon the Trojans from the wall and tow'rs. <lb/>
            As thick as to the ground fall flakes of snow, <lb/>
            When by a cold wind stirred is the cloud, <lb/>
            Their weapons from their hands on both sides go, <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            And shields and helmets crack apace and loud. <note type="margin"> LIB. XII. </note><note type="margin"> The fourth fight. </note> <lb n="160"/>
            But Asius at this vex d to the heart, <lb/>
            Then spake to Jove, and clapping of his thigh, <lb/>
            Aye me, said he, thou too a liar art, <lb/>
            That mad'st us to believe the Greeks would fly; <lb/>
            Who like so many motly wasps or bees <lb n="165"/>
            That in the hollow way their houses build, <lb/>
            And for their young resist their enemies, <lb/>
            Till they repel them or themselves be kill'd, <lb/>
            Still sharply fight and will not quit the place. <lb/>
            Thus Asius said, but Jove unmoved sate, <lb n="170"/>
            And none that day but Hector meant to grace. <lb/>
            And as at this they fought at ev'ry gate, <lb/>
            I cannot like a God relate it all, <lb/>
            The flaming stones that from the Trojans flew <lb/>
            With fire divine up to the Argive wall <lb n="175"/>
            On ev'ry side. How th' Argives no way knew <lb/>
            To save themselves but for the ships to fight; <lb/>
            And how the Gods that with the Greeks took part <lb/>
            Sat discontent in heav'n, and full of spite, <lb/>
            To see Jove so severely make them smart. <lb n="180"/>
            But for the fight without, 'twas first begun <lb/>
            By the bold Lapiths, though but two they were. <lb/>
            For Polypœtes, Pirithous' son, <lb/>
            At Damasus threw first a heavy spear, <lb/>
            And through his helmet's brazen checks it went, <lb n="185"/>
            And through the bone into the brain went on ; <lb/>
            And when unto the shades he him had sent, <lb/>
            He killed Orminus and Pyloon : <lb/>
            And then a deadly spear Leontes threw, <lb/>
            Which through the body piere'd Hippolochus. <lb n="190"/>
            And on Antiphates his sword he drew <lb/>
            And killed him, and then lamenus, <lb/>
            Orestes, Menon, one upon another. <lb/>
            But whilst they stay'd to strip these and the rest, <lb/>
            Hector, Polydamas, and many other, <lb n="195"/>
            That of the Trojan army were the best, <lb/>
            Were at the trench, and stood upon the brink <lb/>
            The wall to break, and set the ships on fire. <lb/>
            But as they stood a little while to think, <lb/>
            There came a bird not suiting their desire. <lb n="200"/>
            An eagle in his pounces held a snake, <lb/>
            And over Hector's soldiers carried it <lb/>
            Alive, but that could yet resistance make. <lb/>
            And by and by the snake the eagle bit. <lb/>
            The eagle smarting cried and flew away, <lb n="205"/>
            And 'mongst the Trojans lets the serpent fall, <lb/>
            And there amazed they, and gaping stay <lb/>
            To see Jove's prodigy before them crawl. <lb/>
            O Hector, said Polydamas, though you <pb n="140"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XII. </note><note type="margin"> The fourth fight. </note> <lb/>
            In courts and councils cross whatever I say, <lb n="210"/>
            How good soe'er it for you be and true, <lb/>
            Unless in ev'ry thing I go your way, <lb/>
            (Which is not well done, for your counsel ought <lb/>
            In peace and war to have their voices free, <lb/>
            And never give advice against their thought, <lb n="215"/>
            But always for the public good to be) ; <lb/>
            Yet now I'll tell you, if this bird be sent <lb/>
            Unto the Trojans as a prodigy, <lb/>
            'Tis not uneasy to foresee th' event. <lb/>
            For this I think the end of it will be : <lb n="220"/>
            As th' eagle in his pounces bore the snake, <lb/>
            But could not to her young ones bear it home; <lb/>
            So if the Trojans this attempt shall make, <lb/>
            They'll back unto the city smarting come, <lb/>
            And many good companions leave behind, <lb n="225"/>
            Whom th' Argives, to defend their ships, will kill. <lb/>
            And this, I think, will any augur find <lb/>
            That in's profession has any skill. <lb/>
            Then Hector sourly looking thus replied : <lb/>
            Polydamas, this counsel I like not; <lb n="230"/>
            You have a better which you from me hide. <lb/>
            But if indeed it be your very thought, <lb/>
            The Gods have sure depriv'd you of your sense, <lb/>
            That bids me not on Jove to set my rest, <lb/>
            But feather'd fowls, that fly I care not whence, <lb n="235"/>
            Nor whither, right or left, or east or west; <lb/>
            But we to Jove, the greatest God, will trust, <lb/>
            That all the other Gods excels in might. <lb/>
            He one bird has, that still observe we must, <lb/>
            And that is, for our country well to fight. <lb n="240"/>
            But why are you so much afraid ? For though <lb/>
            You ne'er so many see before you slain, <lb/>
            You of yourself will have a care I know, <lb/>
            And not adventure where you may abstain. <lb/>
            But if you stay or counsel other men <lb n="245"/>
            To stay behind, my spear shall strike you dead. <lb/>
            This said, he led them further on ; and then <lb/>
            They all with mighty clamour followed. <lb/>
            And Jove a mighty wind from Ida sent, <lb/>
            Which to the ships directly blew the dust, <lb n="250"/>
            That to the Trojans gave encouragement, <lb/>
            But to the Argives horror and distrust. <lb/>
            Encouraged thus, unto the wall they go <lb/>
            And brake down battlements, and posts pluck'd out, <lb/>
            And piles that had been planted by the foe, <lb n="255"/>
            With levers strong they wring up by the root. <lb/>
            Thus at the wall the Trojans laboured, <lb/>
            And hope they had the same to overthrow. <lb/>
            Before the battlements the Argives spread <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            Cow-hides, and thence threw stones on them below. <note type="margin"> LIB. XII. </note><note type="margin"> The fourth fight. </note> <lb n="260"/>
            the Ajaxes then ran from tow r to tow r, <lb/>
            Endeavouring to give the Argives heart, <lb/>
            Some with sweet words, and some of them with sour, <lb/>
            According as they each one did his part. <lb/>
            Fellows, said they, you that excel in war, <lb n="265"/>
            And you that great strength have, and you that small <lb/>
            (For well you know, all men not equal are) <lb/>
            Now play the men, there's bus'ness for you all. <lb/>
            Fear not the clamour of this threatening man ; <lb/>
            Endure this brunt, which if you overcome, <lb n="270"/>
            As (if Jove hinder not) I know you can, <lb/>
            Well course him to the gates of Ilium. <lb/>
            Thus they encouraged the Greeks. And now, <lb/>
            As when great Jove to show his armory <lb/>
            Upon a winter's day sends down his snow, <lb n="275"/>
            Innumerable are the flakes that fly <lb/>
            And cover hills, and woods, and pastures green, <lb/>
            And all the fruitful works of husbandry, <lb/>
            And cover would, but that the sea comes in, <lb/>
            Both ports and shores; for there snow cannot lie; <lb n="280"/>
            The wall with stones resounded round about, <lb/>
            Yet Hector ne'er had broken wall nor gate, <lb/>
            But by the Greeks had still been kept without, <lb/>
            Had not Jove sent, the Trojans t' animate, <lb/>
            His son Sarpedon. With his shield of brass, <lb n="285"/>
            Lined with many folds of strong cow-hide, <lb/>
            And which with golden circles strength'ned was, <lb/>
            And two spears in his hand, to th' wall he hied. <lb/>
            And as a lion that had fasted long <lb/>
            Comes from the hill upon a flock of sheep, <lb n="290"/>
            Will try what he can do, for all the throng <lb/>
            Of men and dogs that them are set to keep; <lb/>
            So boldly goes Sarpedon to the walls, <lb/>
            With mighty hand the battlements to tear, <lb/>
            And as he going was to Glaucus calls. <lb n="295"/>
            Glaucus, said he, what cause think you is there <lb/>
            That we in Lycia more honour'd are <lb/>
            Than other men, and look'd upon like Gods, <lb/>
            And higher sit at feasts, and better fare, <lb/>
            And drink best wine, and more land have by odds ? <lb n="300"/>
            Is't not because we foremost are in fight! <lb/>
            'Tis not in vain, they'll say, our princes have <lb/>
            More honour, since they are of greater might, <lb/>
            And their lives venture other men to save. <lb/>
            Glaucus, if we could death eschew and age <lb n="305"/>
            By running from the battle cowardly, <lb/>
            D'ye think I foremost would myself engage, <lb/>
            Or ever counsel you to follow me ? <lb/>
            You know the ways to death are infinite. <pb n="142"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XII. </note><note type="margin"> The fourth fight. </note> <lb/>
            Though we ne'er fight we cannot always live. <lb n="310"/>
            Therefore come on, and let us bravely fight, <lb/>
            And either honour gain, or honour give. <lb/>
            So said Sarpedon. Glaucus him obey'd ; <lb/>
            And tow'rds the Greeks well followed they went. <lb/>
            Then Mnesteus was terribly afraid, <lb n="315"/>
            For to assault his tower he saw them bent, <lb/>
            And looked about what heroes he could spy <lb/>
            On other towers unto his aid to call. <lb/>
            He saw th' Ajaxes two, and Teucer by, <lb/>
            But too far off to hear. For at the wall <lb n="320"/>
            Of shields and helmets so great thumping was, <lb/>
            That 'twas impossible to hear him call. <lb/>
            The gates resounded no less than the brass; <lb/>
            For fiercely they were fighting at 'em all. <lb/>
            Then Mnesteus to the squire, Thootes, said, <lb n="325"/>
            Run quickly, call the Ajaxes to me, <lb/>
            Both, if they can be spar'd. I am afraid <lb/>
            Against these men I shall not able be <lb/>
            To keep my place. Keen warriors they are. <lb/>
            But if they be themselves distressed there, <lb n="330"/>
            Let Telamonius of the place take care, <lb/>
            And Teucer use his bow and arrows here. <lb/>
            Thootes then unto th' Ajaxes ran <lb/>
            Along the Argive wall, and to them said, <lb/>
            Mnesteus entreats both of you, if you can, <lb n="335"/>
            To come unto his tow'r and give him aid. <lb/>
            Keen warriors, he says, these Lycians are: <lb/>
            But if you be yourselves distressed here, <lb/>
            Let Telamonius of the place take care, <lb/>
            And Teucer use his bow and arrows there. <lb n="340"/>
            This said, great Ajax said unto the less, <lb/>
            Æliades, stay here awhile, till I <lb/>
            Deliver Mnesteus from his distress. <lb/>
            That done, I shall be with you presently. <lb/>
            Ajax and Teucer then together go <lb n="345"/>
            Unto the tow'r of Mnesteus with all speed, <lb/>
            Pandion with them, carry'ng Teucer's bow, <lb/>
            And at their coming found him in great need. <lb/>
            The Lycians, like a black and low'ring cloud, <lb/>
            Ascended to the wall, and fiercely fought. <lb n="350"/>
            The Greeks resist. The noise is mighty loud. <lb/>
            And with a heavy stone stood Ajax out, <lb/>
            That two men scarce could carry, such as now <lb/>
            The earth brings forth, and with the same he stroke <lb/>
            Epicles on the helmet such a blow * <lb n="355"/>
            As head and helmet both in pieces broke. <lb/>
            Down like a diver from the wall fell he <lb/>
            Headlong, and dead upon the ground he lay. <lb/>
            At Glaucus Teucer lets an arrow flee <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            Which through his arm unarmed made its way. <note type="margin"> LIB. XII. </note><note type="margin"> The fourth fight. </note> <lb n="360"/>
            Glaucus, no longer able now to fight, <lb/>
            Leapt from the wall unseen unto the ground, <lb/>
            For fear, if of his hurt they had a sight, <lb/>
            The Greeks would make a triumph of his wound. <lb/>
            Griev'd was Sarpedon to see Glaucus gone, <lb n="365"/>
            But not so grieved but that still he fought, <lb/>
            And fix'd a heavy spear in Alcmaon, <lb/>
            And with the same his life and all pluck'd out. <lb/>
            Sarpedon then tore down a battlement, <lb/>
            And wider for the Lycians made the way. <lb n="370"/>
            But Teucer then an arrow to him sent; <lb/>
            But Jupiter, to save his son that day, <lb/>
            The shaft unto his shield and belt directed. <lb/>
            So that it passed not unto the skin, <lb/>
            The shield and belt together him protected. <lb n="375"/>
            And then, with spear in hand came Ajax in, <lb/>
            And with a push that pierc'd his shield clean through, <lb/>
            His coming on a little while he staid. <lb/>
            But with Sarpedon that could little do, <lb/>
            That honour sought. Then to his friends he said, <lb n="380"/>
            Ye Lycians, what makes ye thus remiss? <lb/>
            Can I make way unto the ships alone ? <lb/>
            Strong as I am, impossible it is. <lb/>
            For many hands much better are than one. <lb/>
            This said, the Lycians heavier than before, <lb n="385"/>
            To please their prince, upon the Argives lay. <lb/>
            The Greeks within their broken ranks restore, <lb/>
            And terrible the battle was that day. <lb/>
            For neither could the Lycians passage make <lb/>
            Unto the ships and break the Argives' wall, <lb n="390"/>
            Nor Greeks compel the Lycians to forsake <lb/>
            The battlements, so fiercely fought they all. <lb/>
            As two men on the confines of their ground <lb/>
            At two ends of a measure tugging stand, <lb/>
            Contending earnestly about their bound, <lb n="395"/>
            And each of them would fain enlarge his land: <lb/>
            So for the battlement they striving stood, <lb/>
            And wounded one another back and breast, <lb/>
            And sprinkled was the battlement with blood, <lb/>
            Nor was it certain yet who had the best. <lb n="400"/>
            But as a woman that is fain to spin, <lb/>
            To find herself and children sorry food, <lb/>
            In one scale wool, in th' other weight puts in <lb/>
            Till they hang ev'n : so ev'n the battle stood <lb/>
            Till Hector came, to whom Jove chiefly meant <lb n="405"/>
            To give the honour of the victory. <lb/>
            Then Hector up the wall the foremost went, <lb/>
            And thence unto his Trojans loud did cry, <lb/>
            Trojans, come on, and break me down this wall, <pb n="144"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XII. <lb/>
             </note> <lb/>
            And set the Argives' hollow ships on flame. <lb n="410"/>
            This said, he heard was by the Trojans all, <lb/>
            And straight unto the battlements they came. <lb/>
            Then Hector at the gate took up a stone, <lb/>
            Great and sharp pointed, two men such as now <lb/>
            Could scarce have lifted up so great a one: <lb n="415"/>
            But Hector with one hand the same could throw ; <lb/>
            For Jupiter to him had made it light. <lb/>
            And as unto a shepherd is a fleece <lb/>
            Of wool, that to be borne needs little might; <lb/>
            So eas'ly borne the stone by Hector is; <lb n="420"/>
            And standing at the gate well fortified <lb/>
            With planks well join'd, and two cross-bars within, <lb/>
            And taking with his right foot back a stride, <lb/>
            Out flew the stone, and at the gate went in. <lb/>
            The gate then roared ; the hinges broken were; <lb n="425"/>
            The bars upon the ground asunder lay; <lb/>
            And pieces of the planks flew here and there; <lb/>
            And to the ships now open was the way. <lb/>
            And Hector with a countenance like night <lb/>
            Flew in. And fire appeared in his eyes: <lb n="430"/>
            His armour as he marched shining bright, <lb/>
            And light reflected up unto the skies ; <lb/>
            And two good spears he grasped in his fist. <lb/>
            And then the Greeks were mightily afraid; <lb/>
            For none except a God could him resist. <lb n="435"/>
            And then unto the Trojans turning said, <lb/>
            Now Trojans to the wall. And presently <lb/>
            Great numbers of the Trojans that way pass, <lb/>
            And others at the gate. The Argives fly <lb/>
            Unto their ships. And great the tumult was.</p>

            He left them fighting there, and turn'd his face <lb/>
            (Thinking th' Immortals would no more have fought) <lb/>
            And looked upon the fields and men of Thrace, <lb/>
            And Mysians, and Hippomolgi (men <lb n="5"/>
            That live on milk the goodly mothers give <lb/>
            Of lusty steeds, and are more honest than <lb/>
            The rest of mortals, and do longer live.) <lb/>
            While Neptune from a hill in Samothrace <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            Look'd down and saw the Greeks and Trojans fight. <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. </note><note type="margin"> Neptune en. <lb/>
            courageth <lb/>

            For thence of Ida hill and all the space <lb/>
            'Bout Troy and th' Argive fleet he had a sight. <lb/>
            And grieved was to see the Argives slain, <lb/>
            And mightily offended was with Jove, <lb/>
            And from the hill in haste came down again <lb n="15"/>
            On foot; and ever as his feet did move, <lb/>
            Under the same the haughty mountains shook, <lb/>
            And the thick woods, and unto Ægæ came. <lb/>
            Thither to come four steps he only took. <lb/>
            There stands a temple sacred to his name, <lb n="20"/>
            Of glistering gold and never to decay. <lb/>
            And there he puts his horses to his car; <lb/>
            Long manes of gold they had, and swift were they; <lb/>
            And then in gold himself array'd for war, <lb/>
            And mounted on his car o'er sea he drives. <lb n="25"/>
            The whales on both sides from the bottom rise <lb/>
            Their king to see. The sea her bosom rives, <lb/>
            But not a drop up to the axtree flies. <lb/>
            Thus quickly to the Argives Neptune came. <lb/>
            Half way 'twixt Tenedus and Imbrus is <lb n="30"/>
            In the deep sea a cave, and in the same <lb/>
            (Lest coming back his horses he should miss) <lb/>
            He sets them up and laid before them meat, <lb/>
            And tied them there with foot-locks at their feet, <lb/>
            Strong locks of gold, that loose they could not get. <lb n="35"/>
            Then up he went unto the Argive fleet, <lb/>
            And there he found the Trojans like a flame <lb/>
            At Hector's heels with mighty noise and cry, <lb/>
            Greedy and full of hope the Greeks to tame, <lb/>
            And then in flames to make their ships to fry. <lb n="40"/>
            Then Neptune speaking to th' Ajaxes two <lb/>
            In Chalchas' shape, You two, said he, can save <lb/>
            The ships, if you but set yourselves thereto. <lb/>
            For of the foe no fear at all I have <lb/>
            In other parts. Defended they will be <lb n="45"/>
            By other Greeks. The danger all is here <lb/>
            Where Hector like a flame you leading see, <lb/>
            That would be thought the son of Jupiter. <lb/>
            If you but think some God bids you resist, <lb/>
            And stand your ground when Hector cometh on, <lb n="50"/>
            And cheer your fellows; though Jove him assist, <lb/>
            He quickly from your good ships will be gone. <lb/>
            This said, he on them both his sceptre laid, <lb/>
            And presently themselves they stronger find; <lb/>
            Their thighs and legs and hands much lighter weight <lb n="55"/>
            And Neptune suddenly rose from the ground. <lb/>
            Just as a hawk from off a rock flies at <lb/>
            Some other fowl; so quickly Neptune rose. <lb/>
            The lesser Ajax first observed that, <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. <lb/>
             </note><note type="margin"> Neptuno en­ <lb/>
            courageth <lb/>
            the Greeks. </note> <lb/>
            And to the greater did the same disclose. <lb n="60"/>
            Ajax, said he, this was some Deity <lb/>
            That in the shape of Chalchas bade us fight. <lb/>
            For 'twas not Chalchas I am sure. For I <lb/>
            As he went off had of his legs a sight, <lb/>
            And of his feet and steps. For marks there are <lb n="65"/>
            To know a God by from a man. Withal <lb/>
            I find myself much more inclin'd to war. <lb/>
            Methinks my hands and feet for battle call. <lb/>
            And so do mine, said Telamonius, <lb/>
            And fain I would with Hector have a bout. <lb n="70"/>
            While they together were discoursing thus, <lb/>
            Neptune behind them busy was about. <lb/>
            Confirming those that to the ships were gone <lb/>
            A little to refresh themselves. For they <lb/>
            Had long and painful labour undergone, <lb n="75"/>
            And heavy at their hearts the danger lay <lb/>
            When Hector and his troops had pass'd the wall, <lb/>
            And of their safety were in great despair. <lb/>
            But Neptune coming soon confirm'd them all, <lb/>
            And gave them hope their fortune to repair. <lb n="80"/>
            To Teucer first he came and Leitus, <lb/>
            To Deipyrus and to Meneleos, <lb/>
            Meriones and stout Antilochus, <lb/>
            And standing near addressed his speech to those. <lb/>
            Fie, Argives, fie young men ; what shame is this; <lb n="85"/>
            Upon your hands I chiefly did rely <lb/>
            To save our ships. If you be so remiss, <lb/>
            The day is come in which we all must die <lb/>
            By Hector's hands. 0 strange ! I never thought <lb/>
            The Trojans durst to th' ships have come so near, <lb n="90"/>
            That heretofore peep out o' th* town durst not, <lb/>
            But like to hinds that hide themselves for fear <lb/>
            Of leopards, wolves, and other beasts of prey. <lb/>
            For so at first they did. But you'll not fight <lb/>
            For anger that the king had sent away <lb n="95"/>
            Dishonoured the man of greatest might. <lb/>
            But what though Agamemnon have indeed <lb/>
            Dishonoured Thetis' son, must we therefore <lb/>
            Give over fight? Or rather with all speed <lb/>
            Endeavour all we can to cure the sore? <lb n="100"/>
            But, howsoe'er, you that excuseless are, <lb/>
            And of the Argive army all the best, <lb/>
            And bodies have and hearts well made for war, <lb/>
            I needs must reprehend you. But the rest <lb/>
            That weak or wretched are I cannot blame. <lb n="105"/>
            Fond men, this negligence may bring forth yet <lb/>
            Some greater ill. Then come away for shame. <lb/>
            For never were the Greeks so hard beset. <lb/>
            Hector has broken both the bars and gates, <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            And now hard by our ships he fiercely fights, <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. </note><note type="margin"> Neptune en. <lb/>
            courageth <lb/>
            the Greeks. </note> <lb n="110"/>
            And with great noise his Trojans animates. <lb/>
            Thus Neptune the dismayed Greeks excites. <lb/>
            At th' Ajaxes the ranks stood firm and close. <lb/>
            Nor Mars nor Pallas could a fault have spied. <lb/>
            They chosen were the Trojans to oppose <lb n="115"/>
            Whom Hector led. And standing side by side, <lb/>
            Shield shield, and target target, and man man <lb/>
            Sustain'd, and spear by spear assisted was. <lb/>
            So close they stood, and labour all they can <lb/>
            Lest Hector to their hollow ships should pass. <lb n="120"/>
            And Hector with his troops went swiftly on. <lb/>
            As when a torrent swell'd with showers of rain <lb/>
            Breaks from the hill a round and heavy stone, <lb/>
            It makes the wood resound, till at the plain, <lb/>
            Swift as it hither roll'd, it rolls no more; <lb n="125"/>
            So Hector marching made account to pass <lb/>
            Through th' Argive fleet and tents to the sea-shore. <lb/>
            But at th' Ajaxes battle stopp'd he was; <lb/>
            And forced back a little to recoil, <note type="correspondsTo" n="130"/>Resisted by so many spears and swords, <lb/>
            And speaking to his Trojans stood awhile, <lb/>
            And Lycians, and Dardans in these words. <lb/>
            Ye Trojans, Lycians, Dardans, do not fly. <lb/>
            I know they cannot long maintain the fight, <lb/>
            If we upon Jove's promise may rely, <lb n="135"/>
            Who all the other Gods excels in might. <lb/>
            This said, Deiphobus went towards the foe, <lb/>
            Holding his buckler out before him high, <lb/>
            So that it cover'd him from head to toe. <lb/>
            Meriones, that on him had his eye, <lb n="140"/>
            His spear threw at him, which no harm did do. <lb/>
            For though upon the buckler fell the stroke, <lb/>
            It carried not th' intended mischief through, <lb/>
            But in the tough bull-hides the spear he broke. <lb/>
            Then back unto the throng he went, and fum'd <lb n="145"/>
            Both for the loss of the good spear he brake, <lb/>
            And of the victory he had presumed, <lb/>
            And went to the ships another spear to take. <lb/>
            The rest fought on, and mighty noise there was. <lb/>
            There Teucer with his spear slew Imbrius <lb n="150"/>
            The son of Mentor, till the Greeks did pass <lb/>
            The sea to Troy he dwelt at Pedasus, <lb/>
            And to Medesicaste there was wed. <lb/>
            But when the Argives came to Troy, he then <lb/>
            Dwelt in King Priam's court, much honoured <lb n="155"/>
            Both by the king himself and by his men. <lb/>
            But now by Teucer's spear was slain. And as <lb/>
            Upon a hill a goodly ashen tree, <lb/>
            Unto the ground, cut from the roots with brass, <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>

            Brings down its boughs, so to the ground fell he. <lb n="160"/>
            To strip him of his arms then Teucer goes; <lb/>
            Which Hector seeing, at him threw his spear, <lb/>
            And misses him ; yet not in vain he throws, <lb/>
            But kills another man that stood him near, <lb/>
            Amphimacus, that newly to the fight <lb n="165"/>
            Was from the ships come back t' assist the rest; <lb/>
            And scarcely of the skirmish had a sight, <lb/>
            When Hector's spear he felt upon his breast. <lb/>
            Then to Amphimachus came Hector near, <lb/>
            Meaning his helmet from his head to take. <lb n="170"/>
            Which Ajax seeing, at him threw his spear <lb/>
            That hit his shield, but passage could not make. <lb/>
            Yet with such strength the spear fell on his shield, <lb/>
            That backward he was driven from the dead ; <lb/>
            So that the Argives bore them off the field. <lb n="175"/>
            Amphimachus to th' ships was carried <lb/>
            By Mnestheus and Stichius, that led <lb/>
            Th' Athenian troops. But the Ajaxes two, <lb/>
            One at the feet, another at the head, <lb/>
            Bore Imbrius from off the ground into <lb n="180"/>
            The throng of Greeks, like hungry lions two, <lb/>
            That carry in their jaws a goat which they <lb/>
            Had snatched from the dogs, and were to go <lb/>
            Through many shrubs to carry it away. <lb/>
            Him they disarm'd, and to let Hector know it, <lb n="185"/>
            The lesser Ajax cutteth off his head, <lb/>
            And turning round with all his strength doth throw it, <lb/>
            And unto Hector's feet 'twas carried. <lb/>
            Now Neptune for Amphimachus thus slain, <lb/>
            Who from his loins descended, vexed sore, <lb n="190"/>
            Went to the Argive ships and tents again <lb/>
            To cheer the Greeks, and hurt the Trojans more, <lb/>
            And with Idomeneus met as he went, <lb/>
            That had a wounded friend brought from the fight, <lb/>
            And straightway back again to go he meant <lb n="195"/>
            To them that fought, and help them all he might. <lb/>
            And Neptune like unto Andremon's son, <lb/>
            Thoas, whose father all th' iEtolians sway'd <lb/>
            Like Jove in Pleuron and in Calydon, <lb/>
            Unto Idomeneus then spake and said, <lb n="200"/>
            O king Idomeneus, what is betide <lb/>
            Of th' Argive threats that Ilium they would tame? <lb/>
            O Thoas, then Idomeneus replied, <lb/>
            I know not any man that we can blame. <lb/>
            There's none of us but understands the war, <lb n="205"/>
            Nor any that betray themselves with fear, <lb/>
            Nor that for sloth to fight unwilling are. <lb/>
            But Jove, it seems, will have us perish here. <lb/>
            But Thoas, you that always heretofore <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            Have fought so well, and set on other men, <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. </note><note type="margin"> Neptune en. <lb/>
            courageth <lb/>
            the Greeks. </note> <lb n="210"/>
            Still hold that purpose never giving o'er. <lb/>
            T' Idomeneus then Neptune said again, <lb/>
            Idomeneus, may that man ne'er come back, <lb/>
            But in the fields lie for the dogs a prey, <lb/>
            That at this time is negligent or slack. <lb n="215"/>
            But now put on your arms and come away, <lb/>
            And quickly. For although we are but two, <lb/>
            Yet since conjoined force of men not strong <lb/>
            Can do as much as one good man, let's go. <lb/>
            This said, up Neptune went into the throng. <lb n="220"/>
            Idomeneus then goes into his tent <lb/>
            And arm'd himself, and took in's hand two spears, <lb/>
            And out again he came like light'ning sent <lb/>
            To men from Jove to fill their hearts with fears. <lb/>
            And scarce came forth, he met Meriones <lb n="225"/>
            That to his tent was going for a spear, <lb/>
            And speaking to him said Idomeneus, <lb/>
            Meriones, my friend, what make you here ? <lb/>
            What are you wounded that you leave the fight ? <lb/>
            Or bring you me some news ? For I to hide <lb n="230"/>
            Myself from battle here take no delight. <lb/>
            Meriones then to him thus replied. <lb/>
            0 king Idomeneus, unto your tent <lb/>
            I forc'd was from the battle to come down, <lb/>
            And thence to take a spear of yours I meant, <lb n="235"/>
            Since on Deiphobus I broke my own. <lb/>
            A spear, then said Idomeneus, there are <lb/>
            Twenty, if you had need of them, that stand <lb/>
            Upright against the walls, which in this war <lb/>
            I took from Trojans vanquished by my hand. <lb n="240"/>
            For when I fight I stand near to the foe. <lb/>
            And that's the cause so many spears I have, <lb/>
            And can so many shields and helmets show, <lb/>
            And armours for the breast great store and brave. <lb/>
            Then spake Meriones ; And I, said he, <lb n="245"/>
            Have many spoils of Trojans at my tent, <lb/>
            But fetch'd from thence so soon they cannot be. <lb/>
            For close up to the foe I also went <lb/>
            Amongst the foremost boldly. Which although <lb/>
            The Argives take no notice of, yet you <lb n="250"/>
            That how I still behav'd myself well know, <lb/>
            Can bear me witness what I say is true. <lb/>
            To him then thus Idomeneus replied, <lb/>
            Meriones, this need not have been said; <lb/>
            I know your courage were it to be tried, <lb n="255"/>
            And men somewhere in ambush to be laid, <lb/>
            Where fear and courage are discerned best; <lb/>
            For there 'tis seen who valiant are, who not. <lb/>
            A coward's heart still panteth in his breast; <pb n="150"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. </note><note type="margin"> Neptune en. <lb/>
            courageth <lb/>
            the Greeks. </note> <lb/>
            And nothing but on death he has his thought; <lb n="260"/>
            He cannot without trembling quiet sit, <lb/>
            But dances on his hams, and changes hue; <lb/>
            And cannot hold himself upon his feet; <lb/>
            And shakes his chaps. These things a coward show. <lb/>
            But in a valiant man there'is none of this. <lb n="265"/>
            He quietly abides without alright, <lb/>
            When in the danger he engaged is ; <lb/>
            And longs for nothing but to come to fight. <lb/>
            If you amongst them had been there, I know <lb/>
            None of them such a fault in you had found. <lb n="270"/>
            Or if you had been hurt 'tis sure enow, <lb/>
            Nor in your back nor neck had been the wound, <lb/>
            But either in your belly or your breast. <lb/>
            But let's no longer talk like children here, <lb/>
            Lest we be blam'd. I think it therefore best <lb n="275"/>
            You now go to my tent and take a spear. <lb/>
            This said, Meriones fetch'd out a spear, <lb/>
            And with Idomeneus went to the fight, <lb/>
            As Mars, when in the field he will appear, <lb/>
            And with him his beloved son Affright, <lb n="280"/>
            And to th' Ephyrians and Phlegyans goes <lb/>
            From Thrace to give one side the victory ; <lb/>
            So with Idomeneus unto the foes <lb/>
            Meriones went up courageously, <lb/>
            And to him said, Idomeneus, where now <lb n="285"/>
            0' th' left or right side of the Trojan host, <lb/>
            Or in the midst shall we our force bestow <lb/>
            To help the Greeks ? For now they need us most. <lb/>
            Idomeneus then to him said again, <lb/>
            The middle of the battle to maintain <lb n="290"/>
            There ready stand enow, and able men, <lb/>
            Teucer good bowman and th' Ajaxes twain. <lb/>
            Hector shall there of fighting have his fill, <lb/>
            As greedy as he is. Though strong he be, <lb/>
            He'll find it hard that way to have his will, <lb n="295"/>
            And come unto the ships with victory, <lb/>
            And burn them, if Jove not with his own hand <lb/>
            Throw in the brands. He must be more than man, <lb/>
            Whom Ajax is not able to withstand ; <lb/>
            Not mortal, such as live by Ceres can, <lb n="300"/>
            And may be killed with a spear or stone. <lb/>
            For Ajax with Achilles may compare <lb/>
            In standing fight, though able less to run. <lb/>
            In that, Achilles him excelleth far. <lb/>
            But now unto the battle let us go, <lb n="305"/>
            And fall on at the left side of the field, <lb/>
            And try what we are able there to do, <lb/>
            And either honour win or honour yield. <lb/>
            This said, they went together to the fight, <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            And on them presently the Trojans fell. <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. </note><note type="margin"> Neptune en­ <lb/>
            courageth <lb/>
            the Greeks. </note> <lb n="310"/>
            There was no place tor victory to light, <lb/>
            So close they fought on both sides and so well. <lb/>
            And such a mighty cloud of dust they raise, <lb/>
            As, when great winds contend upon the plain, <lb/>
            Is in dry weather raised from the ways; <lb n="315"/>
            While one to kill another takes great pain. <lb/>
            And horrid of the squadrons was the sight, <lb/>
            That bristled was all over with great spears. <lb/>
            Their armours, shields, and helmets, with their light <lb/>
            Dazzled the eyes, and clamour fill'd the ears. <lb n="320"/>
            Hard-hearted had he been that with dry eyes <lb/>
            Had this affliction of the heroes seen, <lb/>
            That from the sons of Saturn did arise, <lb/>
            And but for their dissention had not been : <lb/>
            For Jupiter for Hector was and Troy, <lb n="325"/>
            And meant to honour Thetis and her son ; <lb/>
            But not th' Achæan army to destroy. <lb/>
            But Neptune moved with compassion <lb/>
            To see the Argives by the Trojans slain, <lb/>
            And angry with his brother, secretly <lb n="330"/>
            In likeness of a man rose from the main <lb/>
            T' encourage them and give them victory. <lb/>
            Though they were brothers, yet Jove of the two <lb/>
            The elder and the wiser was, so that <lb/>
            Neptune against Jove's will durst nothing do <lb n="335"/>
            In favour of the Greeks distress'd, but what <lb/>
            He thought might be effected privily. <lb/>
            And thus the saw, from brother unto brother, <lb/>
            Of cruel war was drawn alternately, <lb/>
            And many slain of one side and the other. <lb n="340"/>
            And now half gray came in Idomeneus <lb/>
            With lusty Cretans, and the Trojan frighted. <lb/>
            For presently he slew Othryoneus, <lb/>
            Othryoneus that was by fame invited <lb/>
            To purchase honour in the war at Troy, <lb n="345"/>
            And promis'd, if Cassandra he might wed, <lb/>
            From Ilium to drive the Greeks away. <lb/>
            Which Priam to him granted if he sped. <lb/>
            And in this hope, strutting he went to fight. <lb/>
            There with his spear Idomeneus him smote. <lb n="350"/>
            The spear upon his belly just did light, <lb/>
            And down he fell ; his armour sav'd him not. <lb/>
            Idomeneus, insulting o'er him, spake: <lb/>
            Othryoneus, great praise you'll win indeed, <lb/>
            If you can do what you did undertake. <lb n="355"/>
            Come fight for us, and you shall no worse speed. <lb/>
            For if you for us win the town of Troy, <lb/>
            Atrides' fairest daughter yours shall be. <lb/>
            Come with me to the Greeks, that there we may <pb n="152"/>

            Upon the wedding articles agree. <lb n="360"/>
            And then to be reveng'd Asius meant, <lb/>
            And was on foot, although his horses there, <lb/>
            Breathing upon his back, behind him went. <lb/>
            And at Idomeneus had thrown his spear, <lb/>
            But that to throw he time enough had not; <lb n="365"/>
            Because the other made the greater haste, <lb/>
            And with his spear had hit him in the throat, <lb/>
            And out again at's neck the point had pass'd. <lb/>
            And there, as some great oak or poplar tree, <lb/>
            Or pine cut down, that by a ship-wright must <lb n="370"/>
            Be saw'd in planks, falls down, so fell down he, <lb/>
            Grasping with both his hands the bloody dust. <lb/>
            The charioteer was so amaz'd thereat, <lb/>
            That he forgot to turn his car with fear, <lb/>
            And quiet sat. Antilochus saw that, <lb n="375"/>
            And going nearer, at him threw his spear, <lb/>
            Which through his armour and his belly went, <lb/>
            And gasping, fell to th' ground the charioteer. <lb/>
            Antilochus to the ships his horses sent, <lb/>
            And by the Argives now possess'd they were. <lb n="380"/>
            And then Deiphobus himself advanced <lb/>
            And at Idomeneus he threw his spear, <lb/>
            Which, grazing only on his buckler, glanc'd <lb/>
            Unto the Argives that behind him were. <lb/>
            For as he saw it come, he sunk and hid <lb n="385"/>
            His body all under his shield of brass. <lb/>
            Yet not from out his hand depart it did <lb/>
            In vain ; for with it slain Hypsenor was. <lb/>
            Deiphobus then crowing said, So, so, <lb/>
            Asius goes not unreveng'd to hell. <lb n="390"/>
            And though the place unpleasant be, I know <lb/>
            To have such company will please him well. <lb/>
            Antilochus then to the body came, <lb/>
            And kept the Trojans off from stripping it. <lb/>
            Mecistes and Alastor bore the same <lb n="395"/>
            Upon their shoulders to the Argive fleet. <lb/>
            Idomeneus still like a fury went <lb/>
            To kill more Trojans, or himself be kill'd. <lb/>
            And for the Argives thought his life well spent. <lb/>
            Aloathous then met him on the field, <lb n="400"/>
            Who was a suitor to Hippodamie, <lb/>
            Anchises' eldest daughter, and the best <lb/>
            Beloved by her parents both was she, <lb/>
            And of her time exceeded all the rest <lb/>
            In beauty, and in curious work, and wit, <lb n="405"/>
            And a fit consort for the best of Troy. <lb/>
            But Neptune now on purpose bound his feet, <lb/>
            And from his eyes, though bright, took sight away, <lb/>
            So that he could not fly, nor turn, nor fight, <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            But fixed stood, like to a post or tree ; <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. <lb/>

            And by Idomeneus, with Neptune's might, <lb/>
            Pierced through the armour and the breast was he, <lb/>
            And through the heart, as plainly did appear. <lb/>
            For as he bleeding on the ground did lie, <lb/>
            The beating of his heart did shake the spear ; <lb n="415"/>
            And Mars took from him all his chivalry. <lb/>
            Idomeneus then crowed mightily. <lb/>
            Deiphobus, said he, is't not enough <lb/>
            That for your one man I have killed three ? <lb/>
            If not, come on, and take a better proof <lb n="420"/>
            Of what the seed of Jove in war can do. <lb/>
            For Jove got Minos, and Deucalion he. <lb/>
            He me, and I whole shiploads bring of woe <lb/>
            To Troy, unto thy father, and to thee. <lb/>
            This said, Deiphobus considered <lb n="425"/>
            Whether to stay and meet him hand to hand, <lb/>
            Or see by whom he might be seconded. <lb/>
            And at the rear he saw Æneas stand. <lb/>
            For he not much good will did Priam bear, <lb/>
            Who small respect unto his virtue paid. <lb n="430"/>
            To him Deiphobus approaching near, <lb/>
            AEneas, now, said he, you must us aid. <lb/>
            Your brother-law, Alcathous, is kill'd, <lb/>
            Who oftentimes has fed you with his hand, <lb/>
            And naked will be left upon the field <lb n="435"/>
            B' Idomeneus, unless you him withstand. <lb/>
            This said, t' Idomeneus they came away, <lb/>
            And with him greedy were to enter fight. <lb/>
            And he as boldly did their coming stay ; <lb/>
            Though two to one, they did not him affright. <lb n="440"/>
            But as a boar in unfrequented place, <lb/>
            By dogs and men pursu'd, stands sullenly, <lb/>
            Knowing his strength, and looks them in the face, <lb/>
            Bristled his back, and flaming is his eye ; <lb/>
            So for AEneas staid Idomeneus, <lb n="445"/>
            And to his fellows call'd; Ascalaphus, <lb/>
            Meriones, Antilochus, and Aphareus, <lb/>
            Good men of war, and you, Deipyrus, <lb/>
            Come hither friends, said he. I coming see <lb/>
            Æneas towards me with mighty rage, <lb n="450"/>
            A valiant man at arms you know is he, <lb/>
            And now is in the flower of his age. <lb/>
            Were I so young, and of the mind I am, <lb/>
            I'd honour win of him or he of me. <lb/>
            This said, they quickly all about him came <lb n="455"/>
            AEneas to repel or kill. Then he <lb/>
            Call'd Paris to him, and Agenor, and <lb/>
            Deiphobus, the Argives to oppose, <lb/>
            And all of them of Trojans had command, <pb n="154"/>

            And with their spears behind him marched close. <lb n="460"/>
            As when a shepherd leads with a green bough <lb/>
            His sheep from off the pasture to the brook, <lb/>
            Is joy'd to see them follow him; so now <lb/>
            Æneas in his troops great pleasure took. <lb/>
            No sooner they were come unto the ground <lb n="465"/>
            Whereon Alcathous his body was, <lb/>
            But close they fought, and hideous was the sound <lb/>
            Of helmets, shields, and mighty arms of brass. <lb/>
            And there the two that far excell'd the rest, <lb/>
            Æneas and Idomeneus, would fain <lb n="470"/>
            Have fix'd their spears in one another's breast. <lb/>
            First threw AEneas, but he threw in vain, <lb/>
            For by Idomeneus declin'd it was, <lb/>
            And coming to the ground stuck trembling there. <lb/>
            And then threw he and killed Œnomaus, <lb n="475"/>
            And pierced was his belly with a spear, <lb/>
            Who falling filled both his hands with dust. <lb/>
            Idomeneus pull'd out again his spear, <lb/>
            But to take off his arms he durst not trust <lb/>
            Himself, so many lances flying were. <lb n="480"/>
            His limbs and feet not supple were and light <lb/>
            To throw or shun a spear. They now were past <lb/>
            Their best, yet good were in a standing fight, <lb/>
            But could not from the battle run so fast. <lb/>
            And as he slowly walked off the field, <lb n="485"/>
            Deiphobus, that always bore him spite, <lb/>
            A spear threw at him, but him miss'd, and kill'd <lb/>
            Ascalaphus, son of the God of fight, <lb/>
            And on his hands into the dust fell he. <lb/>
            But Mars yet knew not that his son was dead, <lb n="490"/>
            For in the golden clouds, by Jove's decree, <lb/>
            With all the other Gods prohibited <lb/>
            To meddle in the battle, quiet sat. <lb/>
            About Ascalaphus the strife was all, <lb/>
            And first Deiphobus his helmet gat, <lb n="495"/>
            But fore'd he was again to let it fall, <lb/>
            For in the arm he then received a wound, <lb/>
            Which by Meriones was to him sent, <lb/>
            Who quickly took the helmet from the ground, <lb/>
            And with it back unto the Argives went. <lb n="500"/>
            Deiphobus was by Polites (who <lb/>
            His brother was) borne forth unto his car, <lb/>
            And bleeding in his car the town into. <lb/>
            But still upon the field went on the war, <lb/>
            And Aphareus there wounded in the throat <lb n="505"/>
            Was by AEneas' spear, wherewith his head <lb/>
            On one side hanging, shield and helmet brought <lb/>
            Down with him to the earth. There lay he dead. <lb/>
            And Thoon by Antilochus was slain, <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            That to him turn'd his back and meant to fly; <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. <lb/>

            couragt'th <lb/>

            For by the spear in two was cut the vein <lb/>
            Which all along the back to th' neck doth lie, <lb/>
            And down he fell. Antilochus stepp'd in <lb/>
            To strip him ; but the foes about him round <lb/>
            Threw at him spears, but never touch'd his skin, <lb n="515"/>
            Although his shield received many a wound. <lb/>
            For he was well defended on each side <lb/>
            By Neptune, who unto him bore good will, <lb/>
            Because he ne'er would from the fight abide, <lb/>
            And 'mongst the foes his spear was flying still. <lb n="520"/>
            But as his spear at one he aiming stood, <lb/>
            He by Asiades observed was, <lb/>
            Who to him came, as near as well he could, <lb/>
            And threw his spear, whereof one half did pass <lb/>
            Clean through Antilochus his shield, and stuck <lb n="525"/>
            Therein; but th' other half fell to the ground, <lb/>
            For Neptune him preserv'd from that ill luck. <lb/>
            So 'scap'd Antilochus without a wound. <lb/>
            And Adamas retir'd into the rout, <lb/>
            Meriones sent after him a spear, <lb n="530"/>
            Which entering at his hinder parts, came out <lb/>
            Beneath his navel, and above his gear, <lb/>
            Where wounds most fatal are. Then down he falls, <lb/>
            And like a cow that by the horns is tied <lb/>
            By strength of swains, a little while he sprawls, <lb n="535"/>
            But with the plucking out the spear he died. <lb/>
            And then the son of Priam, Helenus, <lb/>
            With a broad sword in hand, all steel of Thrace, <lb/>
            Upon the helmet smote Deipyrus, <lb/>
            Who there fell down and died upon the place. <lb n="540"/>
            The Greeks took up the helmet at their feet; <lb/>
            And griev'd thereat was Menelaus so, <lb/>
            That up he went with Helenus to meet, <lb/>
            Shaking his spear. The other draws his bow, <lb/>
            And on the breast-plate hit was Menelaus; <lb n="545"/>
            But off the arrow flew, like chaff which fann'd <lb/>
            Is from the corn. But th' other wounded was, <lb/>
            Just where he held the bow, quite through the hand, <lb/>
            And dragging hand and spear, himself withdrew <lb/>
            Into the Trojan troops; where from the wound <lb n="550"/>
            The heavy spear his friend Agenor drew, <lb/>
            And in a woollen bandage wrapp'd it round, <lb/>
            Which in his hand a servant held hard by. <lb/>
            And then Pisandrus went to Menelaus, <lb/>
            Betray'd thereto by cruel destiny, <lb n="555"/>
            For to have slain him in great hope he was, <lb/>
            And when they were to one another nigh, <lb/>
            First Menelaus threw his spear, but wide. <lb/>
            At him Pisandrus then his spear lets fly; <pb n="156"/>

            Beneath the brazen point in twain it crack'd. <lb/>
            Then to him with his sword went Menelaus, <lb/>
            And he to Menelaus with an ax, <lb/>
            Which cover'd with his buckler ready was, <lb/>
            And on his helmet crest then fell the stroke; <lb n="565"/>
            But he Pisandrus with his keen sword hit <lb/>
            Upon the forehead near the nose, which broke <lb/>
            The bone, and carried present death with it; <lb/>

            Atrides kick'd him as o' th' ground he lay, <lb n="570"/>
            Then stripp'd him of his arms, and o'er him stood, <lb/>
            Insulting and reproaching those of Troy. <lb/>
            Thus, thus, said he, proud Trojans, you'll at last <lb/>
            Be taught to quit our ships, and have your fill <lb/>
            Of bloody war, and pay for what is past. <lb n="575"/>
            You thought, ye dogs, too little was the ill, <lb/>
            Against the laws of hospitality <lb/>
            To steal away my goods, and wedded wife; <lb/>
            But further will (if in your pow'r it lie) <lb/>
            Deprive the Argive princes all of life, <lb n="580"/>
            And burn their ships, although no injury <lb/>
            I ever did you. But I hope ye shall <lb/>
            Your greediness of fighting satisfy. <lb/>
            But father Jove, who, men say, art of all <lb/>
            The Gods most wise, all this proceeds from you, <lb n="585"/>
            That to the Trojans, false and insolent, <lb/>
            More favour shew than to the just and true; <lb/>
            So that with peace they never are content. <lb/>
            Of everything there is satiety. <lb/>
            Of sleep, of love, of dance, and pleasant song, <lb n="590"/>
            And all men else with war may cloyed be: <lb/>
            Only the Trojans still for fighting long. <lb/>
            This said, the armour to the ships he sent, <lb/>
            And 'mongst the foremost Greeks again he fought. <lb/>
            And there Harpalion unto him went <lb n="595"/>
            (Who t' Ilium was by his father brought, <lb/>
            But brought from thence again he never was) <lb/>
            And at him throws his spear, and hits his shield <lb/>
            Right in the midst; but through it could not pass, <lb/>
            The stubborn brass unto it would not yield. <lb n="600"/>
            Missing his purpose, he the field forsook, <lb/>
            And fearing to be slain, look'd still about <lb/>
            Until an arrow keen him overtook, <lb/>
            Sent from Meriones, that passed throughout <lb/>
            From buttock unto bladder. Then he sat <lb n="605"/>
            Expiring 'mongst the Trojans, his good friends, <lb/>
            And lay like to a worm benumbed, that <lb/>
            Upon the ground itself at length extends. <lb/>
            The Paphlagonians of him had a care, <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            And, sorry for him, carried him to Troy. <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. </note><note type="margin"> Neptune en­ <lb/>

            His father weeping followed the car, <lb/>
            But how to be revenged saw no way. <lb/>
            And Paris then with anger was possest, <lb/>
            And 'mongst the Argives lets an arrow fly, <lb/>
            For of Harpalion he had been the guest, <lb n="615"/>
            And well received in Paphlagonie. <lb/>
            Amongst the Argives one Euchenor was, <lb/>
            The son of Polydus, an aged prophet, <lb/>
            That knew full well how things would come to pass <lb/>
            Before the town of Troy, and told him of it. <lb n="620"/>
            You must, said he, at home by sickness die, <lb/>
            Or going with the Greeks, at Troy be slain. <lb/>
            But for all that the young man valiantly <lb/>
            Went with the Greeks; but ne'er came home again, <lb/>
            Though he behav'd himself with caution there, <lb n="625"/>
            In hope t' avoid both danger and diseases. <lb/>
            But Paris shot him 'twixt the cheek and ear, <lb/>
            And on his eyes there death and darkness seizes. <lb/>
            Thus keenly fought they here; but Hector yet <lb/>
            Knew not the Trojans that were fighting at <lb n="630"/>
            The left hand of the host were so beset, <lb/>
            For if he had perhaps been told of that, <lb/>
            He might have given the Greeks the victory; <lb/>
            Such courage Neptune gave unto them there. <lb/>
            And sometimes by his strength immediately <lb n="635"/>
            In battle fighting they assisted were. <lb/>
            But Hector yet was where he first made way, <lb/>
            Breaking the Argive ranks, and wall, and gate, <lb/>
            Where of Protesilaus the good ships lay, <lb/>
            And those of Ajax next unto them sate; <lb n="640"/>
            Where low the wall and sharpest was the fight. <lb/>
            Th* Epeians, Pthians, and Ionians, <lb/>
            Bœotians, Locrians, all oppose their might <lb/>
            To Hector's Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, <lb/>
            And led were by good men. Th' Athenians <lb n="645"/>
            By Menestheus, Bias, Phidas, Stichius. <lb/>
            Meges the leading had of th' Epians, <lb/>
            And with him Amphion and Dracius. <lb/>
            Medon and Meneptolemus brought on <lb/>
            The Pthians. Medon was Ajax's brother, <lb n="650"/>
            And of Oileus the natural son, <lb/>
            Not gotten by his wife, but by another. <lb/>
            His wife was call'd Eriopis. And he <lb/>
            For killing of her brother forced fled, <lb/>
            To save himself, to th' town of Phylacie, <lb n="655"/>
            Where Meneptolemus was born and bred. <lb/>
            And so the Phthian leaders were these two, <lb/>
            And 'mongst the chief of the Bœotians, sought <lb/>
            To keep the Trojans from approaching to <pb n="158"/>

            But Ajax the swift, son of CEleus, <lb/>
            Not all this while departed from the side <lb/>
            Of Ajax, son of Telamonius, <lb/>
            But as two oxen which the ground divide <lb/>
            Go tugging of the plough with one consent, <lb n="665"/>
            Till underneath their horns their foreheads sweat, <lb/>
            So labouring in the field together went <lb/>
            Yok'd, both the little Ajax and the great. <lb/>
            But Telamonius was followed <lb/>
            With good companions, who, when there was cause, <lb n="670"/>
            His mighty buckler for him carried. <lb/>
            The other destitute of followers was, <lb/>
            For none but Locrians to the war he led, <lb/>
            Who have no use of bucklers when they fight, <lb/>
            Nor spears, nor helmets, that defend the head; <lb n="675"/>
            But came to Troy with bows and arrows light, <lb/>
            And in a standing fight durst not abide. <lb/>
            But from behind the Argive ranks unseen, <lb/>
            They Hector and his Trojans terrified <lb/>
            Incessantly with showers of arrows keen, <lb n="680"/>
            Whilst from the front with spears they plagued were. <lb/>
            The Trojans' courage then was so allay'd, <lb/>
            That into Troy they all had run for fear, <lb/>
            But that Polydamas to Hector said, <lb/>
            Hector, you are a man uncounselable. <lb n="685"/>
            Because in deeds of arms you so excel, <lb/>
            You think yourself in counsel too much able, <lb/>
            As if all virtues must in one man dwell. <lb/>
            The Gods to some have given well to fight, <lb/>
            And others with the muses they have graced; <lb n="690"/>
            Others with dance the people to delight; <lb/>
            And in the mind of others wisdom placed, <lb/>
            The fruit whereof by many is enjoy'd: <lb/>
            It cities saves, as they that have it know, <lb/>
            Which quickly would without it be destroyed, <lb n="695"/>
            But what we are to do I'll tell you now. <lb/>
            The war now lieth only on your hand; <lb/>
            For since we pass'd the wall, some quite give o'er, <lb/>
            And armed as they were do idle stand, <lb/>
            And th' enemy than ours that fight are more. <lb n="700"/>
            Therefore retire, and call the princes hither, <lb/>
            That it may be determined by them all, <lb/>
            Upon mature deliberation, whether <lb/>
            Upon the Argives at their ships to fall <lb/>
            (If so it please the Gods) or otherwise, <lb n="705"/>
            Since Ajax there resolved is to stay, <lb/>
            How with most safety we may hence arise, <lb/>
            For they are in our debt for yesterday. <lb/>
            So said Polydamas, and Hector thought <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            The counsel not amiss, and straight obey'd. <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. <lb/>

            And armed from his chariot leapt out, <lb/>
            And standing on the ground unto him said, <lb/>
            Polydamas, stay you, and here detain <lb/>
            The Trojan chiefs, while to the fight I go, <lb/>
            And give some orders there; I shall again <lb n="715"/>
            Be with you quickly, when I have done so. <lb/>
            He miss'd Deiphobus, and Helenus, <lb/>
            And valiant Adamas, Asiades, <lb/>
            And Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, <lb/>
            And went about the field to look for these; <lb n="720"/>
            Of which some wounded were retir'd to Troy, <lb/>
            And some in battle by the Argives kill'd; <lb/>
            But found his brother Paris in his way, <lb/>
            Encouraging his men upon the field, <lb/>
            And spake unto him, in ill language, thus: <lb n="725"/>
            Unlucky Paris, fine man, lover keen, <lb/>
            Where are Deiphobus, and Helenus, <lb/>
            And Adam8s ? Where are they to be seen ? <lb/>
            And what is of Othryoneus become ? <lb/>
            And where is Asius? Now certainly <lb n="730"/>
            Down to the ground burnt will be Ilium, <lb/>
            And thou a miserable death wilt die. <lb/>
            So Hector said, and Paris thus replied: <lb/>
            Hector, there was for such words now no cause. <lb/>
            Sometimes perhaps you may me justly chide. <lb n="735"/>
            I do not think a coward born I was, <lb/>
            For since unto the ships you brought the war, <lb/>
            We with the Greeks perpetually have fought. <lb/>
            But those you miss slain by the Argives are, <lb/>
            Save that Deiphobus was carried out, <lb n="740"/>
            And Helenus, both wounded in the hand. <lb/>
            Now lead us on to what part you think fit; <lb/>
            We ready are to do what you command, <lb/>
            As far as strength of body will permit. <lb/>
            This said, his brother reconciled was, <lb n="745"/>
            And both went to where cruelly they fought. <lb/>
            About Cebriones, Polydamas, <lb/>
            Orthæus, Polyphcetes, and about <lb/>
            Phalces and Palmes, and the children two, <lb/>
            Ascanius, Moris, of Hippotion, <lb n="750"/>
            Who Ilium but the day before came to, <lb/>
            And now to th' battle went by Jove set on. <lb/>
            As when a storm of wind falls on the plain, <lb/>
            The sea erects itself in ridges white, <lb/>
            And foaming rolls in order on the main ; <lb n="755"/>
            So to the Greeks, with helmets shining bright, <lb/>
            The Trojans one another followed <lb/>
            In order with their captains to the fight, <lb/>
            And Hector, like another Mars, at th' head, <pb n="160"/>

            coiirageth <lb/>
            the Greeks. </note> <lb/>
            With buckler round and strong, and armour bright. <lb n="760"/>
            His buckler he before him held far out, <lb/>
            That cover'd was his body with the same, <lb/>
            And peeping under it he look'd about, <lb/>
            And in that posture to the Argives came. <lb/>
            And at the foremost ranks went here and there <lb n="765"/>
            To try if through them he could passage make; <lb/>
            But fast they stood, nor at it troubled were; <lb/>
            And Ajax seeing it, unto him spake, <lb/>
            Come nearer, man. Why think you to affright <lb/>
            The Greeks ? We are not so unus'd to war. <lb n="770"/>
            Nor are we driven hither by your might; <lb/>
            But by the hand of Jove afflicted are. <lb/>
            Hector, I know, to burn our ships you think; <lb/>
            But we have hands as good the ships to save, <lb/>
            And Troy will first, I think, int' ashes sink. <lb n="775"/>
            And shortly, I believe, you'll wish to have <lb/>
            And pray to Jove and all the pow'rs on high <lb/>
            For horses that run faster than hawks fly, <lb/>
            That from the ships you may go speedily. <lb/>
            This said, an eagle dexter presently <lb n="780"/>
            Flew over them. And they Jove's prodigy <lb/>
            Received gladly with a mighty cry. <lb/>
            Then thus to Ajax Hector did reply. <lb/>
            Ajax, you love to prate and brag and lie. <lb/>
            0 that the son of Jove as sure were I, <lb n="785"/>
            And had been certainly conceived by <lb/>
            Juno, Jove's wife, and as a Deity <lb/>
            Like Pallas and Apollo ne'er to die, <lb/>
            As I am sure great woe will fall this day <lb/>
            Upon the Argives all and then be kill'd, <lb n="790"/>
            If for the coming of my spear thou stay, <lb/>
            And dogs and kites shall eat thee in the field. <lb/>
            This said, he led away. The Trojans shout, <lb/>
            So do the Argives, and resolv'd to try <lb/>
            The power of their foes with courage stout. <lb n="795"/>
            The noise on both sides went up to the sky.</p>

          <p>Now Nestor with Macaon drinking sat, <lb/>
            And heard the Greeks and Trojans fighting roar, <lb/>
            And to him said : Macaon, hear you that ? <lb/>
            The noise is greater much than 'twas before. <lb/>

            And Thrasymedes, his son, took up his, <lb n="10"/>
            And with a good sharp spear went to the field ; <lb/>
            And going forth, a shameful sight he sees, <lb/>
            The Trojans chasing, while the Argives fly, <lb/>
            And down unto the ground was torn their wall. <lb/>
            And then, as when a wave is raised high <lb n="15"/>

            Until some certain and prevailing wind <lb/>
            Commandeth in the air : so Nestor stood, <lb/>
            And with two thoughts distracted was his mind. <lb/>
            Sometimes to go t' Atrides he thought good, <lb n="20"/>
            And sometimes to the battle. But at last <lb/>
            Resolved, unto Agamemnon goes, <lb/>
            Whilst shields and helmets, all the way he past, <lb/>
            Resounded in his ears with frequent blows. <lb/>
            And as he went, the wounded chiefs he met, <lb n="25"/>
            Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed. <lb/>
            For far off from the fight the ships were set, <lb/>
            And close unto the shore lay at a head. <lb/>
            Only the foremost haul'd were to the plain, <lb/>
            And close astern of those was built the wall. <lb n="30"/>
            For with so many ships they cross'd the main, <lb/>
            That near the field they could not place them all. <lb/>
            But side-by-side along the shore they lay, <lb/>
            And took up all the compass of the bay. <lb/>
            The wounded men, to look upon the fray, <lb n="35"/>
            Help'd by their spears, went softly on the way, <lb/>
            Griev'd at the heart, and met with Nestor there, <lb/>
            Who, with his coming, made them more afraid. <lb/>
            And when unto them Nestor was come near, <lb/>
            Then Agamemnon spake, and to him said : <lb n="40"/>
            O Nestor, glory of the Argive nation, <lb/>
            I am afraid that Hector will make good <lb/>
            That which he promised once in his oration, <lb/>
            Before the Trojans, when he boasting stood. <lb/>
            I never will to Troy come back, said he, <lb n="45"/>
            Till I have slain these Greeks, and set on fire <lb/>
            Their ships. And now performed it will be. <lb/>
            Oh, strange ! Do all the other Greeks conspire <lb/>
            Against me with Achilles, Thetis' son, <lb/>
            And therefore are resolved not to fight ? <lb n="50"/>
            'Tis plain, said Nestor, some such thing is done, <lb/>
            Else Jove himself could not with all his might <lb/>
            Have made such work. The wall is broken down, <lb/>

            Nor could it be observed on which side <lb/>
            The Greeks that fighting were, were most distrest, <lb/>
            So thick to th' ground in ev'ry part they fall. <lb/>
            But let's consult what course to take were best, <lb/>
            If counsel can do any thing at all. <lb n="60"/>
            But that we all should fight I'll not advise. <lb/>
            For what can wounded men in battle do ? <lb/>
            To Nestor, Agamemnon then replies,- <lb/>
            Nestor, since now the war is brought unto <lb/>
            Our ships, and that, nor wall, nor trench does good, <lb n="65"/>
            And much the Argives suffer'd have who thought <lb/>
            Their wall for all the Trojans would have stood, <lb/>
            And all our hopes built on it come to nought. <lb/>
            For though I know Jove once was to us kind, <lb/>
            Yet now I see our ruin he designs, <lb n="70"/>
            And pleasure takes in changing of his mind, <lb/>
            And aids the Trojans whilst our hands he binds. <lb/>
            Let's all to what I saying am agree. <lb/>
            The ships that nearest lie to the sea-side, <lb/>
            Drawn down into the water let them be, <lb n="75"/>
            And there till night let them at anchor ride. <lb/>
            And if the Trojans then give over fight, <lb/>
            Well fetch away the rest. For 'tis less shame <lb/>
            A danger to eschew, although by night, <lb/>
            Than needlessly to perish in the same. <lb n="80"/>
            Ulysses frowning on him then replied : <lb/>
            Atrides, what a word have you let fall ? <lb/>
            You ought of cowards to have been the guide, <lb/>
            And not of us Achæans general. <lb/>
            For we by Jove are fram'd for actions high, <lb n="85"/>
            And to achieve the wars we undertake, <lb/>
            How dangerous soever, or to die. <lb/>
            And must we now the siege of Troy forsake, <lb/>
            And after so much labour lost go hence ? <lb/>
            Peace ! let no other Greek hear what you say. <lb n="90"/>
            Who would have said this that had common sense, <lb/>
            And whom so great an army did obey ? <lb/>
            Nor is, in how to fly, your counsel right. <lb/>
            Must we our ships draw down from off the shore, <lb/>
            And at the same time with the Trojans fight, <lb n="95"/>
            Who now rejoice, but would do then much more, <lb/>
            And we that fight be utterly destroyed ? <lb/>
            For they that were at anchor on the main <lb/>
            Would go their way the danger to avoid. <lb/>
            Thus by your counsel we should all be slain. <lb n="100"/>
            Atrides to him then this answer gave : <lb/>
            Ulysses, your reproof is very smart ; <lb/>
            Yet not command but counsel 'twas I gave, <lb/>
            And better I would hear with all my heart. <lb/>

            Amongst you all the youngest man I be, <lb/>
            Be not offended with it. For you know <lb/>
            That born I am of a good family. <lb/>
            For Portheus three worthy sons begat, <lb/>
            In Calydon and Pleuron they all dwelled; <lb n="110"/>
            Melas, and Agrius, and CEneus, that <lb/>
            The other two in deeds of arms excelled. <lb/>
            Of him my father, Tydeus, was the son, <lb/>
            But in exile at Argos led his life, <lb/>
            And of Adrastus' daughters married one, <lb n="115"/>
            And great possessions had he with his wife; <lb/>
            And there a rich and noble house did keep. <lb/>
            For corn, and wine, and fruit he had much ground, <lb/>
            And in his pastures had great store of sheep, <lb/>
            And chiefly was for chivalry renown'd. <lb n="120"/>
            Therefore, my counsel, if you find it good, <lb/>
            You should not for my person take amiss, I <lb/>
            Since I dare fight and am of noble blood. <lb/>
            The counsel I shall give you now is this : <lb/>
            Let ev'ry man unto the battle go, <lb n="125"/>
            And place the wounded out o'th' reach o'th' shot, <lb/>
            That they encourage may against the foe, <lb/>
            Those discontented men that fight would not. <lb/>
            This said, they went together to the fight, <lb/>
            Which, Neptune spying, did not idle stand, <lb n="130"/>
            But, like unto an aged man in sight, <lb/>
            Came in, and took Atrides by the hand. <lb/>
            Achilles' heart, said he, now leaps to see <lb/>
            The slaughter of the Argives, and the flight, <lb/>
            And joys therein, so little wit has he. <lb n="135"/>
            May death and shame upon him for it light! <lb/>
            Atrides, do not all the Gods mistrust, <lb/>
            For sure I am you'll aided be by some, <lb/>
            And see the Trojans fill the air with dust, <lb/>
            As from your ships they fly to Ilium. <lb n="140"/>
            This said, amongst the Greeks he went about, <lb/>
            And loud, as if nine or ten thousand men <lb/>
            Together on a plain had made a shout, <lb/>
            lie shouted, and the Greeks took heart again. <lb/>
            Now Juno standing on Olympus high, <lb n="145"/>
            Her brother 'mongst the Argives saw with joy, <lb/>
            And Jove on Ida with an angry eye ; <lb/>
            And in her mind consid'ring was which way <lb/>
            To cozen him. And was resolv'd, at last, <lb/>
            To go to Ida to him finely drest, <lb n="150"/>
            And after she had by him been embrac'd, <lb/>
            To bind him fast, in gentle sleep to rest. <lb/>
            Then went she to her chamber, which her son <lb/>

            And fast she lock'd the door, and there alone <lb/>
            She with ambrosia cleans'd her dainty skin, <lb/>
            Till not a speck unmeet was left thereon. <lb n="160"/>

            And with gold buttons button'd at her breast. <lb/>
            A hundred tassels at her girdle hung. <lb/>
            And wore a precious pendant at her ear <lb n="170"/>
            Of three rich gems. And over all she flung <lb/>
            A dainty scarf, by which they cover'd were. <lb/>
            Then on her tender feet she tied her shoes. <lb/>
            And when herself she fully had arrayed <lb/>
            From out her chamber presently she goes, <lb n="175"/>
            And Venus took aside and to her said, <lb/>
            Sweet child, I come a favour to request; <lb/>
            But tell me, will you grant it, yea or nay. <lb/>
            I fear you bear me ill will in your breast, <lb/>
            'Cause I for th' Argives am, and you for Troy. <lb n="180"/>
            And Venus to her answer made and said, <lb/>
            Juno, Jove's sister, do not from me hide <lb/>
            Your mind, which to my power shall be obey'd. <lb/>
            Juno to Venus then again replied, <lb/>
            Lend me Desire and Love, by which you tame <lb n="185"/>
            Both mortal men and the immortal Gods. <lb/>
            For to Oceanus I going am, <lb/>
            And Tethys, far from hence, that are at odds. <lb/>
            For when beneath the earth Jove Saturn sent, <lb/>
            I was by them receiv'd and cherished. <lb n="190"/>
            But now with one another discontent, <lb/>
            They will not come together in one bed. <lb/>
            If by this means I him can get within <lb/>
            Love's arms again, no jar shall them divide, <lb/>
            And I from both shall love and honour win. <lb n="195"/>
            And Venus then again to her replied, <lb/>
            Juno, Jove's wife and sister, your request <lb/>
            Cannot by me, nor ought to be denied. <lb/>
            And as she spake, she from about her breast <lb/>
            The fine enchanting girdle straight untied; <lb n="200"/>
            Wherein embroid'red were love and desire, <lb/>
            Soothing, and comfort, that sufficient were, <lb/>

            And to her hands she puts it, and said, Here, <lb/>

            So Juno did, and as she did it smiled. <lb/>
            And to the house of Jove then Venus goes. <lb/>
            But Juno o'er Æmathia, and all <lb n="210"/>
            Pierra, and all the Thracian snows, <lb/>
            And never on the ground her foot lets fall. <lb/>
            And from the mountain Athos o'er the deep, <lb/>
            And came to Lemnos where king Thoas sway'd. <lb/>
            And there she met the gentle God of sleep. <lb n="215"/>
            And took him by the hand, and to him said, <lb/>
            Sweet Sleep, to whom both men and Gods all bow, <lb/>
            If ever with my will you did comply, <lb/>
            Deny not what I shall request you now. <lb/>
            Diffuse sound sleep a while upon Jove's eye, <lb n="220"/>
            As soon as he with love is satisfied. <lb/>
            And I will thank you for it whilst I live. <lb/>
            And from my hand you shall receive beside, <lb/>
            A chair of beaten gold which I'll you give; <lb/>
            Vulcan my son shall make it curiously, <lb n="225"/>
            Together with a foot-stool for your foot. <lb/>
            And Sleep to Juno then made such reply, <lb/>
            As if he were afraid and durst not do't. <lb/>
            Juno, said he, if 'twere another God, <lb/>
            Though Ocean the great sire of them all, <lb n="230"/>
            I durst upon his eyes have softly trod. <lb/>
            But not on Jove's, unless he for me call. <lb/>
            Your order once, like this, I did obey <lb/>
            Before, when Hercules, Jove's mighty son, <lb/>
            Went off to sea after he conquer'd Troy. <lb n="235"/>
            Meanwhile the strong unruly Winds set on <lb/>
            By you, with mighty blasts at sea arose, <lb/>
            And from his best friends hurried him in pain, <lb/>
            And at the last threw him ashore at Coos. <lb/>
            But Jupiter, when he awoke again, <lb n="240"/>
            The Gods at home he all tost up and down, <lb/>
            And chiefly would of me have had a sight. <lb/>
            Into the sea then sure I had been thrown, <lb/>
            But that I fled, and was conceal'd by Night, <lb/>
            Till of his anger blunted was the edge. <lb n="245"/>
            For Night great power has with Gods and men, <lb/>
            And loth was Jove to break her privilege. <lb/>
            T'encourage him then Juno said again, <lb/>
            D'ye think Jove will as angry be for Troy, <lb/>
            As he was then for Hercules his son ? <lb n="250"/>
            But go. Pasiphae you shall enjoy ; <lb/>
            She's fair and young, and of my Graces one, <lb/>
            And with you as a wife shall always stay. <lb/>

            Then Juno, as she was required, sware <lb/>

            The Titans and the brood of Saturn are. <lb/>
            And then together both from Lemnos came <lb/>
            To Lectos, at the foot of Ida hill, <lb n="265"/>
            And o'er the woods upward their way they took. <lb/>
            But out of sight of Jove there Sleep stood still; <lb/>
            And as they went the wood below them shook. <lb/>
            Then Sleep went up into a high fir tree, <lb/>
            And there he sat in likeness of a fowl, <lb n="270"/>
            All cover'd o'er with boughs and leaves was he, <lb/>
            Call'd Chalcis by the Gods, by us an owl. <lb/>
            Juno went on to Gargarus, where Jove <lb/>
            Saw her and met her with no less desire <lb/>
            Than when the first time to enjoy her love <lb n="275"/>
            Without their parents' knowledge he lay by her. <lb/>
            And Jove then standing by her very near, <lb/>
            What made you from Olympus come, said he, <lb/>
            Neither your car nor horses have you here. <lb/>
            Deceitfully then to him answer'd she, <lb n="280"/>
            I going am upon a visit now <lb/>
            To th' father and the mother of the Gods, <lb/>
            Oceanus and Tethys ; who, you know, <lb/>
            Did bring me up. For now they are at odds, <lb/>
            And angry he abstaineth from her bed. <lb n="285"/>
            But if I can I reconcile them will. <lb/>
            The horses that me brought unharnessed <lb/>
            Attend me at the foot of Ida hill. <lb/>
            But that I from Olympus hither came, <lb/>
            Was that I would not such a journey take, <lb n="290"/>
            And not make you acquainted with the same. <lb/>
            This said, to Juno Jove again thus spake. <lb/>
            You may, said he, at any time do that, <lb/>
            But let us now with love ourselves delight. <lb/>
            For never yet upon my heart love sat <lb n="295"/>
            For woman or for Goddess with such might. <lb/>
            Not when upon the wife of Ixion <lb/>

            Fierce Cronides, then answered Juno, how ? <lb/>

            And tell it to the rest to make them sport ? <lb n="310"/>
            Then so ashamed of it shall be I, <lb/>

            Neither the sun nor any living soul <lb n="315"/>
            Can peep. Go thither if you will do that. <lb/>
            And Jove to Juno then again replied. <lb/>
            That man or God shall see us do not fear ; <lb/>
            With such a cloud of gold I will us hide, <lb/>
            As to the Sun himself we'll not appear. <lb n="320"/>
            This said, within his arms his wife he caught, <lb/>
            Whilst under them the Earth made to arise <lb/>
            Great store of saffron, hyacinth, and lote. <lb/>
            There pleased Jupiter with Juno lies, <lb/>
            Closely concealed in a cloud of gold. <lb n="325"/>
            Away went Sleep unto the Argive fleet, <lb/>
            And speaking there to Neptune said, Be bold, <lb/>
            And help the Greeks awhile. Jove cannot see't. <lb/>
            I clos'd his eyes as he by Juno lay. <lb/>
            He'll soon awake ; but help the Greeks till then, <lb n="330"/>
            Who now before the Trojans dare not stay. <lb/>
            This said, Sleep went amongst the tribes of men, <lb/>
            And Neptune to the Argive ranks, and cried,- <lb/>
            Shall Hector think to get the victory <lb/>
            Because Achilles is not on our side ? <lb n="335"/>
            No. Of Achilles little need would be <lb/>
            If every man would his companion cheer. <lb/>
            But now the counsel I shall give obey: <lb/>
            Arm every man himself with a good spear, <lb/>
            And shield, and helmet strong, and come away, <lb n="340"/>
            And follow me. I'll lead you to the field. <lb/>
            Hector, though bold, my coming will not stay. <lb/>
            But let the best man take the largest shield, <lb/>
            And to a weaker put his own away. <lb/>
            This said, well pleased were the Argives all ; <lb n="345"/>
            The wounded princes arm'd themselves each one ; <lb/>
            King Agamemnon first, the general ; <lb/>
            Ulysses and Tydides then put on <lb/>

            And give their heavy arms to men more strong. <lb/>

            And Hector, with the Trojans well array'd, <lb/>
            On th' other side came on. And then began, <lb/>
            Betwixt the Greeks that had the God for aid, <lb/>
            And those of Troy led by a valiant man. <lb n="360"/>
            A cruel fight. And high the sea arose <lb/>
            Up to the ships and tents. And presently, <lb/>
            With Alalaes the mighty armies close ; <lb/>
            And up unto the heavens went the cry. <lb/>
            So loud as now, the sea did never roar, <lb n="365"/>
            When beaten 'twas int' heaps by Boreas; <lb/>
            Nor wind, when in the woods great oaks it tore <lb/>
            Up by the roots, nor th' wood when fir'd it was. <lb/>
            And here did Hector first begin the fight, <lb/>
            And at the greater Ajax threw his spear, <lb n="370"/>
            Which hit him ; but upon two belts did light, <lb/>
            Which one upon another lying were,- <lb/>
            One of his sword, the other of his shield. <lb/>
            Hector was angry that in vain he flung, <lb/>
            For he was in great hope he had him kill'd, <lb n="375"/>
            And now retired backward to the throng. <lb/>
            Then Ajax in his hand took up a stone, <lb/>
            Of those to which the Greeks their ships did tye, <lb/>
            For there amongst their feet lay many a one, <lb/>
            And at him, as he parted, lets it fly; <lb n="380"/>
            And as a top he made it flying spin. <lb/>
            It but a little o'er his buckler flew, <lb/>
            And hit him 'twixt his buckler and his chin, <lb/>
            Upon the breast, and to the ground him threw. <lb/>
            As when an oak is overthrown by thunder, <lb n="385"/>
            Which known is ens'ly by the brimstone smell, <lb/>
            Men look upon't with horror and with wonder; <lb/>
            So gazed they at Hector when he fell. <lb/>
            And from his hands went out both shield and spear, <lb/>
            And helmet from his head ; and with great cry <lb n="390"/>
            The Greeks rush on, and in fair hope they were <lb/>
            To gain his body, and their spears let fly. <lb/>
            But all in vain. For by Polydamas, <lb/>
            Divine Æneas, and Agenor, and <lb/>
            Sarpedon, and by Glaucus sav'd he was, <lb n="395"/>
            Who all before him with their bucklers stand. <lb/>
            His friends then from the battle him convey'd <lb/>
            Unto his chariot and charioteer, <lb/>
            That close behind the squadrons for him stay'd, <lb/>
            And in his car tow'rds Ilium him bear. <lb n="400"/>
            But at the ford of Xanthus, by the way, <lb/>
            They poured water on his face, and then, <lb/>
            In little time. as on the ground he lay, <lb/>
            He breath'd, and came unto himself again. <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            Then sitting on his knees, he cast up blood; <note type="margin"> LIB. XIV. </note><note type="margin"> Juno, by the <lb/>

            And backward fell unto the ground again : <lb/>
            Upon his eyes agnin the darkness stood, <lb/>
            For of the stroke remained still the pain. <lb/>
            The Greeks, as soon as they saw Hector gone, <lb/>
            Took heart, and on the Trojans fiercer were. <lb n="410"/>
            Then Ajax, of Oileus the son, <lb/>
            Slew Satnius, son of Enops, with his spear. <lb/>
            His mother, Neis, was a very fine <lb/>
            Nymph of the river Satnius. Of the same, <lb/>
            Enops upon the bank sat keeping kine, <lb n="415"/>
            And on her got a son called by that name. <lb/>
            Him Ajax now struck through the flank and slew ; <lb/>
            Then for the body there was much ado. <lb/>
            At him Polydamas a spear then threw, <lb/>
            Which Prothoenor's shoulder pierced through. <lb n="420"/>
            And on his hands into the dust he fell. <lb/>
            To th’ Greeks then, boasting, said Polydamas, <lb/>
            I have not thrown in vain. I know full well <lb/>
            That one Greek or another taken 't has <lb/>
            To lean on as a staff i' th' way to Hell. <lb n="425"/>
            At this, the Greeks were griev'd, but specially <lb/>
            The heart of Telamonius did swell. <lb/>
            For Prothoenor slain did near him lie ; <lb/>
            And with his spear threw at Polydamas, <lb/>
            Who nimbly leapt aside and it declin'd. <lb n="430"/>
            But by Archelocus receiv'd it was, <lb/>
            Antenor's son, whose death the Fates designed, <lb/>
            Who having on his neck received the wound, <lb/>
            His forehead, and his eyes, and lips, and nose, <lb/>
            Before his legs or knees came to the ground. <lb n="435"/>
            Then Ajax took his turn, and at it crows. <lb/>
            Polydamas, said he, was Prothoenor <lb/>
            As good a man in your own estimation, <lb/>
            As this man that was brother to Antenor, <lb/>
            Or son ? For he is not unlike that generation. <lb n="440"/>
            This said he, though he well knew who it was. <lb/>
            Then Promachus, as he drew off the dead, <lb/>
            Was killed by a spear from Acamas. <lb/>
            And in it Acamas then gloried. <lb/>
            Argives, said he, great threat'ners as you are <lb n="445"/>
            You vulnerable are as well as we, <lb/>
            And no less subject to the chance of war. <lb/>
            How quiet Promachus now lies you see, <lb/>
            And so I hope ere long you all shall lie. <lb/>
            My brother not long unrevenged lay. <lb n="450"/>
            'Tis good you see to have a brother nigh. <lb/>
            And when he this had said he went away. <lb/>

            A man much favoured by Mercury. <lb/>
            The spear beneath his eyebrow enter'd in, <lb/>
            And to the ground fell down the bloody eye. <lb/>
            The spear went on unto the brain within, <lb n="460"/>
            Then sitting down with both his hands outspread, <lb/>
            The deadly spear yet sticking in his eye, <lb/>
            Peneleus with his sword cuts off his head, <lb/>
            Which to the ground with helmet on did fly. <lb/>
            Then looking up, he to the Trojans said, <lb n="465"/>
            Tell this in Troy. And let his parents mourn. <lb/>
            For Promochus's wife will not be joy'd, <lb/>

            This said, the Trojans stricken were with fear, <lb/>
            And look'd about each one which way to fly. <lb n="470"/>
            Now tell me, Muse, who and by whom slain were <lb/>
            When they pursued the flying enemy. <lb/>
            Great Ajax first, the son of Telamon, <lb/>
            Killed the Mysian leader, Hyrtius, <lb/>
            Of Gyrtias the strong and valiant son ; <lb n="475"/>
            Antilochus then killed Mermerus <lb/>
            And Phalces. By Meriones were slain <lb/>
            Hippotion and Morys. Teucer slew <lb/>
            Prothon and Periphetes, good men twain. <lb/>
            At Hyperenor then Atrides threw, <lb n="480"/>
            And gave him on the flank a cruel wound, <lb/>
            And where the spear went in, his life went out, <lb/>
            And suddenly he fell unto the ground, <lb/>
            And on his eyes sat darkness all about. <lb/>
            But he that far the greater number slew, <lb n="485"/>
            The lesser Ajax was, Oïleus’ son. <lb/>
            'Twas hard to scape when Ajax did pursue ; <lb/>
            For of the Argives all he best could run.</p>

            Upon the plain, his friends there sitting by, <lb/>
            And not a little of his life afraid, <lb/>
            For gasping he scarce able was to draw <lb/>
            His breath, and blood abundance vomited, <lb n="10"/>
            Nor knew his friends. When Jupiter him saw, <lb/>
            Offended his condition pitied. <lb/>
            And then on Juno fiercely look'd and said, <lb/>
            Juno, I see all this is done by you ; <lb/>
            And if you for it with a whip were paid, <lb n="15"/>
            'Twould be no more than for your work is due. <lb/>
            Have you forgot how once you swung i' th' air, <lb/>
            And had two anvils hanging at your feet, <lb/>
            Your hand with a gold chain tied to my chair ? <lb/>
            Though sorry were the other Gods to see't; <lb n="20"/>
            Yet had I any seen but go about <lb/>
            Your manacles or shackles to untie, <lb/>
            I from the sill of heaven had thrown him out, <lb/>
            And strengthless made him on the earth to lie. <lb/>
            I was not so much griev'd for Hercules <lb n="25"/>
            When Boreas, set on by you, arose <lb/>
            As he went off from Troy, cnrag'd the seas, <lb/>
            And at the last threw him ashore at Coos. <lb/>
            But I to Argos brought him safe again. <lb/>
            And this I now repeat, that you may try <lb n="30"/>
            Whether you likely are to lose or gain, <lb/>
            Abusing our familiarity. <lb/>
            This said, the Goddess Juno, struck with fear, <lb/>
            By Earth, said she, and Heaven about it spread, <lb/>
            By Styx, which is our greatest oath, I swear, <lb n="35"/>
            And by your life, and by our nuptial bed, <lb/>
            I never did to Neptune speak a word, <lb/>
            To hurt the Trojans, or the Greeks to aid; <lb/>
            But all he did was of his own accord, <lb/>
            By pity only and compassion sway'd. <lb n="40"/>
            And from henceforward I will him advise, <lb/>
            Seeing what way you lead, the same to take. <lb/>
            Then Jupiter with favourable eyes <lb/>
            On Juno look'd, and thus unto her spake. <lb/>
            Juno, if we were both one way inclin'd, <lb n="45"/>
            Neptune would quickly with us both comply. <lb/>
            Now if your words dissent not from your mind, <lb/>
            Go ’mongst the other Gods, and presently <lb/>
            Bid Iris and Apollo to me come. <lb/>
            For Iris unto Neptune I will send, <lb n="50"/>
            To bid him leave the battle and go home. <lb/>
            To Hector and the Trojans I intend <lb/>

            The Trojans on, and put the Greeks to flight, <lb n="55"/>
            That Thetis' son may see them scattered; <lb/>
            And he shall send Patroclus to the field, <lb/>
            Who shall the Trojans rout and kill my son <lb/>
            Sarpedon, and himself shall then be kill'd <lb/>
            By Hector's spear. And after that is done, <lb n="60"/>
            Achilles in revenge again shall fight, <lb/>
            And by his hand stout Hector shall be kill'd <lb/>
            Under the walls of Troy, i' th' Trojans' sight, <lb/>
            And beaten be the Trojans from the field, <lb/>
            Till Troy by Pallas' counsel taken be. <lb n="65"/>
            Nor till I have performed all I said <lb/>
            To Thetis, supplicating at my knee, <lb/>
            Let any God presume the Greeks to aid. <lb/>
            This said, went Juno to Olympus high. <lb/>
            As when a man looks o'er an ample plain, <lb n="70"/>
            To any distance quickly goes his eye; <lb/>
            So swiftly Juno went with little pain, <lb/>
            And found the Gods at wine together set. <lb/>
            And at her coming in they all stood up. <lb/>
            But Themis forward went and Juno met, <lb n="75"/>
            And to her hand delivered the cup, <lb/>
            And said, You look as if you frighted were <lb/>
            By Jupiter for something. But what is't ? <lb/>
            You know, said Juno, that he is severe ; <lb/>
            And you shall hear the matter if you list, <lb n="80"/>
            Together with the other Gods, though bad. <lb/>
            They will not all contented with it be; <lb/>
            But some of them will troubled be and sad. <lb/>
            And griev'd was she, though speaking smilingly. <lb/>
            Then Juno went up to her throne, and sat ; <lb n="85"/>
            And unto all the Gods spoke angrily, <lb/>
            How mad, said she, or foolish are we, that <lb/>
            Are thinking how again Jove's hands to tie, <lb/>
            Who, careless and unmov'd on Ida hill, <lb/>
            Knows his own strength, and does our plots despise. <lb n="90"/>
            And therefore what he sends, be't good or ill, <lb/>
            We'll take it patiently, if we be wise. <lb/>
            Nor must the God of war on Jove complain, <lb/>
            Or in rebellion against him rise <lb/>
            Because his son Ascalaphus is slain. <lb n="95"/>
            At this, with both his hands Mars clapp'd his thighs, <lb/>
            And to the Gods above complaining said, <lb/>
            Pardon me, Gods ; I will revenge my son, <lb/>
            And 'mongst the Argives go and give them aid, <lb/>
            Though I should lie amongst the dead. Then on <lb n="100"/>
            He puts his armour, and gives order to <lb/>
            Terror and Flight his chariot to prepare; <lb/>
            And then there had been twice as much ado <lb/>
            T'appease Jove's anger ere it came to war, <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>

            Pluck'd off his helmet, and set up his spear, <lb/>
            And pull'd his buckler off, and to him said, <lb/>
            Fool, Bedlam, what! have you no ears to hear ? <lb/>
            You hear what news now Juno brings from Jove. <lb/>
            And if you care not though yourself be lost, <lb n="110"/>
            Yet let the danger of us all you move. <lb/>
            For Jove will leave both Greek and Trojan host, <lb/>
            And, coming hither, seize us one by one, <lb/>
            And never ask who guilty is or not. <lb/>
            Therefore give over vexing for your son, <lb n="115"/>
            For better men than he, by Gods begot, <lb/>
            Already here have been and shall be slain. <lb/>
            The Gods cannot preserve their children all. <lb/>
            This said, she brought Mars to his place again. <lb/>
            And Juno to their houses went to call <lb n="120"/>
            Iris and Phœbus. You must go, said she, <lb/>
            To Jove on Ida. What you are to do, <lb/>
            You will by Jove himself informed be, <lb/>
            As soon as you his presence come into. <lb/>
            Her message done, Juno resumes her place, <lb n="125"/>
            Iris and Phœbus down to Ida fly, <lb/>
            And finding Jove, stood still before his face. <lb/>
            Nor look'd he on them with an angry eye ; <lb/>
            For soon they did his wife's command obey. <lb/>
            Then speaking first to Iris, Go, said he, <lb n="130"/>
            To Neptune quickly, tell him what I say. <lb/>
            Bid him no longer at the battle be, <lb/>
            But either go t'Olympus to the Gods, <lb/>
            Or to the sea. If he will neither do, <lb/>
            Bid him consider if there be no odds <lb n="135"/>
            As well in strength as age between us two. <lb/>
            He knows that all the other Gods me fear, <lb/>
            And for my coming dareth none to stay, <lb/>
            As strong as to himself he doth appear. <lb/>
            This said, swift-footed Iris went her way <lb n="140"/>
            From Ida hill, and Jove without delay, <lb/>
            And swift as any cloud before the winds, <lb/>
            Came down unto the battle before Troy, <lb/>
            And there amongst the Argives Neptune finds, <lb/>
            And going to his side, I came, said she, <lb n="145"/>
            To speak with you a word or two from Jove. <lb/>
            You must not in the war a party be. <lb/>
            He bids you go up to the Gods above, <lb/>
            Or down to th' sea, where lies your own command. <lb/>
            If you refuse, he threatens you with war, <lb n="150"/>
            And bids you have a care t'avoid his hand ; <lb/>
            And th'elder is, he says, and stronger far, <lb/>
            Which you yourself, he thinks, will not deny, <lb/>
            Since th'other Gods of him stand all in awe. <pb n="174"/>

            Neptune to this replying, first spake high: <lb n="155"/>
            Good as he is, said he, it is not law, <lb/>
            Thus to usurp upon my liberty. <lb/>
            For sons and heirs of Saturn we were three, <lb/>
            Begot on Rhea. Pluto, Jove, and I. <lb/>
            By lot the rule o' th' waters came to me. <lb n="160"/>
            To Jove the government of heaven fell, <lb/>
            And of the clouds, and the ethereal sky. <lb/>
            To Pluto darkness, and the rule of hell. <lb/>
            Earth and Olympus did as common lie. <lb/>
            Let Jove then with his share contented be, <lb n="165"/>
            And not encroach on me. For well 'tis known <lb/>
            I hold not any thing of him in fee, <lb/>
            But live as he should do, upon my own. <lb/>
            He should not unto me such language use, <lb/>
            But to his children, that will be afraid, <lb n="170"/>
            And dare not what he bids them to refuse. <lb/>
            Thus Neptune spake. Again then Iris said, <lb/>
            Neptune, shall I this haughty answer carry <lb/>
            To Jove ? And will you that I with it<lb/>
            As 'tis ? The wise their minds oft vary ; <lb n="175"/>
            And Furies on the eldest wait you know. <lb/>
            So she to him. Then Neptune thus to her. <lb/>
            Iris, this word was spoken in good season. <lb/>
            Much worth, I see, is a wise messenger. <lb/>
            But I was vex'd, because thus without reason, <lb n="180"/>
            When I his equal am by birth and lot, <lb/>
            Jove uses me as if I were his slave. <lb/>
            Well. For the present, cross him I will not, <lb/>
            Though I be vex'd. That answer let him have. <lb/>
            And further, that if he without consent <lb n="185"/>
            Of me, Athena, Juno, Mercury, <lb/>
            And Vulcan, Troy shall spare, our discontent <lb/>
            For th' Argives' wrong implacable will be. <lb/>
            And when he this had said he fight forbears, <lb/>
            Nor any longer ’mongst the Argives stay'd, <lb n="190"/>
            But div'd into the sea o'er head and ears. <lb/>
            Then Jove unto Apollo spake, and said, <lb/>
            To Hector go; for Neptune now is gone <lb/>
            For fear of my displeasure ; had he stay'd, <lb/>
            The sons of Saturn of our war had known. <lb n="195"/>
            'Twas wisely done of him my hand t' avoid. <lb/>
            And better both for him and me ; but go, <lb/>
            And shaking your great shield, the Greeks affright, <lb/>
            And strengthen Hector, and encourage so <lb/>
            That he the Argive lords may put to flight, <lb n="200"/>
            And follow them down to the Hellespont, <lb/>
            And make them for their hollow ships to fight. <lb/>
            What then is to be done ? I'll think upon't. <lb/>
            For I intend not to destroy them quite. <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            This said, Apollo left his father Jove, <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. <lb/>

            And down he came to Troy from Ida hill, <lb/>
            Swift as a falcon flying at a dove, <lb/>
            And Hector on the ground found sitting still, <lb/>
            Not laid, but to his senses come anew, <lb/>
            And freely breathing, although very weak, <lb n="210"/>
            And very well his friends about him knew. <lb/>
            There Phœbus standing nigh did to him speak. <lb/>
            Hector, said he, why sit you here alone ? <lb/>
            0, kindest of the Gods, said he, you know <lb/>
            That Ajax wounded has me with a stone, <lb n="215"/>
            So that I am disabled with the blow, <lb/>
            And once to-day I thought I should have gone <lb/>
            To Erebus with other shadows dim ; <lb/>
            With such a force he threw the mighty stone. <lb/>
            Then thus again Apollo answered him. <lb n="220"/>
            Hector, I Phœbus am, and hither come <lb/>
            From Jove, against the Greeks to give you aid, <lb/>
            And ever have wished well to Ilium. <lb/>
            Lead to the ships your troops. Be not afraid. <lb/>
            Hector at this encouraged was again, <lb n="225"/>
            And as a horse at rack and manger fed, <lb/>
            Breaking his headstall, scuds upon the plain, <lb/>
            And high into the air he holds his head, <lb/>
            His mane upon his shoulders plays with th' air, <lb/>
            And proud is in his freedom to behold <lb n="230"/>
            The pleasant river and the pastures fair, <lb/>
            To which he had accustom'd been of old, <lb/>
            And swiftly to the same is carried ; <lb/>
            So swiftly now went Hector to each part, <lb/>
            And in the field his troops encouraged, <lb n="235"/>
            After Apollo once had giv'n him heart. <lb/>
            But as when swains with curs to chase a roe, <lb/>
            Go forth into the field, and with their cry <lb/>
            Rouse a fierce lion, they the prey let go <lb/>
            To save itself i' th' woods or rochers high, <lb n="240"/>
            And both the men and dogs are forc'd to fly; <lb/>
            Just so the Greeks whilst they in bodies fight. <lb/>
            They save themselves ; but seeing Hector nigh, <lb/>
            They troubled were, and lost their courage quite. <lb/>
            Then to them spake Thoas, Andræmon’s son, <lb n="245"/>
            Well skilled at distance or at hand to fight. <lb/>
            Amongst th' Ætolians better there was none. <lb/>
            And few compare with him for counsel might. <lb/>
            O strange, said he, what wond'rous sight is this! <lb/>
            I verily thought Hector had been slain <lb n="250"/>

            For Jupiter defends him now as then. <lb n="255"/>
            But come, let all my counsel now obey. <lb/>
            Let us that most pretend to fortitude <lb/>
            Stay here embattl'd to receive the foe, <lb/>
            And to the ships send back the multitude. <lb/>
            For thither, I think, Hector dares not go : <lb n="260"/>
            This counsel was approved, and then stood out <lb/>
            Ajax, Idomeneus, Meriones, <lb/>
            Teucer, Meges, and such as were most stout, <lb/>
            And one battalion was made of these, <lb/>
            Th' impression of Hector to sustain, <lb n="265"/>
            Till to the ships the rest retreated were. <lb/>
            And Hector with his troops came on amain, <lb/>
            Himself the foremost shaking his long spear. <lb/>
            Apollo march'd before him to the field, <lb/>
            Concealing in a cloud his glorious head, <lb n="270"/>
            And carried in his hand a shining shield, <lb/>
            Which whosoever laid his eyes on fled. <lb/>
            'Twas made at first by Mulciber, and then <lb/>
            Given to Jove when he came down to fight <lb/>
            Against the squadrons of rebellious men, <lb n="275"/>
            To make them fly the field at the first sight. <lb/>
            Expecting Hector, close the Argives stand, <lb/>
            And loud and sharp on both sides was the cry, <lb/>
            And many a spear from every lusty hand, <lb/>
            And in the air, arrows abundant fly, <lb n="280"/>
            And spears ; whereof some flying home did kill, <lb/>
            And others would have done, but short they fell. <lb/>
            As long as Phœbus did his shield hold still, <lb/>
            Many a soul on both sides flew to Hell. <lb/>
            When shaking it, he made the Argives see 't, <lb n="285"/>
            They stricken were with fear and suddenly <lb/>
            Their heavy hearts fell down into their feet, <lb/>
            And then they made all haste they could to fly. <lb/>
            And as a herd or flock is frighted when <lb/>
            A wolf or lion coming on they see, <lb n="290"/>
            And no assistance have of dogs or men; <lb/>
            So th' Argives scattered before Hector flee. <lb/>
            Then slain by Hector was Arcesilaus, <lb/>
            And Stichius who the Bœotians led. <lb/>
            The other a good friend of Mnesteus was ; <lb n="295"/>
            Both killed were by Hector as they fled ; <lb/>
            Æneas Medon slew, and Iasus. <lb/>
            Medon was little Ajax' bastard brother, <lb/>
            And lived from his father Oileus, <lb/>
            By th' instigation of his stepmother <lb n="300"/>
            Eriopis, whose brother he had slain. <lb/>
            And Iasus th' Athenian leader was, <lb/>
            But back to Athens led them not again. <lb/>
            His father was Sphelus Bucalidas. <lb/>

            Polites Echius slew in the first fight, <lb/>
            And Clonius by Agenor killed was; <lb/>
            And Deiochus by Paris in the flight. <lb/>
            Whilst from the foe each one his armour takes, <lb/>
            The flying Greeks into the ditch leap'd all, <lb n="310"/>
            And there encumber d mightily with stakes, <lb/>
            Were forced to retire within the wall. <lb/>
            Then Hector roared to the Trojans, saying, <lb/>
            On to the ships, and let the dead men lie. <lb/>
            I'll be his death whom ever I find staying, <lb n="315"/>
            Nor shall he buried be or burned by <lb/>
            His friends and kin, but in the fields of Troy <lb/>
            Be left for dogs to tear and haul about. <lb/>
            This said, unto the ships he drave away, <lb/>
            By th' Trojans follow'd with a mighty shout. <lb n="320"/>
            Phœbus before them march'd, and with his foot <lb/>
            Into the trench threw down the earth again, <lb/>
            And made an easy and plain passage through't <lb/>
            As far as one a spear can well hurl, when <lb/>
            He hurleth for a wager. To the wall <lb n="325"/>
            The Trojans go, Apollo there again <lb/>
            Before them is, and eas'ly makes it fall, <lb/>
            As children when themselves they entertain <lb/>
            With making pretty things upon the sands, <lb/>
            Then comes into their heads another toy, <lb n="330"/>
            And down they push this with their feet or hands; <lb/>
            So easily Apollo did destroy <lb/>
            The Argives' mighty work, and bring the fight <lb/>
            Again unto the ships. Where now they pray'd, <lb/>
            And one another's courage did excite. <lb n="335"/>
            Nestor to heav'n held up his hands and said, <lb/>
            O Jove, if you the sacrifice accepted have <lb/>
            Of any Greek before he hither came, <lb/>
            And promis'd that the army you would save, <lb/>
            0, at our prayer, now perform the same; <lb n="340"/>
            Let us not perish by the Trojans here. <lb/>
            Thus Nestor pray'd, and then Jove thundered, <lb/>
            Declaring that his prayers granted were. <lb/>
            At this the Trojans were encouraged, <lb/>
            And by their hopes interpreting Jove's mind, <lb n="345"/>
            Upon the Greeks with greater fury fall. <lb/>
            As when a wave is thrown by some great wind <lb/>
            Into a ship, so pass'd they at the wall, <lb/>
            And to the ships they went with horse and car. <lb/>
            The Greeks went up into their ships to fight, <lb n="350"/>
            And with long spears, made for a naval war <lb/>
            And pointed well with brass, and shining bright, <lb/>
            The Greeks and Trojans push at one another, <lb/>

            And higher on their black ships stood the other. <lb n="355"/>
            Patroclus, that till now sat quietly, <lb/>
            Because the fight was only at the wall, <lb/>
            And to Eurypylus his care applied <lb/>
            And med'cines fit to cure his wounds withal, <lb/>
            And sat discoursing with him by his side, <lb n="360"/>
            Now when he saw the Trojans were within, <lb/>
            And of the Argives heard the woful cries, <lb/>
            And saw the fear and danger they were in, <lb/>
            With both his hands then clapped he his thighs. <lb/>
            Eurypylus, said he, I cannot stay ; <lb n="365"/>
            For mightily increased is th' affray. <lb/>
            Your wound be dressed by your servant may, <lb/>
            But to Achilles I must go away. <lb/>
            Who knows but I may win him at the last <lb/>
            To help the Greeks ? This said, away he went, <lb n="370"/>
            And left Eurypylus, and made what haste <lb/>
            He could to get unto Achilles' tent. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the victory no way inclin'd. <lb/>
            Neither the Greeks could make the Trojans fly, <lb/>
            Nor yet the Trojans, as they had design'd, <lb n="375"/>
            Back from the ships could force the enemy; <lb/>
            But level hung the wings of victory, <lb/>
            As when two scales are charg'd with equal weight, <lb/>
            Made by the art of Pallas curiously, <lb/>
            The beam lies level in the air and straight. <lb n="380"/>
            And at one time at divers ships they fought. <lb/>
            Directly unto Ajax Hector went, <lb/>
            And there sharp fighting was one ship about. <lb/>
            Hector to burn, Ajax to save it meant. <lb/>
            Here Ajax, with a long spear in his hand, <lb n="385"/>
            Killed Caletor, Hector's brother's son, <lb/>
            As he was coming with a flaming brand <lb/>
            To fire the ship, and died before 'twas done. <lb/>
            This Hector saw, and to his fellows cried, <lb/>
            Trojans and friends, defend the body dead <lb n="390"/>
            Of Clytius’ son, and shrink not from my side. <lb/>
            And as he spake his long spear from him fled, <lb/>
            Which, aim'd at Ajax, fell on Lycophron, <lb/>
            A man that was to Ajax very dear, <lb/>
            But born at Cythera, and Mastor's son, <lb n="395"/>
            That having kill'd a man durst not stay there, <lb/>
            But unto Ajax fled, and with him staid, <lb/>
            Till now by Hector's spear struck through the head <lb/>
            He died. Then Ajax to his brother said, <lb/>
            Teucer, our friend Mastorides is dead. <lb n="400"/>
            You know how much we honour'd him at home. <lb/>
            'Tis Hector that has slain him. Where are now <lb/>
            Your deadly arrows ? And what is become <lb/>
            Of Phœbus’ gift, your so egregious bow ? <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            Which Teucer hearing, quickly with him was <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. <lb/>

            With bow and quiver in his hand, and shot <lb/>
            And slew the servant of Polydamas, <lb/>
            That had the guiding of his chariot, <lb/>
            Clitus by name, who while in vain he sought <lb/>
            By driving to where hottest was the fight, <lb n="410"/>
            From Hector and the Trojans thanks t have got, <lb/>
            The fatal arrow on his neck did light. <lb/>
            Then down he fell. The frighted horses shook <lb/>
            The empty car. Then came Polydamas, <lb/>
            And by the heads the cap'ring horses took, <lb n="415"/>
            And sets Astynous in Clytus' place; <lb/>
            And gave him a strict charge to hold them nigh, <lb/>
            But not to come with them into the fight. <lb/>
            Then Teucer lets another arrow fly <lb/>
            At Hector, which if it had hit him right, <lb n="420"/>
            He never at the ships again had fought. <lb/>
            But Jupiter was pleas'd to save him now, <lb/>
            And brake the bow-string. Then in vain flew out <lb/>
            The arrow, and into the dust the bow. <lb/>
            And Teucer to his brother made his moan. <lb n="425"/>
            Ajax, said he, is't not a wondrous thing ? <lb/>
            My bow is started from my hand and gone, <lb/>
            Some God or other broken has the string, <lb/>
            Yet new 'twas made this morning purposely <lb/>
            To last all day. Teucer, said Ajax then, <lb n="430"/>
            Cannot you let your bow and quiver lie, <lb/>
            And fight with spear in hand like other men, <lb/>
            And give unto the Greeks encouragement ? <lb/>
            No. Though the Gods above should in their hate <lb/>
            To let the Trojans take our ships be bent, <lb n="435"/>
            Yet let us sell them at a lusty rate. <lb/>
            Teucer then laid his bow up in his tent, <lb/>
            And arm'd himself with helmet and with shield, <lb/>
            And a good spear, and back to Ajax went, <lb/>
            And found him where he left him in the field. <lb n="440"/>
            When Hector saw that Teucer's noble bow <lb/>
            Was useless now, he to his squadrons cried, <lb/>
            Trojans and Lycians, come on boldly now, <lb/>
            For Teucer now his bow hath laid aside. <lb/>
            Jove brake the string. I saw it with these eyes. <lb n="445"/>
            For easily it may discerned be <lb/>
            To whom the hand of Jove intends the prize, <lb/>
            And to whom he denies the victory. <lb/>
            And now upon our side he is you see, <lb/>
            And from the Greeks their courage takes away. <lb n="450"/>
            Then to the ships let's go courageously, <lb/>
            And let the fear of death no man dismay. <lb/>
            For why should any of us fear to die ? <lb/>
            When for his country 'tis, it is no shame. <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <pb n="180"/>

            And if we make the enemy to fly, <lb n="455"/>
            Sav'd are his wife and children, goods, and name. <lb/>
            Whilst Hector thus the Trojans did excite, <lb/>
            Ajax unto the Argives spake, and said, <lb/>
            We must now either put our foes to flight, <lb/>
            Or make account we shall be all destroyed. <lb n="460"/>
            If Hector here to burn our ships should chance, <lb/>

            He calleth on his men ; 'tis not to dance, <lb/>

            Thus Ajax rais'd the courage of th' Achaeans. <lb/>
            Then Hector slew the son of Perimed, <lb n="470"/>
            Stichius that had command of the Phocaeans. <lb/>
            And Ajax slew Laodamas that led <lb/>
            The Trojan foot, and was Antenor's son. <lb/>
            And Otus by Polydamas was slain, <lb/>
            Otus, that led the bold Epeians on, <lb n="475"/>
            And was a friend of Meges. He again <lb/>
            A spear threw at Polydamas, and miss'd; <lb/>
            For Phœbus kindness had for Panthus' son, <lb/>
            And with a present wit did him assist <lb/>
            To turn about and let the spear go on, <lb n="480"/>
            And Croesmus there receiv'd it on his breast, <lb/>
            And down he fell. Then Dolops, Lampus' son, <lb/>
            (Lampus, that was of living men the best, <lb/>
            And grandchild of the King Laomedon) <lb/>
            To be reveng'd, at Meges threw his spear, <lb n="485"/>
            Which pass'd his shield, but in his breastplate staid, <lb/>
            (The breastplate which his father used to wear, <lb/>
            With many plies of strong mail overlaid, <lb/>
            And given was to Phyleus by his guest <lb/>
            At Ephyre, wherewith, in martial strife, <lb n="490"/>
            From deadly strokes of spears to save his breast, <lb/>
            And of his son it now preserv'd the life), <lb/>
            But Meges Dolops hit upon the head, <lb/>
            And from his crest struck off the goodly main, <lb/>
            Which he but newly then had dyed red. <lb n="495"/>
            But Dolops still the fight did well maintain, <lb/>
            Till Menelaus stole unto his side, <lb/>
            And struck him through the shoulder with his spear. <lb/>
            No longer stood he then, but fell and died, <lb/>
            And both of them to strip him going were. <lb n="500"/>
            And Hector then call'd out to all his kin, <lb/>

            He then return d his country to defend, <lb/>
            And liv'd in Priam's house at Ilium, <lb/>
            And proud the Trojans were of such a friend, <lb/>
            And lov'd he was by Priam as his son. <lb/>
            And now unto him Hector spake, and said, <lb n="510"/>
            Have we for Dolops no compassion, <lb/>
            Or to defend his body are afraid ? <lb/>
            Come, follow me. We must no longer play <lb/>
            At distance with the Greeks, but either they <lb/>
            Must utterly deface the town of Troy, <lb n="515"/>
            And kill us all, or we them all destroy. <lb/>
            This said, away they both together went <lb/>
            To save the body of their cousin dead; <lb/>
            And Ajax, with a contrary intent, <lb/>
            His Argives to the fight encouraged. <lb n="520"/>
            Argives, said he, to honour have an eye, <lb/>
            And of your fellows' censures have a care ; <lb/>
            For slain are always more of those that fly <lb/>
            Than those that of base flight ashamed are. <lb/>
            This said, though of it no great need there was <lb n="525"/>
            Amongst the Greeks, they presently obey'd, <lb/>
            And at the ships stood like an hedge of brass; <lb/>
            But on came Hector, not at all afraid. <lb/>
            T' Antilochus then Menelaus said, <lb/>
            Amongst us there is none that better can <lb n="530"/>
            Both fight and run. Why should you be afraid <lb/>
            To leap unto the throng and kill your man ? <lb/>
            This said, away again went Menelaus. <lb/>
            Antilochus leapt out before the rest, <lb/>
            And threw his spear at Menalippus, as <lb n="535"/>
            lie coming was, and hit him on the breast. <lb/>
            No sooner was he fallen to the ground, <lb/>
            Than to the spoil Antilochus ran in, <lb/>
            As quick as when upon a deer a hound <lb/>
            Runs in, that by the hunter kill'd had been. <lb n="540"/>
            But soon as he saw Hector coming on, <lb/>
            As valiant as he was, he durst not stay; <lb/>
            But as some wild beast that had mischief done, <lb/>
            Ere people could assemble, ran away. <lb/>
            The Trojans follow'd him with clamour loud, <lb n="545"/>
            And spears abundance after him they threw, <lb/>
            But he ran on, and got into the crowd. <lb/>
            But they unto the ships the Greeks pursue; <lb/>
            For Jupiter to make his promise good <lb/>
            To Thetis, hitherto the Greeks dismay'd, <lb n="550"/>
            And in the battle with the Trojans stood, <lb/>
            Until he had performed all he said; <lb/>
            But meant to stay no longer with them, than <lb/>
            To see some Argive ship with fire to shine, <pb n="182"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> Hector chaath <lb/>
            the Greeks <lb/>
            again to their <lb/>
            ships. </note> <lb/>
            And then to let the Greeks prevail again. <lb n="555"/>
            From the beginning such was his design <lb/>
            In aiding Hector, who now furiously <lb/>
            Went on like Mars, or like fire in a wood, <lb/>
            With foam about his mouth, and fire in's eye. <lb/>
            And Jove himself came down, and o'er him stood, <lb n="560"/>
            To save him when he was hemm'd in by foes, <lb/>
            And honour him, since 'twas his destiny <lb/>
            That not long after he his life should lose, <lb/>
            And by none but Achilles' hand should die. <lb/>
            Now Hector, looking where the best men stood, <lb n="565"/>
            And armed best, tried first to break in there. <lb/>
            Keen as he was, he there could do no good; <lb/>
            So close they join'd to one another were, <lb/>
            And stuck like great stones in a tow'r or rock, <lb/>
            That of the boist'rous winds and billows high <lb n="570"/>
            Which break upon it, still endures the shock. <lb/>
            Then Hector other places went to try, <lb/>
            And through he pass'd. Then as a wave high grown, <lb/>
            When in foul weather forced by the wind <lb/>
            Under dark clouds, into a ship is thrown, <lb n="575"/>
            The mist and roaring sails bring to the mind <lb/>
            Of the poor seamen nothing but to die; <lb/>
            So frighted were the Greeks. But forward he <lb/>
            Still went; and as when in the meadows by <lb/>
            The river's side thousands of kine there be, <lb n="580"/>
            And th' herdsmen see a lion to them come, <lb/>
            But with a wild beast know not how to fight, <lb/>
            Some go before them, and behind them some, <lb/>
            The lion falleth on them in their sight, <lb/>
            Between both ends, and killeth only one, <lb n="585"/>
            The rest all fly; so th' Argives all, before <lb/>
            Hector and Jupiter, dispersed run, <lb/>
            But only one was killed, and no more. <lb/>
            And Periphetes 'twas, the worthy son <lb/>
            Of an unworthy father, Copreus, who, <lb n="590"/>
            When any labour great was to be done <lb/>
            By Hercules, did from Eurystheus go <lb/>
            As messenger, to carry the commands. <lb/>
            But Periphetes virtue wanted none. <lb/>
            His feet were swift, and valiant were his hands, <lb n="595"/>
            A wiser man Mycena had not one. <lb/>
            But slain he was; for as he turn'd to fly, <lb/>
            He trod upon the edge of his own shield, <lb/>
            And overthrown, upon his back did lie ; <lb/>
            And with a stab of Hector's spear was kill'd. <lb n="600"/>
            His friends, though many standing by him were, <lb/>
            And griev'd to see him fall, did him no good, <lb/>
            For ev'ry one now for himself did fear, <lb/>
            And out of Hector's way kept all he could. <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            The Greeks retreated were no further yet, <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> </note><note type="margin"> The acts of Ajax. </note> <lb n="605"/>
            Than to between the first and second row <lb/>
            Of th' Argive ships; but fore'd that place to quit, <lb/>
            Near to their tents themselves they rally now, <lb/>
            Where Nestor them encouraged again. <lb/>
            Argives, my friends, be valiant now, said he, <lb n="610"/>
            And, if at any time, now play the men. <lb/>
            Of one another's censures fearful be. <lb/>
            Besides, by what you should be moved most, <lb/>
            Your parents, children, wives, and goods and land, <lb/>
            Whether you have them still, or have them lost, <lb n="615"/>
            I you conjure against the foe to stand. <lb/>
            This Nestor said, the Argives to excite: <lb/>
            And Pallas from them took the mist again, <lb/>
            That they might see who did, who did not fight, <lb/>
            Both at the ships and elsewhere on the plain. <lb n="620"/>
            But Ajax Telamonius thought not good <lb/>
            To stay with other Argives in the throng, <lb/>
            But up into a ship he went and stood, <lb/>
            With a ship's spear twenty-two cubits long. <lb/>
            As when a man that taught has been to guide <lb n="625"/>
            Four horses at a time, and in his hand <lb/>
            Holdeth their reins while they go side by side, <lb/>
            And people on the way admiring stand, <lb/>
            He from one horse unto another skips, <lb/>
            And makes them run together to the town ; <lb n="630"/>
            So Ajax o'er the Argives' ranged ships <lb/>
            To save them, and the tents, ran up and down. <lb/>
            And terribly unto the Argives cried <lb/>
            To play the men. Nor Hector 'mongst his troops <lb/>
            Could be persuaded longer to abide ; <lb n="635"/>
            But suddenly as a black eagle stoops <lb/>
            At a great flock of geese, or cranes, or swans, <lb/>
            So Hector of the Argive ships to one <lb/>
            Flew down, and Jove, with his puissant hands, <lb/>
            Behind him marching, always push'd him on. <lb n="640"/>
            Then at the ships the fight began again, <lb/>
            More cruel than before. You would have said <lb/>
            They had no sense of weariness or pain, <lb/>
            So mightily they all about them laid. <lb/>
            The Greeks were in despair of their return. <lb n="645"/>
            The Trojans thought the Argive lords to rout, <lb/>
            And all the ships that brought them thither burn. <lb/>
            Thus minded on each side, they fiercely fought. <lb/>
            Upon a ship then Hector laid his hand, <lb/>
            Which brought Protesilaus unto Troy, <lb n="650"/>
            But never back unto his native land. <lb/>
            For this good ship they one another slay. <lb/>
            Arrows and darts no longer flew about; <lb/>
            But now with battle-axes of great strength, <pb n="184"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> The acts of Ajax. </note> <lb/>
            In one another's reach they stood and fought, <lb n="655"/>
            And with great spears, and of a mighty length, <lb/>
            And great keen swords, whereof from dying hands <lb/>
            Abundance fell on either side to th' ground; <lb/>
            And cover'd were with streaming blood the sands, <lb/>
            That gushed out from many a ghastly wound. <lb n="660"/>
            But Hector on the ship his hand held fast, <lb/>
            And to his Trojans call'd aloud for fire. <lb/>
            This day, said he, requites our ill days past; <lb/>
            To burn these ships Jove with us doth conspire. <lb/>
            And set on fire they had been long ago <lb n="665"/>
            (For I would gladly at the ships have fought) <lb/>
            But that the senate would not have it so, <lb/>
            And kept both you and me from going out. <lb/>
            But though by Jove then smitten were their hearts, <lb/>
            Yet boldly now himself he leads us on. <lb n="670"/>
            This said, the Trojans bravely play their parts, <lb/>
            And with more vigour fought than they had done. <lb/>
            Then on the deck no longer Ajax staid, <lb/>
            many spears went singing by his head. <lb/>
            For if he there had stood he was afraid <lb n="675"/>
            That some unlucky spear would strike him dead; <lb/>
            And to the far side of the ship retreats, <lb/>
            Leaving the deck, which fenceless was and high, <lb/>
            And sat upon one of the rower's seats, <lb/>
            And still upon the Trojans kept his eye. <lb n="680"/>
            And thence he from the fire the ship defends, <lb/>
            And terribly on th' Argive heroes calls <lb/>
            To do their best. We have, said he, no friends <lb/>
            Behind to save our lives, nor better walls <lb/>
            Than those we made; nor any city nigh, <lb n="685"/>
            That can or willing are our part to take. <lb/>
            But far from home, in hostile ground we lie, <lb/>
            And hemmed in are by the briny lake; <lb/>
            And nothing can redeem us but our hands. <lb/>
            This said, he look'd about him furiously, <lb n="690"/>
            To see if any durst approach with brands, <lb/>
            Resolved to kill him that with fire came nigh. <lb/>
            And many to the ship with fire were sent <lb/>
            By Hector; but when they approached near, <lb/>
            Ajax continually did them prevent, <lb n="695"/>
            And twelve he killed with his naval spear.</p><pb n="185"/>

            And with Achilles was Patroclus now, <lb/>
            With tears abundance running down his cheeks, <lb/>
            Like springs that from a high rock streaming flow. <lb/>
            No sooner him Achilles weeping spied, <lb n="5"/>
            But pitied him. Why weep you so, said he, <lb/>
            Like a child running by his mother s side, <lb/>
            And holding by her coat, would carried be ? <lb/>
            Bring you some news that none but you can tell ? <lb/>
            Mencetius and Peleus still do live <lb n="10"/>
            At Phthia with the Myrmidons, and well. <lb/>
            If not, we both have cause enough to grieve. <lb/>
            Or is it that the Greeks are slaughtered so, <lb/>
            And fall before their ships ? 'Tis for their pride! <lb/>
            Speak, what's the matter, that we both may know ? <lb n="15"/>
            Patroclus, sobbing, to him then replied, <lb/>
            0 son of Peleus, of all Greeks the best, <lb/>
            Forgive me if in this necessity <lb/>
            I freely speak. They that excel the rest <lb/>
            In prowess, at the ships all wounded lie. <lb n="20"/>
            Ulysses wounded is, and Diomed, <lb/>
            And Agamemnon, and Eurypylus, <lb/>
            And cur'd may be, but stand us in no stead; <lb/>
            Nor does your virtue any good to us. <lb/>
            O Gods, let never anger in me dwell <lb n="25"/>
            Like this of yours. If you cannot, who can <lb/>
            The Trojans from the Argive fleet repel, <lb/>
            And save so many lives ? 0 cruel man! <lb/>
            The noble Peleus sure was not your father; <lb/>
            Born of the Goddess Thetis you were not. <lb n="30"/>
            Sprung from the raging sea I think you rather, <lb/>
            And that by some hard rock you were begot. <lb/>
            But if you stand upon some prophecy, <lb/>
            Or Thetis have forbidden you to fight <lb/>
            From Jove, yet send some Myrmidons with me, <lb n="35"/>
            That I may to the Argives give some light. <lb/>
            But in your armour let me be array'd, <lb/>
            That when they see me they may think me you, <lb/>
            And back into the city run dismay'd, <lb/>
            And th' Argives wearied take breath anew. <lb n="40"/>
            For long the Trojans have endur'd the fight; <lb/>
            And if fresh enemies they coming see, <lb/>
            With little labour they'll be put to flight, <lb/>
            And leave the Argive tents and navy free. <pb n="186"/>

            Thus prayed he, but 'gainst himself he pray'd, <lb n="45"/>
            And rashly sued to cast his life away. <lb/>
            To this Achilles answer made and said, <lb/>
            My dear Patroclus, what is this you say ? <lb/>
            I stand not on, nor care for prophecy, <lb/>
            Nor yet by Jove forbidden am to fight; <lb n="50"/>
            But at my heart it lieth grievously, <lb/>
            My equal should oppress me by mere might. <lb/>
            A town I won, in which we found great prey; <lb/>
            For my reward the Greeks gave me a maid, <lb/>
            Which Agamemnon from me took away, <lb n="55"/>
            Only because more people him obey'd, <lb/>
            As if I were a man of little worth. <lb/>
            But let that pass. Though once I never meant <lb/>
            My Myrmidons should with the Greeks go forth <lb/>
            To battle till the foes were at my tent, <lb n="60"/>
            Yet since the Argive ships with such a mist <lb/>
            Of Trojans on the shore environ'd lie, <lb/>
            And th' Argives, wanting room, can scarce resist, <lb/>
            And have the pow'r of Troy for enemy, <lb/>
            Take you my arms, and lead unto the fight <lb n="65"/>
            The Myrmidons. The Trojans shall not see <lb/>
            My helmet near to put them in a fright. <lb/>
            If Agamemnon had been just to me, <lb/>
            The ditches had been fill'd with Trojans dead. <lb/>
            But now into the very camp they break; <lb n="70"/>
            Nor can resisted be by Diomed. <lb/>
            To save the ships Tydides is too weak. <lb/>
            Nor can that hateful mouth of Atreus' son <lb/>
            Be heard for Hector, who the air doth fill <lb/>
            With roaring to the Trojans to fall on, <lb n="75"/>
            And shouting of the Trojans as they kill. <lb/>
            Yet so, Patroclus, charge them lustily, <lb/>
            For fear the ships should all be set on fire; <lb/>
            Then lost the Greeks are without remedy, <lb/>
            And to their country never shall retire. <lb n="80"/>
            But now what I shall say give ear unto, <lb/>
            To th' end the Greeks may honour me, and send <lb/>
            Briseis back with gifts, you thus must do. <lb/>
            When you have freed the ships, there make an end <lb/>
            And come away. If Jove give you success, <lb n="85"/>
            No longer without me pursue the fight, <lb/>
            'Twill make my honour with the Greeks the less; <lb/>
            Nor in the slaughter take so much delight <lb/>
            As to proceed up to the walls of Troy, <lb/>
            Lest by some God or other you be checked; <lb n="90"/>
            But having freed the ships come straight away, <lb/>
            Apollo has for Troy a great respect, <lb/>
            And leave both sides to fight upon the plain <lb/>
            Till, grant it, 0 ye Gods, there left are none <lb/>

            Thus they to one another talk d alone. <lb/>
            Ajax by this time from the ship was gone, <lb/>
            Fore d by the spears that from the Trojans flew, <lb/>
            And weakened by the hand of Saturn's son. <lb/>
            For at his head the Trojans alway threw, <lb n="100"/>
            And forc'd he was to hold his great shield high, <lb/>
            And wearied was thereby his buckler-hand. <lb/>
            With spear in hand no Trojan durst come nigh, <lb/>
            But pelting him with spears aloof they stand. <lb/>
            The sweat ran down his limbs, nor could he well, <lb n="105"/>
            Though mightily for breath he pull'd, respire, <lb/>
            Now tell me, Muses, that in heav'n do dwell, <lb/>
            How came the ship first to be set on fire ? <lb/>
            Thus. Hector with his broad-sword, at a blow, <lb/>
            The spear of Ajax chanc'd to cut in twain, <lb n="110"/>
            Where to the staff the head was fix'd, and so <lb/>
            His mighty naval spear he shook in vain: <lb/>
            The head of brass flew humming to the ground. <lb/>
            This Ajax saw, and frighted was to see <lb/>
            Jove thus the counsel of the Greeks confound, <lb n="115"/>
            To give unto the Trojans victory, <lb/>
            And went his way. Then in the Trojans came <lb/>
            With brands of flaming fire; and presently <lb/>
            The hind part of the ship was all in flame. <lb/>
            Achilles with his hand then clapp'd his thigh, <lb n="120"/>
            And to Patroclus said, a flame I see <lb/>
            Rise at the ships. 'Tis time that you were gone, <lb/>
            Lest our retreat should intercepted be. <lb/>
            Away, and quickly put my armour on. <lb/>
            This said, Patroclus first of all puts on <lb n="125"/>
            His boots of war, and to his legs them tied <lb/>
            With silver clasps; and next of Thetis' son <lb/>
            The breast-plate good he to his breast applied, <lb/>
            With golden stars like heaven beautified. <lb/>
            His sword then o'er his shoulder he puts on, <lb n="130"/>
            With silver studs to hang down by his side ; <lb/>
            And then his helmet, shining like the sun, <lb/>
            He puts upon his head; and last of all <lb/>
            He took two spears that fit were for his hand. <lb/>
            But not that which Achilles fought withal, <lb n="135"/>
            For that none but Achilles could command. <lb/>
            A great and strong and heavy spear it was, <lb/>
            Made of an ash cut down i' th' woody hill <lb/>
            Of Pclius, and by Chiron given 'twas <lb/>
            To Peleus, his mighty foes to kill. <lb n="140"/>
            Then to Achilles' car Automedon <lb/>
            The horses Balius and Xanthus tied, <lb/>
            That were by Zephyrus begotten on <lb/>
            Podarge, feeding by the ocean's side; <pb n="188"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> The sixth battle. </note> <lb/>
            And at their heads he Pedasus did place, <lb n="145"/>
            (A horse he took at Thebe in the prey), <lb/>
            That with them both was able to keep pace, <lb/>
            Though he were mortal, and immortal they. <lb/>
            While by his car Patroclus arming stands, <lb/>
            Apace from tent to tent Achilles runs, <lb n="150"/>
            And calleth unto those that had commands, <lb/>
            To arm and bring away the Myrmidons. <lb/>
            Then came they and about Patroclus stood, <lb/>
            Like wolves that on a lusty stag had fed, <lb/>
            And lapping stain'd the river with his blood, <lb n="155"/>
            With bellies full and hearts encouraged. <lb/>
            When they together were, Achilles then <lb/>
            Appointed who i' th' field should them command. <lb/>
            To Troy he ships brought with him five times ten, <lb/>
            From ev'ry ship came fifty men to land. <lb n="160"/>
            And then five bodies he made of them all, <lb/>
            And captains five by whom they led should be. <lb/>
            But was himself the captain-general, <lb/>
            For of the Myrmidons the king was he. <lb/>
            Of these five captains one Menestius was, <lb n="165"/>
            Who was the river Sperchius his son, <lb/>
            And by the name of Boro then did pass. <lb/>
            His mother was of Peleus' daughters one, <lb/>
            And Polydora was her name. And she <lb/>
            To Perierus had been married, <lb n="170"/>
            And for his wife reputed constantly <lb/>
            Before she was of M'nestius brought to bed. <lb/>
            The second bands were by Eudorus led, <lb/>
            The son of Polymela, a fair maid. <lb/>
            Hermes of her became enamoured, <lb n="175"/>
            As at a dance her beauty he surveyed. <lb/>
            It was upon Diana's holy day <lb/>
            He saw her dancing, and at night he got <lb/>
            Unseen into her bed and with her lay, <lb/>
            And his brave son Eudorus then begot. <lb n="180"/>
            To Echecles she after married. <lb/>
            Her father Phylas to him took her son, <lb/>
            And unto man's estate him nourished, <lb/>
            And lov'd no less than if t' had been his own. <lb/>
            The third Pisandrus led, that swift could run, <lb n="185"/>
            And had at fighting with a spear more art <lb/>
            In bloody war than any Myrmidon <lb/>
            Amongst them all, Patroclus set apart. <lb/>
            The fourth was by the old knight Phoenix led. <lb/>
            And of the fifth, charge had Alcimedon. <lb n="190"/>
            When they were all together gathered, <lb/>
            Unto them sharply thus spake Thetis' son. <lb/>
            Ye Myrmidons, said he, remember now, <lb/>
            How all the time I kept you have from fight, <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            You have the Trojans threaten'd hard; and how <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> The sixth battle. </note> <lb n="195"/>
            You said my mother fed me had with gall, <lb/>
            And in great tumult bid me let you go, <lb/>
            Or at the ships upon the Trojans fall. <lb/>
            Lo, there before you is the war you crave. <lb/>
            The Trojans are about to burn the fleet; <lb n="200"/>
            Do you your utmost now the same to save. <lb/>
            Let him that brags of valour let us see't. <lb/>
            This said, the Myrmidons became more keen, <lb/>
            Because they saw the king had chang'd his mind; <lb/>
            And presently into their ranks fell in, <lb n="205"/>
            And close themselves to one another join'd, <lb/>
            As close as in a wall are laid the stones, <lb/>
            By him that means his house shall keep out wind ; <lb/>
            So close together stood the Myrmidons, <lb/>
            Helmets with helmets, shields with shields conjoin'd. <lb n="210"/>
            Before them all two good men armed went, <lb/>
            Patroclus and Automedon, to th' fight. <lb/>
            Achilles then returned to his tent, <lb/>
            Where stood a chest most beautiful to sight, <lb/>
            Which Thetis gave him when he went to Troy, <lb n="215"/>
            Wherein were carpets, coats, and cloaks laid up, <lb/>
            To keep him warm when he a ship-board lay; <lb/>
            And in the same was kept a dainty cup, <lb/>
            In which no other man e'er drank but he, <lb/>
            Though 'twere to offer to the Gods above. <lb n="220"/>
            Nor he himself (such was his nicety) <lb/>
            E'er in it drank but offering to Jove. <lb/>
            Achilles then with sulphur scour'd the cup, <lb/>
            And having rins'd it clean with water fair, <lb/>
            And wash'd his hands, went out and held it up <lb n="225"/>
            Tow'rds heav'n,and thus toJoveaddress'd his prayer. <lb/>
            Pelasgic Jove, that far from hence dost dwell, <lb/>
            But at Dodona men thy counsel know, <lb/>
            The Selli there, thy prophets, fortunes tell, <lb/>
            Though on the ground they sleep, and barefoot go, <lb n="230"/>
            That at my prayer once didst honour me, <lb/>
            And broughtest on the Argive host much woe, <lb/>
            Once more unto my prayer inclined be. <lb/>
            Though to the fight myself I do not go, <lb/>
            I thither send my dear companion. <lb n="235"/>
            O Jove, now honour him! Let Hector know <lb/>
            Patroclus is a man of war alone, <lb/>
            And not then only when I with him go. <lb/>
            And when he has the Trojans driven from <lb/>
            The Argive ships, then grant, 0 Jove, he may <lb n="240"/>
            With all his Myrmidons safe hither come, <lb/>
            With all their arms, and make no longer stay! <lb/>
            Thus prayed he. To half of his desire <lb/>
            Jove nodded ; but the other half denied. <pb n="190"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> The acts of Pa­ <lb/>
            troclus, and his <lb/>
            death. </note> <lb/>
            He granted him to save the ships from fire; <lb n="245"/>
            But at returning safe his neck he wried. <lb/>
            Achilles, when he offer'd had and pray'd, <lb/>
            Went with the cup again into his tent, <lb/>
            And safely laid it up ; and not long staid, <lb/>
            But out again to see the fight he went. <lb n="250"/>
            The Myrmidons now marched orderly; <lb/>
            But when unto the Trojans they were near, <lb/>
            Like wasps incensed they upon them fly. <lb/>
            As when at unawares a traveller <lb/>
            Is going by a wasps' nest near the way, <lb n="255"/>
            Which to the common damage stirr'd has been, <lb/>
            And anger'd by a young unlucky boy, <lb/>
            Upon the traveller they vent their spleen, <lb/>
            And all at once with fury on him fly: <lb/>
            Just so the Myrmidons occasion take, <lb n="260"/>
            Provok'd by Agamemnon's injury, <lb/>
            To fall upon the Trojans for his sake. <lb/>
            Patroclus yet did further them incite. <lb/>
            Ye Myrmidons, said he, Achilles' bands, <lb/>
            Remember now courageously to fight; <lb n="265"/>
            Achilles' honour now lies in your hands, <lb/>
            The best of Greeks. Let Agamemnon see <lb/>
            The fault he did, and know he was unwise, <lb/>
            How wide soever his dominion be, <lb/>
            The best of all th' Achæans to despise. <lb n="270"/>
            Then on the Trojans all at once they fly: <lb/>
            With them the other Greeks by shouts conspire. <lb/>
            The Trojans when they saw Patroclus nigh, <lb/>
            With stout Automedon, Achilles' squire, <lb/>
            Their courage fell, their ranks disorder'd were, <lb n="275"/>
            They look'd about which way 'twere best to run. <lb/>
            For they suppos'd Achilles now was there, <lb/>
            And that his discontent was past and gone. <lb/>
            Patroclus first of all lets fly his spear <lb/>
            Amongst the thickest of the foes, about <lb n="280"/>
            Protesilaus' hollow ship (for there <lb/>
            The Trojans standing close. together fought) <lb/>
            And slew Pyræchmes, who from Amydon, <lb/>
            And Axius' wide stream, the Pœons led. <lb/>
            The spear passed through his right shoulder-bone, <lb n="285"/>
            And when the Pceons saw him fall, they fled. <lb/>
            Not only these he frighted had, but all, <lb/>
            By killing of a captain of such fame. <lb/>
            Patroclus then upon the rest did fall, <lb/>
            And drave them from the ships, andquench'd the flame. <lb n="290"/>
            The Trojans towards Troy retire apace; <lb/>
            Patroclus and the Argives them pursue, <lb/>
            Leaving the ship half burnt upon the place, <lb/>
            And on the plain the fight began anew. <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            As men see all the rocks and woods about, <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> The acts of Pa. <lb/>

            When than the hills the mist is gotten higher; <lb/>
            So when the fire was at the ships put out, <lb/>
            The Greeks did for a little while respire. <lb/>
            For yet the Trojans did not plainly fly, <lb/>
            But still resisting went, and losing ground. <lb n="300"/>
            Here Areilochus was killed by <lb/>
            Patroclus, that gave him a deadly wound <lb/>
            Upon the thigh, just as he turn'd about; <lb/>
            The spear went through, and passing brake the bone, <lb/>
            And at the wound his blood and life went out, <lb n="305"/>
            And on his face he fell down with a groan. <lb/>
            Thoas by Menelaus on the breast, <lb/>
            Close by his shield, a wound received and died. <lb/>
            To Meges Antichus a spear add rest, <lb/>
            But Meges, that his purpose had espied, <lb n="310"/>
            Prevented him, and with his spear him hits <lb/>
            Upon the leg, and near unto the knee, <lb/>
            And all the nerves thereof asunder splits, <lb/>
            And of the wound he died presently. <lb/>
            Antilochus then slew Atymnius, <lb n="315"/>
            The spear went through his flank and struck him dead. <lb/>
            And Marls then struck at Antilochus, <lb/>
            But was prevented by Torasymed, <lb/>
            And slain, pierc'd through the shoulder with his spear. <lb/>
            And thus by two sons of old Nestor slain <lb n="320"/>
            The two sons of Amisodorus were, <lb/>
            And of Sarpedon good companions twain ; <lb/>
            Their sire, Amisodorus, kept at home <lb/>
            The foul Chimæra, that had done much harm, <lb/>
            Devouring people which did that way come, <lb n="325"/>
            Till she was slain by Bellerophontes' arm. <lb/>
            Cleobulus then, pester'd in the throng <lb/>
            By little Ajax, taken was alive, <lb/>
            But after he was taken, liv'd not long, <lb/>
            For Ajax did him of his life deprive. <lb n="330"/>
            For on the neck he gave him such a wound <lb/>
            With his broad sword as made it smoke with blood ; <lb/>
            And presently he fell unto the ground, <lb/>
            And on his eyes perpetual darkness stood. <lb/>
            With swords Peneleos and Lycon prest <lb n="335"/>
            Each other hard. For both their spears had miss'd. <lb/>
            Lycon him hit upon the helmet crest, <lb/>
            And broke his sword. One part staid in his fist, <lb/>
            The other flew. Peneleos him hit <lb/>
            Upon the neck. The sword so far went in, <lb n="340"/>
            As from the shoulders it divided it, <lb/>
            Save that it hung a little by the skin. <lb/>
            Meriones pursued Acamas, <lb/>
            Amongst the Trojans that before him fled ; <pb n="192"/>

            And with a wound i' th' shoulder left him dead. <lb/>
            And by Idomeneus, the king of Crete, <lb/>
            Hit in the mouth was Erymas and slain. <lb/>
            His teeth all stricken out, fell at his feet, <lb/>
            And by the spear pierced through was his brain, <lb n="350"/>
            And fill'd with blood stood staring both his eyes, <lb/>
            Which through his nose and mouth he strove to void, <lb/>
            And gasping, seeks to cast it out, and dies. <lb/>
            Thus the Greek lords each one his man destroyed : <lb/>
            And then as bloody wolves invade the lambs <lb n="355"/>
            Or kids, that by the shepherd's negligence <lb/>
            Are wander'd on the mountains from their dams, <lb/>
            And kill; for nature gives them no defence; <lb/>
            So fiercely on the Trojans fell the Greeks, <lb/>
            But they no more trust to their hands, but feet. <lb n="360"/>
            Ajax to throw his spear at Hector seeks, <lb/>
            But with him Hector has no mind to meet, <lb/>
            But by th' advantage of his skill in war, <lb/>
            Knowing of arrows and of spears the sound, <lb/>
            To keep aloof from Ajax still took care, <lb n="365"/>
            And cover'd with his shield, oft shifted ground. <lb/>
            And though he knew the honour of the day <lb/>
            Would fall unto th* Achæans in the end, <lb/>
            Yet from the field he went not straight away, <lb/>
            But staid and sought his people to defend. <lb n="370"/>
            And then as clouds rise from Olympus high, <lb/>
            And through the air to heaven tend upright <lb/>
            Before tempestuous winds; so rose the cry <lb/>
            At th' Argive ships. Then Hector left the fight, <lb/>
            And after him the Trojans take their heels, <lb n="375"/>
            But in the trench greatly encumbered were, <lb/>
            And many char'ot-poles they brake and wheels. <lb/>
            And when they of the trench were gotten clear, <lb/>
            Fill'd with affright was ev'ry path and way; <lb/>
            Thus at the ships the storm of war gave o'er. <lb n="380"/>
            The horses that were loose ran back to Troy; <lb/>
            And to the ships the Trojans came no more. <lb/>
            Patroclus, where he most disorder found, <lb/>
            Thither he drove, and trod the Trojans down, <lb/>
            And char'ot-seats were tumbled to the ground, <lb n="385"/>
            And many from their seats were headlong thrown. <lb/>
            But the swift horses of Patroclus, which <lb/>
            On Peleus by the Gods bestowed were, <lb/>
            Found no impediment, but leapt the ditch, <lb/>
            Pursuing Hector, who now was not there. <lb n="390"/>
            As when with stormy winds th' autumnal rain <lb/>

            Roaring and foaming, to the ocean wide; <lb/>
            And wash'd away is all man's work, and gone: <lb/>
            So fled the Trojans. These thus put to flight, <lb/>
            He kept the Greeks from going to the town, <lb n="400"/>
            As they desir'd; yet gave not over fight, <lb/>
            But 'twixt the ships and river overthrown <lb/>
            Were many more ; for unrevenged yet <lb/>
            Were many Greeks. First Pronous he kill'd, <lb/>
            Whom with his spear upon the breast he hit, <lb n="405"/>
            Where he was not well cover'd with his shield. <lb/>
            The next he slew was Thestor, Enop's son, <lb/>
            That sate upon his seat amaz'd with fear, <lb/>
            And from his hand the horses' reins were gone. <lb/>
            Patroclus standing by him with his spear, <lb n="410"/>
            Struck him upon the cheek, and there it stuck <lb/>
            Fast in his teeth; and over the fore-wheel <lb/>
            To th' ground Patroclus fetch'd him with a pluck, <lb/>
            As to the bank a fisher pulls an eel, <lb/>
            And to the earth he threw him on his face. <lb n="415"/>
            Eryalus then to him went, in vain, <lb/>
            And by Patroclus slain was on the place, <lb/>
            For with a stone he cleft his head in twain. <lb/>
            Epaltes, Erymas, Amphotcrus, <lb/>
            And Echius, Pyres, Damastorides, <lb n="420"/>
            Euippus, Polymelus, Iphius; <lb/>
            He one upon another kill'd all these. <lb/>
            Sarpedon saw how fast his good friends died, <lb/>
            And that his Lycians ready were to fly ; <lb/>
            He them rebuking, with a loud voice cried, <lb n="425"/>
            Whither dye go? For shame, stay here; for I <lb/>
            Intend to meet this man myself, and know <lb/>
            Who 'tis that here so furiously fights, <lb/>
            And lays so many valiant Trojans low. <lb/>
            This said, he from his chariot alights. <lb n="430"/>
            Patroclus, seeing that, alighted too, <lb/>
            And presently betook him to the fight, <lb/>
            As keen as on a high rock vultures two. <lb/>
            And Jupiter was grieved at the sight, <lb/>
            And to his wife and sister, Juno, said, <lb n="435"/>
            Ay me, my son Sarpedon will be slain, <lb/>
            For by the Fates long since it so is laid; <lb/>
            And now my mind divided is in twain, <lb/>
            To snatch him hence, and carry him again <lb/>
            To Lycia, or now to let him die, <lb n="440"/>
            And by Patroclus' fatal spear be slain. <lb/>
            And Juno then to Jove made this reply. <lb/>
            O Jove, most wilful of the Gods, what say'e ? <lb/>
            A mortal man condemn'd is by the Fates, <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> o </note> <pb n="194"/>

            And you would now the execution stay ? <lb n="445"/>
            Do. But take heed how you offend the states. <lb/>
            And this I tell you further, if you do <lb/>
            Your son, Sarpedon, from the combat save, <lb/>
            The other Gods will look to do so too, <lb/>
            For sons at Troy many immortals have. <lb n="450"/>
            But since you love your son, and for him grieve, <lb/>
            First let Patroclus take away his life, <lb/>
            And then to Death and Sleep commandment give <lb/>
            To carry him, from out the bloody strife, <lb/>
            To Lycia, amongst his friends and kin, <lb n="455"/>
            Who see him will embalmed and buried, <lb/>
            And build a tomb to lay his ashes in, <lb/>
            Which are the honours due unto the dead. <lb/>
            This Juno says ; Jove to it condescends, <lb/>
            And for the honour of his son so dear, <lb n="460"/>
            For rain he drops of blood from heaven sends. <lb/>
            When they were come to one another near, <lb/>
            First threw Patroclus, and kill'd Thrasymed, <lb/>
            A valiant man, Sarpedon's charioteer, <lb/>
            The spear into his belly entered. <lb n="465"/>
            Then at Patroclus flew Sarpedon's spear, <lb/>
            And hit him not, but Pedasus he slew, <lb/>
            The fore-horse of Achilles' car, and now <lb/>
            The sprawling horse caus'd a disorder new. <lb/>
            The yoke screeks, and Automedon lets go <lb n="470"/>
            The reins; whereby the combatants are parted; <lb/>
            Automedon soon found a remedy, <lb/>
            For from the char'ot-seat he nimbly started, <lb/>
            And cut the gears that did the fore-horse tie. <lb/>
            The horses two adjusted were again, <lb n="475"/>
            And then the combatants the fight renew. <lb/>
            And first Sarpedon threw, and threw in vain ; <lb/>
            The spear just over his left shoulder flew. <lb/>
            But not in vain Patroclus' spear was thrown, <lb/>
            That smote him through the midriff. Heavily <lb n="480"/>
            Sarpedon then unto the ground came down, <lb/>
            As if't had been an oak or poplar-tree; <lb/>
            Or as a pine cut down i' th' hill, to be <lb/>
            A mast for some great ship, falls to the ground, <lb/>
            So fell to th' earth Sarpedon heavily, <lb n="485"/>
            And with his armour made the place resound. <lb/>
            As when a bull is by a lion slain, <lb/>
            Under his paw to th' ground he groaning falls; <lb/>
            So groaning fell Sarpedon, in great pain, <lb/>
            And to his friend, the valiant Glaucus, calls, <lb n="490"/>
            And to him said, Now, Glaucus, valiant be, <lb/>
            And set your mind on nothing but to fight. <lb/>
            But first, go call my best men all to me, <lb/>
            And to assist me here join all your might. <lb/>

            The shame thereof for ever will abide. <lb/>
            So therefore quickly call the people: go. <lb/>
            And when he thus had spoken to him, died. <lb/>
            Patroclus on the body sets his foot, <lb/>
            And out again he pull'd the bloody spear, <lb n="500"/>
            With pieces of the midriff sticking to't. <lb/>
            And now away the horses ready were <lb/>
            To run, for no man was upon the seat; <lb/>
            But by the Myrmidons they soon were staid. <lb/>
            The grief of Glaucus then was very great, <lb n="505"/>
            For that he knew not how the king to aid; <lb/>
            For in great pain his arm was with the stroke <lb/>
            Of Teucer's arrow, at the Argive wall, <lb/>
            And found no remedy but to invoke <lb/>
            Apollo, and upon him thus did call: <lb n="510"/>
            Apollo, whether thou in Troy be now <lb/>
            Or Lycia, unto my prayer give ear; <lb/>
            For when distressed men unto thee bow, <lb/>
            Thou dost from any place or distance hear. <lb/>
            I grievously am wounded in the hand, <lb n="515"/>
            The pain whereof up to my shoulder goes; <lb/>
            No longer now can I my spear command, <lb/>
            When most I need to use it 'gainst the foes. <lb/>
            Sarpedon, the brave son of Jove, is slain; <lb/>
            His father of him takes no further care. <lb n="520"/>
            But thou, Apollo, now assuage my pain, <lb/>
            And cure my wound, and make me fit for war; <lb/>
            That I may bring the Lycians to fight, <lb/>
            And I with them the body may defend. <lb/>
            This said, Apollo, by his heavenly might, <lb n="525"/>
            His wound heard up, the pain was at an end; <lb/>
            The blood was gone; encouraged was his mind, <lb/>
            And Glaucus knew Apollo did it all, <lb/>
            And joy'd such favour with the God to find : <lb/>
            Then out he went the Lycians to call. <lb n="530"/>
            That done, he to the Trojan princes goes, <lb/>
            Agenor, Hector, and Polydamas, <lb/>
            Divine AEneas, and craves aid of those; <lb/>
            But what he said, to Hector spoken was. <lb/>
            Hector, said he, your friends you now forget, <lb n="535"/>
            Who from their country hither came so far, <lb/>
            Their lives to venture for your sake. For yet <lb/>
            How to assist them you take little care. <lb/>
            Slain is the King Sarpedon in the fight, <lb/>
            That both with might and justice rul'd the land <lb n="540"/>
            Of Lycia. Let them not vent their spite <lb/>
            Upon the body slain; but by him stand : <lb/>
            The Myrmidons else, for th' Achæans' sake, <lb/>
            Of whom he slew so many at the fleet, <note type="footnote"> O2 </note> <pb n="196"/>

            Will in revenge his armour from him take, <lb n="545"/>
            And do unto him other things unmeet. <lb/>
            This said, the Trojans all were on a flame <lb/>
            To be reveng'd. To Troy he was a wall, <lb/>
            Although he thither as a stranger came; <lb/>
            He many led, himself the best of all. <lb n="550"/>
            And to the Myrmidons they march'd away, <lb/>
            Hector himself before them, at the head, <lb/>
            As angry for Sarpedon's death as they. <lb/>
            Patroclus then the Greeks encouraged, <lb/>
            And speaking first to the Ajaxes two, <lb n="555"/>
            Ajax, said he, both you and you, again <lb/>
            Fight gallantly, as you are us'd to do, <lb/>
            Or better if you can. For I have slain <lb/>
            Sarpedon with my spear, who was the man <lb/>
            That mounted first up to the Argive wall. <lb n="560"/>
            Let's take his armour off him if we can, <lb/>
            And make his fellows some of them to fall. <lb/>
            This said, they into order put their men, <lb/>
            Trojan and Lycian; Greek and Myrmidon; <lb/>
            And to the body slain return again, <lb n="565"/>
            And fiercely one another fell upon. <lb/>
            And Jove the place with darkness cover'd round, <lb/>
            As long as they were fighting 'bout his son. <lb/>
            And at the first the Greeks forsook the ground. <lb/>
            For then there was a noble Myrmidon, <lb n="570"/>
            Epigeus, that king was formerly <lb/>
            Of Budeon, and forced thence away <lb/>
            For a man's death, to Peleus did fly, <lb/>
            Who sent him with Achilles unto Troy. <lb/>
            And now no sooner layed had his hand <lb n="575"/>
            Upon Sarpedon's body, but was slain <lb/>
            By a great stone, that flew from Hector's hand, <lb/>
            And broke (for all his casque) his skull in twain. <lb/>
            Down he upon the dead king falling, dies. <lb/>
            Patroclus, when he saw his friend thus fall, <lb n="580"/>
            Swift as a hawk that at a starling flies, <lb/>
            Up to the foes ran, and amongst them all <lb/>
            He threw a stone, which lighted on the neck <lb/>
            Of Stenelaus, and the tendon rent. <lb/>
            And this gave to the Trojan horse a check; <lb n="585"/>
            And back a little Hector with them went, <lb/>
            As far as one can for experiment, <lb/>
            Or at a foe in battle throw a spear; <lb/>
            So far back Hector with his char'ot went, <lb/>
            The Argives them pursuing in the rear. <lb n="590"/>
            But Glaucus, that did then the Lycians lead, <lb/>
            Pursu'd by Bathycles, and very near, <lb/>
            Upon a sudden to him turn'd his head, <lb/>
            And deep into his breast he thrust his spear, <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            And down he fell. The Trojans then were glad, <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> The acts of Pa­ <lb/>
            troclus, and bia <lb/>
            death. </note> <lb n="595"/>
            And at the body fallen boldly staid. <lb/>
            On th' other side, the Greeks were very sad <lb/>
            To lose so good a man, but not dismay'd. <lb/>
            Meriones then slew Laogonus, <lb/>
            Son of Onetor, priest of Jupiter, <lb n="600"/>
            And honour'd like a God in Gargarus, <lb/>
            The spear him pierc'd between the cheek and ear. <lb/>
            Then at Meriones AEneas threw, <lb/>
            And was in hopes to give him his death's wound; <lb/>
            But he then stoop'd, and o'er him the spear flew, <lb n="605"/>
            And one end shook, the other stuck i' th' ground. <lb/>
            At this AEneas, angry, to him said, <lb/>
            Meriones, as well as you can dance, <lb/>
            My spear was like your motion to have staid, <lb/>
            And that it did not, think it was by chance. <lb n="610"/>
            To him replying, said Meriones, <lb/>
            AEneas, strong and valiant as you are, <lb/>
            You cannot kill men whom and when you please; <lb/>
            Yourself are subject to the chance of war <lb/>
            As well as I. And if my spear fall right <lb n="615"/>
            (As much as to your hands you trust) you'll die <lb/>
            Like other men, and I win honour by't, <lb/>
            And to the shades below your soul will fly. <lb/>
            This said, Patroclus came and him reproved. <lb/>
            Meriones, why talk you thus, said lie, <lb n="620"/>
            D'ye think the Trojans can be hence removed <lb/>
            With evil words, till many slain there be ? <lb/>
            In council words may somewhat signify, <lb/>
            But hands in war determine the event, <lb/>
            'Tis to no purpose words to multiply. <lb n="625"/>
            This said, away they both together went, <lb/>
            And by and by was heard a mighty sound, <lb/>
            As if the woods were falling on the hills, <lb/>
            Of men in armour falling to the ground, <lb/>
            And swords and spears on helmets and on shields. <lb n="630"/>
            Sarpedon cover'd was from top to toe, <lb/>
            With dust and spears, and so besmear'd with blood, <lb/>
            That wise he must have been that could him know, <lb/>
            Though who it was they all well understood, <lb/>
            And busy were about him as the flies <lb n="635"/>
            That buzz in summer time about the pans <lb/>
            Of milk. And all this while Jove kept his eyes <lb/>
            Upon the battle; and advising stands, <lb/>
            Whether 'twere best to let Patroclus die <lb/>
            Upon Sarpedon, slain by Hector, or <lb n="640"/>
            Let him go on, and follow those that fly, <lb/>
            And of the Trojans make the slaughter more. <lb/>
            At last resolv'd, he made the Trojans fly. <lb/>
            Patroclus then pursu'd them up to Troy, <pb n="198"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> The acts of Pa­ <lb/>
            troclus, and his <lb/>

            And as he went, made many of them die; <lb n="645"/>
            And Hector was the first that fled away, <lb/>
            Not ignorant of Jove's apostacy. <lb/>
            And then the lusty Lycians also fled; <lb/>
            Whose king, Sarpedon, now i' th' heap did lie, <lb/>
            Stretch'd out on th' earth amongst the other dead. <lb n="650"/>
            And him Patroclus of his armour strips, <lb/>
            His mighty armour, all of solid brass, <lb/>
            And sent it by his fellows to the ships. <lb/>
            Thus slain and stripp'd Jove's son Sarpedon was. <lb/>
            Then Jove unto Apollo spake, and said, <lb n="655"/>
            Go, Phœbus, bear Sarpedon from the fight <lb/>
            A great way off, and let him be array'd <lb/>
            In an immortal garment, pure and bright. <lb/>
            But in the river clear first wash him clean, <lb/>
            And with ambrosia anoint his skin. <lb n="660"/>
            Let Death and Sleep, two sisters, bear him then <lb/>
            To Lycia, unto his friends and kin, <lb/>
            By whom his body will embalmed be, <lb/>
            And tomb and pillar set upon his grave, <lb/>
            Whereby preserv'd will be his memory, <lb n="665"/>
            Which all the honour is the dead can have. <lb/>
            This said, Apollo down from Ida came, <lb/>
            And bare Sarpedon's body from the fight. <lb/>
            And far off in the river wash'd the same, <lb/>
            And with ambrosia his body white <lb n="670"/>
            Anointed, and with garments fair array'd, <lb/>
            Immortal garments; and into the hands <lb/>
            Of Death and Sleep committed it, who laid <lb/>
            It down again amongst the Lycians. <lb/>
            Patroclus then commands Automedon <lb n="675"/>
            To drive to Troy. Not well; for had he then <lb/>
            The counsel of Achilles thought upon, <lb/>
            He had escap'd. But Jove knows more than men, <lb/>
            And quickly can take from a man of might, <lb/>
            And to a weaker give the victory, <lb n="680"/>
            Whom he himself encourage will to fight, <lb/>
            As now by Jove himself set on was he. <lb/>
            But while Patroclus chas'd the Trojans thus, <lb/>
            Who fell ? Adrestus, and Autonous, <lb/>
            Epistor, Melanippus, Perimus, <lb n="685"/>
            Pylartus, Mulius, and Echeclus, <lb/>
            And Elisus. And taken had been Troy <lb/>
            Now by Patroclus, but that Phœbus stood <lb/>
            Upon the tow'r, and push'd him still away, <lb/>
            To vex the Greeks, and do the Trojans good. <lb n="690"/>
            For thrice he mounted, and was thrice put back <lb/>
            By the immortal hand ; but when again <lb/>
            He mounting was, Apollo to him spake. <lb/>
            Retire, said he,Patroclus, 'tis in vain; <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            It is not you that Ilium can win, <note type="margin"> LIB, XVI. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>

            Nor Thetis son, a better man than you. <lb/>
            Patroclus, at these words, great fear was in, <lb/>
            And far off from the wall himself withdrew. <lb/>
            Now Hector was upon his char'ot seat, <lb/>
            I th Scæan gate, and did deliberate <lb n="700"/>
            Whether to make the Trojans to retreat, <lb/>
            And when they were come in to shut the gate, <lb/>
            Or go to th' fight. While he consulted thus, <lb/>
            Apollo came, and standing by his side <lb/>
            In likeness of his uncle Asius, <lb n="705"/>
            Him sharply did for standing idle chide. <lb/>
            Hector, said he, why stay you here ? If I <lb/>
            Exceeded you in strength as you do me, <lb/>
            I teach you would, in such necessity <lb/>
            To quit the field thus, and unuseful be. <lb n="710"/>
            Go: to Patroclus now directly drive, <lb/>
            And doubt not but that by Apollo's aid, <lb/>
            You may him of his life and arms deprive. <lb/>
            Away went Phœbus when he this had said, <lb/>
            And Hector then returned to the fight, <lb n="715"/>
            While Phœbus did the Argive throng dismay. <lb/>
            Cebriones still kept his horses right <lb/>
            Upon Patroclus. For upon the way <lb/>
            Hector pass'd through the Greeks, and killed none. <lb/>
            Patroclus then alighting, with his spear <lb n="720"/>
            In his left hand, in th' other took a stone, <lb/>
            And with it killed Hector's charioteer, <lb/>
            Cebriones, King Priam's bastard SOil. <lb/>
            Above his eyes, upon his forehead just, <lb/>
            Patroclus hit him with the knobby stone, <lb n="725"/>
            Then from his seat he dropp'd into the dust. <lb/>
            Broke was his skull, his eye-brows crush'd int' one, <lb/>
            And at his feet, before him fell his eyes. <lb/>
            Patroclus scoff'd, and said 'tis nimbly done. <lb/>
            And proudly thus, insulting, o'er him cries: <lb n="730"/>
            Oh, that we had a man could leap like him, <lb/>
            And set upon one of our ships were he, <lb/>
            To leap into the sea, and groping swim! <lb/>
            How satisfied with oysters should we be! <lb/>
            So quickly down he tumbled to the plain, <lb n="735"/>
            I see that there good tumblers are in Troy. <lb/>
            This said, he ran unto the body slain, <lb/>
            Himself with his own valour to destroy. <lb/>
            And then unto the ground leapt Hector too, <lb/>
            And at Cebriones his body, fought <lb n="740"/>
            He and Patroclus, fierce as lions two, <lb/>
            That had a great stag, slain by chance, found out; <lb/>
            And hungry both, strove who should first be fed, <lb/>
            So sought these two each other to destroy. <pb n="200"/>

            troche, and his <lb/>

            And Hector pull'd the dead man by the head, <lb n="745"/>
            Patroclus by the heels, the other way. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the Greeks and Trojans fighting stood, <lb/>
            As when between two hills two great winds fight, <lb/>
            On both sides strongly shaken is the wood, <lb/>
            And boughs beat one another with great might, <lb n="750"/>
            And with a horrid noise together clash, <lb/>
            And many lusty limbs then broken are, <lb/>
            Of barky corme, broad beech, and lofty ash; <lb/>
            So did it with the Greeks and Trojans fare. <lb/>
            About Cebriones stuck many a spear, <lb n="755"/>
            And many a fledg'd arrow from the bow, <lb/>
            And many shields by great stones broken were, <lb/>
            While he along in bed of dust lay low, <lb/>
            And quite forgotten had his chivalry. <lb/>
            Now all the while that mounting was the sun, <lb n="760"/>
            The weapons flew, and men fell equally, <lb/>
            But after noon, when half the day was gone, <lb/>
            The Argives clearly had the victory, <lb/>
            And from the field Cebriones they drew, <lb/>
            And stripp'd there of his armour, let him lie. <lb n="765"/>
            Patroclus then the Trojans chas'd anew, <lb/>
            And there before the Myrmidons leapt out, <lb/>
            Like Mars himself, and thrice nine Trojans slew. <lb/>
            And out again he went; but at that bout, <lb/>
            Upon himself untimely death he drew. <lb n="770"/>
            For Phœbus came (Patroclus saw him not) <lb/>
            Wrapp'd up in air, and standing on the ground, <lb/>
            Between the shoulders with his hand him smote, <lb/>
            That all about him seemed to go round, <lb/>
            And from his head his helmet then he flung <lb n="775"/>
            Into the dust, and foul it was all o'er, <lb/>
            And beaten by the hoofs of horses rung, <lb/>
            That never had been so defil'd before, <lb/>
            When on Achilles' godlike head it sate. <lb/>
            But Jove to Hector gave it now to wear, <lb n="780"/>
            And only then, when near him was his fate. <lb/>
            Moreover, Phoebus brake Patroclus' spear, <lb/>
            A heavy spear, well armed at the head, <lb/>
            And pluck'd his mighty shield out of his hand, <lb/>
            And left him of his arms uncovered. <lb n="785"/>
            With this, Patroclus did amazed stand; <lb/>
            And near unto him then a Dardan came, <lb/>
            And in the back he smote him with his spear; <lb/>
            Panthorides Euphorbus was his name, <lb/>
            And killed him not, but back ran to the rear. <lb n="790"/>
            For though he well could fight, and ride, and run, <lb/>
            And going first abroad to learn the wars, <lb/>
            He was by no man of his age outdone, <lb/>
            And had o'erthrown twice ten men from their cars; <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            Yet for Patroclus now he durst not stay, <note type="margin"> LID. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> The acts of Pa­ <lb/>
            troche, and his <lb/>
            death. </note> <lb n="795"/>
            Although he wounded and disarmed were. <lb/>
            Then to the rear Patroclus went away; <lb/>
            And after him ran Hector with his spear, <lb/>
            And at the belly struck him through the side, <lb/>
            And down he fell. The Greeks were grieved sore. <lb n="800"/>
            As when at a small fountain almost dried, <lb/>
            Together come a lion and a boar <lb/>
            With equal thirst, and drink they both would fain, <lb/>
            But fight who shall drink first, slain is the boar; <lb/>
            So now by Hector was Patroclus slain, <lb n="805"/>
            Though many Trojans he had kill'd before. <lb/>
            And Hector then triumphing o'er him said, <lb/>
            Patroclus, you thought sure t' have stormed Troy, <lb/>
            And in your ships our women t' have convey'd <lb/>
            To Argos with you, when you went away. <lb n="810"/>
            Were you so simple that you could not see <lb/>
            That Hector, with his horses and his spear, <lb/>
            Protects the Trojans from captivity ? <lb/>
            Now shall you for the dogs and fowls lie here; <lb/>
            Nor can Achilles do you any good, <lb n="815"/>
            That bad you, 't may be, when you from him went, <lb/>
            Not to return, till dyed in his blood, <lb/>
            You Hector's coat had from his shoulders rent, <lb/>
            And vain enough you were to promise it. <lb/>
            Patroclus, with a feeble voice, replied, <lb n="820"/>
            Hector, you now may boast as you think fit, <lb/>
            And in your own ability take pride. <lb/>
            T' Apollo first my death I owe, who threw <lb/>
            My armour from my body to the ground ; <lb/>
            I could have slain else twenty such as you, <lb n="825"/>
            And from Euphorbus I received a wound. <lb/>
            To bring me down, you were but one of three. <lb/>
            But hear me, and remember what I say; <lb/>
            Hector, you will not long live after me, <lb/>
            And only for Achilles' hand you stay. <lb n="830"/>
            And at these words he was of life bereft. <lb/>
            His soul unto th' infernal regions fled, <lb/>
            Lamenting so much youth and vigour left; <lb/>
            And Hector to him spake again, though dead. <lb/>
            Patroclus, why do you foretell my death ? <lb n="835"/>
            Who knows but that Achilles may be slain <lb/>
            By me first, and before me lose his breath ? <lb/>
            This said, he pulled out the spear again, <lb/>
            And presently pursued Automedon, <lb/>
            Who of Achilles was the char'otecr; <lb n="840"/>
            But he away was carried and gone <lb/>
            By Peleus' horses, that immortal were.</p><pb n="202"/>

            That slain Patroclus lay upon the ground, <lb/>
            Careful, as of her first calf is a cow, <lb/>
            To th' body went and walked about it round, <lb/>
            Couching his spear and holding out his shield, <lb n="5"/>
            Resolv'd to kill him, whosoe'er he was, <lb/>
            That durst to stand against him in the field. <lb/>
            Then to him said Euphorbus, Menelaus, <lb/>
            Retire, let me advise you, from the dead. <lb/>
            For I am he that gave him the first wound, <lb n="10"/>
            That with his arms I may be honoured; <lb/>
            Lest with my spear I strike you to the ground. <lb/>
            And Menelaus to him thus replied. <lb/>
            O Jupiter, in lion never was, <lb/>
            Nor yet in panther, nor in boar, such pride <lb n="15"/>
            (Though other beasts in strength they far surpass) <lb/>
            As in these sons of Panthus. Though they know, <lb/>
            When Hyperenor proudly me defied, <lb/>
            And spitefully did value me below <lb/>
            All other Greeks, that by my hand he died, <lb n="20"/>
            And sorry were his parents and his wife. <lb/>
            Now you succeed will to your brother's fate. <lb/>
            Begone, then, if you mean to save your life, <lb/>
            And quickly, or you will be wise too late. <lb/>
            No, Menelaus, said Euphorbus then, <lb n="25"/>
            Since you have griev'd his parents and his wife, <lb/>
            'Tis best, I think, to comfort them again, <lb/>
            By making you pay for it with your life. <lb/>
            For though intolerable be their grief, <lb/>
            Yet when they see your armour and your head <lb n="30"/>
            Brought to them home, it will be some relief. <lb/>
            But this by fight must be determined. <lb/>
            This said, he made a thrust at Menelaus, <lb/>
            Which he received on his trusty shield, <lb/>
            It entered not, resisted by the brass, <lb n="35"/>
            Which bent the point, and passage none did yield. <lb/>
            Then, as he backward stepp'd to get away, <lb/>
            He by Atrides on the breast was hit. <lb/>
            The spear press'd with his hand not there did stay, <lb/>
            But to his neck went up and pierced it. <lb n="40"/>
            And then the ground he with his armour knocks, <lb/>
            And dyed was with blood his dainty hair, <lb/>
            Those fine, with gold and silver twined, locks, <lb/>
            Like those that Cytherea's Graces wear. <lb/>

            In open place, and where are many springs, <lb/>
            And stirr'd by gentle winds it is grown big, <lb/>
            Then comes a storm and to the ground it flings; <lb/>
            So by Atrides fell Euphorbus now. <lb/>
            As when a lion cometh from the wood <lb n="50"/>
            Into the herd and seizeth on a cow, <lb/>
            First breaks her neck, then feeds he on her blood <lb/>
            And bowels, dogs and herdsmen looking on <lb/>
            And hueing him, that dare not to go near; <lb/>
            So then upon Atrides ventured none, <lb n="55"/>
            So much the Trojans stricken were with fear. <lb/>
            And now into the hands of Menelaus <lb/>
            Patroclus' armour came; and borne away <lb/>
            Had been, but that by Phœbus cross'd he was, <lb/>
            That was a friend to Hector and to Troy. <lb n="60"/>
            And in the shape of Monies gone was then <lb/>
            (Whom now the Cicon regiments obey'd) <lb/>
            To call back Hector to the field again, <lb/>
            And overtaking him, thus to him said: <lb/>
            Hector, you here Automedon pursue <lb n="65"/>
            To take Achilles' horses all in vain, <lb/>
            Which never will be won or rul'd by you, <lb/>
            And suffer good Euphorbus to be slain <lb/>
            By Menelaus at the body dead <lb/>
            Of Menœtiades. Then went his way. <lb n="70"/>
            And Hector grieved turn'd about his head, <lb/>
            And saw how on the ground Euphorbus lay, <lb/>
            Bleeding and naked left by Menelaus. <lb/>
            And Hector then, enflamed with the sight, <lb/>
            Like raging fire did through the squadrons pass. <lb n="75"/>
            And with great cry returned to the fight. <lb/>
            And cold was then Atrides at the heart, <lb/>
            And with himself he thus disputing stands ; <lb/>
            If I should from the body slain depart, <lb/>
            The Greeks would say of me but little good; <lb n="80"/>
            But if I stay alone here 'twill be worse <lb/>
            Than anything the Greeks can of me say. <lb/>
            For he brings with him all the Trojan force. <lb/>
            But wherefore do I thus disputing stay ? <lb/>
            Who fights against him whom a God doth aid, <lb n="85"/>
            Draws on himself a great and certain ill. <lb/>
            My best course then is Hector to avoid, <lb/>
            And let the Greeks say of it what they will. <lb/>
            But if of Ajax I could get a sight, <lb/>
            Then he and I together would not fear <lb n="90"/>
            With Hector aided by a God to fight, <lb/>
            And to Achilles the dead body bear. <lb/>
            Whilst thus unto himself he laid the case, <lb/>
            The Trojans came with Hector at their head, <pb n="204"/>

            And going left behind the body dead. <lb/>
            But oft look'd back. As when a lion is <lb/>
            Compell'd to leave a fold by men and dogs, <lb/>
            He oft looks back, and runs not for all this, <lb/>
            But tow'rds the wood still slowly on he jogs <lb n="100"/>
            Unwillingly; his heart's too big to run; <lb/>
            So Menelaus off went safe and sound. <lb/>
            And then for Ajax, son of Telamon, <lb/>
            Look'd roundabout, and 'mongst his troops him found <lb/>
            Inciting them to fight. For not a man <lb n="105"/>
            But frighted was by Phœbus and dismay'd; <lb/>
            And with all speed Atrides to him ran, <lb/>
            And standing at his side unto him said,. <lb/>
            Come, Ajax, quickly come away with me <lb/>
            To save Patroclus from the Trojans' wrath, <lb n="110"/>
            That to Achilles carried he may be <lb/>
            Though naked. For his armour Hector bath. <lb/>
            Ajax enrag'd at this, flies to the place <lb/>
            With Menelaus where Patroclus lay, <lb/>
            When Hector from the field him drawing was <lb n="115"/>
            (Having already snatch'd his arms away) <lb/>
            Unto the Trojans to cut off his head, <lb/>
            And give the body to the dogs to eat. <lb/>
            But when great Ajax thither came, he fled, <lb/>
            And to the Trojans made a quick retreat; <lb n="120"/>
            And order gave to bear the arms to Troy, <lb/>
            Achilles' arms, a noble monument <lb/>
            Of his great deed. But Ajax still did stay, <lb/>
            And with his shield about the body went. <lb/>
            As when a lion, his whelps following him, <lb n="125"/>
            Into the open fields comes from the wood, <lb/>
            And hunters meets, he looks upon them grim ; <lb/>
            So Ajax looking, by Patroclus stood. <lb/>
            And Glaucus then, that led the Lycian bands, <lb/>
            To Hector went and frowning to him said, <lb n="130"/>
            Though you be thought a good man of your hands, <lb/>
            Hector, it is not so I am afraid. <lb/>
            Consider first if you the town can save <lb/>
            By Trojans only, without other guard, <lb/>
            And of their service how great need you have; <lb n="135"/>
            And then how lightly you their pains regard. <lb/>
            What Lycian again will for you fight ? <lb/>
            Or how will you defend a meaner man, <lb/>
            That left Sarpedon to the Argives' spite <lb/>
            And sport, and from his body frighted ran, <lb n="140"/>
            That was your friend and had such service done ? <lb/>
            So that if I were won to lead them home, <lb/>
            You'd find a little after we were gone, <lb/>
            The utmost fate of Troy were on it come. <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            For if the Trojans had as forward been, <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> The seventh <lb/>
            battle, about <lb/>
            Patroclus's body. </note> <lb n="145"/>
            As men should be that for their country fight, <lb/>
            Patroclus' body we in Troy had seen, <lb/>
            Fetch'd from the field, for all the Argives' might; <lb/>
            And from the Greeks in change we might have had <lb/>
            Sarpedon s corpse, and brought it into Troy; <lb n="150"/>
            And all the Greeks thereof would have been glad, <lb/>
            So great experience of his worth had they. <lb/>
            But you to Ajax never yet durst go, <lb/>
            And when he came to you, you from him ran <lb/>
            Into the throng o' th' Trojans. And why so ? <lb n="155"/>
            But that you know he is the better man. <lb/>
            Then Hector, frowning on him, thus replied, <lb/>
            Glaucus, 'tis strange that such a man as you <lb/>
            Should so severely without cause me chide ; <lb/>
            I thought you very wise, but 'tis not true. <lb n="160"/>
            You say I dare not with great Ajax fight, <lb/>
            When I do neither foot nor horsemen shun, <lb/>
            But only way give sometimes to the might <lb/>
            Of Jove when he the enemy sets on. <lb/>
            For he to whom he will gives victory, <lb n="165"/>
            And from the proud their courage takes away. <lb/>
            But to the fight come with me now, and see <lb/>
            If I be such a coward as you say ; <lb/>
            And do not from Patroclus' body make <lb/>
            Some of the Argives to retire again. <lb n="170"/>
            This said, he turn'd and to the Trojans spake. <lb/>
            Trojans, said he, and Lycians, play the men <lb/>
            Whilst I myself in these good arms array, <lb/>
            Which from Patroclus' body slain I took. <lb/>
            This said, he from the field went toward Troy, <lb n="175"/>
            And quickly those that bare them overtook, <lb/>
            And gave to them the armour he then wore, <lb/>
            And th' armour of Patroclus there puts on, <lb/>
            Giv'n by the Gods to Peleus heretofore, <lb/>
            Which he when aged gave unto his son, <lb n="180"/>
            But were not kept by him till he was old. <lb/>
            Then Jove that out of sight in heaven sat, <lb/>
            And Hector in this armour did behold, <lb/>
            Poor man, said he, he knoweth not his fate, <lb/>
            Which now is near; and at it shook his head, <lb n="185"/>
            And said, though now these heavenly arms you wear <lb/>
            Of this great man whom all men else did dread, <lb/>
            Killing the gentle knight that did them bear, <lb/>
            And so unhandsomely, you'll never go <lb/>
            To show them to Andromache your wife. <lb n="190"/>
            Yet now you shall prevail against the foe, <lb/>
            To please you, since thus shorten'd is your life. <lb/>
            And as he said it, seal'd it with a nod. <lb/>
            Now Hector, having on these arms and fit, <pb n="206"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> The seventh <lb/>

            Into his breast went in the mighty God <lb n="195"/>
            Of battle, and with courage filled it. <lb/>
            Then Hector, like Achilles shining, came <lb/>
            To his confederates, and 'mongst them went, <lb/>
            Calling upon the best of them by name, <lb/>
            To give unto them all encouragement, <lb n="200"/>
            Mesthles, and Glaucus, and Thersilochus, <lb/>
            Asteropæus, and Hippothous, <lb/>
            Medon, Disinor, Phorcys, Chromius, <lb/>
            And you, the skilful augur, Ennomus, <lb/>
            And you, the thousands that to aid me come, <lb n="205"/>
            'Tis not to muster that you called are, <lb/>
            But to defend the wives of Ilium, <lb/>
            And babes, against the Greeks, that love the war ; <lb/>
            Which to prevent, the Trojans day by day <lb/>
            With pay and with free quarter, tired are. <lb n="210"/>
            Lees therefore fight, and either die or slay; <lb/>
            For there's no other traffic at the war, <lb/>
            And he that shall Patroclus' body gain, <lb/>
            And, spite of Ajax, fetch it off the field, <lb/>
            Half of his armour shall have for his pain, <lb n="215"/>
            And I will half the honour to him yield. <lb/>
            This said, the Trojans on the Argives fell <lb/>
            With all their weight, and made account to gain <lb/>
            Patroclus' body ; for they could not tell <lb/>
            How many Trojans there would first be slain. <lb n="220"/>
            And then to Menelaus Ajax said, <lb/>
            I fear we shall no more return from Troy; <lb/>
            And am not for Patroclus so afraid <lb/>
            (That to the dogs is sure to be a prey) <lb/>
            As for myself and you; with such a cloud <lb n="225"/>
            Of Trojans Hector thund'ring cometh on. <lb/>
            Go therefore, presently, and call aloud <lb/>
            To th' other princes. Other help there's none. <lb/>
            Then Menelaus cried out aloud, <lb/>
            O you that have command in th' Argive host, <lb n="230"/>
            And diet with Atrides are allow'd, <lb/>
            And drink unstinted at the public cost, <lb/>
            'Tis hard to call you ev'ry one by name, <lb/>
            But you that hear me come away with speed; <lb/>
            For to us all 'twill be no little shame, <lb n="235"/>
            To let the dogs upon Patroclus feed. <lb/>
            This said, first little Ajax running came, <lb/>
            And with Idomeneus, Meriones, <lb/>
            Then many more came in; but who can name <lb/>
            The number great that came in after these ? <lb n="240"/>
            And Hector with the Trojans then came in, <lb/>
            And as the sea that rolleth to the shore <lb/>
            Which by some mighty wind had driven been ; <lb/>
            So to the fight the Trojans marching roar. <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            The Greeks about Patroclus' body staid, <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> The seventh <lb/>
            battle, about <lb/>
            Patroclus's body. </note> <lb n="245"/>
            All of one mind, all covered with their shields, <lb/>
            And on their head Jove then a great fog laid, <lb/>
            And all the place about with darkness fills. <lb/>
            For while Patroclus was alive, and serv'd <lb/>
            Achilles, Jove took at him no offence, <lb n="250"/>
            Nor thought that to be dogs' meat he deserv'd, <lb/>
            And therefore urg'd the Greeks to his defence. <lb/>
            At first the Trojans made the Greeks to fly, <lb/>
            And leave the body, but they killed none, <lb/>
            So great a fog upon the place did lie. <lb n="255"/>
            Then with his friends again came Ajax on, <lb/>
            Of all the Greeks, for person and for might, <lb/>
            The bravest man, excepting Thetis' son. <lb/>
            The Trojans, when the Greeks refused to fight, <lb/>
            The body seiz'd, and thought the bus'ness done. <lb n="260"/>
            As when a boar, pursu'd by hounds and men, <lb/>
            Upon them turns, they scattered are and fly; <lb/>
            So, when great Ajax to them came again, <lb/>
            The Trojans, scattered, let Patroclus lie. <lb/>
            For when Hippothous was in great hope <lb n="265"/>
            To drag Patroclus' body up to Troy, <lb/>
            And to his ankle tyed had a rope, <lb/>
            Arrived to him was his latest day. <lb/>
            For Ajax now was come unto him near, <lb/>
            And smote him through the helmet and the brain, <lb n="270"/>
            Which, stained with his blood, stuck to the spear, <lb/>
            And down he threw Patroclus' foot again, <lb/>
            And with it near unto the body fell, <lb/>
            Deprived of life by mighty Ajax' spear, <lb/>
            Far from Larissa, where his friends did dwell, <lb n="275"/>
            And never for his breeding payed were. <lb/>
            And Hector then a spear at Ajax threw, <lb/>
            Which he perceiving, did a little shun, <lb/>
            A very little it beside him flew, <lb/>
            And killed Schedius, Iphitus' son, <lb n="280"/>
            That of Photæans all was far the best, <lb/>
            And did in well-built Panopæa reign. <lb/>
            The spear, sharp-pointed, entered at his breast, <lb/>
            And at his shoulder out it went again. <lb/>
            And Ajax then the valiant Phorcys slew, <lb n="285"/>
            That 'bout the body of Hippothous went. <lb/>
            The spear through breast-plate and through belly flew, <lb/>
            And as it pass'd the guts in pieces rent. <lb/>
            Then Hector and the Trojan lords gave way, <lb/>
            Retiring from the Argive lords; and thus <lb n="290"/>
            By th' Argives coming in, without delay, <lb/>
            Stripp'd were both Phorcys and Hippothous. <lb/>
            And now the Trojans had, for want of heart, <lb/>
            Been chased by the Argives up to Troy, <pb n="208"/>

            Without the Gods, an honourable day; <lb/>
            Had not Apollo, like to Periphas, <lb/>
            Anchises' squire, to iEneas come disguised, <lb/>
            That very wise now grown, and aged was, <lb/>
            And standing by his side, him thus advised; <lb n="300"/>
            Æneas, cannot you, without the Gods, <lb/>
            As well as the Achæans, gain the day <lb/>
            By valour, since in men they have no odds ? <lb/>
            For Jove would rather you should win than they. <lb/>
            Thus Phæbus said. AEneas knew 'twas he ; <lb n="305"/>
            And with a loud voice, unto Hector said: <lb/>
            Hector, and you who the commanders be <lb/>
            Of Trojans, or have brought unto them aid, <lb/>
            Oh, what a shame 'tis for us thus to run <lb/>
            Before the Greeks, ourselves in Troy to hide ! <lb n="310"/>
            But come, there yet amongst the Gods is one <lb/>
            That hath assur'd me Jove is on our side. <lb/>
            This said, before the Trojans he leapt out, <lb/>
            And with his spear in hand, stood at their head. <lb/>
            And when he made them had to wheel about, <lb n="315"/>
            Unto the body he directly led, <lb/>
            And with his spear Leocritus he slew, <lb/>
            The friend of Lycomed, Arisbas' son; <lb/>
            And Lycomed, displeas'd, at Hector threw, <lb/>
            And hit him not, but kill'd Apisaon ; <lb n="320"/>
            Of all that from Pæonia pass'd the seas, <lb/>
            He was in battle of the greatest might, <lb/>
            Excepting no man but Asteropæus; <lb/>
            Who angry at his fall went to the fight. <lb/>
            But now the Greeks about Patroclus stood <lb n="325"/>
            So close, with spears advanced, with bucklers hidden, <lb/>
            That there Asteropæus did no good; <lb/>
            For by great Ajax so they had been bidden. <lb/>
            Let none from hence again retire, said he, <lb/>
            Nor any man before the rest skip out, <lb n="330"/>
            But stand together till you charged be. <lb/>
            Thus roaring to them Ajax went about, <lb/>
            And thick the Trojans and their aids now fell, <lb/>
            And with their blood bedewed was the ground. <lb/>
            Nor did the Argives come off very well; <lb n="335"/>
            But fewer of them 'mongst the dead were found, <lb/>
            For standing close, one shield sav'd more than one. <lb/>
            Thus keen as fire on both sides fought they here; <lb/>
            And such a darkness was the place upon, <lb/>
            As if nor sun nor moon in safety were. <lb n="340"/>
            But th' other places all about had light, <lb/>
            And brightly did the sun in Ida shine, <lb/>
            And gentle at a distance was the fight, <lb/>
            And one another's spear did oft decline. <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>

            Both of the Argives and the Trojans stood, <lb/>
            The pain they suffer'd cannot be express'd, <lb/>
            Of restless labour, and of loss of blood. <lb/>
            But of Patroclus, by the Trojans kill'd, <lb/>
            Antilochus and Torasymed knew not, <lb n="350"/>
            But fought in other places of the field, <lb/>
            And that he still pursu'd the Trojans thought, <lb/>
            When for his body, who the same should get, <lb/>
            Now fighting were the Trojans and the Greeks, <lb/>
            And from their knees and legs ran down the sweat, <lb n="355"/>
            And stained were with blood their arms and cheeks. <lb/>
            As when men set themselves about the skin <lb/>
            Of some fat bull, and stretch it ev'ry way, <lb/>
            That th' humour may go out, the grease go in, <lb/>
            Just so Patroclus' body tugged they, <lb n="360"/>
            Trojans to Troy, and Argives to the fleet; <lb/>
            And thereupon arose this mighty fray. <lb/>
            If Mars or Pallas had been there to see't, <lb/>
            They had not known on whom a fault to lay, <lb/>
            Though angry they had been; such work was then <lb n="365"/>
            By Jove, about Patroclus' body, set <lb/>
            For Trojans and for Argives, horse and men. <lb/>
            But to Achilles known it was not yet, <lb/>
            That slain by th' Trojans was his favourite. <lb/>
            For now not far off from the Trojan wall, <lb n="370"/>
            At a great distance from him, was the fight, <lb/>
            So that he thought not on his death at all; <lb/>
            But having chas'd the Trojans to the gates <lb/>
            Of Ilium, that straight he would come back ; <lb/>
            For well he knew 'twas order'd by the Fates, <lb n="375"/>
            Patroclus never should the city sack. <lb/>
            His mother, Thetis, oft had told him that, <lb/>
            As she before had told it been by Jove; <lb/>
            But quite Patroclus' destiny forgat, <lb/>
            Or knew it not, whom he so much did love. <lb n="380"/>
            The Greeks and Trojans at the body staid <lb/>
            Together close, and one another kill'd. <lb/>
            And one Achæan to another said, <lb/>
            'Twould be a great disgrace to quit the field, <lb/>
            And leave the body of Patroclus thus; <lb n="385"/>
            I rather had by th' earth we swallowed were, <lb/>
            Than they should have it and crow over us, <lb/>
            And to the town the noble body bear. <lb/>
            The Trojans likewise t' one another cried, <lb/>

            By this man's body, let us here abide. <lb/>
            And then the clamour rose up to the sky. <lb/>
            Achilles' steeds now, with Automedon <lb/>
            Upon the car, without the battle stood ; <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> P </note> <pb n="210"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> The seventh <lb/>
            battle, about <lb/>
            Patroclua's body. </note> <lb/>
            But to the fight he could not get them on. <lb n="395"/>
            He to them call'd, but that would do no good ; <lb/>
            And then he flatters them, then threats, then whips, <lb/>
            But for Patroclus griev'd, they would not go <lb/>
            With th' Argives to the fight, nor to the ships, <lb/>
            But lay down on the ground, and wept for woe <lb n="400"/>
            That they had lost a gentle char'oteer. <lb/>
            Jove, seeing them upon the ground thus laid, <lb/>
            And for Patroclus how they grieved were, <lb/>
            Shaking his head, unto himself he said, <lb/>
            Poor steeds, why did I you on man bestow, <lb n="405"/>
            That mortal is, and you immortal are, <lb/>
            And make you also misery to know, <lb/>
            And to participate of human care ? <lb/>
            There breatheth not upon the earth so wide, <lb/>
            So poor a thing and wretched as a man. <lb n="410"/>
            But Hector on your car shall never ride, <lb/>
            For he, without my leave, do nothing can. <lb/>
            Is't not enough for him that he bath got <lb/>
            Achilles' arms, to please himself in vain ? <lb/>
            But have Achilles' horses he shall not, <lb n="415"/>
            For you shall to the ships return again, <lb/>
            And safely carry back Automedon, <lb/>
            Though to the Trojans I intend to-day <lb/>
            The victory, till setting of the sun, <lb/>
            And that by darkness parted be the fray. <lb n="420"/>
            This said, he strength and courage to them gave: <lb/>
            Automedon then to the troops of Greece, <lb/>
            As swiftly the immortal horses drave <lb/>
            As flies a vulture at a flock of geese. <lb/>
            For from the foe he quickly could retire, <lb n="425"/>
            And easily upon them go again, <lb/>
            As oft as the occasion should require; <lb/>
            But by his hand no enemy was slain, <lb/>
            For since he was upon the seat alone, <lb/>
            He could not both together fight and guide. <lb n="430"/>
            But to him came at last Alcimedon, <lb/>
            Laertes' son, and stood by th' char'ot side. <lb/>
            What God, said he, has put it in your head, <lb/>
            Automedon, amongst so many spears <lb/>
            To be alone, knowing your friend is dead, <lb n="435"/>
            And Hector now Achilles' armour wears ? <lb/>
            Automedon unto him then replied : <lb/>
            Alcimedon, a fitter man is none <lb/>
            Than you are, the immortal steeds to guide, <lb/>
            Since Menoctiadcs, my friend, is gone. <lb n="440"/>
            Get up then you, and the good steeds command, <lb/>
            Whilst on the ground I with the Trojans fight. <lb/>
            Alcimedon then took the whip in hand <lb/>
            And reins; Automedon did then alight. <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            This Hector saw, and to Æneas spake: <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> The seventh <lb/>

            Patroclus's body. </note> <lb n="445"/>
            Achilles horses yonder coming are; <lb/>
            To us, said he, they are not hard to take, <lb/>
            For with them there is no great man of war; <lb/>
            And if we to them go, they dare not stand. <lb/>
            This said, Æneas well contented was, <lb n="450"/>
            And forward then they go, with spear in hand, <lb/>
            And shoulders cover'd well with hide and brass. <lb/>
            And Chromius with them, and Aretus went, <lb/>
            And made no doubt but both the men to slay ; <lb/>
            And then to seize Achilles' steeds they meant, <lb n="455"/>
            And with the car triumphing drive to Troy. <lb/>
            Vain men, that were not sure themselves to save. <lb/>
            To Jupiter Automedon then pray'd, <lb/>
            Who heard his pray'r, and great strength to him gave. <lb/>
            And then unto Alcimedon he said: <lb n="460"/>
            Alcimedon, keep still thy horses near, <lb/>
            So that upon my back may fall their breath ; <lb/>
            For quiet never will be Hector's spear, <lb/>
            Until of both of us he see the death, <lb/>
            And set himself upon Achilles' car, <lb n="465"/>
            And put the squadrons of the Greeks to rout, <lb/>
            Or be amongst the foremost slain i' th' war. <lb/>
            This said, he to th' Ajaxes cried out, <lb/>
            And Menelaus: Ajax, Menelaus, <lb/>
            The care of him that's dead to others give, <lb n="470"/>
            And shew your valour where there is more cause. <lb/>
            Come hither, and take care of us that live ; <lb/>
            For Hector and AEneas both are here. <lb/>
            But yet, since on Jove's will dependeth all, <lb/>
            Both good and evil hap, I'll throw my spear, <lb n="475"/>
            And let him where he pleaseth make it full. <lb/>
            And as he spake the spear he from him sent, <lb/>
            Which chanc'd to light upon Aretes' shield, <lb/>
            And passing through, into his belly went, <lb/>
            At which he starting fell upon the field. <lb n="480"/>
            And at Automedon then Hector threw ; <lb/>
            But stooping forward he the spear declin'd, <lb/>
            And o'er his head through th' empty air it flew, <lb/>
            And shaking fix'd it stood i' th' ground behind. <lb/>
            And then the fight by Mars becalmed was; <lb n="485"/>
            But with their swords they had again fall'n on, <lb/>
            But that th' Ajaxes two and Menelaus <lb/>
            Came in, that call'd were by Automedon. <lb/>
            Æneas then and Hector shrunk away, <lb/>
            And Chromius with them, but Aretes not, <lb n="490"/>
            But on the ground without his armour lay. <lb/>
            Automedon then mounts his chariot <lb/>
            All bloody, and the armour by him set; <lb/>
            And said, though this revenge be very small <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <pb n="212"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> The seventh <lb/>
            battle, about <lb/>
            Patroclus'sbody. </note> <lb/>
            For great Patroclus' death, His better yet, <lb n="495"/>
            Though this a worse man be, than none at all. <lb/>
            And at Patroclus' body now the fight <lb/>
            Was greater than before, and fiercer grown. <lb/>
            For Pallas coming, did the Greeks incite, <lb/>
            By Jove himself (whose mind was chang'd) sent down. <lb n="500"/>
            As when to mortals Jove will signify <lb/>
            Th' approach of war, or tempests cold and loud, <lb/>
            To make men leave their work, and cattle die, <lb/>
            He sets up in the sky a purple cloud; <lb/>
            In such a cloud wrapp'd up Athena came, <lb n="505"/>
            The daughter of great Jove, and martial maid, <lb/>
            To th' Argive host, their courage to inflame, <lb/>
            And to Atrides, who stood nearest, said, <lb/>
            In voice and shape like Phoenix: Menelaus, <lb/>
            If you let dogs Patroclus' body tear, <lb n="510"/>
            That of Achilles so beloved was, <lb/>
            You will be scorn'd. Go to him, do not fear. <lb/>
            Phoenix, said he, would Pallas strengthen me, <lb/>
            And save me from so many spears that fly, <lb/>
            Patroclus' body soon should rescued be. <lb n="515"/>
            For no man for him griev'd is more than I, <lb/>
            But Hector fighteth like a raging flame, <lb/>
            And as he goes Jove gives him victory. <lb/>
            This said, Athena pleas'd was with the same, <lb/>
            Because to her he trusted specially, <lb n="520"/>
            And strengthened both his shoulders and his thighs, <lb/>
            And made him bold as is a busy fly, <lb/>
            Which, beaten off, again upon you flies, <lb/>
            And fears not for a little blood to die. <lb/>
            And to Patroclus then went Menelaus, <lb n="525"/>
            And 'mongst the throng of Trojans threw his spear. <lb/>
            It chanced that amongst them one there was, <lb/>
            Pydes, Eëtion's son, to Hector dear, <lb/>
            And at the wine his good companion. <lb/>
            Him Menelaus with his spear then slew <lb n="530"/>
            Just as he turn'd himself about to run, <lb/>
            And from the Trojans the dead body drew. <lb/>
            To Hector then came Phœbus, having on <lb/>
            The form of Phœnops, son of Asius, <lb/>
            In Hector's grace inferior to none, <lb n="535"/>
            And standing by his side said to him thus: <lb/>
            If you be so afraid of Menelaus, <lb/>
            What other Greek will be afraid of you ? <lb/>
            He never yet good spear-man counted was, <lb/>
            Nor is, though Pydes now by chance he slew, <lb n="540"/>
            And vainly now he thinks alone he can <lb/>
            Bring off Patroclus' body from the field. <lb/>
            This said, unto the body Hector ran, <lb/>
            And Jove then lifted up his mighty shield, <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            And in thick clouds the mountain Ida wraps, <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. <lb/>

            And dark it was upon the field as night. <lb/>
            And then with lightning and with thunder claps <lb/>
            The squadrons of the Argives puts to flight. <lb/>
            Menelaus, who the Bœotians led, <lb/>
            Hurt in the shoulder by Polydamas, <lb n="550"/>
            Of the Achæans was the first that fled, <lb/>
            And Leïtus his mate the second was. <lb/>
            That was by Hector wounded in the wrist, <lb/>
            And could no longer use make of his spear; <lb/>
            But from the battle forc'd was to desist, <lb n="555"/>
            And looking still about him ran in fear. <lb/>
            Him Hector as he running was pursues. <lb/>
            On Hectors shield then lights a heavy spear, <lb/>
            That thrown was at him by Idomeneus, <lb/>
            But brake in two; and glad the Trojans were. <lb n="560"/>
            And at Idomeneus then Hector threw ; <lb/>
            Beside him but a little went the spear, <lb/>
            And lighting upon Cœranus him slew, <lb/>
            Who was Meriones his char'oteer, <lb/>
            And with him came to Lyctus all the way <lb n="565"/>
            By sea, and thence he went to Troy by land. <lb/>
            And much good service he had done to Troy, <lb/>
            For fallen had the king by Hector's hand, <lb/>
            And safe had been himself; but now was hit <lb/>
            By Hector's spear betwixt the cheek and ear, <lb n="570"/>
            And struck out were his teeth, his tongue was slit, <lb/>
            And fallen to the ground expired there. <lb/>
            And then Meriones took up the reins, <lb/>
            And to Idomeneus cried out to fly. <lb/>
            To little purpose now is all our pains; <lb n="575"/>
            You see the Trojans have the victory. <lb/>
            Idomeneus to th' ships then drave away <lb/>
            As fast as he could make the horses go, <lb/>
            As being certain they had lost the day. <lb/>
            And Ajax did the same acknowledge now. <lb n="580"/>
            Meriones, said he, and Menelaus, <lb/>
            That Jove will to the Trojans give the day, <lb/>
            A man may see that little judgment has, <lb/>
            So manifestly now he fights for Troy. <lb/>
            The spears thrown by the Trojans never miss, <lb n="585"/>
            But on one Greek or other always light; <lb/>
            Ours seldom hit. What cause is there of this, <lb/>
            But that great Jove doth for the Trojans fight? <lb/>
            Let's therefore here consider of some way <lb/>
            To fetch Patroclus off, and then go home. <lb n="590"/>
            For to our friends in Greece 'twill be a joy <lb/>
            To see us safe again from Hector come; <lb/>
            Who when they to the sea their faces turn, <lb/>
            Despair of ever seeing us again, <pb n="214"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> The seventh <lb/>
            battle, about <lb/>
            Patroclus's body. </note> <lb/>
            And think that Hector will the navy burn, <lb n="595"/>
            And that we there shall ev'ry man be slain. <lb/>
            0 that we had some fit man here to send <lb/>
            T'Achilles' tent; for nothing yet knows he, <lb/>
            That by the Trojans slain is his dear friend; <lb/>
            But 'tis so dark I no such man can see. <lb n="600"/>
            O Jove, give us once more a sky serene; <lb/>
            Remove this mist that we may see to fight, <lb/>
            Or if to kill the Argives all you mean, <lb/>
            0 father Jove, yet kill us in the light. <lb/>
            This said, Jove had compassion on his tears; <lb n="605"/>
            The sun again his glitt'ring beams displays, <lb/>
            Scatters the clouds again and th' Heaven clears. <lb/>
            And then to Menelaus Ajax says, <lb/>
            About the field go Menelaus now, <lb/>
            And seek Antilochus, and bid him go <lb n="610"/>
            Unto Achilles' tent, and let him know <lb/>
            His friend Patroclus slain is by the foe. <lb/>
            This said, away Atrides went. As when <lb/>
            A hungry lion parteth from a fold, <lb/>
            Having in vain provok'd the dogs and men <lb n="615"/>
            That did him from th' expected prey withhold, <lb/>
            Watching all night, when fain he would have fed; <lb/>
            But all the night the darts about him fly <lb/>
            And flaming brands, which lions chiefly dread ; <lb/>
            Away he goes i'th' morn unwillingly; <lb n="620"/>
            So from Patroclus' body parted he <lb/>
            Against his will, thinking the Greeks afraid <lb/>
            Might leave Patroclus to the enemy, <lb/>
            And to Meriones and th' Ajaxes said, <lb/>
            How good a man Patroclus was you know, <lb n="625"/>
            And how in our defence his blood he shed, <lb/>
            And therefore valiantly defend him now. <lb/>
            Let not the foe abuse his body dead. <lb/>
            And when he this had said he went away, <lb/>
            Amongst the Argives peeping here and there, <lb n="630"/>
            Like to an eagle soaring for a prey <lb/>
            Amongst the bushes peeping for a hare; <lb/>
            So he amongst the Argives look'd about <lb/>
            Seeking of Nestor's son Antilochus. <lb/>
            Nor was it long before he found him out, <lb n="635"/>
            Cheering his men, and said unto him thus: <lb/>
            Antilochus, come near, and hear from me <lb/>
            Sad news; I would it were not also true. <lb/>
            That now the Trojans have the victory, <lb/>
            I think it is already known to you. <lb n="640"/>
            But further know that slain Patroclus is. <lb/>
            Run therefore to Achilles quickly, and <lb/>
            Tell him the news. It may be, mov'd by this <lb/>
            To help the Argives with his mighty hand, <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            He'll to the naked body hither come; <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> The seventh <lb/>

            i'or now Achilles armour Hector wears. <lb/>
            At this Antilochus was stricken dumb, <lb/>
            And filled were and swoln his eyes with tears. <lb/>
            And there Antilochus no longer staid, <lb/>
            But to Laodocus his armour gave, <lb n="650"/>
            And he the same upon his char'ot laid; <lb/>
            For to that end he near unto him drave. <lb/>
            Away Antilochus then weeping went <lb/>
            To carry to Achilles the ill news, <lb/>
            And left to Thrasymed his regiment. <lb n="655"/>
            For Menelaus did the same refuse; <lb/>
            Though of a valiant commander then <lb/>
            The tired Pylians had the greatest need, <lb/>
            And to the Ajaxes return'd again <lb/>
            Where lay Patroclus' body, with all speed. <lb n="660"/>
            And when he thither came, unto them said, <lb/>
            Antilochus is to Achilles gone, <lb/>
            Although I see not how he should us aid. <lb/>
            How can he, seeing armour he has none ? <lb/>
            Let's therefore now bethink ourselves, how we <lb n="665"/>
            Ourselves may bear the body from the field, <lb/>
            And also how we may secured be, <lb/>
            Against the Trojans, that we be not kill'd! <lb/>
            Ajax to this replying said, 'Tis true, <lb/>
            And the advice I'll give you will be right. <lb n="670"/>
            Take up the corpse, Meriones and you, <lb/>
            And on your shoulders bear it from the fight. <lb/>
            We two, that are of one name and one mind, <lb/>
            And in the field together use to be, <lb/>
            Will fighting with the Trojans come behind, <lb n="675"/>
            Till at the ships the body lain we see. <lb/>
            This said, Meriones and Menelaus <lb/>
            Up to their shoulders hoist the body dead. <lb/>
            Whilst towards them the back of Ajax was, <lb/>
            The Trojans with great shouting followed. <lb n="680"/>
            Just as a pack of hounds pursue a boar <lb/>
            Wounded by hunters, running with great cry, <lb/>
            Until he turn; then follow him no more, <lb/>
            But scattered are, and this and that way fly; <lb/>
            So did the Trojans after Ajax run <lb n="685"/>
            As long as towards them was not his face. <lb/>
            But when he turned, near him durst stay none, <lb/>
            But stood at a great distance from the place. <lb/>
            Thus fetch'd they off at last the body dead, <lb/>
            With at their heels of Trojans' spears great showers; <lb n="490"/>
            And Argives dropt abundance as they fled, <lb/>
            Like houses in a town on fire, and tow'rs. <lb/>
            As when two mules in heavy way are set <lb/>
            To drag down from the hills some mighty tree, <pb n="216"/>

            Sweating and moiling with the body go; <lb/>
            And as a rock that keepeth off the seas ; <lb/>
            So Aj ax at their backs kept off the foe. <lb n="700"/>
            The Trojans, led by Hector and AEneas, <lb/>
            Pursue the flying Greeks with mighty cry, <lb/>
            As from a hawk that preys on birds like these, <lb/>
            A cloud of starlings cackle when they fly. <lb/>
            And many of them threw their arms away, <lb n="705"/>
            And that they came to fight had quite forgot; <lb/>

            Antilochus came to Achilles' tent, <lb/>
            And found him to the Argive ditch gone out, <lb/>
            Presaging in his mind the sad event, <lb/>
            And saying to himself, Ah me, what's this ? <lb n="5"/>
            The battle to the ships is come again; <lb/>
            Pray God it be not as I fear it is, <lb/>
            The Greeks are routed and Patroclus slain. <lb/>
            My mother told me that the best of all <lb/>
            The Myrmidons by th' Trojans should be slain. <lb n="10"/>
            I bad him not assault the Trojan wall, <lb/>
            Nor fight with Hector, but come back again. <lb/>
            As speaking to himself Achilles stood, <lb/>
            Antilochus unto him weeping came, <lb/>
            The news, said he, I bring you is not good; <lb n="15"/>
            I cannot without tears relate the same. <lb/>
            Slain is Patroclus. On the ground he lies, <lb/>
            And now they fighting are with swords and spears <lb/>
            Who shall his body have, with mighty cries, <lb/>
            Though naked; for his armour Hector wears. <lb n="20"/>
            At this sad news dark were Achilles' eyes; <lb/>
            And up he takes the dust with both his hands, <lb/>
            And throws it on his head; then down he lies, <lb/>
            His face and coat sullied with dust and sands, <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            And tore his hair. And then the lovely prey <note type="margin"> LIB. XVIII. </note><note type="margin"> The grief of <lb/>

            On t' other side Antilochus was fain <lb n="30"/>
            To hold his hands, so mightily he groan'd; <lb/>
            Lest otherwise he should himself have slain. <lb/>
            His mother Thetis hearing him complain, <lb/>
            Though sitting in the deepest of the seas, <lb/>
            Wept out aloud, and presently her train <lb n="35"/>
            About her came of the Nereiades. <lb/>
            Glauca, Thaleia, and Cymodoca, <lb/>
            Nesæa, Speio, Thoa, Halia, <lb/>
            And Æmioreia, and Cymothoa, <lb/>

            Nemertes, and the milk-white Galatæa, <lb n="45"/>
            And Clymene there was, and Callianassa, <lb/>

            With all the rest, and fill'd the silver cave, <lb/>
            And beat their breasts, and round her stood dismay'd. <lb n="50"/>
            And Thetis then th' account unto them gave <lb/>
            Of her great grief, and thus unto them said : <lb/>
            Hear me, Nereiades, my sisters dear, <lb/>
            And be acquainted with my misery. <lb/>
            Ah, wretched Goddess that I was, to bear <lb n="55"/>
            The best of all the heroes ; and when he <lb/>
            Was quickly grown up to a goodly height, <lb/>
            Send him unto the war at Ilium <lb/>
            Against the Trojans for the Greeks to fight, <lb/>
            From whence he never should again come home ; <lb n="60"/>
            But spend his little time of life in woe, <lb/>
            And I can nothing do for his relief. <lb/>
            And now I mean to visit him, and know, <lb/>
            Since he not fights, what cause he hath of grief. <lb/>
            This said, she with her nymphs went from the cave. <lb n="65"/>
            The sea before them her smooth water tore, <lb/>
            And gentle passage to the Goddess gave, <lb/>
            Till they were landed on the Trojan shore, <lb/>
            Where lay Achilles' ships upon the sand ; <lb/>
            And straight up to Achilles Thetis went, <lb n="70"/>
            The nymphs attending on her hand in hand, <lb/>
            And seeing him so grievously lament, <lb/>
            She held him by the head, and to him said, <lb/>
            Why weep you thus, sweet child; what is't you ail? <pb n="218"/>

            For that which formerly to Jove you prayed <lb n="75"/>

            To th' ships they have been beaten from the field, <lb/>
            And know in what great need they stand of you, <lb/>
            And have in heaps been by the Trojans kill'd. <lb/>
            To this Achilles answering said, 'Tis true, <lb n="80"/>
            But in my life what pleasure can I find, <lb/>
            Since sweet Patroclus slain is by his foes, <lb/>
            On whom of all men most I set my mind, <lb/>
            And Hector in his arms triumphing goes; <lb/>
            Those mighty arms, giv'n by the Gods that day <lb n="85"/>
            That you were pleased a mortal man to wed, <lb/>
            To Peleus. Oh, had you been away, <lb/>
            And he a mortal woman married! <lb/>
            You had not for your son been grieved then, <lb/>
            That never to you should return again. <lb n="90"/>
            Nor do I wish to live with mortal men, <lb/>
            But till I with my spear have Hector slain. <lb/>
            By what you say, said Thetis to her son, <lb/>
            Short-liv'd you are. Your own fate then is nigh. <lb/>
            I care not, said Achilles, when that's done <lb n="95"/>
            I shall be very well content to die. <lb/>
            For since I never must return again, <lb/>
            And no defence in me Patroclus found, <lb/>
            Nor other good men by the Trojans slain, <lb/>
            100 I but a needless weight am to the ground. <lb/>
            Oh that contention lost for ever were, <lb/>
            And choler to the heart of man so sweet, <lb/>
            Which often make the wisest men to err! <lb/>
            In Agamemnon and myself I see't. <lb/>
            But since 'tis past, let's put it out of mind. <lb n="105"/>
            For dead he is, and cannot live again. <lb/>
            And now I'll see if Hector I can find, <lb/>
            That has my dearest friend Patroclus slain, <lb/>
            And then let Jove do what himself thinks good. <lb/>
            For Hercules could not avoid his fate, <lb n="110"/>
            Who most of mortals in his favour stood, <lb/>
            But died by destiny and Juno's hate ; <lb/>
            And so shall I, when my day shall arrive, <lb/>
            Lie still when dead. But now let me gain fame <lb/>
            Amongst th' Achæans while I am alive. <lb n="115"/>
            And make some Trojan or some Dardan dame <lb/>
            With both her tender hands to tear her cheeks, <lb/>
            And sigh, and with her tears her beauty blot, <lb/>
            And know my hand from that of other Greeks, <lb/>
            And when I with th' Achæans am, when not. <lb n="120"/>
            And therefore, mother, dearly as you love me, <lb/>
            Endeavour not to make me here abide. <lb/>
            For from my purpose you cannot remove me. <lb/>
            Unto Achilles Thetis then replied, <lb/>

            Nor that the Argive people you defend. <lb/>
            But now you know your arms the Trojans have, <lb/>
            And Hector weareth them ; but shall not long. <lb/>
            The latest of his days is to him nigh. <lb n="130"/>
            But go not you into the bloody throng, <lb/>
            Till here again you have me in your eye. <lb/>
            This said, she turn'd to the Nereiades, <lb/>
            And to them said, Nereiades, dive you <lb/>
            To Nereus, at the bottom of the seas, <lb n="135"/>
            And all you see has happened to him show. <lb/>
            For I up to Olympus must be gone <lb/>
            To Vulcan, if such favour I can gain, <lb/>
            To get a good new armour for my son. <lb/>
            This said, the nymphs to sea return'd again, <lb n="140"/>
            And Thetis to Olympus went her way. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the Greeks before the Trojans fly <lb/>
            With mighty cries, and never stopt till they <lb/>
            Were at the ships, and to the wide sea nigh. <lb/>
            Nor was Patroclus' body rescued yet; <lb n="145"/>
            For now afresh the Trojans to them came, <lb/>
            Which did another fiercer fight beget, <lb/>
            And Hector fell upon them like a flame. <lb/>
            Thrice laid he hold upon Patroclus' foot, <lb/>
            And forc'd he was as oft to let it fall <lb n="150"/>
            To kill some others, then again came to't, <lb/>
            But from the body went not back at all. <lb/>
            No more could Hector driven be away <lb/>
            From the dead body by th' Ajaxes two, <lb/>
            Than can a hungry lion from his prey <lb n="155"/>
            For anything the herdsmen griev'd can do. <lb/>
            And Hector had Patroclus' body got, <lb/>
            And gained had thereby a great renown, <lb/>
            But Juno, though the other Gods knew not, <lb/>
            T' Achilles in great haste sent Iris down. <lb n="160"/>
            T' Achilles straight ste came, and to him said, <lb/>
            Up, terrible Pelides, to the war, <lb/>
            And your beloved friend Patroclus aid ; <lb/>
            For at the ships they fighting for him are. <lb/>
            The Greeks to save his body are in pain, <lb n="165"/>
            The Trojans fain would drag him into Troy, <lb/>
            And Hector most of all that has him slain, <lb/>
            And from his shoulders take his head away <lb/>
            ADd stick it up upon the Trojan wall, <lb/>
            Leaving his corpse a prey to do- and kite. <lb n="170"/>
            Think what reproach will then upon you fall. <lb/>
            Lie then no longer here, but rise and fight. <lb/>
            Achilles then replied. Iris, said he, <lb/>

            To all the rest my coming is unknown. <lb/>
            And then Achilles to her said again, <lb/>

            And Thetis bids me from the war abstain <lb/>
            Till she return again into my sight, <lb n="180"/>
            Who is to Vulcan for new armour gone, <lb/>
            And here's no other armour for me fit <lb/>
            But Ajax's; who, I hope, has it on, <lb/>
            And for Patroclus now has use of it. <lb/>
            We know, said Iris, armour you have none. <lb n="185"/>
            But as you are, upon the ditch appear. <lb/>
            The Trojans from the corpse will soon begone, <lb/>
            And leave it to the Greeks for very fear. <lb/>
            This said, the Goddess Iris vanished. <lb/>
            Achilles rose, and Pallas to him came, <lb n="190"/>
            And on him puts her shield, and on his head <lb/>
            A golden cloud, from which arose a flame. <lb/>
            As when an isle invaded is by foes, <lb/>
            The citizens to call their neighbours in <lb/>
            Make fires, the smoke up to the heaven goes <lb n="195"/>
            By day; by night the flame; and far are seen ; <lb/>
            Upon Achilles' head stood such a flame, <lb/>
            And then unto the ditch he went and shouted, <lb/>
            And farther off Athena did the same. <lb/>
            The Trojans, when they heard it, strait were routed. <lb n="200"/>
            As clear as any trumpet in the wars, <lb/>
            They heard Achilles' voice, and were afraid, <lb/>
            And in disorder turn'd about their cars, <lb/>
            But at his flaming head were most dismay'd. <lb/>
            Thrice shouted he, thrice they disordered were; <lb n="205"/>
            And slain were of the Trojans twelve brave men <lb/>
            By their own cars and spears encumber'd there. <lb/>
            In so much haste they turn'd to fly. And then <lb/>
            The Greeks the body laid upon a bed <lb/>
            And bier, and standing by his side lament. <lb n="210"/>
            And tears abundance there Achilles shed, <lb/>
            And that he sent him had did now repent. <lb/>
            The sun by Juno hasten'd quench'd his fire; <lb/>
            The Argives on the place stay quietly; <lb/>
            The Trojans to without the ditch retire, <lb n="215"/>
            And from the cars the weary steeds untie. <lb/>
            Then presently the chiefs to counsel call <lb/>

            And first unto them spake Polydamas <lb/>

            The Greeks were easy foes; to th' ships I went <lb/>
            Myself, and willingly lay out all night; <lb/>
            But if Achilles hither now should come, <lb/>
            We must not only here fight for our lives ; <lb/>
            So proud he is, he'll go to Ilium, <lb n="235"/>
            And for the city fight and for our wives. <lb/>
            Let's to the city go. 'Tis as I say, <lb/>
            And nothing keeps him from us but the night. <lb/>
            And if he here shall find us when 'tis day, <lb/>
            Some of us will acknowledge I say right. <lb n="240"/>
            And many flying, wish, when 'tis too late, <lb/>
            They were within the walls of Ilium, <lb/>
            Whom dogs and kites shall eat without the gate. <lb/>
            But to my ears may never such news come. <lb/>
            But if you will be ruled all by me, <lb n="245"/>
            Into the market-place of Troy by night <lb/>
            Well bring our strength, and, soon as we can see, <lb/>
            Stand arm'd upon the tow'rs prepar'd to fight. <lb/>
            Then let him from the ships come fight at Troy, <lb/>
            And drive about the walls and do his worst, <lb n="250"/>
            And having tir'd his horses go away ; <lb/>
            Take it he shall not, dogs shall eat him first. <lb/>
            Then Hector frowning on him, thus replies: <lb/>
            Again, said he, I from you must dissent, <lb/>
            Since you to shut ourselves in Troy advise. <lb n="255"/>
            We have already there too long been pent. <lb/>
            Troy once was counted rich in brass and gold; <lb/>
            But since Jove angry was, all that is gone, <lb/>
            In Phrygia and in Mœonia sold, <lb/>
            And little left in Ilium to be won ; <lb n="360"/>
            But since the Greeks are beaten and dismay'd <lb/>
            By th' hand of Jove, your fear is out of season, <lb/>
            Nor will you by the Trojans be obey'd, <lb/>
            Nor shall you; though the Trojans thought it reason. <lb/>
            And therefore take my counsel, which is this. <lb n="265"/>
            Go now and ev'ry man his supper take <lb/>
            In rank and file there where he placed is; <lb/>
            And set good guards, and keep yourselves awake. <lb/>
            If any Trojan for his goods lament, <lb/>
            He may the same upon the town bestow <lb n="270"/>
            In service of the public to be spent, <lb/>
            Rather than be possessed by the foe; <lb/>
            And armed in the morn go to the fleet, <lb/>
            And sharply charge the Greeks by break of day. <pb n="222"/>

            And if indeed Achilles there we meet, <lb n="275"/>
            He were not best oppose us in our way; <lb/>
            For from him I will neither fly nor shrink, <lb/>
            But either honour from him bear away, <lb/>
            Or he from me. Mars common is, I think, <lb/>
            To them that fight; and slain are they that slay. <lb n="280"/>
            This said, the Trojans heard with great applause, <lb/>
            Fools as they were; Pallas had made them mad. <lb/>
            But none of them commend Polydamas, <lb/>
            That given them much better counsel had. <lb/>
            The Trojans presently to supper went, <lb n="285"/>
            The Greeks all night about Patroclus stand; <lb/>
            And there began Achilles to lament. <lb/>
            And on Patroclus' breast he laid his hand. <lb/>
            As when a lion coming to his den, <lb/>
            Misses the tender whelps he left behind, <lb n="290"/>
            He roars, and furiously goes out again, <lb/>
            And through the vallies hunts, the thief to find ; <lb/>
            Such fierce thoughts on Achilles' heart then lay, <lb/>
            And sighing, to the Myrmidons he spake: <lb/>
            Oh, what did I to old Menœtius say! <lb n="295"/>
            How vain a promise did I to him make; <lb/>
            I said, when we had sack'd the town of Troy, <lb/>
            That I to Opus would bring back his son, <lb/>
            Enriched with his portion of the prey. <lb/>
            But all we hope from Jove is seldom done. <lb n="300"/>
            For both of us have the same destiny, <lb/>
            With our heart's blood to dye the Trojan plain, <lb/>
            And as he lieth now, so shall I lie, <lb/>
            And never to my parents come again. <lb/>
            But since, Patroclus, you the first are dead, <lb n="305"/>
            Your funeral I will not celebrate, <lb/>
            Till I have brought you Hector’s arms and head, <lb/>
            Whose bloody hand deliver'd your sad fate, <lb/>
            And have twelve of the noble youths of Troy <lb/>
            Beheaded in revenge. Till then stay here, <lb n="310"/>
            Where Trojan captive women, night and day <lb/>
            Bewailing you, shall stand about the bier. <lb/>
            This said, he order gave for water hot, <lb/>
            To cleanse Patroclus' body from the gore. <lb/>
            Into a cauldron, said he, water put, <lb n="315"/>
            And make a fire, and set the cauldron o'er. <lb/>
            Into a cauldron water then they put, <lb/>

            Then washed from the body was the gore, <lb n="320"/>

            Achilles and the Myrmidons, all night <lb/>
            Lamenting him. Then Jove to Juno said, <lb/>
            You have Achilles brought again to fight <lb/>
            Against the Trojans, on the Argives' side. <lb/>
            Are they your children, that you love them so ? <lb n="330"/>
            And Juno then to Jupiter replied : <lb/>
            Harsh Cronides, what words do you let go ? <lb/>
            Since mortal men, that know much less than we, <lb/>
            May to a friend do good, and hate a foe, <lb/>
            Why may not I, that boast myself to be <lb n="335"/>
            The wife and sister of great Jove, do so, <lb/>
            And make my foes, the Trojans, feel my hate? <lb/>
            Whilst Jove and Juno were discoursing thus, <lb/>
            The Goddess Thetis come was to the gate <lb/>
            Of Vulcan's undecaying famous house <lb n="340"/>
            Of shining brass, with brighter stars thick set, <lb/>
            That ’mongst the houses of the heaven shone. <lb/>
            But he was at his work-house in a sweat, <lb/>
            And at his bellows swaying up and down. <lb/>
            For tripods twenty he had laboured, <lb n="345"/>
            With golden wheels, to go and come again <lb/>
            At his command; but had not finished <lb/>
            The ears and chains, which he was making then. <lb/>
            And whilst this bus'ness Vulcan was about, <lb/>
            Thetis was come, and at the gate did stand. <lb n="350"/>
            And Charts, Vulcan's wife, then going out, <lb/>
            Saw her, and straightway took her by the hand. <lb/>
            Thetis, said she, 'tis strange to see you here; <lb/>
            Much honoured, and a welcome guest you are, <lb/>
            Come in, and pleased be t' accept our cheer. <lb n="355"/>
            Then led her in and brought her to a chair, <lb/>
            A dainty chair, with foot-stool join'd thereto, <lb/>
            And then unto her husband's shop she hied, <lb/>
            For, Thetis, said she, you have work to do. <lb/>
            And Vulcan, glad, to Charts thus replied: <lb n="360"/>
            Is Thetis here, that sav'd me from mishap ! <lb/>
            When for my lameness thrown down from the sky, <lb/>
            Thetis was pleas'd to catch me in her lap, <lb/>
            When else I had been in great misery. <lb/>
            I wrought for her, and for Eurynome, <lb n="365"/>
            Nine years, and made them many pretty things, <lb/>
            Within a rock encompass'd by the sea, <lb/>
            As buckles, clasps, fine boxes, beads, and rings, <lb/>
            Which neither mortal nor immortal knew, <lb/>
            But only Thetis and Eurynome. <lb n="370"/>
            And now to Thetis I must pay what's due, <lb/>
            The ransom of my life, for saving me. <lb/>
            Go you, and entertain her well, while I <lb/>

            And if it can be done, it shall be done. <lb/>
            And then to Vulcan Thetis answered: <lb/>
            No Goddess ever was distressed like me, <lb n="390"/>
            Whom Jove made subject to a mortal's bed, <lb/>
            And Peleus' wife constrained me to be, <lb/>
            Who lies at home decrepid now and spent, <lb/>
            And when I borne unto him had a son, <lb/>
            Of all the heroes the most excellent, <lb n="395"/>
            And of his breeding care omitted none, <lb/>
            And when he grown was to a goodly height, <lb/>
            He sent was to the war at Ilium, <lb/>
            Against the Trojans for the Greeks to fight; <lb/>
            From whence he never shall again come home. <lb n="400"/>
            Though yet he live, he takes therein no joy, <lb/>
            And I to comfort him no power have, <lb/>
            Since Agamemnon taken has away <lb/>
            Her whom the Greeks for honour to him gave. <lb/>
            And then my son no longer would him aid; <lb n="405"/>
            And by the Trojans beaten were the Greeks; <lb/>
            And Agamemnon then sent gifts, and pray'd, <lb/>
            And by ambassadors his favour seeks. <lb/>
            Then though to th' light himself he would not go, <lb/>
            Yet he his armour to Patroclus gave, <lb n="410"/>
            And Myrmidons t' assist him 'gainst the foe, <lb/>
            And to the Scæan gate the Trojans drave. <lb/>
            And by Patroclus taken had been Troy, <lb/>
            Had he not then been by Apollo slain, <lb/>
            That unto Hector gave a glorious day, <lb n="415"/>

            Which makes me now come hither, to request <lb/>

            For twenty bellowses in all he had <lb/>

            And then into the fire he threw in tin, <lb/>
            And brass, and silver fine, and precious gold; <lb n="430"/>
            And to the socket puts the anvil in, <lb/>
            And th' heavy hammer in one hand did hold, <lb/>

            And fastens to the same a silver thong, <lb/>
            And bound the edge about with triple brass. <lb/>
            The shield itself consisted of five plies, <lb/>
            And with great art described in it was <lb/>
            The surface of the earth, the sea and skies, <lb n="440"/>
            The sun, the moon at full, and all the train <lb/>

            Orion, and the bear, men call the Wain, <lb/>
            That only never dives into the seas, <lb/>
            But always to Orion has an eye. <lb n="445"/>
            And in it were two cities. In the one <lb/>
            Good cheer and weddings, and great melody, <lb/>
            And women at their doors stand looking on <lb/>
            To see the bridegroom as he passed by, <lb/>
            And lusty youths, that dancing with them go, <lb n="450"/>
            To citterns and to pipes, and Hymen cry, <lb/>
            And turn as swift as tops upon the toe. <lb/>
            And full of people was the market-place. <lb/>
            Assembled at the hearing of a cause. <lb/>
            A man was slain. And this was then the case. <lb n="455"/>
            One said that he had satisfied the laws, <lb/>
            The other said that nothing he had paid; <lb/>
            And on this issue they will both be tried, <lb/>
            And have their proofs before the judges laid, <lb/>
            And clamour great of friends was on each side. <lb n="460"/>
            The cryers when they stilled had the cry, <lb/>
            Into the judges' hands their sceptres gave, <lb/>
            And in the midst, of gold two talents lie, <lb/>
            For him that has the better cause to have. <lb/>

            And Mars and Pallas with them, all in gold, <lb/>

            And when they were informed they were nigh, <lb/>
            And shepherds two, that did suspect no harm, <lb/>

            At which the other army took th' alarm, <lb/>

            Pursued, and soon they overtaken were, <lb/>
            And then began the fight. Without remorse <lb/>
            They one another slay with sword and spear. <lb/>
            And there disorder plac'd was and debate; <lb/>
            And one borne wounded out, another found, <lb n="490"/>
            Another dead was dragg'd away by Fate, <lb/>
            With bloody coat and armour on the ground. <lb/>
            So lively seemed to the eye their features, <lb/>
            In fighting and in fetching off their slain, <lb/>
            One would have though they had been living creatures, <lb n="495"/>
            And that the fight had real been. Again <lb/>
            Describ'd was in the same a spacious ground, <lb/>
            And men at plough ; and at each ridge's end, <lb/>

            A man that for them did with wine attend. <lb n="500"/>
            And then again the plough about they wind, <lb/>
            And lab'ring to the other end go back; <lb/>

            And many reapers working on the field, <lb/>
            That threw it to the ground in handfuls great; <lb/>
            And boys that follow'd took it from the ground, <lb/>
            And put it in the hands of binders three, <lb n="510"/>
            By whom they made were into sheaves and bound, <lb/>
            Which standing by, their lord was glad to see. <lb/>
            His squires not far off standing were aside; <lb/>
            And at a tree a cow kill'd of the best, <lb/>
            A supper for the reapers to provide, <lb n="515"/>
            And to the women gave it to be dress'd. <lb/>
            And in't a golden vineyard was pourtray'd: <lb/>
            The grapes that on it hung were black, and all <lb/>
            The vines supported and from drooping staid <lb/>
            With silver props, that down they could not fall. <lb n="520"/>
            A ditch there was about it black, and on <lb/>
            The same a hedge, the colour of it tin, <lb/>
            And path unto it there was only one, <lb/>
            By which the fruit in vintage was brought in. <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            And on it boys and girls described were, <note type="margin"> LIB. XVIII. </note><note type="margin"> The grief of <lb/>

            After a fiddle play'd on by a boy, <lb/>
            That sing, dance, whistle, and full baskets bear, <lb/>
            Of Bacchus' gifts, unto the house with joy. <lb/>
            And in it was a herd of bulls and kine, <lb/>
            Part gold, part tin, and herds-men four of gold, <lb n="530"/>
            That to the pasture drave them with dogs nine, <lb/>
            T' a sedgy river; where two lions bold <lb/>
            Upon the horned herd came from a wood, <lb/>
            And 'mongst the foremost seiz'd upon a bull; <lb/>
            The dogs went to them near, and barking stood: <lb n="535"/>
            Then roars the bull. The lions tear and pull. <lb/>
            And in the same he pasture made for sheep <lb/>
            Within a valley large, with lodges good, <lb/>
            And folds, and covered houses them to keep <lb/>
            In safety from the wild beasts of the wood. <lb n="540"/>
            And in it was a dancing place pourtray'd, <lb/>
            Like that which Dædalus had made before <lb/>
            For Ariadne, while in Crete he staid, <lb/>
            And on it dancing youths and maidens store <lb/>
            Go hand in hand. The girls, some clad in fine <lb n="545"/>
            White linen were, and some in coats well spun <lb/>
            Of glossy wool, that with the oil did shine; <lb/>
            And ev'ry one a garland gay had on. <lb/>
            The boys with silver hangers were adom'd, <lb/>
            And golden swords, and with their well-taught feet <lb n="550"/>
            Sometimes they dancing in a circle turn'd, <lb/>
            Sometimes divided in two ranks they meet. <lb/>
            And round about of people stood a throng, <lb/>
            And in the lovely dance took great delight. <lb/>
            And in the midst two tumblers sung the song, <lb n="555"/>
            And many wond'rous things did in their sight. <lb/>
            With the ocean then he all environed. <lb/>
            The shield now done, he went about the rest, <lb/>
            And made a helmet strong fit for his head, <lb/>
            And formed was of massy gold the crest, <lb n="560"/>
            And breast-plate shining brighter than the fire, <lb/>
            And pieces for his legs of ductile tin. <lb/>
            And when he all had done to his desire, <lb/>
            He from his forge returned, and brought it in, <lb/>
            And in the hands of Thetis puts the same; <lb n="565"/>
            Which she received from him joyfully. <lb/>
            Then straightway from Olympus down she came, <lb/>
            As swift as at a fowl a hawk can fly. <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note></p><pb n="228"/>

            Aurora, holding light above the ground, <lb/>
            Than at the ships the silver-footed queen <lb/>
            Achilles by Patroclus weeping found, <lb/>
            And with him many of his friends dismay'd. <lb n="5"/>
            Then in, into the midst of them she went, <lb/>
            And laid her hand on his, and to him said: <lb/>
            My son, why do you thus in vain lament ? <lb/>
            Come, since the Gods have slain him, leave him here, <lb/>
            And take the arms which I from Vulcan bring, <lb n="10"/>
            Such as yet mortal man did never wear; <lb/>
            Which, as she lays them down before him, ring. <lb/>
            The Myrmidons were troubled at the sight, <lb/>
            And turned their backs, affrighted at the show. <lb/>
            Achilles' wrath was more enflamed by't, <lb n="15"/>
            His eyes a-fire, and bended was his brow ; <lb/>
            Yet when he had them in his hands was glad, <lb/>
            And with great admiration them surveyed. <lb/>
            And when enough beholden them he had, <lb/>
            Unto his mother he replied, and said: <lb n="20"/>
            Mother, I see such arms from Vulcan here, <lb/>
            As none but an immortal could have made, <lb/>
            And presently will put them on, but fear <lb/>
            Lest flies the body should meanwhile invade, <lb/>
            And in the wounds some filthy vermin breed. <lb n="25"/>
            And Thetis then replied: Son, do not fear, <lb/>
            For I myself to that will take such heed, <lb/>
            As, that although it should lie here a year, <lb/>
            It shall no worse, but rather better be. <lb/>
            Go you, and th' Argive lords to council call, <lb n="30"/>
            And with king Agamemnon there agree, <lb/>
            And put your anger off before them all; <lb/>
            And spend your choler boldly on your foes. <lb/>
            This said, she to Patroclus mov'd her feet, <lb/>
            And dropp'd ambrosia into his nose, <lb n="35"/>
            To keep his body incorrupt and sweet. <lb/>
            Achilles then went down unto the shore, <lb/>
            And there the heroes did to council call <lb/>
            By name, though they were ready there before. <lb/>
            But thither at the news came th' Argivus all, <lb n="40"/>
            Steers-men and stewards of provision, <lb/>
            And all the rest to th' council thronging in, <lb/>
            Though but to see the face of Thetis' son, <lb/>
            So long they thought he absent now had been. <lb/>

            Though of their wounds they yet not cured were, <lb/>
            Both halting, leaning on their spears, and lame. <lb/>
            The last of all was Agamemnon there, <lb/>
            Wounded by Coon, nor recovered yet; <lb/>
            But th' heroes for his coming not long staid. <lb n="50"/>
            And when they were together all and set, <lb/>
            Achilles rose, and t' Agamemnon said: <lb/>
            Atrides, what great profit got we by <lb/>
            This our unlucky strife about a maid ? <lb/>
            I would it had her fortune been to die, <lb n="55"/>
            Before I siege unto Lyrnessus laid. <lb/>
            To Hector and the Trojans comes the gain; <lb/>
            The Greeks with grief will think on't while they live. <lb/>
            But since it is too late now to complain, <lb/>
            Go forth, and orders for the battle give ; <lb n="60"/>
            That I may to them go again, and see <lb/>
            If at the ships they mean to stay all night. <lb/>
            I think they will much rather wish to be <lb/>
            Within the walls of Troy than stay and fight. <lb/>
            This said, the Greeks were glad and courage take, <lb n="65"/>
            Assured that Achilles would them aid, <lb/>
            And Agamemnon, sitting, to them spake, <lb/>
            (Which he excus'd), and thus unto them said: <lb/>
            'Twere fitter, Argive princes, I stood out, <lb/>
            That so my words you might the better hear; <lb n="70"/>
            But such a number standing are about, <lb/>
            My voice, though greater, would not reach your ear. <lb/>
            Nor were it fit for me to go about, <lb/>
            And tell my mind to each man in his ear. <lb/>
            T" Achilles therefore only I’ll speak out, <lb n="75"/>
            But so, if you attend, that all may hear. <lb/>
            I often have, said he, been blamed by <lb/>
            The Greeks for taking from you your fair prize, <lb/>
            When not in me, but Jove the fault did lie, <lb/>
            And in Erinnys and the Destinies, <lb n="80"/>
            That did me of my wits that day bereave. <lb/>
            For what can I do when the Gods do all ? <lb/>
            Jove's daughter Ate did me then deceive, <lb/>
            From whom, on men and Gods great troubles fall. <lb/>
            Her feet are soft, because she never treads <lb n="85"/>
            On th' earth ; but when she mischief has to do <lb/>
            Walks in the air, and puts it in men's heads. <lb/>
            And sometimes does shrewd turns t'immortals too. <lb/>
            For Juno, though but of th' female sex, <lb/>
            That day that Hercules was to be born, <lb n="90"/>
            Was able Jove, the best o’ th' Gods, to vex, <lb/>
            And labour of Alcmena to adjourn. <lb/>
            For Jove before th' immortals having said <lb/>
            That he a man that day to light would bring, <pb n="230"/>

            By whom his race in Greece should all be sway'd. <lb n="95"/>
            You jest, said Juno, you mean no such thing. <lb/>
            I'll not believer unless you first be sworn <lb/>
            That he shall of your seed in Greece be king, <lb/>
            That of a woman shall this day be born. <lb/>
            This said, straight Jove, no fraud imagining, <lb n="100"/>
            The great oath took. But after did repent. <lb/>
            And Juno from Olympus' lofty head <lb/>
            Leapt down, and t' Argos of Achaia went, <lb/>
            And brought the wife of Sthenelus to bed. <lb/>
            And there was she deliver'd of a son, <lb n="105"/>
            That was by Perseus of Jove's descent, <lb/>
            Though she but seven months had of him gone. <lb/>
            And then to Thebes she to Alcmena went, <lb/>
            And hinder'd her that day from bringing forth. <lb/>
            Then up to Jupiter she came again, <lb n="110"/>
            And said, This day is born a man of worth, <lb/>
            Eurysteus, in Argos fit to reign, <lb/>
            And of your seed. And Jove in choler then <lb/>
            Took Atè by the head and swung her round, <lb/>
            And swore she ne'er to hcav'n should come again. <lb n="115"/>
            And having said it, threw her to the ground ; <lb/>
            And always after sigh'd to see the pain <lb/>
            To which Eurysteus did put his son; <lb/>
            As I do, when I see the Argives slain <lb/>
            By Hector, grieve to think what I have done. <lb n="120"/>
            But since that Jove has made me to offend, <lb/>
            I for my error willing am to pay. <lb/>
            Come, then, and your assistance to us lend, <lb/>
            And quickly bring your Myrmidons away. <lb/>
            And all that by Ulysses yesterday <lb n="125"/>
            I to you promised shall performed be. <lb/>
            Or presently, if you will for it stay, <lb/>
            That you th' atoning gifts yourself may see. <lb/>
            Achilles then unto him thus replies. <lb/>
            As for your gifts, to give them me or no, <lb n="130"/>
            Yet only in your choice, Atrides, lies. <lb/>
            But now 'tis time we to the Trojans go, <lb/>
            To make fine speeches here is but delay. <lb/>
            But let your men o' th' field Achilles see <lb/>
            Through squadrons of the Trojans making way, <lb n="135"/>
            The Argives then encouraged will be. <lb/>
            Ulysses then t' Achilles answered: <lb/>
            Godlike Achilles, mighty as you are, <lb/>
            Urge not the Greeks to fight till they be fed ; <lb/>
            They fasting cannot long endure the war, <lb n="140"/>
            And likely 'tis the battle will be long, <lb/>
            Especially if Gods both sides assist; <lb/>
            And bread and wine is that which makes men strong. <lb/>

            From morning unto night, unless he first <lb/>

            By the Achæans all they may be seen; <lb/>
            And let him take an oath before us, that <lb/>
            Briseis' bed he never went unto, <lb/>
            Nor all this while has done unto her what <lb/>

            And you your anger henceforth bridle must. <lb/>
            And you, Atrides, feast him like a friend, <lb/>
            And for hereafter learn to be more just, <lb/>
            Nor think't a shame for men their faults to mend. <lb/>
            Ulysses, said Atrides, I am joy'd <lb n="165"/>
            The counsel you have given us to hear, <lb/>
            For 'tis but reason all that you have said, <lb/>
            And I with all my heart the oath will swear. <lb/>
            And let Achilles, though in haste, stay here <lb/>
            With all the rest, that they my gifts may see, <lb n="170"/>
            And witnesses be to the oath I swear. <lb/>
            And for the gifts, Ulysses, presently <lb/>
            Go you yourself with good men, whom you will, <lb/>
            And bring them from my tent and set them here, <lb/>
            For what they are, you well remember still; <lb n="175"/>
            The same that by you promised from me were. <lb/>
            And you, Talthybius, provide a swine, <lb/>
            That we may offer up a sacrifice <lb/>
            To Jove, the Sun, and other pow'rs divine. <lb/>
            This said, Achilles to him thus replies: <lb n="180"/>
            Renowned Agamemnon, I think yet <lb/>
            Another time for feast had better been, <lb/>
            As when in war a pause we intermit. <lb/>
            And whilst yet unabated is my spleen, <lb/>
            We see our friends lie torn upon the ground, <lb n="185"/>
            The Greeks to battle and revenge I prompt. <lb/>
            You think my counsel therein is not sound, <lb/>
            And seek with feasting to divert them from't. <lb/>
            But let us fasting to the battle go, <lb/>
            And make good cheer when we come back again, <lb n="190"/>
            And have reveng'd ourselves upon the foe; <lb/>
            For I will neither eat nor drink till then. <lb/>

            They that go to the war must patient be, <lb/>
            And let the dead unto their graves be borne, <lb/>
            And not weep over them above a day. <lb/>
            And we that safe from fight are come again, <lb n="210"/>
            When we are fed can all day fighting stay. <lb/>
            All other exhortation is vain. <lb/>
            Let therefore now the Greeks to breakfast go, <lb/>
            Which is the soldier's best encouragement, <lb/>
            Then all together fall upon the foe. <lb n="215"/>
            And when he this had said, away he went, <lb/>
            And with him took Meges, Meriones, <lb/>
            Theas, Antilochus, and Thrasymed, <lb/>
            And Menalippus, and added unto these <lb/>
            The martial son of Creon, Lycomed, <lb n="220"/>
            And brought the presents from Atrides' tent. <lb/>
            Sev'n tripods great, and twenty cauldrons bright, <lb/>
            Twelve horses, and sev'n women with them went, <lb/>
            And, fair'st of all, Briseis made them eight. <lb/>
            Talents of gold Ulysses weigh'd out ten, <lb n="225"/>
            And took the pains himself to carry that; <lb/>
            The rest was carri'd by the younger men, <lb/>
            And laid before the princes as they sat. <lb/>
            Then Agamemnon rose, and by him near <lb/>
            Talthybius attended with a swine, <lb n="230"/>
            From which Atrides clipt a lock of hair, <lb/>
            And lifts his hands unto the pow'rs divine. <lb/>
            O Jove, said he, the chiefest of the Gods, <lb/>
            O Sun, and Earth, and Furies underground, <lb/>
            That in your hands carry th' eternal rods <lb n="235"/>
            To punish such as perjur'dshall be found, <lb/>
            My hand I on Briseis never laid, <lb/>
            Neither for bed, nor any other cause; <lb/>
            But always in my tent untouched she staid, <lb/>
            Nor ever by me once attempted was. <lb n="240"/>
            And if herein I told you have a lie, <lb/>
            Let all the dreadful torments that are due <lb/>
            To such as guilty are of perjury <lb/>
            Upon me fall. This said, the swine he <unclear>slew</unclear>. <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            Then out the stomach of the swine did cut, <note type="margin"> LIB. XIX. <lb/>

            And that Talthybius took in his hands. <lb/>
            And threw't into the sea the fish to glut. <lb/>
            That done, Achilles up amongst them stands. <lb/>
            'Tis thou, 0 Jove, said he, that spoilest all. <lb/>
            Briseis at my tent had stayed still, <lb n="250"/>
            Nor had her going from me mov'd my gall, <lb/>
            But that thou hadst a mind the Greeks to kill. <lb/>
            This said, the council he dissolv'd, and sent <lb/>
            Tli' Achæans to their ships to break their fast. <lb/>
            Then ev'ry man unto his own ship went, <lb n="255"/>

            Meanwhile the Myrmidons the presents bear <lb/>

            And thither also brought the women were. <lb/>
            But th' horses to the field his servants sent. <lb n="260"/>
            Briseis, when she saw Patroclus lie <lb/>
            With many ghastly wounds dead on the bier, <lb/>
            She flung her arms about him and did cry, <lb/>
            And her white neck, and face, and breast did tear, <lb/>
            And weeping over him did thus complain. <lb n="265"/>
            0 dear Patroclus, whom alive I left, <lb/>
            Now when I to you am return'd again, <lb/>
            Ah me, I find you of your life bereft. <lb/>
            How fast my woes on one another fall! <lb/>
            The husband which my parents made me wed, <lb n="270"/>
            And three good brothers of one mother all, <lb/>
            I saw before Lyrnessus massacred. <lb/>
            And then, Patroclus, you to comfort me, <lb/>
            Told me that I should be Achilles' wife, <lb/>
            And to him married in Pthia be. <lb n="275"/>
            But now since you have also lost your life, <lb/>
            I never of my woe shall see an end. <lb/>
            And then the other women wept and roar'd, <lb/>
            All for Patroclus, as they did pretend, <lb/>
            But inwardly their own fate they deplor'd. <lb n="280"/>
            The Greeks again about Achilles stood, <lb/>
            And urged him, ere he to battle went, <lb/>
            Himself to strengthen with a little food, <lb/>
            But could by no means get him to consent. <lb/>
            My friends, said he, importune me no more <lb n="285"/>
            To eat or drink before we go to fight. <lb/>
            My heart within me now is vexed sore; <lb/>
            Fear not, I shall endure from morn to night. <lb/>
            This said, the other princes from him went. <lb/>
            The two Atrides and Ulysses stay, <lb n="290"/>
            And Phoenix and old Nestor at his tent, <lb/>
            And King Idomeneus, his grief t' allay, <lb/>
            But nothing they could say did any good, <lb/>

            And looking on Patroclus' body stood, <lb n="295"/>
            And then afresh lamented at the sight. <lb/>
            Sweet friend, said he, you wont were to provide <lb/>
            Good breakfast for me when I was to fight, <lb/>
            But since that comfort now I am denied, <lb/>
            In meat and drink I take no more delight. <lb n="300"/>
            For greater hurt cannot upon me fall, <lb/>
            Although for want of me my father die, <lb/>
            While absent from him at the Trojan wall, <lb/>
            For this accursed Helen's sake I lie; <lb/>
            Nor though my son Neptolemus should die, <lb n="305"/>
            Whom I in Scyros isle left to be bred, <lb/>
            Nor thinking then that here both you and I <lb/>
            Should lose our lives ; but that when I was dead <lb/>
            He should by you be to my house convey'd, <lb/>
            And made to know my servants and estate. <lb n="310"/>
            For Peleus now is very much decay'd, <lb/>
            If quite he have not finished his fate. <lb/>
            When this Achilles, weeping, spoken had, <lb/>
            The good old men, that also had their fears <lb/>
            For those they left at home, were very sad. <lb n="315"/>
            And Jove had pity on Achilles' tears, <lb/>
            And speaking to Athena, Child, said he, <lb/>
            Your love to valiant men, I see, is gone. <lb/>
            Achilles must no more remeinber'd be. <lb/>
            Behold how for his friend he maketh moan, <lb n="320"/>
            And takes no food, though th' other princes feast, <lb/>
            Let not his strength by hunger be decay'd; <lb/>
            Distil ambrosia into his breast, <lb/>
            And nectar. Straight Athena him obey'd. <lb/>
            And swift as any harpy came away, <lb n="325"/>
            And arming of themselves she found the rest; <lb/>
            But that Achilles' strength might not decay, <lb/>
            She dropt ambrosia into his breast, <lb/>
            And nectar sweet, and out the Argives went. <lb/>
            As when from Jove descendeth a thick snow, <lb n="330"/>
            Which Boreas blowcth through the element; <lb/>
            Such of the armed Arrives was the show; <lb/>
            So bright their burnish’d arms and helmets were, <lb/>
            The lustre up to heaven did rebound, <lb/>
            And smiling all about the fields appear, <lb n="335"/>
            And at the moving of their feet resound. <lb/>
            Achilles then his mighty arms puts on, <lb/>
            And grinds his teeth, and fire was in his eyes, <lb/>
            And hasted to the battle to be gone; <lb/>
            So much his heart did at the Trojans rise. <lb n="340"/>
            First to his legs the leg pieces he tied <lb/>
            With buckles of fine silver all along. <lb/>
            And next his breast-plate to his breast applied, <lb/>
            And on his shoulder then his sword he hung; <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            Then up into his hands his shield he took, <note type="margin"> LIB. XIX. <lb/>

            Large, strong, and mighty; radiant was the same, <lb/>
            And from afar it like the moon did look, <lb/>
            Or, as to seamen, on the wolds a flame, <lb/>
            That sure are of a storm when that they see, <lb/>

            And next be puts his helmet on his head, <lb/>
            Which shined like a comet in the air, <lb/>
            So finely Vulcan had it polished, <lb n="355"/>
            And made it seem to blaze with golden hair. <lb/>
            And then to try his arms if fit they were, <lb/>
            He walked about, and thought he wings had worn. <lb/>
            And last from out a tub he took his spear <lb/>
            (Which by his father formerly was borne, <lb n="360"/>
            And made by Chiron in Mount Pelion) <lb/>
            Which no man but Achilles now could wield, <lb/>
            Since Peleus' strength decayed was and gone. <lb/>
            A fatal spear to heroes in the field. <lb/>
            And Alcimus then and Automedon, <lb n="365"/>
            The horses to the chariot made fast, <lb/>
            And harnessed them and put their bridles on, <lb/>
            And back unto the seat the reins they cast. <lb/>
            With whip in hand then mounts Automedon, <lb/>
            And after him Achilles not long staid, <lb n="370"/>
            Yclad in armour shining like the sun, <lb/>
            And roughly to his horses speaking said, <lb/>
            Xanthus and Balius take heed I pray, <lb/>
            A little better of your char'oteer, <lb/>
            Than of Patroclus you did yesterday, <lb n="375"/>
            Whom dead and stript you left behind you here. <lb/>
            This said, his sprightly head low Xanthus hung, <lb/>
            Till on the ground his golden mane was laid. <lb/>
            And Juno human speech gave to his tongue. <lb/>
            And to Achilles then he spake and said, <lb n="380"/>
            Yes, great Achilles, we will save you now: <lb/>
            But know ye, that your utmost day is nigh ; <lb/>
            Not by our faults; the Gods will have it so, <lb/>
            And, which cannot be shunn'd, your destiny. <lb/>
            And that Patroclus is disarm'd and slain, <lb n="385"/>
            'Twas not because we lazy were or slow, <lb/>
            But that Priamides might honour gain, <lb/>
            Apollo slew him with his silver bow. <lb/>
            For we could have gone faster than the wind, <lb/>
            If that could to him any good have done. <lb n="390"/>
            The thread of life which for him was design’d <lb/>
            Was by the Destinies drawn out and spun. <lb/>
            This then said Xanthus, but could not proceed. <lb/>
            His speech the Furies from him took again. <pb n="236"/>

            Xanthus, replied Achilles, there's no need <lb n="395"/>
            For you to prophecy my death in vain. <lb/>
            I know already that I here must die, <lb/>

            And on the plain the Trojans ready all, <lb/>
            Jove to the goddess Thetis gave command <lb/>
            The common council of the Gods to call. <lb/>
            Then down ste came, and calling went about. <lb n="5"/>
            Ye Gods, said she, Jove calls you to his house. <lb/>
            And straight the Rivers from their streams came out, <lb/>
            All but their father old Oceanus. <lb/>
            The Nymphs from ev'ry meadow, spring and grove, <lb/>
            Up to the Mount Olympus went in haste; <lb n="10"/>
            And when they come were to the house of Jove, <lb/>
            In porches round on polished seats were plac'd; <lb/>
            And Neptune also having heard the call, <lb/>
            Leap'd from the sea up to Olympus' hill, <lb/>
            And sitting in the midst, before them all <lb n="15"/>
            To Jove he spake, and said, What is your will ? <lb/>
            D'ye call us hither our advice to hear; <lb/>
            To give the day to Trojan or to Greek; <lb/>
            For I perceive the battle now is near ? <lb/>
            My mind, said Jupiter, you need not seek. <lb n="20"/>
            For of the Greeks distrest I have a care. <lb/>
            But on Olympus I intend to stay, <lb/>
            And please myself with looking on the war. <lb/>
            But let the other Gods go down to Troy, <lb/>
            And take which side they will. For else I fear, <lb n="25"/>
            Achilles, whom the Trojans did so dread, <lb/>
            When in the battle no immortals were, <lb/>
            And more enrag'd is since his friend is dead; <lb/>
            When he has driv'n the Trojans from the field, <lb/>
            Will then directly go to Ilium, <lb n="30"/>
            And overthrow the wall which you did build, <lb/>
            Before the time, by fate appointed, come. <lb/>
            This said, the fight began. On th' Argives' side <lb/>
            Stood Juno, Pallas, Neptune, Mercury; <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            And Vulcan, taking in his strength great pride, <note type="margin"> LID. XX. </note><note type="margin"> The eighth <lb/>

            Went halting ’mongst them with his legs awry. <lb/>
            On th' other side, Mars for the Trojans stood, <lb/>
            And Phoebus, and his sister Artemis, <lb/>
            Their mother Leto, and Scamander-flood, <lb/>
            And Venus that of all the fairest is. <lb n="40"/>
            And whilst they from the battle stood aside, <lb/>
            The Argives mightily encouraged were, <lb/>
            And in Achilles' presence took great pride; <lb/>
            For long it seem'd they had not seen him there. <lb/>
            The Trojans, when they saw him, shook for fear, <lb n="45"/>
            So like to Mars he was, his arms so bright. <lb/>
            But when the Gods on both sides with them were, <lb/>
            Then all about was filled with affright, <lb/>
            And in the air heard was Athena's shrill <lb/>
            As from the ditch, and sometimes from the shore, <lb n="50"/>
            And Mars sometimes from Callidone hill, <lb/>
            And sometimes as at Troy was heard to roar, <lb/>
            The Trojans he, but she the Greeks to incite. <lb/>
            Thus by the Gods from heav'n encouraged, <lb/>
            The armies met, and cruel was the fight, <lb n="55"/>
            And terribly above Jove thundered, <lb/>
            And Neptune shook the earth on ev'ry side; <lb/>
            The Argive ships, and stately Trojan tow'rs, <lb/>
            The plain beneath, and lofty tops of Ide. <lb/>
            And frighten'd with it were th' infernal pow'rs ; <lb n="60"/>
            And Pluto, starting from his ugly throne, <lb/>
            To Neptune cried out his hand to hold, <lb/>
            For fear his dismal dwelling should be shown <lb/>
            To men and Gods, so hateful to behold. <lb/>
            So great a noise the Gods make when they fight. <lb n="65"/>
            Phœbus to Neptune now opposed is, <lb/>
            And Pallas stands against rude Mars his might, <lb/>
            And Juno matched is with Artemis, <lb/>
            And Mercury against Latona stood. <lb/>
            But he that Vulcan had to deal withal, <lb n="70"/>
            Was the divine and deep swift-running flood, <lb/>
            Which Xanthus Gods, but men Scamander call. <lb/>
            Thus were th' Immortals matched one to one. <lb/>
            Achilles would have given any good <lb/>
            That he had matched been to Priam's son, <lb n="75"/>
            T’ have made to Mars a breakfast of his blood. <lb/>

            T’ encounter with Achilles; and array'd <lb/>
            In th' person and the voice of Lycaon <lb/>
            Came to his side, and thus unto him said: <lb n="80"/>
            Æneas, when the wine was in your head, <lb/>
            I oft have heard you of yourself say this, <lb/>
            That 'gainst Achilles you in fight durst stand. <lb/>
            What say you to him now ? See, there he is. <pb n="238"/>

            Priamides, Æneas then replied, <lb n="85"/>
            Why would you have me with Achilles fight ? <lb/>
            I once already was, upon mount Ide <lb/>
            Keeping our cattle, by him put to flight; <lb/>
            And thence for safety to Lyrnessus fled. <lb/>
            But he the town Lyrnessus quickly won, <lb n="90"/>
            And Pedassus. And then I had been dead <lb/>
            If Jove had not enabled me to run. <lb/>
            For Pallas with him was and made him way, <lb/>
            Striking his foes before him with affright, <lb/>
            And urging him the Trojans to destroy. <lb n="95"/>
            'Tis more than man can do t' oppose his might; <lb/>
            One God or other always with him is <lb/>
            To put aside the spears before they come. <lb/>
            And whom he aims at he doth never miss, <lb/>
            And to the mark his spear flies always home. <lb n="100"/>
            But if the Gods unpartial would be, <lb/>
            Although of solid brass his body were, <lb/>
            He should not easily get the victory. <lb/>
            Æneas, then said Phœbus, do not fear, <lb/>
            But pray unto the Gods. Your mother is <lb n="105"/>
            Jove's daughter Cytherea, as they say, <lb/>
            A greater Goddess by descent than his ; <lb/>
            And therefore boldly to him go your way. <lb/>
            His mighty words and threats you must not fear. <lb/>
            This said, he courage breath'd into his breast. <lb n="110"/>
            Then through the foremost went he with his spear, <lb/>
            And helmet of strong brass with glittering crest. <lb/>
            Now Juno of his going was aware, <lb/>
            And calling to her th' other Gods, she said, <lb/>
            Neptune and Pallas, let us have a care; <lb n="115"/>
            I see a danger that ought to be weigh'd. <lb/>
            AEneas yonder, with his spear in hand, <lb/>
            Goes to Achilles with a mind to fight. <lb/>
            Let's keep him off, or by Achilles stand, <lb/>
            And add both to his courage and his might, <lb n="120"/>
            That he may know the Gods of greatest pow'r <lb/>
            Are on his side, and those that stand for Troy <lb/>
            In virtue much to us inferior, <lb/>
            And dare not in the field against us stay; <lb/>
            And that we from Olympus hither came <lb n="125"/>
            To save him now; hereafter, whatsoe'er <lb/>
            Mischances come, he must endure the same, <lb/>
            Since at his birth they woven with him were. <lb/>
            For if unknown our purpose to him be, <lb/>
            To meet a God will put him into fear. <lb n="130"/>
            'Tis dangerous Gods as they are to see; <lb/>
            So terrible to mortals they appear. <lb/>
            And Neptune unto Juno then replied, <lb/>

            Nor does it need, so much we have the odds. <lb/>
            But let's go hence to yonder mountain top, <lb/>

            And when he this had said, he led away, <lb/>
            And when he come was to the castle-wall, <lb n="145"/>
            Which was by th' Trojans built for Hercules <lb/>
            By Pallas' help, to save him from the whale <lb/>
            That much annoy'd the Trojans from the seas, <lb/>
            He and his party of the Gods staid there, <lb/>
            Concealed by a cloud, and looking on. <lb n="150"/>
            But Mars and Phœbus, with their party, were <lb/>
            Sitting upon the brow of Callidon. <lb/>
            Thus from the field the Gods on both sides staid, <lb/>
            Consulting how their friends the day might win, <lb/>
            But neither side effectually would aid, <lb n="155"/>
            For not a God amongst them durst begin. <lb/>
            Now cover'd over was the field with men, <lb/>
            Both horse and foot, array'd in armour bright; <lb/>
            The earth resounded with their feet. And then <lb/>
            Two warriors in the midst stood out to fight, <lb n="160"/>
            Achilles and Æneas, the two best. <lb/>
            And first iEneas, with fierce looks, went on <lb/>
            With spear in hand, and shield before his breast. <lb/>
            To meet him then advanced Thetis' son. <lb/>
            As when to chase a lion from the plain, <lb n="165"/>
            The people of the town with weapons rise, <lb/>
            The lion looks upon them with disdain, <lb/>
            As if he did their multitude despise; <lb/>
            But when a spear from any of them comes, <lb/>
            He whips himself int' anger with his tail, <lb n="170"/>
            And terribly goes on, and yawns and foams, <lb/>
            To kill, or to be killed if he fail: <lb/>
            So at the seeing of iEneas' spear, <lb/>
            Achilles did himself to th' fight provoke. <lb/>
            And when they stood to one another near, <lb n="175"/>
            Achilles first unto AEneas spoke. <lb/>
            AEneas, why, said he, come you away <lb/>
            So far before the rest ? To fight with me ? <lb/>
            Will Priam, think you, make you king of Troy, <lb/>
            If by your hand perhaps I slain should be ? <lb n="180"/>
            No. He is wise, and sons has of his own. <lb/>
            Or will the Trojans set you out great lands, <lb/>
            Some to be planted, others to be sown, <lb/>
            Whenever I am killed by your hands ? <pb n="240"/>

            But that I hope will never be. You know <lb n="185"/>
            How once I made you run down Ida hill, <lb/>

            You ne'er look'd back for fear of greater ill; <lb/>
            And how the town I won, and led away <lb/>
            The women captives; though'twas then Jove's will <lb n="190"/>
            That from my hands you should escape that day, <lb/>
            You must not look that you should do so still. <lb/>
            And therefore I advise you to be gone, <lb/>
            And in the throng o' th' Trojans to abide, <lb/>
            For ev'ry fool his harm knows when 'tis done. <lb n="195"/>
            This said, Æneas to him thus replied : <lb/>
            Pelides, do not think you can me fright, <lb/>
            As if I were a child, with words of scorn; <lb/>
            For if in evil words I took delight, <lb/>
            I could as many easily return. <lb n="200"/>
            We one another's parents know by fame; <lb/>
            Peleus your father was, Anchises mine. <lb/>
            Your mother is divine, Thetis by name; <lb/>
            And Venus mine, of the celestial line; <lb/>
            And one of them to-day must lose a son, <lb n="205"/>
            For 'tis not words can fetch us off this place. <lb/>
            But if you'll know my generation, <lb/>
            I'll by my father likewise count my race; <lb/>
            For first by Jove was Dardanus begot, <lb/>
            That rul'd the Dardans under Ida hill, <lb n="210"/>
            In divers towns; for Ilium yet was not, <lb/>
            But at the foot of Ida they dwelt still. <lb/>
            And Dardan Erichthonius begat, <lb/>
            That was the wealthiest of mortal men: <lb/>
            Three thousand mares he had, and unto that <lb n="215"/>
            As many foals, all feeding on the fen. <lb/>
            And twelve of these were got by Boreas, <lb/>
            That leapt their dams in likeness of a horse, <lb/>
            And o'er the ears of standing corn could pass <lb/>
            And never make them stoop, such was their force; <lb n="220"/>
            And run upon the sea, and never wet <lb/>
            Their hoofs, which very wondrous was to see. <lb/>
            And Erichthonius did Tros beget. <lb/>
            And Tros the father was of children three, <lb/>
            Bus, Assaracus, and Ganymed. <lb n="225"/>
            But Ganymed was taken up by Jove, <lb/>
            So fair he was, and t' heaven carried, <lb/>
            To minister unto the Gods above. <lb/>
            The son of Ilus was Laomedon, <lb/>
            And he Tithonus got, and Priamus, <lb n="230"/>
            And Lampus, Clytius, Icetaon. <lb/>
            But Capys son was of Assaracus. <lb/>
            Capys begat Anchises, and he me. <lb/>

            But given is to them whom Jove will grace. <lb/>
            Then let us from reproachful words abstain, <lb/>
            Whereof there is great plenty everywhere, <lb/>
            To serve all men that will them entertain, <lb/>
            That as a man will speak, so he may hear. <lb n="240"/>
            What need we, like two women in the street, <lb/>
            When they cannot agree, to rail and scoff? <lb/>
            Who, say they true or false, are indiscreet. <lb/>
            For from my purpose you'll not put me off <lb/>
            With scornful words, before your force I try, <lb n="245"/>
            Let's therefore here no longer talk, but fight. <lb/>
            And as he spake his spear he letteth fly, <lb/>
            Which on Achilles' mighty shield fell right, <lb/>
            And terribly it made the same resound, <lb/>
            Achilles far before him held his shield, <lb n="250"/>
            For fear AEneas through it might him wound; <lb/>
            Though heav'nly arms to mortals will not yield. <lb/>
            But that he thought not on. Nor did the spear, <lb/>
            Well driven as it was, and strong, pass through ; <lb/>
            For of five plies that labour'd in it were <lb n="255"/>
            By Mulciber, it pierced only two, <lb/>
            And those were brass. There still remained three, <lb/>
            The one of gold, the other two of tin; <lb/>
            And stopped by the brass it could not be, <lb/>
            But coming to the gold it there stuck in. <lb n="260"/>
            And then Achilles threw his spear at him, <lb/>
            Which flying with great force pass'd thro' his shield, <lb/>
            Where thin the brass and hide was near the brim, <lb/>
            And over him it flew into the field. <lb/>
            For when AEneas coming saw the spear, <lb n="265"/>
            He crouched low, and held his buckler high; <lb/>
            And though the same proceeded but from fear, <lb/>
            It made the spear above his head to fly. <lb/>
            AEneas at the first amazed stands; <lb/>
            But when Achilles with his sword came on, <lb n="270"/>
            He stoop'd, and from the ground took in his hands, <lb/>
            That near unto him lay, a mighty stone, <lb/>
            Which two men, such as now are, scarce could bear, <lb/>
            And hit him had on th' head or breast in vain, <lb/>
            That with celestial arms defended were, <lb n="275"/>
            And by Achilles' sword himself been slain, <lb/>
            If it had not by Neptune been foreseen. <lb/>
            Who speaking to the Gods did thus complain. <lb/>
            O Gods, said he, great pain I now am in <lb/>
            To see AEneas by Achilles slain, <lb n="280"/>
            For heark'ning to Apollo foolishly; <lb/>
            Who will not help him though he set him on. <lb/>

            This said, to Neptune Juno did reply: <lb/>
            If you Æneas have a mind to save, <lb n="290"/>
            Save him yourself. For well you know that I <lb/>
            And Pallas ’mongst the Gods sworn often have, <lb/>
            That neither of us shall a Trojan aid, <lb/>
            Though Ilium itself were in a flame. <lb/>
            Away went Neptune soon as that was said, <lb n="295"/>
            And to Æneas and Achilles came, <lb/>
            And o'er Achilles' eyes a mist he spread, <lb/>
            And drew his spear out of AEneas' shield; <lb/>
            And to Achilles that he carried, <lb/>
            And laid it at his feet upon the field. <lb n="300"/>
            And then AEneas, lifted by the force <lb/>
            Of an immortal God, skipp'd to the rear, <lb/>
            O'er many ranks of heroes and of horse, <lb/>
            Unto the Caucons, that the hindmost were, <lb/>
            Where Neptune standing by him spake, and said: <lb n="305"/>
            AEneas, who was't of th' immortal Gods, <lb/>
            That to engage Achilles you betray’d, <lb/>
            That stronger is than you by so much odds ? <lb/>
            Henceforth take heed you come not in his way, <lb/>
            Lest by his hand you die. When he is gone, <lb n="310"/>
            You boldly on the best adventure may, <lb/>
            For of the rest you slain shall be by none. <lb/>
            This said, he to Achilles went again, <lb/>
            And made the mist to vanish from his eyes, <lb/>
            And round about him look'd Achilles then, <lb n="315"/>
            And to his feet return'd, his spear espies, <lb/>
            And said unto himself, 0 strange, what's this ? <lb/>
            The man is gone, my spear come back I see. <lb/>
            Æneas of the Gods beloved is, <lb/>

            Now nor henceforth (he for you is too strong) <lb/>
            Lest by his spear or sword you chance to fall. <lb/>
            Thus Hector, by the God admonished, <lb/>
            Into the Trojan troops retired again. <lb/>
            The Trojans then before Achilles fled ; <lb n="355"/>
            And by him first Iphition was slain, <lb/>
            Whom the nymph Neis to Otrynteus bare, <lb/>
            In Ida, at the foot of Tmolus hill; <lb/>
            Great troops he brought unto the Trojan war, <lb/>
            And thought he could the great Pelides kill: <lb n="360"/>
            But coming on, he met Achilles' spear, <lb/>
            The fatal spear, that cleft his head in twain. <lb/>
            Achilles then triumphed o'er him there, <lb/>
            Though fallen to the ground he were, and slain. <lb/>
            So, Otryntides, die there on the earth, <lb n="365"/>
            Though where runs Hyllus into Hermus deep, <lb/>
            On the Gygean lake, you had your birth. <lb/>
            This said, he left him in eternal sleep, <lb/>
            For th' Argive char'ot-wheels to crush and grind. <lb/>
            And after him he slew Demoleon, <lb n="370"/>
            A warrior good, and of undaunted mind, <lb/>
            That of Antenor was a valiant son. <lb/>
            Him through the head, with spear in hand, he smote, <lb/>
            And out together came both blood and brain; <lb/>
            His helmet, though of brass, preserved him not. <lb n="375"/>
            And after he Demoleon had slain, <lb/>
            He with his spear pursu'd Hippodamas, <lb/>
            Who from his car had leapt unto the ground; <lb/>
            Frighted, and now before him running was, <lb/>
            And gave him on the back a mortal wound, <lb n="380"/>
            Whereat he blows and roars like any bull <lb/>
            Brought to the altar for a sacrifice, <lb/>
            When young men by the horns him thither pull <lb/>
            By violence ; then down he falls, and dies. <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>

            Unluckily, then in Achilles' sight <lb n="385"/>
            Was Polydorus, Priam's youngest son, <lb/>
            And best belov'd; whom he forbad to fight, <lb/>
            Though swiftest of them all he were to run: <lb/>
            But he, the virtue of his feet to shew, <lb/>
            Betwixt the hosts ran up and down the field, <lb n="390"/>
            Until a spear Achilles at him threw, <lb/>
            And with a wound upon the back him kill'd; <lb/>
            Out at his navel went the spear again, <lb/>
            And for his guts to follow made a way. <lb/>
            But Hector, when he saw his brother slain, <lb n="395"/>
            Amongst his troops he could no longer stay, <lb/>
            But going to Achilles, shook his spear. <lb/>
            Then, speaking to himself, Achilles said, <lb/>
            The man that slew Patroclus I see here, <lb/>
            We must no more each other now avoid; <lb n="400"/>
            And sourly on him looking, said, Come near, <lb/>
            That I may quickly of you make an end. <lb/>
            And Hector to him answer'd without fear, <lb/>
            In vain, Achilles, your proud words you spend ; <lb/>
            Such words as these may children terrify, <lb n="405"/>
            And I can speak that language when I list; <lb/>
            And though you be a mightier man than I, <lb/>
            The victory does not in that consist, <lb/>
            But he shall have it whom the Gods appoint, <lb/>
            Though he be weaker, if his spear fly true, <lb n="410"/>
            Which mine may do, and sharp is at the point. <lb/>
            This said, his spear he at Achilles threw, <lb/>
            Which back to Hector's feet Athena blew, <lb/>
            With soft and gentle breath, without a sound ; <lb/>
            And straight Achilles, thund'ring, to him flew. <lb n="415"/>
            But then Apollo snatch'd him from the ground, <lb/>
            Which is by any God done in a trice, <lb/>
            And in a mist conceal'd him from his sight: <lb/>
            And after him Ahcilles leapt up thrice. <lb/>
            And thrice the air obscure in vain did smite <lb n="420"/>
            Then whoop'd he after him, and threat'ning said, <lb/>
            Dog, an ill death again thou 'scaped hast, <lb/>
            That fighting, to Apollo pray'st for aid; <lb/>
            But yet I shall dispatch you at the last, <lb/>
            If any of the Gods for me appear; <lb n="425"/>
            But now I must to other Trojans go. <lb/>
            This said, at Dryops straight he threw his spear, <lb/>
            And sent his soul unto the shades below. <lb/>
            To meet Demuchus then he went half way, <lb/>
            That with his sword came toward him to fight: <lb n="430"/>
            Him with a wound i' th' neck he made to stay, <lb/>
            And with his sword then killed him outright. <lb/>
            Then by him slain the sons of Bias were, <lb/>
            Laogonus and Dardanus, the one <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            With his great sword, the other with his spear. <note type="margin"> LIB. XX. </note><note type="margin"> The eighth <lb/>

            And next he killed Tros, Alastor's son, <lb/>
            Who not resisted, but fell at his knee, <lb/>
            And begg'd his life, for being of his age, <lb/>
            Hoping for that he pitied might be. <lb/>
            But that Achilles' wrath could not assuage. <lb n="440"/>
            He quite mistook his nature like a child, <lb/>
            For cruel was Achilles, and hard-hearted; <lb/>
            But he sweet-natur'd thought he was, and mild, <lb/>
            Whereas he never thought how others smarted. <lb/>
            And then Achilles gave him such a wound, <lb n="445"/>
            That with the blood his liver started out. <lb/>
            And there he left him dying on the ground, <lb/>
            And for more Trojan leaders look'd about; <lb/>
            Then, coming to him, he saw Mulius, <lb/>
            And struck him through the head from ear to ear. <lb n="450"/>
            Then with his sword he killed Echeclus, <lb/>
            Antenor's son, that to him came too near. <lb/>
            Then on the arm he hit Demotion, <lb/>
            The spear stuck in, and forc'd him there to stay; <lb/>
            Achilles then came furiously on, <lb n="455"/>
            And with his sword he skimm'd his head away, <lb/>
            Helmet and all. Then Regmus, with a wound <lb/>
            Upon the belly, he slew with his spear, <lb/>
            Who from his char'ot fell unto the ground; <lb/>
            And after him he slew his charioteer, <lb n="460"/>
            Areithous, whilst he his horses turns. <lb/>
            As a thick coppice, on a windy day, <lb/>
            If set on fire, unmercifully burns ; <lb/>
            So went Achilles killing ev'ry way. <lb/>
            As oxen from the straw tread out the corn, <lb n="465"/>
            So trampling went his horses o'er the dead, <lb/>
            That with their bucklers by the wheels were torn, <lb/>
            And th' axle-tree with blood was covered, <lb/>
            And spokes ; in part with droppings from the wheels, <lb/>
            (For going on the ground the wheels were gory) <lb n="470"/>
            And partly beaten up with th' horses' heels, <lb/>
            And bloody were his hands; and all for glory.</p>

          <p>WHEN to the river Xantlius they were come, <lb/>
            The Trojans at the ford half of them pass'd, <lb/>
            And on the highway fled to Ilium; <lb/>
            The other leapt into the stream for haste, <pb n="246"/>

            Achilles, with <lb/>

            And with the winding flood there swimming strive. <lb n="5"/>
            As locusts, when by sudden tier sprung, <lb/>
            In swarms into the river fly and dive; <lb/>
            So they themselves into Scamander flung, <lb/>
            And filled was the stream with horse and men. <lb/>
            Achilles on the bank-side left his spear, <lb n="10"/>
            Set up on end against a tree; and then <lb/>
            Achilles leapt in with his sword ; and there <lb/>
            He kill'd as fast as he could turn and strike, <lb/>
            And with their blood the stream was dyed red. <lb/>
            And grievous 'twas to hear them groan and shriek, <lb n="15"/>
            That in the flood were by him massacred. <lb/>
            As when the dolphins in a river are, <lb/>
            The other fish scud to the banks in shoals, <lb/>
            So did it with the swimming Trojans fare; <lb/>
            They fled to th' banks, and hid themselves in holes. <lb n="20"/>
            And twelve of them alive Achilles took, <lb/>
            And with their girdles hands behind them bound, <lb/>
            Then caus'd them to be led out of the brook, <lb/>
            And to the ships conveyed safe and sound, <lb/>
            To slay them at Patroclus' funeral. <lb n="25"/>
            Then from the river out he came again, <lb/>
            And Priam's son Lycaon met withal, <lb/>
            That from Scamander flying was in vain, <lb/>
            Whom prisoner he had taken once before, <lb/>
            When in his father's ground he was by night, <lb n="30"/>
            Cutting of spoke staves from a sycamore, <lb/>
            And on him now the second time did light. <lb/>
            To Lemnos first he sent him to be sold, <lb/>
            And bought he there was by Eetion. <lb/>
            Achilles for him had good store of gold. <lb n="35"/>
            But he got loose and home again did run. <lb/>
            And there eleven days he staid; and well <lb/>
            Was entertained in his father's house. <lb/>
            The twelfth into Achilles' hands he fell <lb/>
            Again, that sent him then to Erebus. <lb n="40"/>
            Achilles seeing him without a spear, <lb/>
            Without a shield, and nothing on his head, <lb/>
            (For he had cast away his arms for fear, <lb/>
            When almost tir'd he from the river fled.) <lb/>
            Achilles, grumbling to himself, then said, <lb n="45"/>
            O strange! These Trojans are stout-hearted men. <lb/>
            That being sent away, will not be staid, <lb/>
            But to the war must needs come back again. <lb/>
            Here's one I sent to Lemnos to be sold, <lb/>
            And now lie's come to fight with me again, <lb n="50"/>
            'Tis strange the sea could not him from me hold, <lb/>
            That can against their will hold other men. <lb/>
            But well, I'll give him of my spear a taste, <lb/>
            And send him to the earth that I may see <lb/>

            By which are holden better men than he. <lb/>
            Whilst thus Achilles said, the man came near <lb/>
            To beg his life, for loath to die was he. <lb/>
            To wound him then Achilles lifts his spear, <lb/>
            But under it he got unto his knee, <lb n="60"/>
            And with one hand laid hold upon his spear, <lb/>
            And on Achilles' knee the other laid. <lb/>
            And kneeling down before him shook with fear, <lb/>
            And lamentably to him speaking said, <lb/>
            Achilles, I beseech you pity me, <lb n="65"/>
            And save my life, although 'twere but for this, <lb/>
            That I your prisoner was. Captivity <lb/>
            At least for life a sanctuary is. <lb/>
            And when you unto Lemnos sent me had, <lb/>
            You for me got a hundred oxen's price; <lb n="70"/>
            And for my ransom now I should be glad <lb/>
            You would be pleas'd to take that value thrice. <lb/>
            'Tis but twelve days since I came back to Troy, <lb/>
            And all the way had been in grievous pain, <lb/>
            And when I thought I should my friends enjoy, <lb n="75"/>
            I fallen am into your hands again. <lb/>
            Ohow have I so much incurr'd the hate <lb/>
            Of Jupiter to shorten thus my life! <lb/>
            Or from my mother cometh my hard fate, <lb/>

            Altheus got her, king of Pedasus, <lb/>
            And she of Priam's many wives was one, <lb/>
            For many more beside had Priamus, <lb/>
            And by her had me and another son. <lb/>
            And both of us must by you now be kill'd, <lb n="85"/>
            For Polydore you have already slain, <lb/>
            Whilst like a child he ran about the field. <lb/>
            And for myself, I fear, I pray in vain. <lb/>
            But what am I that must no quarter have? <lb/>
            Though by my father I am Hector's brother, <lb n="90"/>
            That sent the good Patroclus to his grave, <lb/>
            Yet I am nothing to him by the mother. <lb/>
            Thus pleaded he. Achilles then replied: <lb/>
            Tell me no more of ransom or of quarter. <lb/>
            'Tis true, I did, before Patroclus died, <lb n="95"/>
            Suffer some Trojans for their lives to barter; <lb/>
            But now if any of the Trojans fall <lb/>
            Into my hands before the town of Troy, <lb/>
            And those of Priam's race the least of all, <lb/>
            Must hope from me to get alive away. <lb n="100"/>
            But wherefore, friend, should you think much to die? <lb/>
            Patroclus, a much better man, is gone. <lb/>
            You see how strong and tall a man am I, <lb/>

            This said, Lycaon's heart and limbs both fail'd, <lb/>
            And of the spear letis go his hold, and wide <lb n="110"/>
            His hands he spread and his sad fate bewail'd. <lb/>
            Achilles then his sword drew from his side, <lb/>
            And gave him on the neck a mighty wound, <lb/>
            The sword's whole breadth into his neck he took, <lb/>
            And presently he fell dead to the ground. <lb n="115"/>
            Achilles threw him then into the brook, <lb/>

            And feed the fishes that will lick your blood; <lb/>
            Your mother over you shall never weep, <lb/>
            But to the sea you go shall with the flood, <lb n="120"/>
            Where to the curled water leaps a fish, <lb/>
            Upon Lycaon's dainty fat to feed; <lb/>
            And until Troy be by us won, I wish <lb/>
            That th' other Trojans may no better speed, <lb/>
            But flying, by my spear be toss'd like hay. <lb n="125"/>
            Scamander shall afford them little aid, <lb/>
            Though to his stream they bulls and horses slay, <lb/>
            Till for Patroclus' death they all have paid. <lb/>
            With these his haughty words, Scamander griev'd, <lb/>
            Contrived how Achilles to repel, <lb n="130"/>
            And how the Trojans best might be reliev'd, <lb/>
            That to escape into his water fell. <lb/>
            Achilles then Asteropæus spied, <lb/>
            Pelegon's son, the son of Axius, <lb/>
            Of Axius the river deep and wide, <lb n="135"/>
            By th' daughter of king Acessamenus. <lb/>
            And to him with a mind to kill him went, <lb/>
            As he was newly come out of the water. <lb/>
            But Xanthus gave him such encouragement, <lb/>
            (Because Achilles fill'd his stream with slaughter), <lb n="140"/>
            That there Asteropæus for him staid, <lb/>
            And both in right and left hand had a spear, <lb/>
            And never sought the combat to avoid. <lb/>
            And when they were to one another near, <lb/>
            Who are you, said Achilles, and whose son, <lb n="145"/>
            That in my anger dares approach me so ? <lb/>
            For I in arms encounter'd am by none <lb/>
            But those whose parents destin'd are to woe. <lb/>
            Asteropæus to him then replied: <lb/>
            Why ask you me whose son and who I am ? <lb n="150"/>
            The forces of Pæonia I guide; <lb/>
            To whom elev'n days since I hither came. <lb/>
            Of my descent, the author Axius is, <lb/>
            The fairest stream that on the earth doth run <lb/>

            Thus who I am tis told you, and whose son. <lb/>
            And now, Achilles, it is time to fight. <lb/>
            This said, from his two hands his two spears fly, <lb/>
            For both Asteropæus’ hands were right, <lb/>
            The one of them his mighty shield did try, <lb n="160"/>
            But pierc’ d it not; the plate of gold withstood. <lb/>
            The other gave his arm a little wound <lb/>
            Near to his elbow, and fetched out some blood, <lb/>
            And so beyond him went and stuck i' th' ground. <lb/>
            Achilles then his spear with all his strength <lb n="165"/>
            Incensed at Asteropœus threw, <lb/>
            Which missing, into th' earth went half its length. <lb/>
            Then from his side his sword Achilles drew. <lb/>
            Asteropæus to Achilles' spear <lb/>
            Went back, and at it thrice he pluck'd in vain; <lb n="170"/>
            Then thought to break it; but Achilles there <lb/>
            Was with his sword, and with that he was slain. <lb/>
            For by the sword his belly was so ripp'd, <lb/>
            That all his bowels issued at the wound. <lb/>
            There him Achilles of his armour stripp'd, <lb n="175"/>
            And o'er him crow'd as he lay on the ground. <lb/>
            Lie there, said he; shall rivers' sons compare <lb/>
            With th' offspring of the blessed Gods above ? <lb/>
            The issue of a brook, you say, you are, <lb/>
            But I the issue am of mighty Jove; <lb n="180"/>
            For Peleus my father was, and his <lb/>
            Was Æacus, whom Jupiter begot. <lb/>
            But greater he than any river is, <lb/>
            Then equal to his race, their race is not. <lb/>
            A river great enough you had at hand, <lb n="185"/>
            But that you found had done you little good. <lb/>
            For nothing can the power of Jove withstand; <lb/>
            Not Achelous with his royal flood, <lb/>
            Nor th' Ocean itself, of waters king, <lb/>
            From whose abundance seas their water take, <lb n="190"/>
            And ev'ry river, stream, and well, and spring <lb/>
            That goeth on the earth, and ev'ry lake ; <lb/>
            Who, when they but a clap of thunder hear, <lb/>
            From Jove some danger presently they dread. <lb/>
            This said, from th' earth he pulled out his spear, <lb n="195"/>
            And left o' th' sands Asteropæus dead, <lb/>
            Where Xanthus from the wound shall wash the blood, <lb/>
            And eels and other fish feed on his fat. <lb/>
            Achilles then pursued those that stood <lb/>
            Upon Scamander bank amazed at <lb n="200"/>
            The fury of the giddy stream; and when <lb/>
            They saw their leader killed in their sight <lb/>
            By th’ hand of terrible Achilles, then <lb/>
            They ev'ry one betook themselves to flight. <pb n="250"/>

            Then with his sword he slew Thersilochus, <lb n="205"/>
            And after him the stout Astypylus, <lb/>
            And Opholostes, Mydon, Ænius, <lb/>
            And after these, Mnesus and Thrasius, <lb/>
            And had shed yet much more Pæonian blood, <lb/>
            But that Scamander at it took offence, <lb n="210"/>
            And like a man above his water stood, <lb/>
            And to Achilles spake his mind from thence. <lb/>
            Achilles, truly you excel in might, <lb/>
            And acts you do of great iniquity, <lb/>
            And by the Gods assisted are in fight. <lb n="215"/>
            But though by Jove you should allowed be <lb/>
            To kill the Trojans, kill them on the plain. <lb/>
            My stream so choked is with carcasses, <lb/>
            I cannot drive my waters to the main. <lb/>
            I wonder you should do such deeds as these; <lb n="220"/>
            Let those you kill be killed openly. <lb/>
            Go therefore from me. Thus Scamander said. <lb/>
            And then unto the River answered he: <lb/>
            Divine Scamander, you shall be obey'd. <lb/>
            But to pursue the Trojans I mean still, <lb n="225"/>
            Till I have chas'd them up to Ilium. <lb/>
            And fight with Hector, if he stay, I will, <lb/>
            And see if his or my last day be come. <lb/>
            Scamander then unto Apollo spake: <lb/>
            Phœbus, said he, you Jove's commandment slight, <lb n="230"/>
            That bade you of the Trojans care to take, <lb/>
            And to defend them all you could till night. <lb/>
            Into the stream Achilles leaps again, <lb/>
            At which Scamander swelling lifts his waves, <lb/>
            And out he throws the bodies of dead men, <lb n="235"/>
            And from Achilles' hand the living saves. <lb/>
            Then throws a billow on Achilles' head, <lb/>
            And heavy on his shield the current lay; <lb/>
            And on the ground by no means he could tread, <lb/>
            So fast the River carried him away. <lb n="240"/>
            But o'er the water hung an elmen limb <lb/>
            Which he laid hold on. Then fell down the tree <lb/>
            Into the river. And that saved him, <lb/>
            And served as a bridge to set hint free. <lb/>
            And swiftly then Achilles from him ran, <lb n="245"/>
            But after him Scamander sent his water, <lb/>
            Resolv'd to quench the fury of the man, <lb/>
            And save the Trojans in his stream from slaughter. <lb/>
            And then as far as one can throw a spear <lb/>
            Achilles from the flood obliquely flies <lb n="250"/>
            Swift as a hawk ; but yet was ne'er the near; <lb/>
            For still he water has before his eyes. <lb/>
            As when a man makes passage with his spade <lb/>
            For water to his garden from a hill, <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            The stream outruns him that the channel made; <note type="margin"> LIB. XXI. </note><note type="margin"> Achilles, with <lb/>

            So Xanthus was before Achilles still. <lb/>
            And ever as Achilles turn'd or stood <lb/>
            To see if any God would by him stand, <lb/>
            Above his shoulders rose the mighty flood, <lb/>
            And while he starts from's feet removes the sand. <lb n="260"/>
            Achilles then himself bewailing said, <lb/>
            0 Jupiter, and look'd up to the sky, <lb/>
            Let some God 'gainst this River give me aid, <lb/>
            And any other death then let me die. <lb/>
            But none I know on whom the fault to lay <lb n="265"/>
            But my dear mother, who to flatter me, <lb/>
            Said I should die before the walls of Troy, <lb/>
            And by Apollo only killed be. <lb/>
            0 that I had by Hectors hand been slain, <lb/>
            The best of all the men that fight for Troy. <lb n="270"/>
            But now I perish like a silly swain <lb/>
            Passing a torrent in a rainy day. <lb/>
            These words Achilles had no sooner said, <lb/>
            But Neptune and Athena with him were ; <lb/>
            And on Achilles' hand their hands they laid. <lb n="275"/>
            Then Neptune said, Achilles, do not fear. <lb/>
            Encouraged by two such Gods as we, <lb/>
            Pallas and I, and that by Jove's command, <lb/>
            Retiring soon you shall the river see. <lb/>
            For fear of him you need not hold your hand. <lb n="280"/>
            But drive the Trojans all to Ilium <lb/>
            Save those that fly. And having Hector slain <lb/>
            (As we assure you you shall do) then come <lb/>
            Triumphantly unto the ships again. <lb/>
            This said, unto the Gods again they came. <lb n="285"/>
            Achilles boldly waded in the field, <lb/>
            Where many bodies dead and bucklers swam. <lb/>
            With so much courage Pallas had him fill'd, <lb/>
            And in the water stoutly lifts his knees. <lb/>
            For Pallas now his strength augmented had. <lb n="290"/>
            And Xanthus, vex'd before, when he saw this, <lb/>
            Foamed and roar'd as one that had been mad; <lb/>
            And cried out for help to Simois. <lb/>
            Brother, said he, assist me here, to stay <lb/>
            This raging man that t' Ilium going is. <lb n="295"/>
            I am afraid he'll take the town of Troy. <lb/>
            Make haste to help me ; and your channel fill <lb/>
            With water both from torrent and from spring, <lb/>
            And stones and trees bring with you from the hill, <lb/>
            That on this furious man we may them fling ; <lb n="300"/>
            So that his strength shall do him little good, <lb/>
            Nor armour, which upon the field shall lie <lb/>
            Concealed from the eyes of men in mud <lb/>
            And sand enough. Thus bury him will I, <pb n="252"/>

            They shall not need, if they should be so kind, <lb/>
            More monument upon him to bestow. <lb/>
            This said, he foam'd, and full of bodies dead <lb/>
            He at Achilles a great billow bowl'd, <lb n="310"/>
            Which coming to him cover'd had his head, <lb/>
            But Juno chanc'd to see it as it roll'd, <lb/>
            And unto Vulcan shriek'd in great affright, <lb/>
            Rise quickly, dear child, Cyllipodion, <lb/>
            Xanthus against you coming is to fight, <lb n="315"/>
            And to defend yourself your flames put on. <lb/>
            And I will Zephyrus and Notus call <lb/>
            From sea, that for you so shall blow the flame ; <lb/>
            That the armour, and the heads o' th' Trojans all <lb/>
            Shall not be able to endure the same. <lb n="320"/>
            Go to his bank, and burn up ev'ry tree, <lb/>
            And then throw fire on him, and never fear, <lb/>
            Nor by his threats or pray'rs persuaded be <lb/>
            To cease, until again you from me hear. <lb/>
            And Vulcan then made ready a huge flame. <lb n="325"/>
            And first the dead he burn'd upon the plain ; <lb/>
            Then to the water with his fire he came <lb/>
            To send it to the channel back again. <lb/>
            As when a field new moist'ned is with rain <lb/>
            In summer-time, 'tis quickly dried again <lb n="330"/>
            By Boreas ; so soon dried was the plain, <lb/>
            And burn'd the bodies were of the dead men. <lb/>
            And to the river then his flame he turn'd, <lb/>
            Where th' elms and willows, tamarisks, and lote, <lb/>
            Sedges, and many other plants he burn'd, <lb n="335"/>
            That in or by the river grew about. <lb/>
            And eels and fishes in the water hot <lb/>
            Tumbled and turn'd their bellies up with heat; <lb/>
            Into such pain by Vulcan they were put; <lb/>
            And Xanthus fainting cover'd was with sweat, <lb n="340"/>
            And then to Vulcan spake. Vulcan, said he, <lb/>
            No God is able to resist your might. <lb/>
            What are the Trojans or the Greeks to me ? <lb/>
            Give over. I'll no longer with you fight. <lb/>
            Thus spake Scamander, boiling all the while. <lb n="345"/>
            As when upon a fire of well-dried wood <lb/>
            The grease of a fat swine is made to boil; <lb/>
            So boiled he, and went not on, but stood, <lb/>
            Making to Juno his complaint, and said, <lb/>

            Than on the rest that do the Trojans aid, <lb/>

            Although the Greeks should set the town on fire. <lb/>
            This Xanthus said ; and Juno hearing it, <lb/>
            To Vulcan with a loud voice spake again : <lb/>
            Vulcan, now hold your hand. It is not fit <lb/>
            T' offend a God too much, to pleasure men. <lb n="360"/>
            And Vulcan hearing her his fire puts out; <lb/>
            And Xanthus back into his channel went. <lb/>
            Thus were they parted, and no longer fought, <lb/>
            And Juno, though in choler, was content. <lb/>
            And then the Gods amongst themselves fell out, <lb n="365"/>
            And one against another stood in duel, <lb/>
            And heav'n and earth resounded as they fought, <lb/>
            Giving each other many wounds and cruel. <lb/>
            And up unto Olympus rose the cry, <lb/>
            Where Jove sat on his throne in majesty, <lb n="370"/>
            And casting on the fields of Troy his eye, <lb/>
            Laughed to see them fight that could not die. <lb/>
            Mars first began, and to Athena said, <lb/>
            You, impudent, that to engage in fight <lb/>
            The Gods amongst themselves are not afraid, <lb n="375"/>
            To satisfy your pride and endless spite, <lb/>
            Remember how you on me set Tydide <lb/>
            To throw his spear at me, and openly <lb/>
            Unto my body you the same did guide <lb/>
            With your own wicked hand, and wounded me, <lb n="380"/>
            IT! pay you now. Which was no sooner spoken, <lb/>
            But Mars his spear was at Athena's shield, <lb/>
            Which not Jove's thunderbolt could e'er have broken. <lb/>
            Then took she up a stone that lay i' th' field, <lb/>
            Great, knobby, black, that had been heretofore <lb n="385"/>
            Set there, of some man's land to show the bound, <lb/>
            And with the same she struck Mars o'er and o'er. <lb/>
            There lay he, and seven acres hid of ground. <lb/>
            And over him insulting, then said she, <lb/>
            Lie there, and know I can you overcome ; <lb n="390"/>
            And that your mother glad of this will be <lb/>
            For fighting 'gainst the Greeks for Ilium. <lb/>
            This said, she from him turn'd. Then to him went <lb/>
            Venus, and led him groaning from the place. <lb/>
            Pallas, said Juno, see that impudent <lb n="395"/>
            That leads him out, and do her some disgrace. <lb/>
            Then Pallas to her went, and with her hand <lb/>
            Hit her o' th' breast; then both fell on the plain, <lb/>
            For Mars without her could no longer stand. <lb/>
            Then Pallas over them insults again: <lb n="400"/>
            So may, said she, lie all that stand for Troy <lb/>
            As these do here. Had it not been for them, <lb/>
            The war had ended been; we come away, <lb/>

            And threat'ned you to bind you hand and foot, <lb/>
            And sell you in some island for a slave, <lb/>
            And cut off both your and my ears to boot, <lb/>
            And forc'd we were by flight ourselves to save ? <lb/>
            Yet for his people you have ever fought, <lb n="425"/>
            Though by you they deserve to be destroy'd, <lb/>
            And will not join with us to root them out. <lb/>
            To Neptune Phcebus then replied, and said, <lb/>
            O Neptune, you would think me mad, if I <lb/>
            Should fight with you for such a thing as man. <lb n="430"/>
            They are but leaves, now fresh, to-morrow die; <lb/>
            And when he this had said, away he ran, <lb/>
            For with his uncle loath he was to fight. <lb/>
            His sister then, Diana, to him came, <lb/>
            That angry was to see him put to flight; <lb n="435"/>
            Apollo, said she, is it not a shame <lb/>
            Thus easily to give the victory <lb/>
            To Neptune ? Wherefore carry you a bow <lb/>
            And arrows, and to nothing them apply ? <lb/>
            D'ye carry them, like children, for a show ? <lb n="440"/>
            Let me not hear you boasting any more <lb/>
            That you to fight with Neptune did not fear, <lb/>
            As in my father's house you did before. <lb/>
            Thus she; but Phœbus did not answer her. <lb/>
            Then Juno, angry, to Diana came; <lb n="445"/>
            Bold face, said she, how dare you with me fight, <lb/>
            That stronger than you are a great deal am ? <lb/>
            D'ye think that in your bow there is such might ? <lb/>
            I know to women you a lion are, <lb/>
            And Jove permits you which you will to kill; <lb n="450"/>
            But me to overcome 'tis harder far <lb/>
            Than t' hunt a stag or boar upon a hill; <lb/>
            But since you have a mind to understand <lb/>
            What I can do, I'll let you see it now. <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            Then both her wrists she seiz'd with her left hand, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXI. <lb/>

            With th' other from her shoulders took her bow, <lb/>
            And beats her with the same about the ears, <lb/>
            And laugh'd to see her wriggling strive to fly. <lb/>
            At last she freed herself, and shedding tears <lb/>
            She fled (leaving her bow and shafts to lie <lb n="460"/>
            Upon the ground, dispersed here and there) <lb/>
            Then forth came Hermes and Latona bright, <lb/>
            And when they were to one another near, <lb/>
            Leto, said he, I will not with you fight, <lb/>
            That are Jove's mistress. Boast amongst the Gods <lb n="465"/>
            That you have got the victory in fight, <lb/>
            And by no other means but the great odds <lb/>
            You have in strength ; and I will not deny't. <lb/>
            This said, Latona gathered up the bow <lb/>
            And arrows of her daughter Artemis. <lb n="470"/>
            To Jove went Artemis, to let him know <lb/>
            How ill she had been us'd: and at his knees <lb/>
            She weeping sate. And Jove then made her rise, <lb/>
            And to her said, Dear child, what God was that, <lb/>
            That was so rash as t' use you in this wise, <lb n="475"/>
            As one that openly had done a fault ? <lb/>
            'Twas Juno, then said Artemis, your wife; <lb/>
            And she it was that was of all the first <lb/>
            To set the Gods amongst themselves at strife. <lb/>
            Thus Jove and she between themselves discoursed. <lb n="480"/>
            Then Phœbus went into the town of Troy ; <lb/>
            For still he had a care to guard the wall, <lb/>
            For fear the Greeks the city should destroy. <lb/>
            But to Olympus th' other Gods went all, <lb/>
            One part triumphing, th' other discontent, <lb n="485"/>
            And sate down by their father Jupiter. <lb/>
            Meanwhile Achilles fiercely forward went, <lb/>
            Killing of men and horses with his spear. <lb/>
            As in a town on fire the people all <lb/>
            Are busy, and the most of them undone, <lb n="490"/>
            So did it with the Trojans then befal; <lb/>
            Some slain were by Achilles, and some run. <lb/>
            Now Priam standing was upon a tower, <lb/>
            And saw the Trojans by Achilles chas'd, <lb/>
            And that to turn again they had no power, <lb n="495"/>
            And down unto the gates he came in haste, <lb/>
            And to the porters order gave, and said, <lb/>
            Open the gates and let the people in, <lb/>
            That from Achilles hither fly dismayed, <lb/>
            And shut them when you see they are within; <lb n="500"/>
            For if that cruel man should with them get <lb/>
            Within the wall, 'twould be a dismal day. <lb/>
            The porters then the gates wide open set. <lb/>
            Then to the gates the Trojans took their way, <pb n="256"/>

            Pursued by Achilles as they fled, <lb n="505"/>
            And sure he taken had the town of Troy, <lb/>
            But that Apollo then encouraged <lb/>
            Agenor to oppose him by the way ; <lb/>
            And lest he should be by Achilles slain, <lb/>
            He at the beech tree near him took his stand, <lb n="510"/>
            When need should be to bring him off again <lb/>
            Unwounded from Achilles' heavy hand. <lb/>
            But when Agenor saw Achilles nigh, <lb/>
            He troubled was, and to himself thus spake: <lb/>
            What shall I do? If from him I should fly <lb n="515"/>
            To Ilium, the way that others take, <lb/>
            He’ll overtake me, and cut off my head, <lb/>
            For swifter much he is of foot than I. <lb/>
            What if I let him on the Trojans tread, <lb/>
            And I some other way to Ida fly, <lb n="520"/>
            And hide myself i' th' bushes there till night ? <lb/>
            But why do I discourse thus foolishly ? <lb/>
            I cannot pass the plain but in his sight, <lb/>
            And then I lost am without remedy. <lb/>
            But if I stay and fight with him, what then ? <lb n="525"/>
            His body is not made of steel nor brass, <lb/>
            But mortal is, they say, like other men, <lb/>
            And like to other men but one life has ; <lb/>
            His glorious acts are Jupiter's not his. <lb/>
            This said, he for Achilles' coming staid, <lb n="530"/>
            As when i' th' woods a panther roused is; <lb/>
            At hearing of the hounds he's not afraid, <lb/>
            But to the hunter goes for all his spear, <lb/>
            And though pierc'd through therewith, will to him fly <lb/>
            Upon the spear itself; that being near <lb n="535"/>
            He either may revenged be or die; <lb/>
            So resolutely then Antenor's son <lb/>
            Agenor, for Achilles waiting, staid, <lb/>
            And at him aim'd his spear as he came on, <lb/>
            And lifting up his voice, unto him said: <lb n="540"/>
            Achilles, Oh, you think this day to win <lb/>
            The town of Troy. There's yet much work to do, <lb/>
            For many mighty men there are therein, <lb/>
            And many dangers to be waded through. <lb/>
            They of their wives and parents will take care, <lb n="545"/>
            And little babes; but you shall perish here, <lb/>
            As terrible and mighty as you are. <lb/>
            And as he spake, he at him threw his spear, <lb/>
            Which on his leg below the knee did light, <lb/>
            And with the stroke resounded then the tin; <lb n="550"/>
            But the celestial arms were of such might, <lb/>
            That it rebounded back, and went not in. <lb/>
            And when Achilles was to throw at him, <lb/>
            Away Apollo snatch'd him from his sight, <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            Concealed in a mist obscure and dim, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXII. <lb/>
             </note> <lb n="555"/>
            And carried him in safety from the fight. <lb/>
            And that the flying Trojans might escape <lb/>
            Achilles' hand, and save themselves in Troy, <lb/>
            He took upon himself Agenor's shape, <lb/>
             And put himself into Achilles' way. <lb n="560"/>
            Achilles then pursues, and Phœbus flies <lb/>
            Along Scamander's bank upon the plain, <lb/>
            And kept before him still, but in such wise, <lb/>
            As t' overtake him he might hope in vain. <lb/>
            Achilles thus by Phœbus was deceived, <lb n="565"/>
            Till from the town he far was led away. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the flying Trojans were received, <lb/>
            And thronging got within the gates of Troy : <lb/>
            For none of them without the gate durst stay, <lb/>
            To ask who had escaped, and who not; <lb n="570"/>
            So glad they were of getting into Troy, <lb/>
            That how all others sped they never thought.</p>

            Like deer, and up unto the wall they went, <lb/>

            And with good wine renewed their spirits spent, <lb/>
            And to the wall advancing was the foe. <lb n="5"/>
            But Hector, hamper'd by his cruel fate, <lb/>
            Into the town of Troy refus'd to go, <lb/>
            And staid without, before the Scæan gate. <lb/>
            Then to Achilles Phœbus spake, and said, <lb/>
            Why do you thus pursue me, Peleus' son, <lb n="10"/>
            That am a God ? which but by passion sway'd <lb/>
            You might have known ; but rashly you run on, <lb/>

            Must leave your way so far to follow me, <lb/>
            And cannot kill me ; for I cannot die ? <lb/>
            At this Achilles vex'd was at the heart; <lb/>
            And to Apollo answered angrily ; <lb/>
            Apollo, thou the most pernicious art <lb n="20"/>
            Of all the Gods, that hast me thus misled. <lb/>
            For had I unto Ilium kept my way, <lb/>
            I strewed had the field with Trojans dead <lb/>

            But I would make you pay for't to your cost, <lb/>
            If to revenge myself I able were. <lb/>
            This said, to Troy he went a mighty pace, <lb/>
            And mighty things conceived in his mind, <lb n="30"/>
            And stretch'd his legs and knees, as in a race <lb/>
            Good horses do, to leave the rest behind. <lb/>
            Old Priam first upon him set his eyes ; <lb/>
            For brightly from afar his armour shin'd <lb/>
            Like the fair star that does in autumn rise, <lb n="35"/>
            But agues brings, and is to men unkind, <lb/>
            And called is Orient do,,. So bright <lb/>
            Achilles in his armour did appear, <lb/>
            And put the old man Priam in affright, <lb/>
            And made him groan, and roar, and tear his hair. <lb n="40"/>
            To Hector then he cried aloud and said, <lb/>
            Hector, come in; come in, my dearest son ; <lb/>
            For mightily I for you am afraid ; <lb/>
            Fight not against that cruel man alone. <lb/>
            Achilles stronger is than you by odds ; <lb n="45"/>
            Lose not your life to give him victory. <lb/>
            Oh that he were beloved by the Gods <lb/>
            No better than he is belov'd by me! <lb/>
            He eaten had ere now been on the plain <lb/>
            By dogs and fowl, and I been comforted <lb n="50"/>
            A little for my sons whom he bath slain, <lb/>
            Or in the islands far hence trafficked. <lb/>
            Lycaon now I miss, and Polydore ; <lb/>
            They came not into Troy with them that fled. <lb/>
            Their mother brought me with her wealth good store <lb n="55"/>
            To pay their ransom if they be not dead. <lb/>
            If they be slain, 'tis then remediless. <lb/>
            Their parents and the people all will grieve ; <lb/>
            But yet their sorrow will be much the less <lb/>
            If Hector still preserved be and live. <lb n="60"/>
            Come, therefore, quickly in, dear child, and save <lb/>
            The Trojans and their wives, yourself and wife ; <lb/>
            And do not let Achilles th' honour have <lb/>
            Alone to have deprived you of life. <lb/>
            Besides, you should some pity take of me, <lb n="65"/>
            That now upon the very brink of age <lb/>
            The cruel slaughter of my sons must see, <lb/>
            And daughters dragg'd and hurried by the rage <lb/>
            Of the Achæans into slavery, <lb/>

            And babes dash'd 'gainst the ground expiring lie, <lb/>

            And after all this, slain must I be too; <lb/>

            That at my table daily take their food. <lb/>
            When young men slain are by the chance of war, <lb/>

            White heads and beards, and parts not to be named, <lb n="80"/>
            There's nothing to a man more miserable. <lb/>
            Thus said old Priam, tugging his grey hairs, <lb/>
            But to prevail with Hector was not able. <lb/>
            And to him then his mother spake with tears, <lb/>
            And from her bosom layed out a teat, <lb n="85"/>
            Hector, if this e'er pleased you, said she, <lb/>
            Dear son, I pray you into Troy retreat, <lb/>
            And have compassion on my misery. <lb/>
            Come in ; between you let there be a wall; <lb/>
            For if you should be slain, your wife and I <lb n="90"/>
            Shall not lament you at your funeral, <lb/>
            But at the ships a prey for dogs you'll lie. <lb/>
            Thus weeping, he and she to Hector pray'd, <lb/>
            And nothing to them answer'd he again, <lb/>
            But obstinately for Achilles staid. <lb n="95"/>
            And as a snake roll'd up before his den, <lb/>
            With venom fed, when coming towards him <lb/>
            He sees a man, and stirred is his gall, <lb/>
            Looks cruelly; so Hector, looking grim, <lb/>
            Staid with his shield set up against the wall; <lb n="100"/>
            And grieving, to himself he spake, and said: <lb/>
            If I should now into the city go, <lb/>
            Polydamas the first would me upbraid, <lb/>
            That yesternight advis'd me to do so, <lb/>
            Then when Achilles in the field was seen. <lb n="105"/>
            But his good counsel I refused then, <lb/>
            Which to have follow'd had much better been; <lb/>
            Lost by my folly are so many men. <lb/>
            And now I fear the Trojans and their wives <lb/>
            Will censure me, and some man worse than I <lb n="110"/>
            Say I have cast away the people's lives, <lb/>
            Presuming on my strength so foolishly. <lb/>
            So they will say; and therefore better 'tis <lb/>
            To venture on Achilles, though I die, <lb/>
            A better way I cannot take than this; <lb n="115"/>
            For should I lay my shield and helmet by, <lb/>
            And leave my spear set up against the wall, <lb/>
            And to Achilles thus disarmed come, <lb/>
            And offer Helen to restore with all <lb/>
            The wealth she with her brought to Ilium ; <lb n="120"/>
            And to the Greeks give half the goods of Troy, <lb/>

            But whither to no purpose runs my mind? <lb n="125"/>
            I will not do't, for it were but in vain. <lb/>
            I ne'er the sooner should his favour find, <lb/>
            But by him so much eas'lier be slain. <lb/>
            I cannot with him talk from hill nor tree, <lb/>
             As boys and wenches do; he is too nigh, <lb n="130"/>
            And therefore here I'll stay for him, and see <lb/>
            Whether my fate it be or his to die. <lb/>
            Whilst yet he spake, Achilles near him was, <lb/>
            As terrible as Mars, and shook his spear; <lb/>
            As flaming fire relucent was the brass, <lb n="135"/>
            Or as the sun at morning doth appear. <lb/>
            Then Hector durst no longer stay, but fled : <lb/>
            Fear nimbly made his feet and knees to move; <lb/>
            Achilles no less swiftly followed. <lb/>
            As when a hawk is flying at a dove, <lb n="140"/>
            The dove flies out aside, herself to save; <lb/>
            But by the hawk again is followed, <lb/>
            That gives not over till the prey he have; <lb/>
            Achilles so pursu'd and Hector fled, <lb/>
            Keeping the cart-way still under Troy wall; <lb n="145"/>
            And to the watch-tow'r came and sicamore, <lb/>
            And the two springs that into Xanthus fall, <lb/>
            Whereof the one is always cover'd o'er <lb/>
            With smoke, as if upon a fire it were, <lb/>
            And with hot water all the year doth flow. <lb n="150"/>
            The water of the other all the year <lb/>
            As cold is as the hail, or ice, or snow, <lb/>
            And two fine washing-places built were there, <lb/>
            To which the Trojan women used to come, <lb/>
            And wash their garments when they sullied were, <lb n="155"/>
            Before the Argives came to Ilium. <lb/>
            This way they ran, and swiftly mov'd their thighs; <lb/>
            For 'twas not for a piece of flesh or hide, <lb/>
            Which of foot-races is the usual prize, <lb/>
            But for the life of Hector that they vied. <lb n="160"/>
            As when race-horses run for some great prize, <lb/>
            That used to it are, most swiftly run ; <lb/>
            So Hector and Achilles now ran thrice <lb/>
            About Troy wall, the Gods all looking on. <lb/>
            Then, speaking to the Gods, Behold, said Jove, <lb n="165"/>
            I Hector see in danger to be slain, <lb/>
            A good and pious man, and whom I love. <lb/>
            And for him now my heart is in great pain; <lb/>
            For he hath made me many a sacrifice, <lb/>
            Both in my house on Ida and in Troy, <lb n="170"/>
            And now before the swift Achilles flies. <lb/>
            Say, shall he die, or be convey'd away ? <lb/>
            Father, said Pallas then, what's this you say ? <lb/>
            He's mortal, and by Fate condemned is, <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            And will you now the execution stay? <note type="margin"> LIB. XXII. <lb/>

            You may; but th' other Gods will take't amiss. <lb/>
            And Jove to Pallas then again replied: <lb/>
            Sweet child, it was not seriously meant, <lb/>
            But only said. You shall not be denied; <lb/>
            Do what you please yourself, I am content. <lb n="180"/>
            This said, Athena, glad, leapt down to Troy. <lb/>
            Achilles Hector still pursued ; and as <lb/>
            A hound in view pursueth all the way <lb/>
            A frighted hare, so coursed Hector was; <lb/>
            Nor suffer'd was to double or to squat. <lb n="185"/>
            For when he to the gate ran for defence, <lb/>
            Between the gate and him Achilles gat, <lb/>
            So that he could not stay for help from thence. <lb/>
            Achilles never would the wall forsake; <lb/>
            But Hector still upon the cart-way fled. <lb n="190"/>
            As men can neither fly nor overtake <lb/>
            When in a dream they think it in their bed; <lb/>
            So Hector from Achilles could not fly, <lb/>
            Nor could Achilles Hector overtake; <lb/>
            For Phœbus Hector did with strength supply, <lb n="195"/>
            But of him then no further care did take. <lb/>
            Achilles by a sign all else forbad <lb/>
            To throw a spear, for fear the greatest glory <lb/>
            Some other of the Argives should have had, <lb/>
            And he come after but as accessory. <lb n="200"/>
            When to the spring the fourth time they were nigh, <lb/>
            Jove took his golden balance up, and laid <lb/>
            In one o' th' scales Achilles' destiny, <lb/>
            And Hector's in the other, and them weigh'd. <lb/>
            Hector's was heaviest, and down fell the same <lb n="205"/>
            As low as hell, so much it overweigh'd. <lb/>
            Then Phœbus parted. And t' Achilles came <lb/>
            Athena nigh, and speaking to him, said, <lb/>
            Achilles, now, I think, we shall not miss <lb/>
            Of killing Hector, but with honour go <lb n="210"/>
            To th' ships, as greedy as of fight he is; <lb/>
            For sure I am he cannot 'scape us now, <lb/>
            Phœbus in vain to Jove shall for him pray. <lb/>
            But stay you here and breathe awhile; for I <lb/>
            Will to him go, and make him for you stay, <lb n="215"/>
            And so encourage him he shall not fly. <lb/>
            This said, Achilles, leaning on his spear, <lb/>
            Staid where lie was. To Hector Pallas came. <lb/>
            So like Deiphobus she did appear <lb/>
            In shape and voice, he took her for the same. <lb n="220"/>
            And when she with him was, she to him said, <lb/>
            Brother, you still are by Achilles cours'd <lb/>
            About the wall of Troy. Be not afraid; <lb/>
            I'll by you stand, and let him do his worst. <pb n="262"/>

            Deiphobus, said Hector, who before <lb n="225"/>
            Was dearest to me of my brothers all, <lb/>
            I bound am now to honour you much more, <lb/>
            That t' aid me durst appear without the wall, <lb/>
            When all the rest remain within for fear. <lb/>
            Pallas to Hector then replied, and said, <lb n="230"/>
            Brother, my father and my mother dear, <lb/>
            And friends with their entreaties had me staid, <lb/>
            So dreadful is Achilles to them all, <lb/>
            But I would not. But come, let's go and try <lb/>
            Whether it be our fate by him to fall, <lb n="235"/>
            Or his by Hector's hand and spear to die. <lb/>
            This said, she went before him with her spear, <lb/>
            Lest he, some fraud mistrusting, should have staid. <lb/>
            And when they were unto Achilles near, <lb/>
            Hector spake first, and to Achilles said: <lb n="240"/>
            Pelides, though before you I have fled <lb/>
            Now thrice about the wall, and durst not stay, <lb/>
            Yet now to stand I am determined, <lb/>
            And fight till either I be slain or slay. <lb/>
            But come, let's first the Gods to witness call, <lb n="245"/>
            Of what shall be agreed 'twixt you and me. <lb/>
            If by my hand it be your chance to fall, <lb/>
            Your body dead shall not abused be. <lb/>
            I'll take your arms and send them into Troy; <lb/>
            Your body dead the Greeks shall have again <lb n="250"/>
            Entire, and not disgraced any way ; <lb/>
            Do you the like to me if I be slain. <lb/>
            Achilles, sourly looking, said again, <lb/>
            Talk not of oaths and covenants to me. <lb/>
            That nothing worth 'twixt lions are and men, <lb n="255"/>
            And wolves with lambs on nothing can agree; <lb/>
            And you and I shall one another hate, <lb/>
            Nor oaths and pacts between us will stand good, <lb/>
            Till we blood-thirsty Mars shall satiate <lb/>
            Either with Hector's or Achilles' blood. <lb n="260"/>
            It now behoves you all your pow'r to show, <lb/>
            And be an able man of war indeed. <lb/>
            You cannot, as you did, run from me now, <lb/>
            Although, I think, you never had more need; <lb/>
            For by Athena slain you shall be here, <lb n="265"/>
            And for the slaughter of the Greeks be paid. <lb/>
            This said, he at him threw his heavy spear, <lb/>
            But Hector, stooping, did the same avoid, <lb/>
            And o'er his head the spear then harmless flew. <lb/>
            But Pallas quickly snatch'd it from the sand <lb n="270"/>
            Invisibly, which Hector never knew, <lb/>
            And put the same into Achilles' hand. <lb/>
            Then Hector to Achilles spake, and said, <lb/>
            Achilles, you have miss'd. My fate unknown <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            Is to you yet; and me to make afraid, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXII. </note><note type="margin"> The death <lb/>

            and lamenta­ <lb/>

            You have devised fables of your own ; <lb/>
            Upon my back your spear shall never fall. <lb/>
            If by it to be slain my fate it be, <lb/>
            It shall be on my breast, or not at all. <lb/>
            But how my spear will speed now let me see; <lb n="280"/>
            Oh, that it would into your body go ! <lb/>
            The Trojans would the war much better bear, <lb/>
            Since from your hands proceeds the greatest woe. <lb/>
            And as he spake away he sent his spear, <lb/>
            And on Achilles' shield it lighted just, <lb n="285"/>
            But enter'd not; and other he had none. <lb/>
            Upon Deiphobus lay all his trust; <lb/>
            But when he call'd Deiphobus was gone, <lb/>
            And Hector then perceiv'd his death was near; <lb/>
            And oh, said he, the Gods now for me call. <lb n="290"/>
            Deiphobus, I thought, stood by me here, <lb/>
            But Pallas 'twas; he's still within the wall. <lb/>
            I shall not 'scape. I see, Jove heretofore, <lb/>
            And Phœbus too, did mean it should be<lb/>
            They sav'd me oft, but will do so no more. <lb n="295"/>
            But let me somewhat do before I go, <lb/>
            That men may speak of me in time to come, <lb/>
            And not ignoble die: and at that word <lb/>
            He roused up his fainting heart, and from <lb/>
            His side he drew his great and heavy sword. <lb n="300"/>
            As when an eagle stoopeth to the plain, <lb/>
            From a dark cloud, a tender lamb t' invade, <lb/>
            Or fearful hare; so Hector went amain <lb/>
            T' Achilles, brandishing his shining blade. <lb/>
            Achilles, angry, on the other side <lb n="305"/>
            Came on, and cruel thoughts had in his mind, <lb/>
            And up he kept his shield his breast to hide, <lb/>
            And on his head like fire his helmet shin'd; <lb/>
            And as he went, at ev'ry step he trod, <lb/>
            His plume, by Vulcan made of golden hair, <lb n="310"/>
            And to his crest applied, gave a nod, <lb/>
            And o'er his shoulders terribly did flare. <lb/>
            As Hesperus at midnight does appear, <lb/>
            The brightest star that shineth in the sky; <lb/>
            So gloriously the point shone of his spear. <lb n="315"/>
            Thus terribly to Hector he drew nigh, <lb/>
            And view'd his arms to see which way his spear <lb/>
            Might with most ease into his body pass. <lb/>
            But everywhere entire and close they were, <lb/>
            Save at the neck a little gap there was. <lb n="320"/>
            At that he aim'd, and with great force he smote <lb/>
            Him with his mighty spear clean through the neck; <lb/>
            And yet the spear his wind-pipe wounded not. <lb/>
            Then down he fell, but able was to speak. <pb n="264"/>

            Achilles, over him insulting, said, <lb n="325"/>
            Hector, you thought, when you Patroclus kill'd, <lb/>
            You safe were, and of me were not afraid, <lb/>
            Because you knew I was not in the field; <lb/>
            And like a fool ne'er thought of what a friend <lb/>
            To take revenge he left had at the fleet; <lb n="330"/>
            Who now has brought you to an evil end <lb/>
            For dogs to eat, while he has burial meet. <lb/>
            Then Hector feebly to him said again, <lb/>
            Let not by dogs my body eaten be, <lb/>
            But be contented that you have me slain; <lb n="235"/>
            My friends at any price will ransom me. <lb/>
            Take brass and gold, as much as you require; <lb/>
            And to my father send my body home, <lb/>
            To be consumed in the fun'ral fire, <lb/>
            By th' Trojans and their wives in Ilium. <lb n="340"/>
            Thus Hector said. Achilles answer'd to't: <lb/>
            Hector, you dog, speak not of price to me; <lb/>
            If I myself could eat thee I would do't; <lb/>
            But by the dogs I'm sure you'll eaten be. <lb/>
            If they would give me twenty times as much, <lb n="345"/>
            Or buy thy body, weight for weight, with gold, <lb/>
            And promise as much more, your deeds are such, <lb/>
            Your body shall not at that price be sold. <lb/>
            Nor shall your mother lay you on a bed, <lb/>
            And over you lamenting stand and howl; <lb n="350"/>
            But in the open field you shall lie dead, <lb/>
            Until devour'd you be by dogs and fowl. <lb/>
            Hector replied (though ready now to die), <lb/>
            I knew you had a heart as hard as steel; <lb/>
            But thus much to you I will prophecy: <lb n="355"/>
            The vengeance of the Gods you'll for it feel, <lb/>
            When one day Paris and Apollo shall, <lb/>
            As terrible and strong as you are now, <lb/>
            Make you before the Scæan gate to fall. <lb/>
            This said, he died; and to the shades below, <lb n="360"/>
            Leaving his limbs, his soul, bewailing, flew. <lb/>
            And yet Achilles did again reply, <lb/>
            And briefly to him answer'd, Now die you; <lb/>
            And when the Gods call for me, so will I. <lb/>
            This said, he from the body pluck'd the spear, <lb n="365"/>
            And laid it by him down upon the place, <lb/>
            And took his armour off. Then others near <lb/>
            Stood, gazing at his stature and his grace, <lb/>
            And wond'ring at him, t' one another said: <lb/>
            We safely now to Hector may go nigher; <lb n="370"/>
            His raging fit is very much allay'd <lb/>
            Since when unto the ships he came with fire. <lb/>

            Or still defend the same without him will. <lb/>
            But why should this come now into my head <lb/>
            When unbewail'd Patroclus lieth still ? <lb/>
            For my Patroclus I must not forget <lb n="385"/>
            As long as I am living and can go. <lb/>
            And when I come to th' house of Hades, yet <lb/>

            Whilst thither we in triumph bring the foe <lb/>
            With whose great praise the town of Troy did ring. <lb/>
            This said, he full of spite on Hector flies, <lb/>

            A cloud of dust ; and in it all the while, <lb/>
            Along the ground dragged was his comely head, <lb/>
            Once glorious, now by the Greeks made vile, <lb/>
            Since to them Jove had him delivered. <lb n="400"/>
            Which, when his mother from the wall beheld, <lb/>
            Enrag'd, she from her head pluck'd off her hood, <lb/>
            And threw it from her, tore her hair, and squeal'd. <lb/>
            And Priam lamentably sighing stood. <lb/>
            About him were the Trojans shedding tears, <lb n="405"/>
            Sighing, and sobbing, and in such affray, <lb/>
            As if all Troy had flam'd about their ears. <lb/>
            And much ado they Priam had to stay. <lb/>
            For down he lay, and spake to ev'ry one, <lb/>
            Forbear, said he ; I will go to this man <lb n="410"/>
            As fierce and cruel as he is, alone, <lb/>
            And move him to compassion, if I can ; <lb/>
            And what respect he hath to age I'll see. <lb/>
            For Pelius is old as well as I, <lb/>
            That got that mischief both to Troy and me, <lb n="415"/>
            To th' Trojans all, but me especially. <lb/>
            For he hath kill'd me many a goodly son, <lb/>
            Which all together make me not so smart, <lb/>
            Nor wounds so deep as Hector's death hath done, <lb/>
            Which is alone enough to break my heart. <lb n="420"/>
            Oh blessed Gods, that it had been your will <lb/>
            He in his mother's hands and mine had died, <lb/>
            That over hint we might have wept our fill! <lb/>

            Within an inner chamber weaving sate, <lb/>
            And given had her maids command to set <lb/>
            A trivet on the fire, that Hector might, <lb/>
            When he came in, wash off his blood and sweat, <lb/>
            Contracted by great labour in the fight, <lb n="440"/>
            Not dreaming of her husband's death. But when <lb/>
            She heard the lamentation at the wall, <lb/>
            And outcries both of women and of men, <lb/>
            She trembling stood, and let her shuttle fall. <lb/>
            And then unto her maids she call'd, and said, <lb n="445"/>
            Come hither two of you, and with me go; <lb/>
            I hear my mother cry, and am afraid <lb/>
            To Priam's sons there happened is some woe. <lb/>
            I'll to the tow'r go up myself, and see <lb/>
            What 'tis. My heart is at my mouth. I fear <lb n="450"/>
            Lest by Achilles Hector chased be <lb/>
            Alone, and will be killed by his spear. <lb/>
            Oh, how I tremble ! he can never stay, <lb/>
            But out before the rest will always run, <lb/>
            And never unto any man give way, <lb n="455"/>
            As if his strength could matched be by none. <lb/>
            This said, out went she like a woman mad, <lb/>

            Where she no sooner look'd about her had, <lb/>
            But saw her husband to a char'ot tied, <lb n="460"/>

            And you now to the shades below are gone, <lb/>
            And me a woful widow here have left, <lb/>
            And with me my sweet babe your tender son, <lb/>
            And cannot, since you are of life bereft, <lb n="480"/>
            Do to him any good, nor he to you. <lb/>
            And though he should escape the Argives now, <lb/>
            Yet poverty and woe will him pursue, <lb/>
            And other men his goodly fields will plough. <lb/>
            A child that is an orphan has no friend; <lb n="485"/>
            And, though with tears, must stoop to whatsoe'er <lb/>
            To the supplying of his need shall tend, <lb/>
            When he his want of food no more can bear. <lb/>
            So to your friends my child shall go, and take <lb/>
            One by the cloak, another by the coat, <lb n="490"/>
            That give him may some wine for pity's sake, <lb/>
            Enough to cool his lips, but not his throat. <lb/>
            Or else some son of them that sit at meat <lb/>
            May rate, or give him a good box o'th' ear, <lb/>
            And bid him quickly out o' th' hall to get, <lb n="495"/>
            And tell him that his father dines not there. <lb/>
            Then weeping comes Astyanax to me, <lb/>
            That us'd was by his father to be fed <lb/>
            With mutton fat and marrow on his knee, <lb/>
            And with his nurse repose on a soft bed. <lb n="500"/>
            But since his father now is dead and gone, <lb/>
            Astyanax (whom so the Trojans call <lb/>
            Because defended were by you alone, <lb/>
            When you were here, the Trojan gates and wall), <lb/>
            Intolerable grief is like to find, <lb n="505"/>

            'Tis to the wives of Troy an honour due. <lb/>

            Upon the place; and thus unto them spake. <lb/>
            You Myrmidons, my stout companions, <lb/>
            You must not from your cars your horses take, <lb/>
            With horses and with cars we first must go, <lb/>
            And for Patroclus weep about his bier. <lb n="10"/>
            And when we have by weeping eas'd our woe, <lb/>
            Untie your horses and we'll all sup here. <lb/>
            This said, they wail'd. Achilles first began ; <lb/>
            And thrice about Patroclus' bier they drave. <lb/>
            And Thetis, fallen was so great a man, <lb n="15"/>
            Amongst them stood, and tears unto them gave, <lb/>
            Which down their armour fell into the sand. <lb/>
            Achilles bade him then with tears, farewell. <lb/>
            And laying on Patroclus' breast his hand, <lb/>
            Rejoice, said he, Patroclus, though in hell; <lb n="20"/>
            For now I to you shall my word make good, <lb/>
            Since hither I have Hector dragged dead <lb/>
            For dogs to eat. And to revenge your blood, <lb/>
            Twelve Trojans I will at your pile behead. <lb/>
            This said, he Hector laid upon his face <lb n="25"/>
            I' th' dust before the bier disgracefully. <lb/>
            The Myrmidons meanwhile their arms unlace, <lb/>
            And th' horses from the chariots untie. <lb/>
            And then down by Achilles' ship they sat, <lb/>
            Who gave unto them all a fun'ral feast, <lb n="30"/>
            And for them slew both goats and muttons fat, <lb/>
            And swine good store, and many a well-fed beast. <lb/>
            But to Achilles then came in the lords, <lb/>
            To wait upon him t' Agamemnon's tent, <lb/>
            That he might try with comfortable words <lb n="35"/>
            If he could mitigate his discontent. <lb/>
            When they were there Atrides first commands <lb/>
            His ministers to bring in water hot, <lb/>
            To wash the gore from off his face and hands. <lb/>
            Achilles peremptorily said, Not, <lb n="40"/>
            And swearing, unto Agamemnon said, <lb/>
            By Jove, that is of all the Gods most high, <lb/>
            Till I Patroclus in the fire have laid, <lb/>
            And rais'd him have a tomb wherein to lie, <lb/>
            And with him burn'd these locks of mine, nor hand, <lb n="45"/>
            Nor face shall washed be by me. But now <lb/>
            Let's sup. I' th' morning I will give command <lb/>
            That for his pile we may have wood enough, <lb/>
            That speedily the body we may burn. <lb/>
            And when out of our sight we have it laid, <lb n="50"/>
            The people to their business may return. <lb/>
            Thus he advised, and it was obey'd. <lb/>
            The people then in haste to supper went, <lb/>
            And had good cheer, and heartily they fed. <lb/>

            Into their tents went every man to bed. <lb/>
            Down went Achilles to the water's side <lb/>
            Attended on by many Myrmidons, <lb/>
            And in a place clean washed by the tide <lb/>
            He laid him down to sleep upon the stones. <lb n="60"/>
            Nor was it long ere sleep upon him crept. <lb/>
            For laboured very hard he had that day. <lb/>
            For Hector him in exercise had kept <lb/>
            Running before him round the wall of Troy. <lb/>
            And then the spirit of Patroclus dead, <lb n="65"/>
            Like him in stature, garments, voice, and eyes, <lb/>
            Appeared to him standing at his head, <lb/>
            And speaking said unto him in this wise. <lb/>
            You sleep, Achilles, and have me forgot, <lb/>
            Though when I was alive you lov'd me well. <lb n="70"/>
            Pray bury me, these spirits here will not <lb/>
            Let me come in within the gates of hell, <lb/>
            Nor let me mix with those beyond the river, <lb/>
            But make me wander 'bout the house of Dis. <lb/>
            Give me your hand upon't, for I shall never <lb n="75"/>
            Return, when once my body burned is. <lb/>
            We shall no more together counsel take, <lb/>
            Since by my fate I taken am away, <lb/>
            And you yourself, divine Achilles, make <lb/>
            Account to die before the walls of Troy. <lb n="80"/>
            And then the favour let me have, I pray, <lb/>
            That when my flesh consum'd is in the flame, <lb/>
            My bones with yours you will be pleas'd to lay, <lb/>
            And let the urn that holds them be the same ; <lb/>
            That golden urn which Thetis gave to you. <lb n="85"/>
            We long with one another lived have. <lb/>
            For when Amphidamus his son I slew, <lb/>
            Unto your house I fled my life to save, <lb/>
            From Opus, being little past a boy, <lb/>
            And childishly the quarrel took at chess ; <lb n="90"/>
            And never meant him ill before that day, <lb/>
            And sorry was I for my foolishness. <lb/>
            Your father to his house then took me in, <lb/>
            Made me your man, and lov'd and cherished me, <lb/>
            And since so long we have together been, <lb n="95"/>
            Why should not now our bones together be ? <lb/>
            Achilles to the shadow then replied, <lb/>
            Sweet friend, what need had you to come from hell <lb/>
            To tell me this ? I for you do provide, <lb/>
            That all you say may be performed well. <lb n="100"/>
            Come nearer to me, that embrace we may <lb/>
            A little while, and one another moan. <lb/>
            This said, his arms he spreads ; and then away <lb/>
            Patroclus sunk and left him there alone. <pb n="270"/>

            Oh, oh, said he, I see 'tis certain then, <lb/>
            In hell there souls are, though they have no hearts, <lb/>
            But idols only are, and forms of men. <lb/>
            For by me standing was the soul all night <lb/>
            Of my Patroclus to me dictating, <lb n="110"/>
            And wonderfully like him 'twas t' the sight; <lb/>
            And what he wanted told me ev'ry thing. <lb/>
            This said, again about the body dead <lb/>
            Achilles and the Myrmidons lament, <lb/>
            And so continued till the day was spread; <lb n="115"/>
            But to the wood then Agamemnon sent <lb/>
            From ev'ry part of th' army men to Ide, <lb/>
            Whereof some axes carried in their hands, <lb/>
            And others ropes. And with them goes for guide <lb/>
            Meriones, and, as their chief, commands. <lb n="120"/>
            O'er hills and dales then to the woods they went, <lb/>
            Driving their mules before them all the way ; <lb/>
            And lusty oaks unto the ground they sent, <lb/>
            And cleft them into pieces as they lay. <lb/>
            And those unto the mules with ropes they tied, <lb n="125"/>
            And every one of them took in his hand, <lb/>
            Either a heavy bough, or limb beside. <lb/>
            For so Meriones had given command. <lb/>
            This done, they back descended to the plain <lb/>
            Fast as they could, through bri'rs and bushes store; <lb n="130"/>
            And quickly at the ships they were again, <lb/>
            And laid their wood in order on the shore. <lb/>
            Then to the Myrmidons Achilles spake, <lb/>
            You Myrmidons, put on your arms, said he, <lb/>
            And, horsemen, all your char'ots ready make, <lb n="135"/>
            And mount into your seats and follow me. <lb/>
            When they were ready, foremost went the horse, <lb/>
            And by a cloud of foot were followed. <lb/>
            I' th' midst between them carried was the corse <lb/>
            With locks of hair thrown on him covered, <lb n="140"/>
            Which the sad mourners from their heads had shorn. <lb/>
            Achilles went himself next to the bier, <lb/>
            Who for his friend did principally mourn. <lb/>
            When at the place of funeral they were, <lb/>
            Upon the ground they layed down the bier, <lb n="145"/>
            And quickly in a pile they heap'd the wood. <lb/>
            Then cuts Achilles off his yellow hair, <lb/>
            And from the body at a distance stay'd, <lb/>
            And towards Greece and Phthia turn'd his eye, <lb/>
            And speaking to Spercheius' river said. <lb n="150"/>
            My father to you made a vow, when I <lb/>
            Returned, this hair should unto you be paid, <lb/>
            And to the other Gods a hecatomb, <lb/>
            And fifty fat rams at your spring to slay. <lb/>

            And at that word he puts it in his hand. <lb n="160"/>
            At this the Greeks a-weeping fell again, <lb/>
            And wept had till the setting of the sun, <lb/>
            But that Achilles spake t' Atrides then, <lb/>
            And pray'd him that the people might be gone. <lb/>
            King Agamemnon, will the Greeks, said he, <lb n="165"/>
            Be never with lamenting satisfied ? <lb/>
            'Tis in your pow'r ; let them dispersed be <lb/>
            Unto their ships, their suppers to provide, <lb/>
            For we will of the fun'ral take a care. <lb/>
            But let the leaders of the army stay, <lb n="170"/>
            And such as specially concerned are. <lb/>
            This said, Atrides sent the rest away. <lb/>
            And then the wood into a pile they laid. <lb/>
            A hundred foot it was from side to side ; <lb/>
            And on the top the corpse. Then kiU'd and flay'd <lb n="175"/>
            Both sheep and beeves, and with their fat they hide <lb/>
            Patroclus' body dead from head to foot. <lb/>
            And by it laid the cattle flay'd to burn. <lb/>
            To the bier Achilles went and laid into 't <lb/>
            Of honey one, of oil another urn. <lb n="180"/>
            And of Patroclus' horses four he slew ; <lb/>
            And of nine little dogs he kept, kill'd two. <lb/>
            And those into the fun'ral pile he threw ; <lb/>
            And last of all, twelve Trojans adds thereto. <lb/>
            This done, again he to Patroclus said, <lb n="185"/>
            My dear Patroclus, once again, farewell. <lb/>
            Twelve lusty Trojans on your pile are laid. <lb/>
            I'm faithful to you, though you be in hell, <lb/>
            But Hector for the dogs shall be a prey. <lb/>
            But Venus 'nointed him with oil of rose, <lb n="190"/>
            And so preserved him both night and day, <lb/>
            That not a dog did on him lay his nose. <lb/>
            Then Phœbus sent from heav'n a cloud obscure, <lb/>
            The place whereon his body lay to hide, <lb/>
            To th' end it might the scorching sun endure, <lb n="195"/>
            And not be shrivell'd up, nor shrunk, nor dried. <lb/>
            And then Achilles a new bus'ness finds; <lb/>
            He could not set on flame the new-fell'd wood, <lb/>
            But forc'd he was to pray to the two Winds, <lb/>
            Zephyr and Boreas. Then off he stood, <lb n="200"/>
            And to them offer'd with a cup in's hand, <lb/>
            And to them vowed a good sacrifice, <lb/>
            If they from sea would come, and by him stand, <lb/>
            And blow the fire until the flame did rise. <pb n="272"/>

            This Iris hearing, went unto the Winds, <lb n="205"/>
            To tell them how Achilles to them pray'd, <lb/>
            And at good cheer in Zephyr's house them finds, <lb/>
            And fain they would her with them there have staid, <lb/>
            And made her sit; but she refused that. <lb/>
            The Gods, said she, feast at a hecatomb <lb n="210"/>
            In Blackmoor-land, and I must be thereat, <lb/>
            And must make haste, or thither cannot come. <lb/>
            To Zephyr now and Bore-as I came, <lb/>
            To tell them that a plenteous sacrifice <lb/>
            Achilles make them will, if on a flame <lb n="215"/>
            They'll set the pile whereon Patroclus lies. <lb/>
            This said, she parts. The Winds arise and roar, <lb/>
            And toss the clouds before them in the sky, <lb/>
            And at their feet tumble the waves ashore, <lb/>
            And then upon Patroclus' pile they fly, <lb n="220"/>
            And fiercely blow. Inflamed was the pile, <lb/>
            And whistling at it staid the Winds all night, <lb/>
            Achilles standing by it all the while, <lb/>
            Invoking solemnly Patroclus' spright; <lb/>
            And th' earth with wine by cupfuls watered. <lb n="225"/>
            As one that mourneth for his eldest son, <lb/>
            That then dies, when he should be married; <lb/>
            So did he for Patroclus sigh and groan. <lb/>
            When in the sky the day-star did appear <lb/>
            To shew that after him Aurora came, <lb n="230"/>
            The pile and bodies dead consumed were <lb/>
            To ashes, and extinguished was the flame ; <lb/>
            Away the Winds went o'er the seas of Thrace, <lb/>
            And passing, shook the waters of the deep. <lb/>
            Achilles went a little from the place, <lb n="235"/>
            And weary, laid him down and fell asleep. <lb/>
            And now 'twas day, the soldiers came again. <lb/>
            Then with their trampling did Achilles wake, <lb/>
            And up he stood and look'd about. And then <lb/>
            He to Atrides turn'd his eyes and spake: <lb n="240"/>
            Atrides, let us first with wine, said he, <lb/>
            Put out the fire as far as it is spread, <lb/>
            That taken up Patroclus' bones may be <lb/>
            (For where they lie 'tis soon discovered; <lb/>
            Since in the midst we did his body lay, <lb n="245"/>
            But others, horse and men, at the outside lie) <lb/>
            That in a bason of pure gold they may <lb/>
            Reserved be until I also die. <lb/>
            And though no great tomb here I have designed, <lb/>
            Yet may the Greeks that stay when I am gone, <lb n="250"/>
            When they think good, if they will be so kind, <lb/>
            And see cause for it, make a greater one. <lb/>
            This said, the fire they first extinguished; <lb/>
            Then down unto the ground the ashes came, <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            And up Patroclus' bones they gathered, <note type="margin"> LID. XXIII. </note><note type="margin"> The funeral <lb/>

            And in a golden pan they laid the same; <lb/>
            And back into the ships they carried that, <lb/>
            To be reserved in Achilles' tent, <lb/>
            Wrapp'd up within a double kell of fat. <lb/>
            And then about the pile to work they went, <lb n="260"/>
            And where the pile was, that they made their ground, <lb/>
            And earth abundance on the same they lay, <lb/>
            Till it became a mighty hill and round. <lb/>
            When they had done, Achilles made them stay <lb/>
            And sit o' th' ground, to see the games which he <lb n="265"/>
            Prepared had, the funeral to grace. <lb/>
            Then many prizes rich he caus'd to be <lb/>
            Brought from his ship and laid upon the place, <lb/>
            Brass cauldrons, tripods, and great iron bars, <lb/>
            Horses and mules, and cattle of great size, <lb n="270"/>
            And goodly women taken in the wars. <lb/>
            First for the horse; he tells each one his prize. <lb/>
            To th' first a woman that could spin and weave, <lb/>
            Together with a tripod deep and wide. <lb/>
            The next a mare of six years should receive, <lb n="275"/>
            Together with her young mule by her side. <lb/>
            A handsome kettle to the third he gave, <lb/>
            Which never on the fire had yet been set. <lb/>
            Of gold two talents was the fourth to have; <lb/>
            The fifth a cup and cover was to get. <lb n="280"/>
            Then to them spake. These prizes here, said he, <lb/>
            Lie waiting for the horsemen on the plain, <lb/>
            If any horsemen in the host there be, <lb/>
            That with their char'ots hope the same to gain, <lb/>
            Come in. Had any else these games set forth, <lb n="285"/>
            The greatest of these prizes had been mine ; <lb/>
            For of my horses you well know the worth, <lb/>
            And that they are immortal and divine, <lb/>
            Which Neptune gave to Peleus, he to me. <lb/>
            But I'll sit out; my horses shall stay here, <lb n="290"/>
            Hanging their heads as they do heavily, <lb/>
            Since they have lost their gentle char'oteer. <lb/>
            Let any other of the Argives, who <lb/>
            Is of his horses confident, come in, <lb/>
            And presently prepare himself thereto, <lb n="295"/>
            And try which of the prizes he can win. <lb/>
            This said, the horsemen straight themselves present. <lb/>
            Eumelus first, Adrestus' noble son, <lb/>
            That was for horsemanship most eminent. <lb/>
            Then Diomed with th' horses which he won <lb n="300"/>
            From Venus' son, when by her sav'd he was. <lb/>
            Then sitting on his chariot came forth <lb/>
            King Agamemnon's brother Menelaus, <lb/>
            And at it horses two were of great worth. <note type="footnote"> VOL. x. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>

            The one of them, Podargus, was his own, <lb n="305"/>
            The other, Æthe, very swift she was, <lb/>
            A female, and for Agamemnon's known, <lb/>
            To whom, when he to Ilium was to pass, <lb/>
            She given was by Echepolus, who <lb/>
            T' excuse himself of following him to Troy <lb n="310"/>
            (For very rich he was, and loath to go) <lb/>
            And with his leave in Siryon to stay. <lb/>
            The fourth, with horses of the Pylian brood, <lb/>
            Was Nestor's gallant son, Antilochus. <lb/>
            His father, careful of him, by him stood <lb n="315"/>
            Instructing him, and said unto him thus: <lb/>
            Antilochus, you have been taught so well <lb/>
            By Jove and Neptune, young man as you are, <lb/>
            The rules of horsemanship, I need not tell <lb/>
            You of the art, but pray you to take care; <lb n="320"/>
            Though you know how about the goal to wind, <lb/>
            Their horses somewhat are than yours more swift. <lb/>
            I fear you will in that some damage find; <lb/>
            But none of them know better how to shift. <lb/>
            'Tis care, not strength, makes a good carpenter, <lb n="325"/>
            And ships at sea are governed by care; <lb/>
            Force in foul weather little helps to steer; <lb/>
            Best char'oteers are they that best beware. <lb/>
            A man that on his horses' speed relies, <lb/>
            May from the high-way sometimes drive aside, <lb n="330"/>
            But not come in again. But he that's wise, <lb/>
            Will always towards the goal directly guide, <lb/>
            And have an eye on him that goes before. <lb/>
            The goal I'll tell you (lest you know it not) <lb/>
            A staff is, of a fathom high or more, <lb n="335"/>
            Of oak or pine, that is not apt to rot, <lb/>
            Standing between two great white stones upright, <lb/>
            And for a monument set up was there <lb/>
            In ancient time, of some deceased wight, <lb/>
            Or formerly there had a race been there, <lb n="340"/>
            And to that purpose served now again. <lb/>
            Be sure you drive your horses to it close, <lb/>
            And leaning, press a little th' inner rein, <lb/>
            And let the farther horse's rein go loose. <lb/>
            But let the near horse to it go as near <lb n="345"/>
            As can be, so the stones you still avoid; <lb/>
            You'll wound your horses else, and char'ot tear, <lb/>
            And be asham'd whilst others will be joy'd. <lb/>
            If at the staff you once but get the start, <lb/>
            In coming back before you shall be none, <lb n="350"/>
            How good soe'er their horses be or art, <lb/>
            Though they the steeds were of Laomedon, <lb/>
            Or like Arion all their horses were, <lb/>
            Adrestus' horse of the celestial race. <lb/>

            And having done, returned to his place. <lb/>
            The fifth and last came in Meriones. <lb/>
            Then up into their seats they mounted all; <lb/>
            And then by lots determin'd which of these <lb/>
            Should start the first. T' Antilochus did fall <lb n="360"/>
            To start the first. The next t' Eumelus came. <lb/>
            The third lot fell t' Atrides Menelaus. <lb/>
            The fourth had on't Meriones his name. <lb/>
            The best, and last to start Tydides was. <lb/>
            Then all a-row they stood. Achilles by, <lb n="365"/>
            Showed them the goal far off upon the plain ; <lb/>
            And all at once hold up their whips on high, <lb/>
            And beat their horses each one with his rein ; <lb/>
            And loud upon them call'd to make them run. <lb/>
            Old Phoenix at the staff was set to stay <lb n="370"/>
            And be a witness of what there was done, <lb/>
            And see there were amongst them no foul play. <lb/>
            And swiftly from the ships they part away, <lb/>
            In clouds of dust up to their breasts they fly, <lb/>
            And to the wind their spreading manes display; <lb n="375"/>
            Their cars sometimes are in the air a-high, <lb/>
            And sometimes on the ground. The char'oteers <lb/>
            Sit for all that still fast upon their seats, <lb/>
            And ev'ry one aloud his horses cheers, <lb/>
            While in his breast his heart with longing beats. <lb n="380"/>
            But when about the goal they turned were, <lb/>
            And coming back again unto the shore, <lb/>
            Then 'twas their virtue chiefly did appear, <lb/>
            And faster went their horses than before. <lb/>
            And now Eumelus' horses foremost were, <lb n="385"/>
            And Diomed behind him was not far <lb/>
            With his male Trojan horses, but so near, <lb/>
            As if they would have gone into his car. <lb/>
            So near they were their heads did on it lie, <lb/>
            And made Eumelus' back and shoulders hot <lb n="390"/>
            With breathing on them ; and the victory <lb/>
            Had got, or doubtful made at least, had not <lb/>
            Apollo been to Diomed unkind, <lb/>
            And from his hand struck out his shining whip. <lb/>
            Tydides then again was left behind, <lb n="395"/>
            And wept to see Eumelus him outstrip. <lb/>
            When Pallas saw what wrong was to him done, <lb/>
            She puts the whip into his hand again, <lb/>
            And angry goes unto Admetus' son, <lb/>
            And of his horses breaks the yoke in twain. <lb n="400"/>
            On one side of the way then went one mare, <lb/>
            And on the other side the other goes. <lb/>
            Down fell the pole, and with it he ; and tare <lb/>
            His elbows and his eye-brows, mouth, and nose. <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <pb n="276"/>

            Tydides in the meantime passed by, <lb n="405"/>
            And got before them all a mighty length. <lb/>
            For Pallas to him meant the victory, <lb/>
            And gave unto his horses greater strength. <lb/>
            Behind Tydides next was Menelaus, <lb/>
            And next to him Antilochus ; and he <lb n="410"/>
            Aloud unto his horses calling was. <lb/>
            Now let's, said he, your utmost virtue see. <lb/>
            With Diomed you are not bid contend, <lb/>
            Whom victor now Athena means to make, <lb/>
            And strengthened hath his horses to that end; <lb n="415"/>
            But only Menelaus t' overtake. <lb/>
            Were 't not a shame that Æthe, but a mare, <lb/>
            Should leave you two such lusty steeds behind ? <lb/>
            But if you now seek how yourselves to spare, <lb/>
            I tell you this, and true you will it find, <lb n="420"/>
            You shall be slain. Therefore use all your speed, <lb/>
            And when you come into a narrow place, <lb/>
            Leave it to me to do what I see need. <lb/>
            This said, the horses fearing mend their pace, <lb/>
            And now were close at Menelaus' heels. <lb n="425"/>
            Then near unto a hollow way they came ; <lb/>
            And lest they break should one another's wheels, <lb/>
            Atrides turn'd aside into the same. <lb/>
            The other after him a little wide <lb/>
            The same way took. Atrides then afraid <lb n="430"/>
            That he would enter with him side by side, <lb/>
            Unto Antilochus cried out and said, <lb/>
            Antilochus, you drive too carelessly, <lb/>
            The way's too narrow. Pray a little stay <lb/>
            Your horses; broader 'twill be by and by, <lb n="435"/>
            Lest both our cars lie broken on the way. <lb/>
            Antilochus then whipp'd his horses on <lb/>
            So much the faster, seeming not to hear. <lb/>
            And when they were a little further gone, <lb/>
            Atrides held his horses in, for fear <lb n="440"/>
            Their cars should clashing overturned be, <lb/>
            And with them they be thrown into the dust, <lb/>
            And to him spake, reviling: Go, said he, <lb/>
            Of all the men I know the most unjust, <lb/>
            And not so wise as th' Argives thought you were. <lb n="445"/>
            But yet the prize you shall not so obtain, <lb/>
            But for it first you shall be put to swear. <lb/>
            And then his horses he drave on again, <lb/>
            And to encourage them unto them said, <lb/>
            His horses cannot keep before you long; <lb n="450"/>
            They old are both; strain hard. Be not dismay'd, <lb/>
            For both of you brave horses are, and young. <lb/>
            This said, at highest speed again they fly, <lb/>
            And to Antilochus came up again. <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            The Argives on the race now sat to spy <note type="margin"> LID. XXIII. </note><note type="margin"> The funeral <lb/>

            Who foremost coming was upon the plain. <lb/>
            Idomeneus sat in a place more high <lb/>
            Without the race, and heard a char'oteer, <lb/>
            Whose voice he knew, unto his horses cry, <lb/>
            And presently two horses did appear. <lb n="460"/>
            Of one of them the colour was bright bay, <lb/>
            But on his forehead had a spot of white, <lb/>
            And, as the moon at full, round ev'ry way, <lb/>
            And from afar conspicuous and bright. <lb/>
            Then to the Greeks he said, Is there no more <lb n="465"/>
            That see these horses coming back but I ? <lb/>
            They are not those that foremost were before; <lb/>
            And 'tis another char'oteer I spy. <lb/>
            Eumelus some mischance has had I fear; <lb/>
            And yet about the goal he turned well, <lb n="470"/>
            But now I cannot see him any where. <lb/>
            Perhaps out of his hands their bridles fell; <lb/>
            No longer would the horses then obey, <lb/>
            But thrown him somewhere have o' th' field, or borne <lb/>
            Him in their fit by violence away, <lb n="475"/>
            And have his char'ot overturn'd, or torn. <lb/>
            Stand on your feet yourselves, and mark him well, <lb/>
            Whether or no it Diomedes be, <lb/>
            The son of Tydeus, for I cannot tell; <lb/>
            He like him is, and I believe 'tis he. <lb n="480"/>
            The lesser Ajax then, Oileus' son, <lb/>
            With evil words t' Idomeneus replied, <lb/>
            The mares upon the field are coming on, <lb/>
            But you must talk, though from the purpose wide. <lb/>
            Your eyes are now grown old, and less can see, <lb n="485"/>
            And yet to talk you love so much the more, <lb/>
            Though at discerning many better be; <lb/>
            Eumelus, as at first, is still before. <lb/>
            Ajax, said he, of all the Greeks the worst, <lb/>
            Except at railing, let's a wager lay, <lb n="490"/>
            A tripod, or a cauldron, who comes first; <lb/>
            Atrides judge, that you may know and pay. <lb/>
            And Ajax then about was to reply; <lb/>
            Nor had the quarrel 'twixt them there been staid, <lb/>
            But that Achilles, who was sitting by, <lb n="495"/>
            Rose from his seat, and coming to them said, <lb/>
            Idomeneus and Ajax, 'tis a shame <lb/>
            For you in evil language to contend, <lb/>
            That others when they do so ought to blame. <lb/>
            Sit down, and but a little while attend, <lb n="500"/>
            They'll soon be here. They strive for victory, <lb/>
            And driving are as fast as e'er they can; <lb/>
            Discerned then it will be easily <lb/>
            Which is the foremost, which the hindmost man. <pb n="278"/>

            This said, they saw Tydides very near, <lb n="505"/>
            Plying his whip; his horses seem'd to fly, <lb/>
            And cover'd was with dust the char'oteer, <lb/>
            And hard it was the track o' th' wheels to spy. <lb/>
            Then coming in, before the lords he stopped, <lb/>
            And to the ground leapt from his chariot; <lb n="510"/>
            With sweat his horses' breasts and shoulders dropped. <lb/>
            Then Stenelus the prize neglected not, <lb/>
            But nimbly from his place he to it skips, <lb/>
            And by his friends there standing by his side <lb/>
            Sent th' woman and the tripod to the ships; <lb n="515"/>
            And having done, the horses he untied. <lb/>
            Antilochus next to Tydides was, <lb/>
            That not by virtue of his steeds, but sleight, <lb/>
            Advantage gotten had of Menelaus, <lb/>
            When for them both he found the way too streight. <lb n="520"/>
            But Menelaus to him was so near, <lb/>
            As is a chariot-horse unto the wheel, <lb/>
            Which of his tail doth sometimes touch the hair, <lb/>
            And makes the horse to run that does it feel. <lb/>
            So near unto him was Atrides then, <lb n="525"/>
            That was behind once a quoit's cast or more. <lb/>
            But quickly to him he came up again, <lb/>
            For Æthe now ran faster than before, <lb/>
            And had they but a little longer run, <lb/>
            Atrides by Antilochus had pass'd, <lb n="530"/>
            And without doubt the second prize had won. <lb/>
            Meriones behind was a spear's cast; <lb/>
            Slow steeds he had, and but small skill in courses. <lb/>
            Eumelus, whom Athena overthrew, <lb/>
            Came hindmost, and before him drave his horses, <lb n="535"/>
            And with his hands behind, his char'ot drew. <lb/>
            Achilles mov'd with pity was at this, <lb/>
            And spake unto the Argives in this wise: <lb/>
            Although he come the last, the best he is; <lb/>
            'Tis fit he have at least the second prize, <lb n="540"/>
            But Diomed the first, that has it won. <lb/>
            And just it seemed in the Argives' sight, <lb/>
            And from Antilochus the prize had gone, <lb/>
            Had he not pleaded for it as his right. <lb/>
            Antilochus then to Achilles spake: <lb n="545"/>
            Though well, said he, in pity you incline <lb/>
            T' Eumelus, yet my prize he must not take; <lb/>
            I won it have, and 'tis not yours, but mine. <lb/>
            His horses good, and horseman good he is; <lb/>
            And he and they upon the ground were laid <lb n="550"/>
            By some mischance; I'm not concern'd in this, <lb/>
            He should unto th' immortal Gods have pray'd. <lb/>
            But you, that pity him, and at your tent <lb/>
            Have gold, brass, horses, women, cattle store, <lb/>

            Eumelus with the value, or with more; <lb/>
            For whosoever means to have the mare, <lb/>
            Must for her with me fight. Thus pleaded he. <lb/>
            Achilles, that great love unto him bare, <lb/>
            Was glad, and said, Since you so counsel me, <lb n="560"/>
            The breast-plate I will to him give of brass, <lb/>
            That hemm'd is all about with shining tin, <lb/>
            With which Asteropæus armed was. <lb/>
            Automedon, into my tent go in, <lb/>
            And quickly to me bring the breast-plate forth. <lb n="565"/>
            And then Automedon no longer stands, <lb/>
            But fetches out the armour of great worth, <lb/>
            And puts the same into Eumelus' hands. <lb/>
            Then up Atrides Menelaus stands, <lb/>
            And in his hand the crier a sceptre laid, <lb n="570"/>
            And silence to be kept i' th' court commands. <lb/>
            T" Antilochus then Menelaus said, <lb/>
            Antilochus, what made you me disgrace, <lb/>
            Justling my horses in the hollow way, <lb/>
            When there was so much danger in the place <lb n="575"/>
            That 't had been best for both of us to stay ? <lb/>
            But you, the princes, hear the cause I pray, <lb/>
            And judge between us both impartially, <lb/>
            Lest any of the Greeks hereafter say <lb/>
            I did t' Antilochus an injury, <lb n="580"/>
            And from him got the mare by fraud or might; <lb/>
            And that his horses than mine better were; <lb/>
            But come, I now know how myself to right. <lb/>
            Come, lay your hand upon the reins, and swear <lb/>
            By Neptune, that you did not willingly <lb n="585"/>
            And with prepensed malice cross my car. <lb/>
            To this Antilochus did then reply: <lb/>
            O Menelaus, since you elder are, <lb/>
            You know our faults upon the sudden rise, <lb/>
            And that before-hand young men study not; <lb n="590"/>
            Their wits are present, but the old are wise, <lb/>
            To do you injury I never thought. <lb/>
            The mare is yours; and if you please to send <lb/>
            For anything I have, that too I'll give <lb/>
            Rather than with an oath the Gods offend, <lb n="595"/>
            And out of Menelaus' favour live. <lb/>
            This said, he put the mare into his hand; <lb/>
            Then Menelaus look'd as fresh and gay <lb/>
            As dew, that on the growing corn doth stand, <lb/>
            Then when the fields are in their best array, <lb n="600"/>
            And to Antilochus replied again: <lb/>
            Antilochus, I angry am no more; <lb/>
            I see you were by youth transported then ; <lb/>
            But putting tricks upon your friends give o'er. <pb n="280"/>

            But you so much have suffer'd for my sake, <lb/>
            Together with your father and your brother, <lb/>
            That I can easy satisfaction take. <lb/>
            And now, to shew I got it not by might, <lb/>
            Take you the prize, although it be my share. <lb n="610"/>
            This said, he took t' himself the cauldron bright, <lb/>
            And yielding to Antilochus the mare, <lb/>
            Unto Noëmon gave her to set up <lb/>
            (Noëmon was Antilochus his man). <lb/>
            One prize remain'd, which was the double cup; <lb n="615"/>
            Meriones the two gold talents wan. <lb/>
            Achilles rising then to Nestor went, <lb/>
            And unto him the double cup he gave. <lb/>
            This prize, said he, keep for a monument <lb/>
            Of my Patroclus lying in his grave. <lb n="620"/>
            You shall not for it arm your fists with lead, <lb/>
            Nor with young men at cast of spear engage, <lb/>
            Nor shall you on the foot-race need to tread; <lb/>
            Of all such work you are excus'd by age. <lb/>
            This said, the cup into his hand he laid, <lb n="625"/>
            Which joyfully he took, and thus replied: <lb/>
            Sweet son, you nothing but the truth have said. <lb/>
            My strength is past, it cannot be denied; <lb/>
            My hands I scarce can to my shoulders raise, <lb/>
            And heavily my feet both rise and fall. <lb n="630"/>
            Oh, that I were as young as in those days <lb/>
            When I saw Amarynceus' funeral <lb/>
            Set forth most nobly in Buprasion. <lb/>
            There many prizes were, and many a man; <lb/>
            But like to me amongst them there was none, <lb n="635"/>
            Eperan, Pylian, nor Ætolian. <lb/>
            At fists the prize from Clytomed I won; <lb/>
            And wrestling with Ancæus I him threw, <lb/>
            And Iphiclus, swift as he was, outrun; <lb/>
            And with the spears I Polydore out-threw, <lb n="640"/>
            And at the horse-race only was outstripp'd <lb/>
            By th' envy of the sons of Actor two; <lb/>
            For sitting on the char'ot they both whipp'd, <lb/>
            And from me won that prize with much ado. <lb/>
            Such then I was. But now to younger men <lb n="645"/>
            That work I leave. Old age I must obey; <lb/>
            But such I was amongst the Argives then. <lb/>
            And now, Achilles, here no longer stay, <lb/>
            Proceed with other games your friend to grace; <lb/>
            Your gift I take, and great content I find, <lb n="650"/>
            In that you shewn have in this public place, <lb/>
            Amongst the Greeks you have me in your mind. <lb/>
            Achilles having heard these praises all <lb/>
            Of Nestor, brought into the place a mule, <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            A prize for him that won at fist and ball, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIII. </note><note type="margin"> The funeral <lb/>

            Patroclus. </note> <lb n="655"/>
            A mule of six years old, and hard to rule. <lb/>
            As for the vanquish'd, he assign'd to him <lb/>
            A lesser prize, which was a silver cup, <lb/>
            That crook'd and wryed was about the brim. <lb/>
            Achilles then amongst the Greeks stood up. <lb n="660"/>
            Atrides, and you Argives all, said he, <lb/>
            Let two men fight for these at fist and ball; <lb/>
            The lusty mule shall for the victor be, <lb/>
            The cup for him that in the fight shall fall. <lb/>
            This said, Epeius, a huge man stood up, <lb n="665"/>
            And that had at this kind of fight great skill, <lb/>
            And seiz'd the mule, and said, As for the cup, <lb/>
            Let any one against me rise that will, <lb/>
            The mule is mine; at this game I am best. <lb/>
            Is't not enough that th' Argives value me <lb n="670"/>
            In fight but as a mean man like the rest ? <lb/>
            For no man can the best at all things be. <lb/>
            But let him know, whoe'er with me contends, <lb/>
            I'll break his bones. Which being to him known, <lb/>
            He may about him ready have his friends, <lb n="675"/>
            To take him up when I have knocked him down. <lb/>
            This said, Mecestes' son, Euryalus, <lb/>
            That won the prize from the Cadmæans all, <lb/>
            At Thebes, upon the death of Œdipus, <lb/>
            When celebrated was his funeral, <lb n="680"/>
            Presents himself. About him, busy was <lb/>
            Tydides, wishing him the victory; <lb/>
            And gave him of strong leather well-wrought lace, <lb/>
            Wherewith the balls unto his wrists to tie. <lb/>
            The champions up their fists together have, <lb n="685"/>
            Which when they met so quick and mingled were, <lb/>
            That which was which a man could not perceive, <lb/>
            But how they rattled at their heads might hear. <lb/>
            Euryalus then chanc'd to look aside, <lb/>
            At which Epeius such a blow him hit, <lb n="690"/>
            Upon the cheek, that he was stupified, <lb/>
            And could no longer stand upon his feet. <lb/>
            As when the sea is curl'd by Zephyrus, <lb/>
            A little fish leaps up and falls again ; <lb/>
            So started at the stroke Euryalus, <lb n="695"/>
            And fainted. To him went Epeius, then, <lb/>
            And took him up. His friends that by him stood, <lb/>
            Led him away trailing his feet behind, <lb/>
            His neck aside hanging, and spitting blood; <lb/>
            And wand'ring out of order was his mind. <lb n="700"/>
            Achilles other prizes then brought forth <lb/>
            For wrestlers ; and for him that did the best, <lb/>
            A mighty three-foot pot esteemed worth, <lb/>
            By th' company, twelve oxen at the least, <pb n="282"/>

            Then up rose Ajax, up Ulysses rose, <lb/>

            And presently extend their arms, and close ; <lb/>

            And Ajax then unto Ulysses said, <lb/>
            Let's lift each other; and withal him lifts, <lb/>
            And hop'd upon the ground to have him laid, <lb/>
            But he, then, not forgetful of his shifts, <lb/>
            Struck with his right foot Ajax on the ham, <lb n="725"/>
            So that to turn him Ajax strength did lack. <lb/>
            Then both together to the ground they came, <lb/>
            One on his breast, the other on his back. <lb/>
            And now Ulysses to lift Ajax is. <lb/>
            And from the ground he heav'd him, but not high, <lb n="730"/>
            And in he clapt one knee between both his, <lb/>
            Then both upon the ground again they lie. <lb/>
            Again they rise, and had not so giv'n o'er, <lb/>
            But that Achilles to them goes, and says, <lb/>
            You both are best; torment yourselves no more, <lb n="735"/>
            But equal prizes take, and go your ways, <lb/>
            That other Greeks for other prizes may <lb/>
            Their virtue show. This said, they him obey'd, <lb/>
            And from their bodies wip'd the dust away, <lb/>
            And with their coats themselves again array'd. <lb n="740"/>
            And then Achilles brought new prizes in,- <lb/>
            A silver temp'rer that six gallons held, <lb/>
            And by Sidonian workmen made had been, <lb/>
            And all that e'er they made before excell'd, <lb/>
            And by Phœnicians into Greece was brought, <lb n="745"/>
            And giv'n to Thoas, and from him it came <lb/>
            T' Eunæus, Jason's son. Eunæus bought <lb/>
            Lycaon of Patroclus with the same. <lb/>
            This was the prize for him that swiftest ran. <lb/>
            A great fat ox the second was to take ; <lb n="750"/>
            And half a talent, gold, the hindmost man. <lb/>
            And then Achilles to the Argives spake. <lb/>
            Arise, said he, that for this prize will run. <lb/>
            Then Ajax rose, son of Oïleus, <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            The lesser Ajax. And then Nestor's son, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIII. </note><note type="margin"> The funeral <lb/>
            games for <lb/>
            Patroclus. </note> <lb n="755"/>
            The swiftest of the youth, Antilochus. <lb/>
            A row they stand. Achilles to them shows <lb/>
            The goal about the which they were to run. <lb/>
            Together then they start; and foremost goes <lb/>
            The nimble-footed Ajax, Oïleus' son. <lb n="760"/>
            But next him, and so near Ulysses is, <lb/>
            As from a woman's distaff comes the thread, <lb/>
            And on his steps trod ere the dust aris, <lb/>
            And breathed all the way upon his head. <lb/>
            The Greeks upon him called all the way <lb n="765"/>
            To do his best, and wish'd him victory. <lb/>
            Then to Athena did Ulysses pray. <lb/>
            O help me, my good Goddess, now, said he. <lb/>
            And when almost they ended had the race, <lb/>
            Then chanced Ajax in the dung to fall <lb n="770"/>
            Of cattle which had kill'd been on the place, <lb/>
            B' Achilles for Patroclus' funeral, <lb/>
            And fill'd with cow-dung was his mouth and nose. <lb/>
            Ulysses on the temp'rer laid his hands. <lb/>
            And Ajax, spitting dung, again arose, <lb n="775"/>
            And with his ox before the Argives stands. <lb/>
            Oh, oh, said he, 'tis Pallas bath done this, <lb/>
            Who, as a careful mother of her child, <lb/>
            Upon Ulysses always waiting is. <lb/>
            And when he that had said th' Achæans smil'd. <lb n="780"/>
            Antilochus th' half talent took of gold, <lb/>
            And smil'd, and to the Argives said, You see <lb/>
            The Gods still give most honour to the old ; <lb/>
            Ajax in age a little passeth me ; <lb/>
            Again, Ulysses older is than he. <lb n="785"/>
            And younger men with these cannot contend <lb/>
            At running of a race, except it be <lb/>
            Achilles : whom he finely did commend. <lb/>
            Achilles, of that commendation glad, <lb/>
            Unto Antilochus replied again ; <lb n="790"/>
            To your half-talent I'll another add. <lb/>
            That word of yours shall not be said in vain. <lb/>
            Achilles then brought forth the shield, and spear, <lb/>
            And helmet of Sarpedon, for till he <lb/>
            Was killed by Patroclus his they were, <lb n="795"/>
            And said unto the Greeks : now let me see <lb/>
            Two valiant men, well-arm'd, contend for these ; <lb/>
            And he that first draws blood shall bear away <lb/>
            This Thracian sword won from Asteropæus. <lb/>
            The arms in common they shall both enjoy, <lb n="800"/>
            And at my tent they both shall feasted be. <lb/>
            Up then great Ajax, up Tydides rose, <lb/>
            And came forth armed from the company, <lb/>
            And looking grimly, one to th' other goes, <pb n="284"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIII. </note><note type="margin"> The funeral <lb/>
            games for <lb/>
            Patroclus. </note> <lb/>
            And thrice to one another fiercely leapt, <lb n="805"/>
            And Ajax' spear pass'd through Tydides' shield ; <lb/>
            But by the breast-plate from his flesh was kept. <lb/>
            Good was his breast-plate, and not apt to yield. <lb/>
            But still at Ajax' neck Tydides aim'd, <lb/>
            Above his shield still pushing with his spear ; <lb n="810"/>
            At which the people standing by exclaim'd ; <lb/>
            For then of Ajax' life they stood in fear, <lb/>
            And to Achilles cried to part the fray <lb/>
            Betime, and let them equal prizes have. <lb/>
            And by Achilles then dismissed were they; <lb n="815"/>
            But yet the sword he to Tydides gave. <lb/>
            And then of iron he brought out a sough, <lb/>
            Such as at first it from the furnace came, <lb/>
            The which Eëtion was wont to throw ; <lb/>
            Amongst whose goods Achilles found the same, <lb n="820"/>
            And to his ship he brought it with the rest. <lb/>
            And said to th' Argives, He this prize shall gain, <lb/>
            That lets us see he throw it can the best. <lb/>
            It will his plough with iron five years maintain. <lb/>
            He needs not to the town for iron go. <lb n="825"/>
            Then Polypcetes and Leontes rise, <lb/>
            And Ajax, and together stand arow ; <lb/>
            And last of all unto them comes Epeius. <lb/>
            First threw Epeius, and well laugh'd at was. <lb/>
            And next to him Leontes threw the same. <lb n="830"/>
            Then Ajax threw and did them both surpass. <lb/>
            But when to Polypœtes' hand it came, <lb/>
            As far as doth a shepherd throw his hook <lb/>
            Seeing his sheep stand still or straggle out, <lb/>
            So far threw he. The prize his friends then took <lb n="835"/>
            And bare it to his tent. The people shout. <lb/>
            Achilles then brought other prizes in, <lb/>
            Ten double, and ten single axes keen, <lb/>
            The which the two best bowmen were to win, <lb/>
            And said, Now let your archery be seen. <lb n="840"/>
            And on the sands erects a ship-mast high, <lb/>
            And at the top he tied a dove unto't <lb/>
            With slender thread, and said, Your skill now try. <lb/>
            For he that dead the tender dove shall shoot, <lb/>
            Shall have the double axes for his prize; <lb n="845"/>
            The single he that breaks the thread shall win. <lb/>
            Then Teucer and Meriones arise, <lb/>
            And lots they cast which of them shall begin. <lb/>
            And to begin to Teucer fell the lot. <lb/>
            And first he shot. But should have made a vow <lb n="850"/>
            A hecatomb to Phœbus, but forgot. <lb/>
            And therefore Phœbus would not him allow <lb/>
            To kill the bird. But yet he brake the thread, <lb/>
            And tow'rds the ground, it hung down from her feet. <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            The frighted dove in th' air hovered, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIII. </note><note type="margin"> The funeral <lb/>
            games for <lb/>
            Patroclus. </note> <lb n="855"/>
            And mightily the Argives shout to see't. <lb/>
            Meriones then quickly drew his bow, <lb/>
            For th* arrow fitted on't already lay, <lb/>
            And presently to Phoebus made a vow <lb/>
            Of his first lambs a hecatomb to pay. <lb n="860"/>
            And seeing how the dove amazed went <lb/>
            Above his head this way and that way round, <lb/>
            His arrow keen he quickly to her sent, <lb/>
            Which piere'd her thro', and brought her to the ground. <lb/>
            The wounded dove unto a mast then flies, <lb n="865"/>
            And there her feathers sheds, and hangs her head, <lb/>
            And having sitten there not long she dies. <lb/>
            The Argives gazing at it wondered. <lb/>
            And then Meriones away did bear <lb/>
            The double axes. Teucer took the rest. <lb n="870"/>
            Achilles then new prizes fetch'd ; a spear, <lb/>
            And a new cauldron worth an ox at least. <lb/>
            To throw the spear then rose the king Atrides, <lb/>
            And after him stood up Meriones <lb/>
            Idomeneus his squire. Then said Pelides, <lb n="875"/>
            There shall be no contention for these. <lb/>
            We know how much you are more excellent <lb/>
            At this than any of th* Achæans here. <lb/>
            Take you these prizes therefore to your tent, <lb/>
            And give unto Meriones the spear, <lb n="880"/>
            If you think fit. Atrides was content, <lb/>
            And to Meriones he gave the spear, <lb/>
            And by Talthybius the cauldron sent <lb/>
            Unto the ships ; and all well pleased were.</p>

            And ev ry man returned to his tent, <lb/>
            And busy was his supper to prepare ; <lb/>
            And after they had supp'd to bed they went. <lb/>
            Achilles all the night slept not a wink, <lb n="5"/>
            But on Patroclus' worth, and company, <lb/>
            And on their common suff'rings still did think, <lb/>
            And lay upon his bed unquietly. <lb/>
            And weeping sometimes laid himself on this, <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="margin"> LID. XXIV. </note><note type="margin"> The redemp­ <lb/>

            Sometimes on that side, sometimes on his face, <lb n="10"/>
            And sometimes on his back, and sometimes ris, <lb/>
            And walk'd upon the shore from place to place. <lb/>
            And soon as ere he saw the morning come, <lb/>
            He Hector to his char'ot ti'd again ; <lb/>
            And dragg'd him thrice about Patroclus' tomb, <lb n="15"/>
            And then went in, and left him on the plain, <lb/>
            With dust all over hidden, but not rent. <lb/>
            For Phœbus had him cover'd with his shield, <lb/>
            That torn his body was not as they went. <lb/>
            The Gods meanwhile sat looking on the field, <lb n="20"/>
            And griev'd to see Achilles show such spite ; <lb/>
            And some of them advised Mercury <lb/>
            To steal away the body from his sight. <lb/>
            To this the other Gods did all agree, <lb/>
            But Neptune, Juno, Pallas, angry were <lb n="25"/>
            With Priam and with Troy, for Paris' sake, <lb/>
            For that he Venus did so much prefer, <lb/>
            And of the others small account did make. <lb/>
            Thus pass'd it then. But twelve days after, came <lb/>
            Apollo to the Gods in council set, <lb n="30"/>
            And said, Ye Gods unjust, you are to blame. <lb/>
            What sacrifice did Hector e'er forget, <lb/>
            That to his father, mother, wife, and son, <lb/>
            That for his death lament, he must not come, <lb/>
            And buried be, since he is dead and gone, <lb n="35"/>
            And have a funeral in Ilium ? <lb/>
            But to Achilles' fury you give way, <lb/>
            Whose breast is void of all humanity. <lb/>
            As lions on men's cattle love to prey; <lb/>
            Savage and proud on men so falleth he, <lb n="40"/>
            Asham'd of nothing. Though another man, <lb/>
            That had a loving brother lost, or son, <lb/>
            When he has wept a while, give over can, <lb/>
            And bear the ill that cannot be undone ; <lb/>
            But he with Hector's death is not content, <lb n="45"/>
            But drags his body at his chariot, <lb/>
            Not caring how we may the same resent. <lb/>
            He'll find at last 'twere better he had not <lb/>
            Upon the senseless earth have shown such spite. <lb/>
            To this in anger Juno then replied, <lb n="50"/>
            If equal they had been, you had said right, <lb/>
            But that they equal are it is denied. <lb/>
            For Hector was a mortal woman's son ; <lb/>
            Achilles' mother a great Goddess is, <lb/>
            Thetis, that nurs'd was and brought up by none <lb n="55"/>
            But by myself. The Gods can witness this, <lb/>
            Who, when I made her noble Peleus' bride, <lb/>
            Came to the wedding all, and you too then <lb/>
            Were with your fiddle there well satisfied, <lb/>

            Then Jupiter to Juno spake and said, <lb/>
            Look not so angrily upon the Gods, <lb/>
            Nor for Achilles' honour be afraid. <lb/>
            'Twixt him and Hector I know well the odds. <lb/>
            But Hector we of mortals love the best, <lb n="65"/>
            I do at least, of all the men of Troy. <lb/>
            He never is behind-hand with my feast, <lb/>
            But flesh and wine pays duly at my day. <lb/>
            But we'll not Hector from Achilles steal; <lb/>
            Nor can, since Thetis for him is awake. <lb n="70"/>
            Call Thetis hither; for with her I'll deal <lb/>
            To make him for his body ransom take. <lb/>
            This said, into the sea leap'd Iris straight <lb/>
            Between the isles of Imbros and of Same. <lb/>
            The water roar'd and started at her weight; <lb n="75"/>
            And she to th' bottom like a plummet came, <lb/>
            Where in a hollow cave the Goddess sat, <lb/>
            Her sea-nymphs all about her sitting round, <lb/>
            She in the midst bewailing her son's fate, <lb/>
            That was to perish on the Trojan ground. <lb n="80"/>
            And going to her near, Thetis, said she, <lb/>
            Jove calls you to him. She replied, Why so ? <lb/>
            What has that mighty God to say to me ? <lb/>
            I am not fit amongst the Gods to go. <lb/>
            But well; I go. I dare not disobey. <lb n="85"/>
            And on her head then throws she a black hood. <lb/>
            Then up they went, and Iris led the way. <lb/>
            To let them pass the sea divided stood, <lb/>
            And being landed, leap'd up to the sky, <lb/>
            When Jove in council and the Gods were met; <lb n="90"/>
            Where Thetis was received lovingly, <lb/>
            And next himself by Jupiter was set: <lb/>
            There Juno nectar, Pallas gave her place. <lb/>
            And Jove unto her spake. Thetis, said he, <lb/>
            I know your grief, but such is now the case, <lb n="95"/>
            You could not from th' assembly spared be. <lb/>
            Nine days amongst ourselves we disagree <lb/>
            Concerning Hector's body what to do; <lb/>
            The most would have him stol'n by Mercury, <lb/>
            But for your sake I would not yield thereto. <lb n="100"/>
            But go you, Thetis, to your son, and say <lb/>
            The Gods are angry, and I most of all, <lb/>
            That Hector's body at the ships doth stay <lb/>
            Unransom'd, and without a funeral; <lb/>
            That he release it may for fear of me. <lb n="105"/>
            Meanwhile to Priam Iris shall be sent, <lb/>
            To bid him go t' Achilles speedily, <lb/>
            And with fair presents fetch it from his tent. <lb/>

            T' Achilles' tent, and found him sitting there, <lb n="110"/>
            Where he, Patroclus still lamenting, sigh'd, <lb/>
            And with him friends providing dinner were; <lb/>
            And killed had a fat sheep in his tent. <lb/>
            Then in she went, and sat down by his side. <lb/>
            How long, said she, will you yourself torment ? <lb n="115"/>
            Be comforted, and for your health provide ; <lb/>
            And take delight in women's company, <lb/>
            For here you know you are not long to stay, <lb/>
            And that at hand is now your destiny. <lb/>
            And hear what I from Jove must to you say. <lb n="120"/>
            From Jupiter I come, who bade me say <lb/>
            The Gods are angry, and he most of all, <lb/>
            That Hector's body at the ships doth stay <lb/>
            Unransom'd, and without a funeral. <lb/>
            The ransom therefore take, and let him go. <lb n="125"/>
            To which Achilles a short answer gave. <lb/>
            Let him that will, since Jove will have it so, <lb/>
            The ransom bring, the body he shall have. <lb/>
            Whilst Thetis and her son discoursing were, <lb/>
            To Priam Jove swift Iris sent away. <lb n="130"/>
            Iris, said he, this message from me bear <lb/>
            To Priam, and relate what now I say. <lb/>
            Bid him unto Achilles' tent to go, <lb/>
            And carry with him other Trojans none <lb/>
            But one old squire, his char'ot to look to, <lb n="135"/>
            And bring away the body of his son ; <lb/>
            And honourable presents with him bear, <lb/>
            Wherewith Achilles may be well content. <lb/>
            And bid him death and danger not to fear, <lb/>
            So good a guardian with him shall be sent. <lb n="140"/>
            Hermes shall guide him to Achilles' tent, <lb/>
            And being there he needs not fear at all. <lb/>
            Achilles will'not kill him, but prevent <lb/>
            The hurt that might from others on him fall. <lb/>
            He wants not judgment, care, nor piety, <lb n="145"/>
            And pity has for them that to him pray. <lb/>
            This said, flew Iris from Olympus high <lb/>
            To Priam's house, where little was of joy. <lb/>
            His sons about him weeping sat, and he <lb/>
            I' th' midst involved in his cloak so just, <lb n="150"/>
            That one th' impression of his limbs might see, <lb/>
            His head and neck bedaub'd with dung and dust, <lb/>
            Which he himself had thrown upon his head. <lb/>
            His daughters, and his sons' wives, howling went <lb/>
            About, for brothers and for husbands that were dead, <lb n="155"/>
            And to the shades by th' Argives had been sent. <lb/>
            Then Iris unto Priam coming near, <lb/>
            With soft and gentle voice unto him said: <lb/>

            Jove bids you to Achilles tent to go, <lb/>
            And carry with you other Trojans none <lb/>
            But one old squire, your char'ot to look to, <lb/>

            So good a guardian with you shall be sent; <lb/>
            Hermes shall guide you to Achilles' tent. <lb/>
            When you are there, past is the danger all; <lb n="170"/>
            Achilles will not kill you, but prevent <lb/>
            The harm that may from others on rOll fall. <lb/>

            When Iris this had said, she went away. <lb/>
            Then Priam said unto his sons, Arise, <lb/>
            And make a waggon ready out of hand ; <lb/>
            And to a cedar chamber down he hies, <lb/>
            Where his most precious household-stuff did stand, <lb n="180"/>
            And thither call'd his wife, and to her said, <lb/>
            Jove's messenger t' Achilles bids me go <lb/>
            With ransom for my son. I'm not afraid, <lb/>
            But what think you ? Is't best to go, or no ? <lb/>
            At this, aloud she shriek'd, and said, Ay me, <lb n="185"/>
            What now is of the wit you had become, <lb/>
            For which so wise you once were thought to be, <lb/>
            By men abroad, and by your friends at home ? <lb/>
            Will you go put yourself into the hand <lb/>
            Of him that hath your sons so many slain, <lb n="190"/>
            A man that does not pity understand, <lb/>
            Nor faith ? No, no, he'll not from you abstain. <lb/>
            But since the Fates designed had before <lb/>
            His birth, to th' dogs he should be made a prey <lb/>
            By this hard-hearted man, you may deplore <lb n="195"/>
            Him here at home, and from Achilles stay. <lb/>
            Oh, that between my teeth I had his heart, <lb/>
            That to revenge my son I might it eat; <lb/>
            It would no little ease be to my smart, <lb/>
            And less the loss of him I should regret. <lb n="200"/>
            For Hector only for his country fought, <lb/>
            And of his enemies was not afraid, <lb/>
            Nor did him wrong, but valiant was and stout. <lb/>
            Then Priam to his wife replied, and said, <lb/>

            Dissuade me not, nor ill bird to me be <lb/>

            But howsoever, come what will, I am <lb/>
            With Hector in my arms content to die. <lb/>
            This said, the chests he presently unlocks, <lb/>
            And out he lays twelve robes for womankind, <lb/>
            As many coats, as many single cloaks, <lb n="215"/>
            And unto those as many that were lin'd; <lb/>
            And further twelve rich carpets out he laid, <lb/>
            And when he that had done, he gold brought forth, <lb/>
            Whereof he layed by ten talents weigh'd, <lb/>
            And two great black three-footed pots, much worth; <lb n="220"/>
            And unto those he set bright cauldrons four, <lb/>
            And the fine cup which giv'n him was when he <lb/>
            From Troy to Thrace was sent ambassador, <lb/>
            So long'd he to set Hector's body free. <lb/>
            I* th' porch then standing many Trojans were, <lb n="225"/>
            That sorry for his grief, were thither come; <lb/>
            To whom he said, Rascals, what make you here ? <lb/>
            Find you not cause of grief enough at home, <lb/>
            That you must hither come to trouble me, <lb/>

            Hereafter you will easlier killed be, <lb/>

            As for myself, before I see that day, <lb/>
            I hope to be within th' infernal gates. <lb/>
            Then with his staff he drave them all away; <lb n="235"/>
            And turning in again his sons he rates, <lb/>
            Paris and Agathon and Helenus, <lb/>
            Pammon, Polites, and Antiphobus, <lb/>
            Argavus, Deiphobus, Hippothous. <lb/>
            These nine he rated, saying to them thus, <lb n="240"/>
            Make haste, unworthy sons. I had been glad <lb/>
            If you in Hector's stead had all been slain. <lb/>
            O how unfortunate am I, that had <lb/>
            So many and so valiant sons in vain ! <lb/>
            Mestor and Troïlus both valiant men, <lb n="245"/>
            And godlike Hector. Sure I am accurs'd. <lb/>
            Since Mars of these depriv'd me has again, <lb/>

            That done, king Priam's horses to his car <lb/>
            Were by himself and by Idæus tied, <lb/>
            Of which he always taken had such care, <lb/>
            That while they fed he stayed by their side. <lb/>
            Then Hecuba came to them with a cup, <lb n="265"/>
            A golden cup of pleasant wine, that they <lb/>
            The same to Jupiter might offer up <lb/>
            Before unto their foes they went away. <lb/>
            Here, take this cup, said she, and pray to Jove <lb/>
            That he will let you see a lucky flight <lb n="270"/>
            Of that great bird which he the most doth love, <lb/>
            That you may be assured by the sight <lb/>
            That safe you shall again return to Troy. <lb/>
            For if that favour to you be denied <lb/>
            I should avise you by all means to stay. <lb n="275"/>
            And Priam then to Hecuba replied, <lb/>
            This counsel, wife, of yours with reason stands. <lb/>
            Jove pleased is when to him men look up. <lb/>
            For water then he call'd and wash'd his hands, <lb/>
            And from his wife received the golden cup. <lb n="280"/>
            Then looking up to heav'n, 0 Jove, said he, <lb/>
            Of all the Gods most glorious, high, and great, <lb/>
            Grant me that I may well received be <lb/>
            B' Achilles at his tent, and well retreat. <lb/>
            And that thereof I may be confident, <lb n="285"/>
            Now show me of your bird a lucky flight. <lb/>
            This said, Jove presently an eagle sent, <lb/>
            Of colour spotted over black and white. <lb/>
            As wide as is a prince's gate or more, <lb/>
            So wide her wings the mighty eagle spreads, <lb n="290"/>
            And as it over Ilium did soar, <lb/>
            The people joy'd to see it o'er their heads. <lb/>
            The old man then went up into his seat, <lb/>
            And through the city to the plain did pass. <lb/>
            The waggon wherein lay the treasure great <lb n="295"/>
            Before him driven by Idæus was. <lb/>
            And so far went his sons, and sons-in-law; <lb/>
            And then return'd again into the city. <lb/>
            When Jupiter upon the way him saw <lb/>
            In this estate, he moved was with pity ; <lb n="300"/>
            And unto Hermes turn'd his eyes and said, <lb/>

            He thither safely come. And Mercury <lb/>
            No sooner understood his father's will <lb/>

            Wherewith he layeth sleep on mortal eyes, <lb/>
            And takes it off again when he thinks good. <lb/>
            Then down to Troy and Hellespont he flies, <lb n="315"/>

            When down begins t' appear upon his face. <lb/>
            Idæus now and Priam at the brink <lb/>
            Of Xanthus were, and night came on apace, <lb/>
            And there they made their mules and horses drink. <lb n="320"/>
            Idæus near them then saw Mercury, <lb/>
            And in great fear, to Priam cried, I see <lb/>
            A man, 0 Priam, coming. Let us fly, <lb/>
            Or to him go and fall down at his knee. <lb/>
            And horribly was Priam then afraid ; <lb n="325"/>
            His hair with fear upon him stood upright. <lb/>
            Then Mercury unto him came, and laid <lb/>
            His hand on his, and to him said, 'Tis night; <lb/>
            What makes you be abroad ? Do you not fear <lb/>
            Your foes, the Greeks? If any of them knew <lb n="330"/>
            That you were with so great a treasure here, <lb/>
            In what a pitiful estate were you ? <lb/>
            For you, and he that's with you, both are old, <lb/>
            And neither of you can himself defend, <lb/>

            And Priam then to Mercury replied: <lb/>
            'Tis true you say; and yet the Gods a care <lb/>
            Have of me still, to send me such a guide, <lb n="340"/>
            So great a man, so comely, and so wise, <lb/>
            That blessed are the parents you begat. <lb/>
            And Mercury to him again replies : <lb/>
            Indeed, old man, you say the truth in that. <lb/>
            But whither bear you your best goods away ? <lb n="345"/>
            To some strange city, till the war be done ? <lb/>

            And whence ye come, and who your parents are, <lb/>
            And how my son and his hard fate you knew ? <lb/>
            You mean to try me now, said Mercury. <lb/>
            At th' Argive ships I Hector frighted saw, <lb/>
            And how he made the Greeks before him fly, <lb n="355"/>

            And seven sons he has in all, of which <lb/>
            I am the last. And lots at home we drew, <lb/>
            Which of us with Achilles should be sent <lb n="365"/>
            To th' war of Troy. The lot then fell to me, <lb/>
            And with Achilles in his ship I went, <lb/>
            And hither come the place of fight to see. <lb/>
            The Greeks by break of day will hither come, <lb/>

            Impatient of their stay at Ilium, <lb/>
            They cannot by their leaders be kept in. <lb/>
            Then Priam to him said again: Since you <lb/>
            Achilles' servant are, is Hector yet <lb/>
            At th' Argive ships, I pray you tell me true, <lb n="375"/>
            Or cut in joints, thrown to the dogs to cut ? <lb/>
            And Hermes unto this again replies: <lb/>
            Nor dogs nor fowl upon him yet have fed, <lb/>
            But at the ships he still neglected lies, <lb/>
            And though he have twelve days now there been dead, <lb n="380"/>
            Yet is his body uncorrupt, and free <lb/>
            From worms that breed in other bodies slain, <lb/>
            And though it ev'ry morning dragged be <lb/>
            About Patroclus' tomb, doth whole remain, <lb/>
            And undefac'd, the blood all wash'd away. <lb n="385"/>
            You would admire to see him look so fresh, <lb/>
            And cleansed of the filth that on him lay, <lb/>
            And at his wounds how closed is the flesh, <lb/>
            Though many from the Greeks receiv'd he had; <lb/>
            So kind the Gods were after he was dead. <lb n="390"/>
            These words of Mercury made Priam glad, <lb/>
            And thus again he to him answered: <lb/>
            Yes, yes, 'tis good to give the Gods their due, <lb/>
            A thing that Hector never did omit; <lb/>
            And therefore to him they this favour shew, <lb n="395"/>
            Although his soul be in th' infernal pit. <lb/>
            But now t' Achilles' tent be you my guide, <lb/>
            And at my hand this handsome cup receive. <lb/>
            Again you try me, Mercury replied; <lb/>
            I dare not take't without Achilles' leave, <lb n="400"/>
            For of his anger in great fear I stand. <lb/>
            Without a bribe I'll with you go along <lb/>
            To what place you think fit, by sea or land, <lb/>
            Though 'twere to Argos; none shall do you wrong. <lb/>
            For sure, so wretchedly I do not look, <lb n="405"/>
            But that a man may of me stand in fear. <lb/>
            Then up he leapt, and in his hands he took <lb/>
            The whip and reins, and serv'd as char'oteer. <lb/>
            When they were come to th' Argive ditch and wall, <pb n="294"/>

            The watch that placed was the gate to keep, <lb n="410"/>
            Their supper to provide were busy all, <lb/>
            And Mercury there laid them all asleep, <lb/>
            Took off the bars, the gate wide open laid, <lb/>
            And in the char'ot and the waggon went, <lb/>
            With all the wealth for Hector to be paid, <lb n="415"/>
            And forward pass unto Achilles' tent, <lb/>
            Built for him by his Myrmidons, and high, <lb/>
            With fir-trees tall, and cover'd over head <lb/>
            (To keep it out of danger from the sky) <lb/>
            With the deep vesture of the flow'ry mead, <lb n="420"/>
            And to it had a great court pal'd about, <lb/>
            And in the pale a high two-valved door, <lb/>
            For cars and waggons to go in and out, <lb/>
            And one great bar of fir-tree and no more, <lb/>
            So great that it required three common men <lb n="425"/>
            Upon the lofty gate to set it on, <lb/>
            And three such men to take it off again; <lb/>
            None but Achilles shut it could alone. <lb/>
            This gate then Hermes open to him laid, <lb/>
            And with the car and waggon in he came, <lb n="430"/>
            Then leaping to the ground to Priam said, <lb/>
            Old father, I a God immortal am, <lb/>
            Hermes, and hither sent to be your guide, <lb/>
            From heaven, on purpose by my father Jove. <lb/>
            But by Achilles I'll not here be spied; <lb n="435"/>
            Gods must not shew to men such open love. <lb/>
            But go you to Achilles in, and try <lb/>
            What favour from him at his knees your find, <lb/>
            And put him of his son in memory, <lb/>
            And father. That will work upon his mind. <lb n="440"/>
            This said, t' Olympus Hermes went his way. <lb/>
            Then to the ground leapt Priam from his car, <lb/>
            And going in he bad Idæus stay, <lb/>
            And of the mules and horses have a care. <lb/>
            Achilles at his supper now was set, <lb n="445"/>
            And waiting on him stood Automedon <lb/>
            And Alimus, the table standing yet; <lb/>
            But supp'd he had, and appetite had none. <lb/>
            His other friends at distance from him sat, <lb/>
            And Priam to them then came in unseen, <lb n="450"/>
            And kiss'd the hands there of Achilles, that <lb/>
            Of many of his sons the death had been. <lb/>
            As when a man that kill'd another has, <lb/>
            And to another prince for safety flies, <lb/>
            Men at him stare; so he amazed was <lb n="455"/>
            When he saw Priam stand before his eyes. <lb/>
            The rest admir'd the comely man to see, <lb/>
            And both on him and one another look: <lb/>
            But Priam then upon Achilles' knee <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            Laid both his hands, and thus unto him spoke: <note type="margin"> LID. XXIV. </note><note type="margin"> The redemp­ <lb/>

            and his funeral. </note> <lb n="460"/>
            Godlike Achilles, take into your thought <lb/>
            Your father, that an old man is as I, <lb/>
            And into trouble by his neighbours brought, <lb/>
            And has no friend on whom he may rely. <lb/>
            Yet he has many intervals of joy, <lb n="465"/>
            And thinking on his son, is comforted <lb/>
            With hope to see him hack return from Troy. <lb/>
            Undone am I; for all my hopes are fled. <lb/>
            When tli' army of th' Achæans landed here, <lb/>
            I by the Gods with fifty sons was bless'd, <lb n="470"/>
            Whereof sixteen my wife did to me bear, <lb/>
            And other women in my house the rest. <lb/>
            But in this war the most of them are lost. <lb/>
            And now by Mars reduced are to few. <lb/>
            And Hector, which of all I loved most, <lb n="475"/>
            Is lately, 0 Achilles, slain by you. <lb/>
            His body to redeem I hither come, <lb/>
            With precious gifts, and fall before your knee, <lb/>
            That I may bury it in Ilium. <lb/>
            Upon your father think, and pity me. <lb n="480"/>
            Yet is my case more pitiful than his. <lb/>
            For what calamity can greater be <lb/>
            Than th' hands that have my children kill'd to kiss ? <lb/>
            This said, Achilles wept. And from his knee, <lb/>
            With his, the hands of Priam gently mov'd ; <lb n="485"/>
            And then aloud they both lamented. He <lb/>
            For Peleus, and Patroclus whom he lov'd, <lb/>
            And Priam for his own calamity, <lb/>
            And through the house were heard to sigh and groan. <lb/>
            Achilles, when his fit of tears was laid, <lb n="490"/>
            And eased was his heart, came from his throne, <lb/>
            And rais'd th' old man that on his knees yet staid, <lb/>
            And to him spake. Alas, old man, said he, <lb/>
            You much have suffer'd, and your pain I feel. <lb/>
            But how alone durst you to come to me, <lb n="495"/>
            That slew your sons, unless your heart be steel ? <lb/>
            But come, sit down. In vain lamenting is, <lb/>
            The hurt that's done tears cannot take away, <lb/>
            Since so 'tis ordered by the Gods in bliss, <lb/>
            That men shall live in pain, and they in joy. <lb n="500"/>
            Two barrels in his cellar Jove has still, <lb/>
            Of gifts to be bestow'd on mortal wights, <lb/>
            One full of good, the other full of ill. <lb/>
            And usually to mingle them delights. <lb/>
            For they that only ill receive from Jove, <lb n="505"/>
            Exposed always are to injury, <lb/>
            And begging up and down the world shall rove, <lb/>
            And both by Gods and men despised be. <lb/>
            So Peleus at the first receiv'd much good, <pb n="296"/>

            And with his subjects in great honour stood, <lb/>
            And joined in wedlock to a Goddess was. <lb/>
            But after this the ill unto him came, <lb/>
            To leave no child behind him to succeed, <lb/>
            But only me that so short-lived am, <lb n="515"/>
            And from him live to vex you and your seed. <lb/>
            And you, 0 Priam, once were rich, they say, <lb/>
            And all that was in Lesbos did enjoy, <lb/>
            And over all the Hellespont did sway, <lb/>
            And that all Phrygia did you obey, <lb n="520"/>
            And with great store of children bless'd you were. <lb/>
            But now, you only fights and slaughter see, <lb/>
            And patiently you Hector's death must bear. <lb/>
            He cannot with your tears revived be ; <lb/>
            Much sooner you may suffer greater ill. <lb n="525"/>
            T'Achilles, Priam then again replies, <lb/>
            O Thetis' son, to sit I have no will, <lb/>
            Whilst at the ships my son unburied lies. <lb/>
            But bring him forth, that I my son may see, <lb/>
            And you the presents I have brought enjoy; <lb n="530"/>
            And prosperous unto you may they be, <lb/>
            And safely I again return to Troy. <lb/>
            Achilles, angry then, Old man, said he, <lb/>
            Provoke me not. I'll put into your hand <lb/>
            The body of your son, because to me <lb n="535"/>
            From Jove my mother came with that command. <lb/>
            And very well I know you Priam are, <lb/>
            And that you hither had a God for guide. <lb/>
            What mortal to the army come would dare ? <lb/>
            Or could have pass'd the watch and not been spied ? <lb n="540"/>
            Or open to you could the gates have set ? <lb/>
            Therefore take heed, and anger me no more, <lb/>
            Lest the command of Jove I should forget, <lb/>
            And without Hector send you out adoor. <lb/>
            This said, old Priam was afraid and sat. <lb n="545"/>
            Out went Achilles with Automedon <lb/>
            And Axamus, his two good servants, that <lb/>
            He lov'd the most, Patroclus being gone. <lb/>
            And they the horses and the mules untied, <lb/>
            And from the waggon in the goods they brought, <lb n="550"/>
            Only, wherewith the body dead to hide, <lb/>
            They left behind a handsome robe and coat. <lb/>
            Achilles then his drudging maids appointed <lb/>
            To bear the body to some chamber meet, <lb/>
            And see the same well wash'd and well anointed, <lb n="555"/>
            So secretly that Priam might not see't, <lb/>
            Lest grieved he should something do or say, <lb/>
            That might so far Achilles' anger move, <lb/>
            That in his passion he should Priam slay, <lb/>

            And being wash'd, anointed, and array'd, <lb/>
            Achilles laid the body on a bed, <lb/>
            Which his two servants in the waggon laid. <lb/>
            This done, he to Patroclus sake and said, <lb/>
            O ray Patroclus, if you hear in Hell, <lb n="565"/>
            That Hector's body I have sent to Troy, <lb/>
            Forgive me, since I for it paid am well <lb/>
            With gifts, whereof what's fit to you I'll pay. <lb/>
            This said, Achilles to his tent retired, <lb/>
            And sat upon the seat from whence he rise <lb n="570"/>
            Your son, said he, is freed as you desired, <lb/>
            And on a bed laid in your waggon is. <lb/>
            Tomorrow with him go, by break of day. <lb/>
            But let us not our supper now forget ; <lb/>
            For Niobe twelve children lost, they say ; <lb n="575"/>
            Yet did she not for that refuse to eat. <lb/>
            Six lusty sons, six daughters fair they were, <lb/>
            And killed all, only for saying this, <lb/>
            [Leto but two, and she did many bear.] <lb/>
            By Phcebus they, and these by Artemis, <lb n="580"/>
            The Goddess Leto's daughter and her son. <lb/>
            Nine days and nights they lay unburied ; <lb/>
            For Jove had chang'd the people into stone, <lb/>
            And then the Gods with earth them covered. <lb/>
            Yet Niobe, when she had weeping done, <lb n="585"/>
            Received food ; and now doth somewhere lie <lb/>
            I' th' wolds of Sepylus, and turn'd to stone, <lb/>
            The hurt done by the Gods takes patiently. <lb/>
            Come then, old man, and lay your grief away, <lb/>
            And for the present think upon your meat, <lb n="590"/>
            And weep for Hector when you come to Troy, <lb/>
            For true it is your loss of him is great. <lb/>
            This said, forth goes Achilles, and appoints <lb/>
            A sheep for supper to be kill'd and flay'd ; <lb/>
            Which straight was done, and cut out into joints, <lb n="595"/>
            And pierc'd with spits unto the fire was laid. <lb/>
            And when it was well roasted, taken up. <lb/>
            Automedon o' th' table laid the bread. <lb/>
            Achilles made the messes. Then they sup, <lb/>
            And on the meat they laid their hands and fed. <lb n="600"/>
            But when of food they had no more desire, <lb/>
            Priam admir'd Achilles' form and face. <lb/>
            Achilles Priam did no less admire, <lb/>
            In his aspect and speech there was such grace. <lb/>
            When on each other they had look'd enough, <lb n="605"/>
            Priam began, and to Achilles spake. <lb/>
            Dismiss me, if you please, Achilles, now, <lb/>
            That I a little sleep at last may take. <lb/>
            For since my son was slain, I never slept, <pb n="298"/>

            Perpetually, and for him sigh'd and wept, <lb/>
            Nor until now touch'd either meat or wine. <lb/>
            Achilles then to th' women gave command <lb/>
            r th' porch without to set him up a bed, <lb/>
            With handsome coverlets of purple, and <lb n="615"/>
            With fine soft blankets see it covered. <lb/>
            The women quickly his command obey'd, <lb/>
            And two beds ready made i' th' porch without. <lb/>
            Achilles smiling then to Priam said, <lb/>
            Old man, I from my tent must turn you out; <lb n="620"/>
            Lest some man should, from Agamemnon sent <lb/>
            With counsel, come and chance to see you here, <lb/>
            And let him know that you are at my tent, <lb/>
            And the redemption of your son defer. <lb/>
            But ere you go, old man, pray tell me right, <lb n="625"/>
            What time is needful for his obsequies ? <lb/>
            That I so long may keep the Greeks from fight. <lb/>
            Then Priam to Achilles thus replies : <lb/>
            You know, Achilles, very well how far <lb/>
            The hills and woods are distant from the town, <lb n="630"/>
            And how afraid to go the Trojans are. <lb/>
            We need nine days to fetch the fuel down. <lb/>
            The tenth he shall be burnt and buried; <lb/>
            Th' eleventh a mount upon him shall be laid ; <lb/>
            The twelfth we'll fight again if there be need. <lb n="635"/>
            To this Achilles answered, and said, <lb/>
            Old man, the time you asked granted is; <lb/>
            So long th' Achæans shall from fight forbear. <lb/>
            This said, in Priam's hand he layed his, <lb/>
            That of his faith he might not stand in fear. <lb n="640"/>
            There in the porch slept Priam and Idæus; <lb/>
            And then unto his bed Achilles went, <lb/>
            And there he slept, and with him fair Brisëis, <lb/>
            Within an inner chamber of his tent. <lb/>
            The other Gods and men slept all the night; <lb n="645"/>
            But sleep approached not to Hermes' eyes, <lb/>
            But thinking lay on Priam, how he might <lb/>
            Conduct him safely from his enemies. <lb/>
            Then up he rose, and went to Priam's head, <lb/>
            And to him said, HOt Priam, sleep you here ? <lb n="650"/>
            Since you redeem'd have Hector's body dead, <lb/>
            You think you nothing farther have to fear. <lb/>
            Although you for him paid a lusty price, <lb/>
            Yet if alive Atrides find you here, <lb/>
            Your sons and friends shall pay that value thrice. <lb n="655"/>
            This said, he suddenly awak'd with fear, <lb/>
            And calling to Idæus made him rise. <lb/>
            Then Hermes to the waggon and the car, <lb/>
            Himself the lab'ring mules and horses ties. <lb/>

            Unseen, till past Scamander ford they were; <lb/>
            Then Hermes left them and return'd to Jove. <lb/>
            And now the morning was display'd and clear. <lb/>
            Then sighing, on they went to Ilium, <lb n="665"/>
            But were by neither man nor woman spied, <lb/>
            Till up into the tow'r of Pergamum <lb/>
            Cassandra went, and thence she them discried, <lb/>
            And weeping, to the people cried, and said, <lb/>
            Ye men and women all of Ilium, <lb n="670"/>
            If ever you at Hector's coming joy'd, <lb/>
            Run to the gates; I see him hither come. <lb/>
            Then, man nor woman left was in the town, <lb/>
            But Hector to behold went to the gate. <lb/>
            First came his loving wife and mother down, <lb n="675"/>
            And in the waggon by him weeping sate. <lb/>
            The people in a throng about him staid <lb/>
            Lamenting and lamented had all day, <lb/>
            But Priam from his car unto them said, <lb/>
            Trojans, unto the body dead give way. <lb n="680"/>
            And when within the house I have it laid, <lb/>
            Then for him weep till you be satisfied. <lb/>
            When this was said, the people him obey'd, <lb/>
            And to make way, themselves they then divide. <lb/>
            Then to the house they brought the body in, <lb n="685"/>
            And plac'd it on a bed. Then singers by <lb/>
            They set, the lamentation to begin. <lb/>
            Their song they sung ; to which the women sigh. <lb/>
            Then to lament Andromache began. <lb/>
            Oh, my dear husband, you have lost your life <lb n="690"/>
            Unhappily, that were but a young man, <lb/>
            And made a wretched widow of your wife, <lb/>
            And with me left behind a tender son, <lb/>
            To evil fate begot by you and me. <lb/>
            To see him grow a man I hope have none ; <lb n="695"/>
            This city first I fear destroyed will be, <lb/>
            Since you are gone that was our sole defence. <lb/>
            T' Achaia now the wives of Troy must go, <lb/>
            And with them I. And you my child must hence, <lb/>
            And in vile work employ'd be by the foe, <lb n="700"/>
            Or you may by some spiteful man or other <lb/>
            Be from the wall or some high tower thrown, <lb/>
            For Hector's sake, that killed has his brother, <lb/>
            Or father, or his son before the town. <lb/>
            For many of the Greeks has Hector slain. <lb n="705"/>
            He went not to the battle bashfully. <lb/>
            For which the Trojans now are in great pain, <lb/>
            And I your loving wife especially. <lb/>
            O that you thus should in the dust be laid, <pb n="300"/>

            And Hecuba began. Hector, said she, <lb/>
            Of all my sons to me you were most dear. <lb/>
            And when arrived was your destiny, <lb n="715"/>
            You by the Gods, though dead, beloved were. <lb/>
            My other sons, when any taken by <lb/>
            Achilles were, beyond sea carried were <lb/>
            And sold, and made to suffer slavery <lb/>
            At Samos, Imbros, Lemnos, or elsewhere ; <lb n="720"/>
            But when of life he had deprived you, <lb/>
            Because his friend, Patroclus, you had slain, <lb/>
            About his monument he oft you drew, <lb/>
            Though that could not bring him to life again. <lb/>
            But now he sent it to me has again, <lb n="725"/>
            As fresh and as well coloured as if by <lb/>
            Apollo's gentle shafts he had been slain. <lb/>
            This said, again the people sob and sigh. <lb/>
            Then Helen took her turn, Hector, said she, <lb/>
            Whom best I lov'd of all my brother-laws, <lb n="730"/>
            For you were so, since Paris married me, <lb/>
            Though when I married him accurs'd I was, <lb/>
            Now twenty years 'tis since I came to Troy, <lb/>
            And never did an ill word from you hear ; <lb/>
            And when your kindred of me ill did say, <lb n="735"/>
            You took my part, and made them to forbear. <lb/>
            Since you are gone my joy is at an end, <lb/>
            And in your death I moan my own estate, <lb/>
            That now amongst the Trojans have no friend, <lb/>
            Who hate me as the author of their fate. <lb n="740"/>
            This, said with tears, provok'd the people's pity; <lb/>
            But Priam then unto them spake, and said : <lb/>
            Go Trojans now and fetch wood to the city ; <lb/>
            You need not of the Argives be afraid. <lb/>
            Achilles, when I parted from his tent, <lb n="745"/>
            Eleven days allowed my son t' inter <lb/>
            And fetch down wood without impediment ; <lb/>
            So long the Arrives should from fight forbear. <lb/>
            This said, to th'hills with oxen, and with wains, <lb/>
            And mules they went, and busy were about <lb n="750"/>
            This work nine days together and took pains. <lb/>
            Upon the tenth the body was brought out, <lb/>
            And on the top of the great wood-pile laid, <lb/>
            And fire put to't; and all day long it burned, <lb/>
            And all the night. When morning was displayed, <lb n="755"/>
            Again the Trojans to the pile returned, <lb/>
            And th'embers with black wine extinguished. <lb/>
            His bones then by his brothers and his kin, <lb/>
            Were from the ground together gathered, <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            And by them to an urn of gold laid in. <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIV. </note><note type="margin"> The redemp­ <lb/>

            The urn, with purple robes then covered over, <lb/>
            Into a grave, which soon was made, they laid. <lb/>
            The grave with many and great stones they cover. <lb/>
            And last of all, because they were afraid, <lb/>
            Before their work were done the Greeks would come, <lb n="765"/>
            They sent out scouts on ev'ry side to spy. <lb/>
            And o'er his grave, in haste, they raise a tomb. <lb/>
            This done, away they went, and by-and-bye <lb/>
            To Priam's house they came again, and there <lb/>
            He made a splendid supper for them all. <lb n="770"/>
            Then home they went, well pleased with their cheer. <lb/>

            That having sack'd the sacred town of Troy, <lb/>
            Wander'd so long at sea; what course he ran <lb/>
            By winds and tempests driven from his way: <lb/>
            That saw the cities, and the fashions knew <lb n="5"/>
            Of many men, but suffer'd grievous pain <lb/>
            To save his own life, and bring home his crew; <lb/>
            Though for his crew, all he could do was vain, <lb/>
            They lost themselves by their own insolence, <lb/>
            Feeding, like fools, on the Sun's sacred kine ; <lb n="10"/>
            Which did the splendid deity incense <lb/>
            To their dire fate. Begin, 0 Muse divine. <lb/>
            The Greeks from Troy were all returned home, <lb/>
            All that the war and winds had spar'd, except <lb/>
            The discontent Ulysses only; whom <lb n="15"/>
            In hollow caves the nymph Calypso kept. <lb/>
            But when the years and days were come about, <lb/>
            Wherein was woven his return by fate <lb/>
            To Ithaca (but neither there without <lb/>
            Great pain), the Gods then pitied his estate, <lb n="20"/>
            All saving Neptune ; who did never cease <lb/>
            To hinder him from reaching his own shore, <lb/>
            And persecute him still upon the seas <lb/>
            Till he got home, then troubled him no more. <lb/>
            Neptune was now far off in Black-moor land; <lb n="25"/>
            The Black-moors are the utmost of mankind, <lb/>
            As far as east and west asunder stand, <lb/>
            So far the Black-moors* borders are disjoin'd. <lb/>
            Invited there to feast on ram and bull, <lb/>
            There sat he merry. Th' other Gods were then <lb n="30"/>
            Met on Olympus in a synod full, <lb/>
            In th' house of Jove, father of Gods and men. <lb/>
            And first spake Jove, whose thoughts were now upon <lb/>
            Ægistus' death, which he but then first knew, <lb/>
            By th' hand of Agamemnon's valiant son, <lb n="35"/>
            Who to revenge his father's blood him slew. <lb/>
            Ha! how dare mortals tax the Gods, and say, <lb/>
            Their harms do all proceed from our decree, <lb/>
            And by our setting; when by their crimes they <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>

            Telemachus, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
            Against our wills make their own destiny ? <lb n="40"/>
            As now Ægistus did Atrides kill <lb/>
            Newly come home, and married his wife ; <lb/>
            Although he knew it was against my will, <lb/>
            And that it would cost him one day his life. <lb/>
            Sent we not Hermes to him to forbid <lb n="45"/>
            The murder, and the marriage of the wife; <lb/>
            And tell him if the contrary he did <lb/>
            Orestes should revenge it on his life ? <lb/>
            All this said Hermes, as we bade him. But <lb/>
            Ægistus, for all this, was not afraid <lb n="50"/>
            His lust in execution to put. <lb/>
            And therefore now has dearly for it paid. <lb/>
            Then Pallas moved on Ulysses' part, <lb/>
            And said, 0 Father Jove, the king of kings, <lb/>
            Ægistus' fate was fit for his desert, <lb n="55"/>
            So let them perish all that do such things. <lb/>
            'Tis for Ulysses that I live in pain, <lb/>
            Poor man, long absent from his friends, forlorn, <lb/>
            In a small isle, the centre of the main ; <lb/>
            Kept from his home, doth nought but grieve and mourn. <lb n="60"/>
            The isle is beautified with goodly trees. <lb/>
            And in it dwells a nymph. Her father's name <lb/>
            Atlas, that all the depths of the ocean sees, <lb/>
            And beareth up the pillars of the same, <lb/>
            And heaven and earth to boot. His daughter 'tis <lb n="65"/>
            That with fair words and gentle courtesy <lb/>
            Detains Ulysses. And her meaning is <lb/>
            For ever there to have his company. <lb/>
            Whilst he, alas! e'en dies for very grief. <lb/>
            To see the smoke of Ithaca he wishes, <lb n="70"/>
            And would take that for some, though small relief. <lb/>
            And yet you are not mov'd. Were not Ulysses <lb/>
            His sacrifices on the Trojan shore <lb/>
            Both free and bountiful ? They were, you know: <lb/>
            In th' Argive camp, I dare say, no man's more. <lb n="75"/>
            Why, therefore, Father, should you hate him so ? <lb/>
            To her the mighty Jove made this reply. <lb/>
            Child, what a word is this that you let fall ? <lb/>
            Do I neglect Ulysses, or do I <lb/>
            Ulysses hate, that amongst mortals all <lb n="80"/>
            For wisdom and for piety excels ? <lb/>
            Neptune, that backs and shakes the earth, 'tis he <lb/>
            Whose breast with anger and revenge still swells <lb/>
            Against him, for his son's calamity, <lb/>
            The godlike Polypheme, Cyclops the great, <lb n="85"/>
            Whom on Thoosa, Phorcys' daughter brave, <lb/>
            Neptune the king of waters did beget, <lb/>
            Embracing her within a hollow cave ; <lb/>
            And him Ulysses has depriv'd of sight. <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            For which, though Neptune do not him destroy, <note type="margin"> LIB. I. </note><note type="margin"> Pallas adviseth <lb/>
            Telemachus, &amp;c. </note> <lb n="90"/>
            He crosses him with dangers day and night, <lb/>
            And drives him up and down out of his way. <lb/>
            But well, let us that are assembled now <lb/>
            Bethink us how to bring him home. 'Tis odds <lb/>
            'Twill cool his rage. He has not strength enough <lb n="95"/>
            T' oppose the power of all the other Gods. <lb/>
            Then Pallas said, 0 Jove, of kings the king, <lb/>
            Since the blest Gods have thought good, and decreed <lb/>
            Ulysses to his native soil to bring, <lb/>
            Let's Hermes send unto the nymph with speed, <lb n="100"/>
            In th' isle Ogygia, to let her know <lb/>
            Our sentence, that she may the same obey. <lb/>
            And I to Ithaca meanwhile will go, <lb/>
            And cause his son to call without delay <lb/>
            The common council; and to make him bold, <lb n="105"/>
            To warn his mother's suitors to be gone, <lb/>
            And feast no longer on his herd and fold, <lb/>
            As they before had insolently done. <lb/>
            To Sparta too I'll send him, and to Pyle <lb/>
            T' inquire about his father's navigation, <lb n="110"/>
            That in the world, by travel for a while, <lb/>
            He may acquire a greater reputation. <lb/>
            This said, upon her feet her shoes she binds, <lb/>
            Ambrosian golden shoes, that do her bear <lb/>
            On land and water swiftly as the winds, <lb n="115"/>
            And takes in hand her brazen-headed spear ; <lb/>
            A heavy, massy, and strong spear, the same <lb/>
            Wherewith, when angry, she the armed bands <lb/>
            Of mighty men of war does eas'ly tame. <lb/>
            That was the spear she carried in her hands. <lb n="120"/>
            Then from the high Olympus leapt she down <lb/>
            T' Ulysses' house, and stood in the hall-door <lb/>
            I' th' shape of Mentes, that possess'd the crown <lb/>
            O' th' Taphian people, whom he reigned o'er. <lb/>
            And thence beheld the suitors in the court, <lb n="125"/>
            Sitting upon the hides of beeves, which they <lb/>
            Themselves had kill'd, and, wanting other sport, <lb/>
            Playing at chess they pass'd their time away. <lb/>
            Meanwhile their officers and serving-men <lb/>
            Were busy mingling water with the wine, <lb n="130"/>
            Others the meat divide, others make clean, <lb/>
            Set up and rub the tables till they shine. <lb/>
            Telemachus now with the suitors sat, <lb/>
            Fancying, in case his father should appear, <lb/>
            Brought home by the Gods or by some lucky fate, <lb n="135"/>
            How then these knaves would slink away for fear; <lb/>
            And he again recover his estate, <lb/>
            And in his own land rule without a peer. <lb/>
            He was the first that spied the Goddess, and <note type="footnote"> X 2 </note> <pb n="308"/>

            Telemachus, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
            Then presently he hastened to the door; <lb n="140"/>
            Receives her spear and takes her by the hand, <lb/>
            And both go in, she after, he before. <lb/>
            You shall, said he, stranger be welcome here : <lb/>
            But first let's sup, and afterwards well find <lb/>
            Sufficient time both for me to inquire, <lb n="145"/>
            And you to tell your business and your mind. <lb/>
            When they were come into the stately hall, <lb/>
            Her spear within a case he sets upright, <lb/>
            T' a pillar, in which case the spears were all <lb/>
            His father left behind going to fight. <lb n="150"/>
            Then led her to a chair which stood upon <lb/>
            A dainty carpet curiously wrought, <lb/>
            And put t' her feet a stool to rest upon, <lb/>
            And for himself a handsome stool he brought : <lb/>
            Then did a maid, in a fine golden ewer, <lb n="155"/>
            Bring water for their hands, and pours it on <lb/>
            Over a bason large of silver pure, <lb/>
            And set a table to them, for both one: <lb/>
            From others' seats remoter than to fear <lb/>
            Their rudeness might offend her, or that they <lb n="160"/>
            Might peradventure listening overhear <lb/>
            What he and she did of Ulysses say. <lb/>
            Another sets on bread and other things <lb/>
            To eat, such as in her charge were at home. <lb/>
            But flesh of many sorts the carver brings, <lb n="165"/>
            And the cup-bearers often go and come. <lb/>
            Then came the suitors in, and took their places <lb/>
            All in a row. To each a table stands, <lb/>
            And golden bowl, one way look all their faces, <lb/>
            The waiters bring in water for their hands. <lb n="170"/>
            The maids in baskets bring both bread and meat, <lb/>
            On which they lay their hands with great good will, <lb/>
            And heartily and hastily they eat, <lb/>
            And to the brim their cups the servants fill. <lb/>
            When they of hunger had pluck'd out the sting, <lb n="175"/>
            The lusty suitors' thoughts converted were <lb/>
            To dancing, and to hear the minstrel sing, <lb/>
            Sports these are consecrated to good cheer. <lb/>
            To Phemius, the minstrel, that was by, <lb/>
            Unwillingly, forc'd by th' unruly throng, <lb n="180"/>
            They brought a cittern, and he presently <lb/>
            Began to play, and then to sing a song. <lb/>
            But to the Goddess Pallas, in her ear <lb/>
            Telemachus began to speak his mind, <lb/>
            Not being willing any else should hear. <lb n="185"/>
            Excuse me, friend, that I say what I find. <lb/>
            You see the care of these men what it is, <lb/>
            Singing and dancing. And no wonder, since <lb/>
            That which they spend is not their own, but his <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            Whose bones lie somewhere naked far from hence, <note type="margin"> LID. I. </note><note type="margin"> Pallas adviseth <lb/>
            Telemachus, &amp;c. </note> <lb n="190"/>
            Unburied, it may be, on the ground, <lb/>
            There rotting as he lies i' th' dew and rain; <lb/>
            Or else at sea, perhaps, if he be drown'd, <lb/>
            The waves his body roll upon the main. <lb/>
            If him at home the best of them should meet <lb n="195"/>
            Safely arrived in Ithaca, he would <lb/>
            Much rather wish, I think, for nimble feet, <lb/>
            Than to be rich in garment or in gold. <lb/>
            But, oh ! he's dead, and of some cruel death ; <lb/>
            And though some tell us he is coming home, <lb n="200"/>
            'Tis comfortless, for he's bereav'd of breath. <lb/>
            To Ithaca I ne'er shall see him come. <lb/>
            But let this pass, and tell me truly now <lb/>
            Your own, your father's, and your country's name. <lb/>
            And further, I desire you'll let me know, <lb n="205"/>
            Whence are the mariners that with you came <lb/>
            Unto this town? and tell me this likewise, <lb/>
            Where rideth the good ship that brought you to't; <lb/>
            For verily I can no way devise <lb/>
            How you should come on horseback or on foot? <lb n="210"/>
            And tell me, were you never here before, <lb/>
            Nor saw my father whilst he here abode ? <lb/>
            For strangers came to visit him good store, <lb/>
            As having much convers'd with men abroad. <lb/>
            I'll clearly speak, said Pallas, t' every thing. <lb n="215"/>
            My father was Anchialus, and I <lb/>
            Mentes, my city Taphos, and I king; <lb/>
            My people to the oar themselves apply. <lb/>
            At present bound I am to Temisa <lb/>
            For brass; and iron I carry with me thither. <lb n="220"/>
            Under Mount Neion, not near Ithaca, <lb/>
            My ship at Reithrus rideth safe from weather. <lb/>
            As for your father, we were mutual guests <lb/>
            (Ask the old lord Laertes) from our youth. <lb/>
            With one old maid alone his meat to dress, <lb n="225"/>
            He lives at's country house, hell tell you truth. <lb/>
            There creeps he in his vineyard up and down. <lb/>
            And I came hither now, 'cause I was told <lb/>
            By some, his son Ulysses was in town. <lb/>
            But 'tis not so. The Gods do him withhold <lb n="230"/>
            From his dear wife, and native country still <lb/>
            Within an island, where the savage men <lb/>
            By force detain him much against his will: <lb/>
            But all in vain, he shall return again. <lb/>
            For I presage, and come it shall to pass, <lb n="235"/>
            That am no prophet, nor birds understand; <lb/>
            Though he were tied there with chains of brass, <lb/>
            He shall get loose and see his native land. <lb/>
            But say, are you indeed, that arc so grown, <pb n="310"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. I. </note><note type="margin"> Pallas adviseth <lb/>
            Telemachus, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
            His son ? Your heads and eyes are like, I mark, <lb n="240"/>
            For we were well to one another known; <lb/>
            But 'twas before he did for Troy embark <lb/>
            With other princes of the Argive youth; <lb/>
            But never saw him since. That I'm his son, <lb/>
            Said he, my mother says. But who in truth <lb n="245"/>
            Knoweth who 'twas that got him ? I think none. <lb/>
            If I might choose my father, I would be <lb/>
            His son that groweth old on's own estate. <lb/>
            But whom they tell me is my father, he <lb/>
            Of all men is the most unfortunate. <lb n="250"/>
            Then said the Goddess, Howsoe'er that be, <lb/>
            The Gods will never nameless leave your kind, <lb/>
            That are the son of fair Penelope, <lb/>
            And so well fram'd in body and in mind. <lb/>
            But say, What feast is this, and who these be? <lb n="255"/>
            You have no cause to feast. Their conversation <lb/>
            Pleases me not. 'Tis rude, unmannerly. <lb/>
            What! is't a wedding, or is't a collation ? <lb/>
            Friend, since you ask, said he, take the whole story. <lb/>
            This house was rich, my father being here, <lb n="260"/>
            But th' unkind Gods have taken hence that glory: <lb/>
            For where he is, a word we cannot hear. <lb/>
            Less had I griev'd, if he his life had lost <lb/>
            With other Argive lords under Troy wall, <lb/>
            Or, the war done, 'mongst those that love him most. <lb n="265"/>
            Then had he had a noble funeral, <lb/>
            At which th' Achaean princes would have been, <lb/>
            And the honour had redounded to his son. <lb/>
            But now, alas! devour'd by harpies keen, <lb/>
            Unheard-of and unask'd-for he is gone, <lb n="270"/>
            Leaving me here behind to sigh and groan. <lb/>
            Besides, the Gods have giv'n me other care, <lb/>
            Bitter enough. 'Tis not for him alone <lb/>
            My heart is rent. There other mischiefs are. <lb/>
            How many lords within these isles do sway! <lb n="275"/>
            Same, Dulichium, Ithaca, and Zant; <lb/>
            So many suitors duly every day <lb/>
            For marriage with my mother the house haunt. <lb/>
            Whilst she can none put off, and will none marry, <lb/>
            They spend my corn and wine, and cattle kill, <lb n="280"/>
            And eating here and drinking still they tarry, <lb/>
            And me perhaps at last they murder will. <lb/>
            Then Pallas said, Is't so ? 'Tis time indeed <lb/>
            Your father hither were come back again, <lb/>
            Having so long been absent hence, with speed <lb n="285"/>
            To lay his hands upon these shameless men. <lb/>
            Oh! that just now within the gates he stood <lb/>
            Of th' outer court, I would desire no more, <lb/>
            Arm'd with two spears, buckler, and helmet good, <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            Such now, as I have seen him heretofore. <note type="margin"> LIB. I. </note><note type="margin"> Pallas adviseth <lb/>
            Telemachus, &amp;c. </note> <lb n="290"/>
            From Ephyré he took our house in's way, <lb/>
            Where first I saw him merry drinking wine. <lb/>
            For he had been with Ilus, him to pray <lb/>
            To give him for his shafts a medicine, <lb/>
            Wherewith to make them all they wound to kill. <lb n="295"/>
            But he refused, fearing the powers above. <lb/>
            And 'twas my father gave't him for good will: <lb/>
            For why, he did him very dearly love. <lb/>
            If, such as then, Ulysses should appear <lb/>
            Amongst the suitors now, short liv'd I trow <lb n="300"/>
            They'd be, and have but bitter wedding cheer. <lb/>
            But when he shall come home, Gods only know, <lb/>
            Or whether you shall see him any more. <lb/>
            Meanwhile consider by what means you may <lb/>
            Get the unruly suitors out of door, <lb n="305"/>
            That so oppress you, and your house annoy. <lb/>
            And first observe what I shall you advise. <lb/>
            Convoke the people to the market-place; <lb/>
            Protest the Gods against their injuries, <lb/>
            And let the whole assembly know your case. <lb n="310"/>
            Say, if they needs will wed her, let her go <lb/>
            Back to her father, who the match should make, <lb/>
            And offer for her what is fit; and so <lb/>
            Which of them she likes best, him let her take, <lb/>
            And for yourself, I think it your best way, <lb n="315"/>
            In a good bark of twenty oars abroad <lb/>
            T' inquire what men can of your father say, <lb/>
            Or what some lucky sign from Jove may bode. <lb/>
            Go first to Pyle, inquire of Nestor ; then <lb/>
            To Sparta. Ask of Menelaus, whom <lb n="320"/>
            Of all which had at Troy commanded men <lb/>
            The Gods t' Achaia brought the latest home. <lb/>
            If of his safety and return you hear, <lb/>
            How much soever they waste your estate, <lb/>
            Endure their riot yet another year. <lb n="325"/>
            If dead, come back, and fairly celebrate <lb/>
            His rites, and give your mother whom she will <lb/>
            For husband. Then bethink you, how you may <lb/>
            By open force, or howsoever kill <lb/>
            These shameless suitors that your means destroy. <lb n="330"/>
            Be fool'd no more. You're now at man's estate. <lb/>
            Ægistus slew Orestes' father. He <lb/>
            Ægistus slew. Who does not this relate <lb/>
            With honour to Orestes' memory ? <lb/>
            And you, my friend, you are a goodly man. <lb n="335"/>
            Take heart. Gain honour. I must now be gone ; <lb/>
            My crew with patience no longer can <lb/>
            Stay for me, therefore think what's to be done. <lb/>
            Your counsel, said Telemachus, is such <pb n="312"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. I. </note><note type="margin"> Pallas adviseth <lb/>
            Telemachus, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
            As might become a father to his son. <lb n="340"/>
            IT not forget it. Though your haste be much, <lb/>
            Stay yet awhile; be'not so quickly gone. <lb/>
            Wash and take food, and then go merrily ; <lb/>
            And with you a fair present from me take, <lb/>
            Whereby to keep me in your memory; <lb n="345"/>
            Such as kind friends to one another make. <lb/>
            Then said the Goddess, Now I cannot stay. <lb/>
            As for your present I will not deny it, <lb/>
            But take it at my coming back this way, <lb/>
            How much soe'er you mean t' oblige me by it. <lb n="350"/>
            This said, she mounted from him to the sky <lb/>
            In likeness of an eagle, to his wonder. <lb/>
            Who thought it was some God, and grew thereby <lb/>
            Bolder, and on his father more did ponder. <lb/>
            And straightway to the suitors went, who were <lb n="355"/>
            Now come again into the house, and seated, <lb/>
            A song which Phemius then sung to hear, <lb/>
            Containing how the Grecians retreated <lb/>
            Unfortunately from the Trojan shore <lb/>
            By Pallas' doings, whom they bad offended. <lb n="360"/>
            Penelope that heard it, and was more <lb/>
            Concerned than they all, straightway descended. <lb/>
            She entered not, but in the door did stand, <lb/>
            Veil'd with a scarf which on her head she wore, <lb/>
            Having a waiting-woman on each hand; <lb n="365"/>
            And to the singer thus said, weeping sore: <lb/>
            Phemius, y' have better songs, why sing you then <lb/>
            This sad one ? Fitter 'twere the deeds to tell <lb/>
            Of mighty Gods, and mighty deeds of men, <lb/>
            Which sure would please the company as well. <lb n="370"/>
            Sing one of those, and let them hear and drink ; <lb/>
            Give over this. You touch my interest, <lb/>
            And wound my heart in forcing me to think <lb/>
            Upon my husband, of all Greeks the best. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus, Good mother, why <lb n="375"/>
            Should not the singer choose what song to sing, <lb/>
            Whose part it is to please the company ? <lb/>
            It is not he that does the evil bring. <lb/>
            'Tis none of Phemius' fault, but th' act of Jove, <lb/>
            Who deals to all men all things as he please. <lb n="380"/>
            Should he not sing the songs that men most love, <lb/>
            The new'st ? The Greeks' sad passage o'er the seas ? <lb/>
            Be patient, many more besides Ulysses, <lb/>
            Come short from Troy by one fate or another, <lb/>
            Nor are you the only wife her husband misses. <lb n="385"/>
            Many men else are lost. Therefore, good mother, <lb/>
            Go to your work again above, and see <lb/>
            Your maids do theirs, leave censuring of songs <lb/>
            Unto us men, and specially to me, <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            To whom the greatest power here belongs. <note type="margin"> LIB. I. </note><note type="margin"> FaUna adviseth <lb/>
            Telemachus, &amp;c. </note> <lb n="390"/>
            Then to her chamber up she went again, <lb/>
            With her two maids, and there began to weep, <lb/>
            Being for her dear husband in great pain, <lb/>
            And wept till Pallas clos'd her eyes with sleep. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the suitors into clusters ran, <lb n="395"/>
            And one t' another his thoughts uttered <lb/>
            With noise enough. But there was not a man <lb/>
            That did not wish to have her in his bed. <lb/>
            Then to them spake Telemachus: D'ye hear, <lb/>
            Proud suitors of my mother, let's, I pray, <lb n="400"/>
            Give ear unto the singer, and forbear <lb/>
            Clamour. To-morrow is the council day, <lb/>
            There I shall warn you publicly, no more <lb/>
            To haunt my house, but each man home to go, <lb/>
            And there to feast by turns on your own store; <lb n="405"/>
            And if you be not willing to do so, <lb/>
            But your own means to spare, shall think it best <lb/>
            To feast yourselves on one man's substance all, <lb/>
            And ruin his estate, go on and feast, <lb/>
            While I upon the Gods for vengeance call. <lb n="410"/>
            O that the mighty Jove would so ordain, <lb/>
            That all men's actions might be repaid <lb/>
            As they deserve! Then should you all be slain <lb/>
            Within my doors. After he this had said, <lb/>
            The suitors bit their lips, and silent mused <lb n="415"/>
            At the strange boldness of Telemachus, <lb/>
            And at the language which the young man used, <lb/>
            To which none answer'd but Antinous. <lb/>
            The Gods, quoth he, have taught you a high strain <lb/>
            Of language, and undaunted oratory; <lb n="420"/>
            But if their meaning were that you should reign <lb/>
            Here, o'er us all, I should be very sorry. <lb/>
            Telemachus replied, Think what you will; <lb/>
            If Jove consent, why should not I be king ? <lb/>
            What harm is it with wealth my house to fill, <lb n="425"/>
            Besides the honour it will with it bring ? <lb/>
            In Ithaca there many princes be, <lb/>
            You'll say, would be as glad to rule as I. <lb/>
            No matter, whosoe'er be king, not he, <lb/>
            But I am king in my own family. <lb n="430"/>
            Who, said Eurymachus, shall have the hap <lb/>
            To reign in Ithaca is hard to guess, <lb/>
            It lies yet folded up within Jove's lap. <lb/>
            None shall, Telemachus, you dispossess <lb/>
            Of house, or land, or goods, by violence, <lb n="435"/>
            As long as there in Ithaca be men. <lb/>
            But tell me who that was, that now went hence; <lb/>

            Or some news from Ulysses, brought perchance, <lb n="440"/>
            And went so soon away, t' avoid being known ? <lb/>
            He was no mean man by his countenance. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus, My father's dead, <lb/>
            We never shall again see one another; <lb/>
            With messengers I trouble not my head, <lb n="445"/>
            Nor soothsayers, that do but soothe my mother. <lb/>
            The man my father's old acquaintance was, <lb/>
            Mentes Anchialides, and his town <lb/>
            Taphos, and he thereof the ruling has ; <lb/>
            His people for their trade by sea well known. <lb n="450"/>
            Thus said he, though he doubted not at all <lb/>
            But 'twas some God. Meanwhile the suitors staying <lb/>
            For th' evening's coming on, to dancing fall, <lb/>
            Or listen to the minstrel's song and playing. <lb/>
            The evening came, the suitors went away; <lb n="455"/>
            Telemachus went also to his bed, <lb/>
            In a warm stately chamber, where he lay <lb/>
            Ranging the many cares he had in's head; <lb/>
            Euryclea a torch before him bore, <lb/>
            Daughter of Ops, now old, but at the time <lb n="460"/>
            Laertes did her purchase, heretofore, <lb/>
            For twenty oxen, she was in her prime. <lb/>
            He honour'd her as if she'd been his wife, <lb/>
            But from her bed perpetually forbore, <lb/>
            T' avoid suspicion, and domestic strife. <lb n="465"/>
            She'd nurs'd Telemachus, and lov'd him more <lb/>
            Than did the other maids, and now she stands <lb/>
            To light him. He unlocks the door, goes in, <lb/>
            Takes off his coat, puts it into her hands, <lb/>
            She foldeth, brusheth, hangs it on a pin. <lb n="470"/>
            Then forth she went, and by a silver ring <lb/>
            Pulls to the door. And there all night he lay <lb/>
            Rememb'ring Pallas' words, and pondering <lb/>
            Upon the business of the following day.</p>

            And out he went appearing like a God. <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            And straight unto the criers gave command, <note type="margin"> LIB. II. </note><note type="margin"> Pyle by night, <lb/>
            and how he was <lb/>

            To call the people to the public place. <lb/>
            The people met. And then with spear in hand <lb/>
            He to them takes his way; and followed was <lb/>
            By two white dogs. Then takes his father's throne ; <lb/>
            His elders gave him way; all on him gaze. <lb n="10"/>
            For why; the Goddess Pallas of her own <lb/>
            Had set authority upon his face. <lb/>
            The first that spake was old AEgyptius, <lb/>
            Stooping with age, of great experience: <lb/>
            One son of his, whose name was Antiphus, <lb n="15"/>
            Went to the siege of Troy, but coming thence <lb/>
            He died in the savage Cyclops' jaws, <lb/>
            When with Ulysses he was in his den: <lb/>
            Euronymus one of the suitors was, <lb/>
            The others with their father dwelled then. <lb n="20"/>
            But still he grieved was for Antiphus. <lb/>
            The tears ran down his cheeks, and weeping he <lb/>
            Rose up and said unto th' assembly thus: <lb/>
            Ye men of Ithaca, I pray hear me; <lb/>
            Since we to Troy Ulysses sent with ships, <lb n="25"/>
            We ne'er convoked were to Parliament, <lb/>
            What need have young or old men of our lips ? <lb/>
            And who is he that now doth us convent ? <lb/>
            Has he informed been of some invasion, <lb/>
            And unto us the same would first report ? <lb n="30"/>
            Or on some other public great occasion <lb/>
            Would give us counsel ? The Gods bless him for't. <lb/>
            Telemachus then presently upstands, <lb/>
            Though well contented with his father's praise. <lb/>
            The crier puts the sceptre in his hands. <lb n="35"/>
            And to Ægyptius first he speaks, and says, <lb/>
            Here am I, that the people have convok'd. <lb/>
            Nor do I any news or counsel bring, <lb/>
            But by my private sufferings am provok'd; <lb/>
            Which here I offer t' your considering. <lb n="40"/>
            Is it not grief enough, my father's loss, <lb/>
            That ruled like a father to us all, <lb/>
            But that I must yet bear a greater cross, <lb/>
            To see his house to utter ruin fall ? <lb/>
            My mother's house the suitors daily fill, <lb n="45"/>
            And of the best of you they children are. <lb/>
            She wedded must be with her father's will, <lb/>
            But to her father go they do not dare. <lb/>
            But in my house continually they stay, <lb/>
            And sacrifice my beeves, and goats, and sheep, <lb n="50"/>
            My wine exhaust, and much they cast away. <lb/>
            For why, Ulysses lost is on the deep, <lb/>
            And I myself unable to defend. <lb/>
            But shall I so be still, or once be able <pb n="316"/>

            To bring upon these men unjust their end, <lb n="55"/>
            Whose injuries no more are tolerable ? <lb/>
            Take it to heart. Think how 'twill taken be <lb/>
            By other states. Fear from the Gods some change, <lb/>
            That are not pleased with such iniquity, <lb/>
            And may in closer order make you range. <lb n="60"/>
            By Jove I you adjure, and Themis, who <lb/>
            Convokes assemblies, and revokes again, <lb/>
            Forbear these evil deeds yourselves to do, <lb/>
            And of your sons the liberty restrain. <lb/>
            Leave me to suffer misery alone. <lb n="65"/>
            Hurt none but me. Unless my father have <lb/>
            In hatred of you some great evil done, <lb/>
            And for revenge these men such power you gave. <lb/>
            But better 'twere for me, that you than they <lb/>
            Should spend my treasure and my comings in. <lb n="70"/>
            For if among so many men it lay, <lb/>
            Begging I might from them the value win. <lb/>
            But for my case no help can now be found. <lb/>
            said Telemachus in choler high, <lb/>
            And from him threw the sceptre to the ground. <lb n="75"/>
            Nor could forbear to let fall tears and sigh. <lb/>
            The people pitied him, but silent sat; <lb/>
            None but Antinous durst answer make. <lb/>
            Telemachus, said he, too passionate <lb/>
            You are, and too much liberty you take. <lb n="80"/>
            The people's hatred you would very fain <lb/>
            Draw to the suitors, and procure them shame. <lb/>
            But from your mother cometh all your pain; <lb/>
            And therefore her, not us, you ought to blame. <lb/>
            Three years are gone and past, the fourth is this, <lb n="85"/>
            Since she her suitors baffled has with art, <lb/>
            Putting each one in hopes by messages, <lb/>
            And promises that he had gain'd her heart. <lb/>
            Moreover, setting up a beam to weave, <lb/>
            Suitors, said she, since dead Ulysses is, <lb n="90"/>
            Stay yet a little while, and give me leave <lb/>
            To make an end but of one business. <lb/>
            I must for old Laertes make a cloth, <lb/>
            Which in his sepulchre he is to wear. <lb/>
            T' offend the wives of Greece I should be loth; <lb n="95"/>
            For to accuse me they will not forbear, <lb/>
            But say I very hasty was to wed, <lb/>
            If I go hence and not provide a shroud <lb/>
            Wherein Laertes may be buried <lb/>
            Out of such wealth, that might have been allow'd. <lb n="100"/>
            Her suitors all were well content. And then <lb/>
            All day she wove, but ere she went to bed, <lb/>
            What she had wov'n, she ravell'd out again. <lb/>
            Three years her suitors thus she frustrated, <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            In the fourth year her woman her betrayed, <note type="margin"> LIB. II. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>

            And in we came, whilst she the web undid, <lb/>
            And then to end it she could not avoid, <lb/>
            Since now her purpose could no more be hid. <lb/>
            To your complaint the suitors answer thus ; <lb/>
            Take notice of it, you and all the rest: <lb n="110"/>
            Send back your mother to Icarius, <lb/>
            There let her marry whom they both think best. <lb/>
            But if she think to vex us longer yet, <lb/>
            Caring for nothing but for Pallas' gifts, <lb/>
            To have the reputation for wit, <lb n="115"/>
            And skilfulness in curious work and shifts, <lb/>
            Wherein th' Achæan wives she doth excel, <lb/>
            Both old and young, Tiro, Alcmen', Micen', <lb/>
            Although with us she hath not dealed well; <lb/>
            But if to use us so she longer mean, <lb n="120"/>
            So much the longer with you we shall eat, <lb/>
            Which to Penelope will be a glory. <lb/>
            But we consume shall so much of your meat, <lb/>
            If long we stay there, that you will be sorry. <lb/>
            For so long as she dodges with us thus, <lb n="125"/>
            No whither from your house will we depart. <lb/>
            Then to him answered Telemachus: <lb/>
            Antinous, I ne'er shall have the heart <lb/>
            To send my mother hence against her will. <lb/>
            Abroad my father is, alive or dead. <lb n="130"/>
            That I her father should repay, were ill, <lb/>
            For forcing her to leave her husband's bed. <lb/>
            And from the Furies I shall suffer worse, <lb/>
            For if I force her from my house to go, <lb/>
            Whether she will or not, she will me curse, <lb n="135"/>
            And men will of me be revenged too. <lb/>
            If it displease you that she stayeth here, <lb/>
            You have your remedy ; you may go home, <lb/>
            And ev'ry one make all the rest good cheer <lb/>
            By turns, and into my house never come. <lb n="140"/>
            But if you needs will feed on me alone, <lb/>
            I can but to the Gods for vengeance call, <lb/>
            And reparation for what is done, <lb/>
            Which may enough be to destroy you all. <lb/>
            This said, two eagles coming were in sight, <lb n="145"/>
            And when they were the market-place just o'er, <lb/>
            Th' assembled heads surveying, stopp'd their flight, <lb/>
            And on their broad and levell'd wings they soar; <lb/>
            Then, having torn themselves both neck and cheek, <lb/>
            They to their right wing rise and fly away. <lb n="150"/>
            What this should mean th' assembly was to seek, <lb/>
            And to them thus did Alitherses say : <lb/>
            Hear me, ye men of Ithaca, said he, <lb/>
            And you, the suitors, that are most concern'd. <pb n="318"/>

            Destruction is rolling toward ye, <lb n="155"/>
            Although it be not by yourselves discerned. <lb/>
            Ulysses from his friends will not be long, <lb/>
            And now from Ithaca far off is not, <lb/>
            Seeing what daily done is in the throng, <lb/>
            And how to kill the suitors lays his plot; <lb n="160"/>
            Nay, many more besides the suitors may <lb/>
            Of their misfortune chance to have their part. <lb/>
            If they desist not soon, and come away. <lb/>
            I speak not this at random, but on art; <lb/>
            For all must come to pass I told him then, <lb n="165"/>
            When with the Argive lords he went to Troy: <lb/>
            That after twenty years he should again <lb/>
            Return with pain, his men all cast away. <lb/>
            Then said Eurymachus, Old man, go home, <lb/>
            And there to your own children prophecy, <lb n="170"/>
            Lest to them any harm hereafter come; <lb/>
            A better prophet for these things am L <lb/>
            Under the sun be many birds that fly, <lb/>
            And yet not all of them do fortunes tell; <lb/>
            Ulysses, far hence, dead is certainly, <lb n="175"/>
            I know not where. I would thou wert as well. <lb/>
            For then you would give over to inflame <lb/>
            Telemachus, who but too angry is; <lb/>
            In hope to get some present for the same, <lb/>
            If he will give it. But I tell you this. <lb n="180"/>
            If any old man, with his wisdom, dare <lb/>
            To set against us any young man here, <lb/>
            He shall be sure himself the worse to fare, <lb/>
            And when 'tis done he shall be ne'er the near; <lb/>
            We'll set a fine upon your head so wise, <lb n="185"/>
            Which you to pay will not be well content. <lb/>
            I myself will Telemachus advise <lb/>
            His mother may be to her father sent <lb/>
            To make the match, and on the dower agree, <lb/>
            Such as becomes him, to his daughter dear ; <lb n="190"/>
            Till that be done, no hope at all I see <lb/>
            The suitors should desist. For they not fear <lb/>
            Telemachus, as haughty as he is, <lb/>
            And full of words; and much less do they care <lb/>
            For such deceitful prophecies as this, <lb n="195"/>
            For which you only the more hated are. <lb/>
            Meanwhile Telemachus his goods decay, <lb/>
            And he shall never make them up again, <lb/>
            While she persists her suitors to delay, <lb/>
            And makes us all expect her love in vain. <lb n="200"/>
            And 'tis her virtue makes us thus to strive <lb/>
            Amongst ourselves who shall her favour win; <lb/>
            For many other ladies we could wive, <lb/>
            And be sufficiently delighted in. <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            Then said Telemachus, No more will I <note type="margin"> LID. II. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>

            to Pyle, &amp;c. </note> <lb n="205"/>
            This matter to you press, or to the woo'rs. <lb/>
            You and the Gods know all I do not lie; <lb/>
            But I demand a bark of twenty oars, <lb/>
            For I intend to travel for awhile, <lb/>
            To hear what men can of my father say. <lb n="210"/>
            To Lacedaemon I will go, and Pyle. <lb/>
            Or seek from Jove some notice of his way, <lb/>
            And if alive he be, and coming home, <lb/>
            Though to my cost, I'll stay another year. <lb/>
            If dead he be, then back again I'll come, <lb n="215"/>
            And rites of burial will give him here, <lb/>
            Splendid, and well becoming his estate, <lb/>
            And let my mother her own liking take. <lb/>
            Having thus spoken, down again he sate. <lb/>
            And then Ulysses' old friend Mentor spake, <lb n="220"/>
            With whom Ulysses left his house in trust. <lb/>
            Hear me, ye Ithacesians, said he; <lb/>
            Let no king ever be hereafter just, <lb/>
            Nor to his people soft and gentle be, <lb/>
            Since you Ulysses have so soon forgot, <lb n="225"/>
            That ever rul'd us like a father kind. <lb/>
            But I the suitors so much accuse not, <lb/>
            Although on force and fraud they set their mind, <lb/>
            (For 'gainst Ulysses' goods, which they devour, <lb/>
            They stake their heads in hope he'll ne'er come home) <lb n="230"/>
            And you that many are, and have the power <lb/>
            To check them, sit as if you all were dumb. <lb/>
            And then rose up Leocritus and spake: <lb/>
            Mentor, said he, more busy much than wise, <lb/>
            That would about a supper quarrel make, <lb n="235"/>
            Ulysses, were he here, I'd not advise <lb/>
            To seek by force the suitors to remove. <lb/>
            For though he much be wish'd for by his wife, <lb/>
            She would not of his coming well approve, <lb/>
            But he the sooner be depriv'd of life. <lb n="240"/>
            And you, the people, now may hence retire; <lb/>
            Mentor and Alitherses will provide <lb/>
            A bark for what place ever he'll desire ; <lb/>
            And if at Ithaca he mean t' abide, <lb/>
            No news he will hear of him a great while. <lb n="245"/>
            But never t' Ithaca shall come again, <lb/>
            If he to Lacedæmon go, or Pyle. <lb/>
            This said, dismiss'd and scatter'd were the men ; <lb/>
            And to Ulysses' house the suitors went, <lb/>
            Telemachus to the sea-side, and pray'd: <lb n="250"/>
            O God, that gavest me commandement <lb/>
            To pass the seas, canst not now be obey'd, <lb/>
            I am both by the town and woo'rs delay'd. <lb/>
            Then in the form of Mentor, Pallas came, <pb n="320"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. II. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>
            goes secretly <lb/>
            to PIle. &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
            And standing by Telemachus, she said, <lb n="255"/>
            With such a voice as Mentor's seem'd the same, <lb/>
            If in you you retain the spirit brave <lb/>
            Your father had, to make his word his deed, <lb/>
            Then also the assurance I shall have, <lb/>
            To tell you in your voyage you shall speed ; <lb n="260"/>
            But if Ulysses* son you be not right, <lb/>
            For aught I know you may this labour spare; <lb/>
            Few sons exceed or reach their father's might, <lb/>
            But commonly inferior they are. <lb/>
            But since in you I see your father's wit, <lb n="265"/>
            I hope your voyage shall have good success; <lb/>
            Therefore, no more with th' woo'rs in council sit, <lb/>
            Expect from fools to have no more redress, <lb/>
            That see not their own end that is so nigh. <lb/>
            Nor shall you long be forced here to stay, <lb n="270"/>
            For with a good ship furnish you will I, <lb/>
            And with you will myself go all the way. <lb/>
            Meanwhile go you into your house again, <lb/>
            And put up store of wine, and of cold meat, <lb/>
            And good bread, which the marrow is of men; <lb n="275"/>
            I'll for you mariners together get. <lb/>
            In Ithaca are good ships, old and new, <lb/>
            Good store, of which I will go choose you one, <lb/>
            The best of all that come within my view, <lb/>
            And make it ready, that we may be gone. <lb n="280"/>
            This said, to th' house retum'd Telemachus. <lb/>
            The woo'rs in killing cattle were employ'd, <lb/>
            And straight unto him went Antinous, <lb/>
            And laughing, took him by the hand, and said, <lb/>
            Telemachus, bold and brave orator, <lb n="285"/>
            Fear from us neither evil word nor deed; <lb/>
            Eat and drink merrily as heretofore, <lb/>
            Well see you furnished with what you need, <lb/>
            Both ship and men, and see you soon convey'd <lb/>
            To Pyle, that of your father you may hear. <lb n="290"/>
            Telemachus then answered, and said, <lb/>
            Antinous, can I be merry here ? <lb/>
            D'ye think that yet too little was the wrong <lb/>
            The suitors did me, my estate to waste, <lb/>
            When I perceiv'd it not, as being young; <lb n="295"/>
            But since I grown am, and my childhood past, <lb/>
            And somewhat know, and more hear others say, <lb/>
            I'll do my best to bring them to their end, <lb/>
            Whether I go to Pyle, or here do stay. <lb/>
            And yet to go to Pyle I do intend, <lb n="300"/>
            And think my passage will not be in vain ; <lb/>
            For I go like a merchant, not a guest, <lb/>
            As if to me no ship did appertain. <lb/>
            It must be so; the suitors think it best. <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            This said, his hand from his hand he snatch'd out; <note type="margin"> LIB. II. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>

            And then the suitors that were in the court, <lb/>
            Some give him evil words, and others flout, <lb/>
            And one another with him made good sport. <lb/>
            He'll come from Pyle with succours, God knows what, <lb/>
            Said one, or Sparta, which shall on us fall, <lb n="310"/>
            Or poison bring from Ephir6; and that <lb/>
            Put in the temperer shall kill us all. <lb/>
            Who knows, then said another, if he go, <lb/>
            But he his father's fate may also have, <lb/>
            Whilst seeking him he wanders to and fro, <lb n="315"/>
            Which would to us no little trouble save; <lb/>
            His goods amongst us we should soon divide, <lb/>
            And to his mother leave his houses free, <lb/>
            And him she chooses to lie by her side. <lb/>
            Thus they derided him. Then down went he <lb n="320"/>
            Into a large and high-roof'd room, where lay, <lb/>
            In chests pack'd up, great store of cloth of gold, <lb/>
            And garments very many, rich and gay, <lb/>
            And many barrels of sweet wine and old, <lb/>
            Which for Ulysses were preserved there, <lb n="325"/>
            When he returned to his native soil. <lb/>
            In the same room many brass vessels were, <lb/>
            And many barrels of sweet smelling oil, <lb/>
            And double were the locks upon the door, <lb/>
            Whereof the nurse, Euryclea, had the key. <lb n="330"/>
            Telemachus call'd for her, and says to her, <lb/>
            Come, nurse, this night I am to go away. <lb/>
            Fill me of wine twelve pitchers of the best, <lb/>
            Next to that which you for my father save; <lb/>
            And fine flour, twenty measures at the least, <lb n="335"/>
            In good thick leather satchels let me have, <lb/>
            Quickly. For when my mother is a-bed, <lb/>
            To Lacedaemon and to Pyle I go, <lb/>
            That of my father, if alive or dead, <lb/>
            There any news be, I the same may know. <lb n="340"/>
            Euryclea then wept and sobb'd, and said, <lb/>
            Dear child, why will you go from hence so far <lb/>
            Alone ? Your mother you will make afraid, <lb/>
            Of whom so dearly you beloved are. <lb/>
            Your father far off is already dead, <lb n="345"/>
            And by the way the suitors seek to kill you, <lb/>
            And share your goods amongst them by the head. <lb/>
            I pray stay here, and do not go. Why will you ? <lb/>
            Nurse, said Telemachus, be of good cheer; <lb/>
            'Tis by the counsel of a God I go, <lb n="350"/>
            And I require you solemnly to swear <lb/>
            You'll not my going let my mother know. <lb/>
            Telemachus to the suitors went again, <lb/>
            And Pallas, in his likeness, to the town, <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <pb n="322"/>

            From house to house she goeth up and down, <lb/>
            And of Noemon borrowed a bark, <lb/>
            Who not unwillingly it to him lent. <lb/>
            And now the sun was down, the streets were dark, <lb/>
            And down to the sea-side the Goddess went, <lb n="360"/>
            And the good ship into the sea they haul, <lb/>
            And in it stow all that was needful fort; <lb/>
            The mariners were there together all, <lb/>
            And tied the ship at far end of the port. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the suitors merrily carouse, <lb n="365"/>
            And Pallas then, their fancies to confound, <lb/>
            From the sea-side went back into the house, <lb/>
            And from their hands the cups threw to the ground. <lb/>
            And with the love of sleep possess'd their eyes, <lb/>
            And made them nod, and let their eye-lids down; <lb n="370"/>
            And not long after from their seats they rise, <lb/>
            And for that night took lodging in the town. <lb/>
            Then, like to Mentor both in form and voice, <lb/>
            Telemachus she called out of doors. <lb/>
            Your men are ready at the port, she says, <lb n="375"/>
            There they expecting you sit with their oars. <lb/>
            Then out they went, and Pallas led the way, <lb/>
            And found the rowers ready on the beach. <lb/>
            Telemachus then said, Come back, I pray, <lb/>
            To th* house with me, our victual thence to fetch, <lb n="380"/>
            Which, well put up, I there have ready laid; <lb/>
            But nothing of it does my mother know, <lb/>
            Nor any else but I and one old maid. <lb/>
            Then with Telemachus to th' house they go, <lb/>
            And to the ships at once bring all away, <lb n="385"/>
            And stow it as Telemachus thought fit. <lb/>
            Pallas and he embark without delay, <lb/>
            And at the stern they both together sit. <lb/>
            And now the mariners their tackle ply; <lb/>
            First, in the midst they set the mast upright, <lb n="390"/>
            And it unto the ship with strong ropes tie, <lb/>
            And then their sails they hoist up to their height, <lb/>
            Which Pallas, with a lusty gale from west, <lb/>
            Kept full all night. The ship the sea then gores; <lb/>
            The water, swiftly running from her breast <lb n="395"/>
            By both her sides, wounded and broken roars. <lb/>
            And then unto the Gods they offer wine, <lb/>
            And to them all were praying for awhile, <lb/>
            But specially unto their guide divine; <lb/>
            Then sail'd all night, and were next mom at Pyle. <lb n="400"/>

            To hold the light up before Gods and men; <lb/>
            Telemachus, with all his company, <lb/>
            Unto the town of Pyle arrived then. <lb/>
            Then Nestor had a sacrifice in hand <lb n="5"/>
            To Neptune, and upon the sea-side stood, <lb/>
            And with him store of people on the sand. <lb/>
            Black bulls he eighty-one had to him vow'd: <lb/>
            Nine seats there were, five hundred to each seat, <lb/>
            And to the same nine bulls appointed were; <lb n="10"/>
            The entrails, broil d upon the coals they eat. <lb/>
            The thighs to Neptune burnt to ashes were. <lb/>
            The ship then came within the port to land, <lb/>
            And disembark'd, upon the shore they staid; <lb/>
            With furled sails the ship did by them stand. <lb n="15"/>
            Then Pallas to Telemachus thus said: <lb/>
            Telemachus, by no means bashful be; <lb/>
            For wherefore did you undertake this task, <lb/>
            But of your father to hear certainty ? <lb/>
            To Nestor then directly go, and ask <lb n="20"/>
            If of Ulysses anything he know. <lb/>
            Hell tell you truly. He's too wise to lie. <lb/>
            Mentor, said he, I'm young, and know not how <lb/>
            With one so old to answer and reply. <lb/>
            Telemachus, said Pallas, do not fear, <lb n="25"/>
            You'll somewhat prompted be by your own breast <lb/>
            (You never by the Gods neglected were), <lb/>
            The God that loves you will supply the rest. <lb/>
            Then up to Nestor they directly went, <lb/>
            And Pallas foremost. All about him there <lb n="30"/>
            They found upon the sacrifice intent. <lb/>
            His sons and lords, to hasten the good cheer, <lb/>
            Some broaching, and some roasting were of meat, <lb/>
            And presently about the strangers come, <lb/>
            And with their hands salute them, and entreat <lb n="35"/>
            To sit. And then Pisistratus went to'em, <lb/>
            Saluted them, and took them both by th' hands, <lb/>
            And for them (since there was no empty seat) <lb/>
            Laid sheepskins, with the wool upon the sands; <lb/>
            And of the entrails gave them part to eat, <lb n="40"/>
            And to her hand held up a cup of wine. <lb/>
            To Neptune, said he, offer up your vow, <lb/>
            For he expressly is the pow'r divine, <lb/>

            Nine years we plots contriv'd to take the town, <lb/>
            Which Jove made prosperous with much ado. <lb n="110"/>
            Ulysses had for plotting the renown, <lb/>
            For none compared himself your father to: <lb/>
            If it be true you are Ulysses' son, <lb/>
            And I confess, hearing you speak your mind, <lb/>
             And steadfastly your person looking on, <lb n="115"/>
            Much respect for you in myself I find. <lb/>
            While we together were at Troy, we never <lb/>
            In council or assembly disagreed, <lb/>
            But what was for the Argives' good, we ever <lb/>
            Endeavoured what we could to get decreed. <lb n="120"/>
            But when of Troy we had destroyed the town, <lb/>
            And back unto our ships again were come, <lb/>
            Then Jove upon the Greeks began to frown, <lb/>
            Intending to them ill returning home, <lb/>
            For few there were amongst them just or wise, <lb n="125"/>
            But on themselves they drew down their own fate, <lb/>
            Which made the Goddess Pallas to devise <lb/>
            To set the two Atrides at debate. <lb/>
            Then of the people they a meeting call <lb/>
            At almost sunset, and the people came <lb n="130"/>
            (Having their heads with wine disordered all) <lb/>
            Th' Atrides told them why they call'd the same, <lb/>
            Where Menelaus votes to cross the seas, <lb/>
            And each man to his country to repass. <lb/>
            But this advice his brother did not please, <lb n="135"/>
            To stay there yet awhile his counsel was, <lb/>
            And first a hecatomb to sacrifice, <lb/>
            The Goddess Pallas' anger to appease. <lb/>
            But Agamemnon therein was not wise, <lb/>
            lIen cannot change the will o' th' Gods with ease. <lb n="140"/>
            While they contending were with words unmeet, <lb/>
            One part arose, resolv'd to stay all night, <lb/>
            And in the morn to go aboard the fleet, <lb/>
            And each one tow'rds his home to take his flight. <pb n="326"/>

            Knowing that Jove to the Greeks evil meant; <lb/>
            So did the son of Tideus, Diomed. <lb/>
            At Lesbos to us Menelaus came, <lb/>
            Where we, which way to go, consulting staid, <lb/>
            Chius within, or else without the same, <lb n="155"/>

            That we in safety be the sooner might; <lb/>
            And sent us therewithal a lusty gale, <lb/>
            Which brought us to Gerestus when 'twas night, <lb n="160"/>
            And there to Neptune we burnt many thighs. <lb/>
            On the fourth day the ships of Diomed <lb/>
            To Argos came. The same wind staid i' th' skies <lb/>
            Till I at Pyle was safe delivered. <lb/>
            So came I home, sweet child, and cannot tell <lb n="165"/>
            Which of the Greeks came safe home, and which not. <lb/>
            But what has since been told me I know well, <lb/>
            And so far as is reason, you shall know't. <lb/>
            The Myrmidons, they say, came safely home, <lb/>
            Conducted by stout Neoptolemus. <lb n="170"/>
            And Philoctetes very well did come <lb/>
            Unto his father's house, Pallantius. <lb/>
            Idomeneus to Crete brought all his men <lb/>
            That were not slain at Ilium in fight. <lb/>
            How Agamemnon, when come home again, <lb n="175"/>
            Was butchered, I need not to recite; <lb/>
            Nor how he came, nor of Ægistus' plot, <lb/>
            Nor yet how bitterly he smarted for't. <lb/>
            'Tis good, you see, to have a son begot, <lb/>
            That can revenge his father in that sort. <lb n="180"/>
            And you, my friend, that tall are and well made, <lb/>
            Be valiant, and get 'mongst men good fame. <lb/>
            Telemachus then answered, and said: <lb/>
            O Nestor, but my case is not the same. <lb/>
            Sharp the revenge was of Atildes' son, <lb n="185"/>
            And far and wide will matter be for songs, <lb/>
            But from the Gods such power I have none, <lb/>

            O friend, said Nestor, since I have been told <lb/>

            Without your leave, do with your house make bold, <lb/>

            For if of you Pallas as careful were, <lb/>
            As carefully she did your father guide <lb/>
            At Troy (a God to man ne'er did appear <lb/>
            So plainly as she there stood by his side.) <lb/>
            If Pallas were so kind to you, you'd see <lb n="205"/>
            The suitors quickly would forget to woo. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus, 'Twill never be, <lb/>
            Although the Gods should give consent thereto. <lb/>
            Telemachus, said Pallas, what a word <lb/>
            Have you let fall ? A man may be with ease, <lb n="210"/>
            Though far off, to his native soil restor'd <lb/>
            By any of the Gods, if so he please. <lb/>
            And I at home would rather lose my life <lb/>
            Fighting than sitting, as Atrides died, <lb/>
            Slain by Ægistus and his own bad wife, <lb n="215"/>
            Basely by them in whom he did confide. <lb/>
            And yet the Gods unable are to save <lb/>
            A man from death, although he be a friend, <lb/>
            Whose end the cruel Fates determin'd have. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus, Let's make an end <lb n="220"/>
            Of this discourse. Ulysses' latest day <lb/>
            Determin'd by the Gods already is, <lb/>
            And I to Nestor somewhat else will say; <lb/>
            For three men's ages do but equal his. <lb/>
            O Nestor, I would fain informed be <lb n="225"/>
            How Agamemnon was of life deprived. <lb/>
            And Menelaus, where meanwhile was he ? <lb/>
            And how Ægistus had the plot contriv'd. <lb/>
            Was it that Menelaus too long stay'd, <lb/>
            Ægistus ventur'd on a better wight ? <lb n="230"/>
            I'll tell you all the truth, then Nestor said, <lb/>
            And yet what you yourself have guess'd is right. <lb/>
            For why, if Menelaus coming home <lb/>
            JEgistus in the house alive had found, <lb/>
            He never had at Argos had a tomb, <lb n="235"/>
            But eaten been by dogs above the ground, <lb/>
            And fowls of prey. Nor had he had the pity <lb/>
            Of the Argive women, nor lamented been, <lb/>
            But lain had i' th' fields far from the city. <lb/>
            For why, a viler act was never seen. <lb n="240"/>
            For when at Troy we ended had the strife, <lb/>
            Long time it was before we came away; <lb/>
            Then siege laid he to Agamemnon's wife, <lb/>
            And secretly hidden in Argos lay, <pb n="328"/>

            And left him for a booty to the kites. <lb n="250"/>
            And then unto Ægistus she did yield, <lb/>
            And richly were performed the wedding rites. <lb/>
            Then on the altars many thighs they burn, <lb/>
            And with them rich men's baubles, and gold stuff, <lb/>
            For why, for so unhop'd-for a good turn, <lb n="255"/>
            They thought they could not thank the Gods enough. <lb/>
            Now coming Menelaus was and I, <lb/>
            And were as far come as to Sunium, <lb/>

            The best that in a storm ere ship brought home, <lb n="260"/>
            And hindrance of his coming this was some <lb/>
            To bury him. But when he put to sea, <lb/>
            And was with all his ships in safety come <lb/>
            Under the windy mountain of Males, <lb/>
            Then an ill passage for them Jove provided; <lb n="265"/>
            The wind then whistled, and the water danced, <lb/>
            And into two parts was the fleet divided; <lb/>
            And one part to the coast of Crete advanced, <lb/>
            Where Cydons dwell, near Jardan river's mouth. <lb/>
            There in the sea standeth a stone upright, <lb n="270"/>
            That breaks the water when it rolls from south, <lb/>
            So that it comes to Phæstus without might; <lb/>
            And there the men came in and sav'd their lives, <lb/>
            But all the ships upon the rock were split. <lb/>
            The other part the wind to Egypt drives <lb n="275"/>
            With Menelaus. Five ships were in it. <lb/>
            Whilst Menelaus did in Egypt stay, <lb/>
            And visit princes and their gifts receiv'd; <lb/>
            Ægistus made the Argives him obey, <lb/>
            And Agamemnon of his life bereav'd; <lb n="280"/>
            And sev'n years in Mycene reigned he. <lb/>
            But then Orestes came, whom they not knew, <lb/>
            From Athens to them unexpectedly, <lb/>
            And there the slayer of his father slew, <lb/>
            And feasted th' Argives at the funeral <lb n="285"/>
            Of him and her. That very day did come <lb/>
            King Menelaus, his ships laden all, <lb/>
            From Egypt, with his costly presents home. <lb/>
            And you, my friend, take heed you do not stay <lb/>

            This said, the sun was down, and dark the sky. <lb/>
            Nestor, said Pallas, you before us lay <lb/>
            That to which we have nothing to reply. <lb/>
            Now slit the tongues, and let wine temper'd be, <lb n="305"/>
            That we may offer to th' immortals all; <lb/>

            So Pallas said, and they to offering fall <lb/>

            And young men to them all brought temper'd wine. <lb n="310"/>
            The tongues lay on the fire, each one upstands <lb/>
            And offers wine unto the powers divine. <lb/>
            And when the offering was at an end, <lb/>
            Telemachus and Pallas were about <lb/>
            To go aboard, and there the night to spend. <lb n="315"/>
            But Nestor on the other side cried out, <lb/>
            The Gods forbid that you should lie aboard, <lb/>
            As if I were a man so rude or poor <lb/>
            As not good bedding for a friend t' afford. <lb/>

            And many sons alive with me at home, <lb/>
            That able are my friends to entertain, <lb/>
            And 'tis Ulysses' son that's to me come, <lb/>
            Surely this night he shall with me remain. <lb/>
            O Nestor, then said Pallas, that is right, <lb n="325"/>
            And at your house to lodge for him 'tis best. <lb/>
            But at the ship I needs must lie this night, <lb/>
            His purpose to make known to all the rest. <lb/>
            Amongst them there no old man is but I, <lb/>
            The company t' encourage that expect <lb n="330"/>
            Telemachus. Not with authority, <lb/>
            But my advice they'll follow for respect. <lb/>
            The next day with the Caucons I must be, <lb/>

            And then that he may Menelaus see, <lb n="335"/>
            With strong swift horses on his way him set. <lb/>
            This said, the Goddess Pallas went away, <lb/>
            In likeness of an eagle to the skies. <lb/>
            The people star'd, and knew not what to say, <lb/>

            And Nestor to his house then led them all, <lb/>
            Both sons and sons-in-law, and being there, <lb/>
            They sat on chairs and couches in the hall; <lb n="355"/>

            And when the wine and water mixed were, <lb/>
            Then Nestor pray'd and offered. And when <lb n="360"/>
            The off'rings to the Goddess ended were, <lb/>
            The rest unto their lodgings went away. <lb/>
            Telemachus by Nestor stay'd was there, <lb/>
            And in a soft and costly bed he lay; <lb/>
            And near unto him lay Pisistratus, <lb n="365"/>
            Who of the sons of Nestor was the last. <lb/>
            And Nestor in the inmost part of th' house, <lb/>
            Where, by the queen his wife, his bed was plac'd. <lb/>
            Soon as Aurora did the day restore, <lb/>
            The old knight Nestor rose up from his bed, <lb n="370"/>
            And sat upon the bench before the door, <lb/>
            Of marble white and smooth that glistened. <lb/>
            His father used to sit there before, <lb/>
            King Neleus, but that since he was dead, <lb/>
            And that King Nestor now the sceptre bore, <lb n="375"/>

            One to Telemachus his ship quickly, <lb/>
            And bid his mates, save two, all hither come; <lb/>
            Another bid the gilder hither come, <lb/>
            To gild the sacred heifer's horns with speed; <lb n="390"/>
            The rest stay here to look to things at home, <lb/>
            That all things may be ready that we need, <lb/>
            Seats, dry wood, and fair water. So said he, <lb/>
            Then busy were they all. The heifer came, <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            And all Telemachus his company. <note type="margin"> LID. III. </note><note type="margin"> Nestor enter­ <lb/>

            The glider came, Laerces was his name, <lb/>
            And every tool that to his art belongs, <lb/>

            His anvil, and his hammer, and his tongs. <lb/>
            And Pallas also now amongst them stands. <lb n="400"/>
            Then fell the man to work on Nestor's gold, <lb/>
            And so elaborate it was when done, <lb/>
            That it might please the Goddess to behold. <lb/>
            Then came in Stratius and Echephron, <lb/>
            And by the horns they led the heifer in. <lb n="405"/>
            The basin and the ewer, and barley white, <lb/>

            Then Nestor pray'd, and from the heifer's head <lb/>
            Cut off some hair, and into th' fire it threw. <lb n="410"/>
            Then prayed the rest; and barley sprinkled <lb/>
            Upon the fire, and Thrasymed then slew <lb/>
            The heifer with his axe, and cut in twain <lb/>
            The tendons of the neck, and down she fell; <lb/>
            And Nestor's wife and daughters shout amain <lb n="415"/>
            To see the sacred act performed well. <lb/>
            Pisistratus then cuts the victim's throat, <lb/>
            And up they held it to let out the blood <lb/>
            Into a pail which Perseus thither brought, <lb/>
            And to that purpose ready with it stood. <lb n="420"/>
            The life together with the blood outflies. <lb/>
            Then from the body they the bowels draw, <lb/>
            And next cut off the shoulders and the thighs, <lb/>
            As is of sacrifice the ritual law; <lb/>
            And them slit into two parts they display, <lb n="425"/>
            And cover them all over with sweet fat, <lb/>
            Shoulder on shoulder, thigh on thigh they lay, <lb/>
            And Nestor on the altar burneth that; <lb/>
            And with it on the fire black wine he poured. <lb/>
            By him a spit was ready with five points. <lb n="430"/>
            The fire the thighs, the men th' entrails devoured, <lb/>
            The rest divided was in smaller joints, <lb/>
            To roast on spits. Telemachus the while <lb/>
            Into the bath retired, and was there <lb/>
            Well bathed, and anointed with sweet oil <lb n="435"/>
            By Polycaste, Nestor's daughter dear, <lb/>
            And in a robe and coat clad gloriously, <lb/>
            And came, as if no mortal he had been, <lb/>
            Into the hall, and sat down Nestor by. <lb/>
            The meat now ready straightway was brought in. <lb n="440"/>
            Then in the young men came to fill them wine. <lb/>
            When they with flesh and wine were satisfied, <lb/>
            Then to his sons said Nestor, Children mine, <lb/>
            The horses to the coach see quickly tied. <pb n="332"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note> <lb/>
            Away they go, and to the coach they set <lb n="445"/>
            The horses swift; and in it bread and wine <lb/>
            A maid laid in, and with it choicest meat, <lb/>
            Which none but god-fed kings eat when they dine. <lb/>
            Up to the seat then went Telemachus <lb/>
            (The seat was large and capable of two) <lb n="450"/>
            And after him went up Pisistratus, <lb/>
            And whip and reins he took his hands into. <lb/>
            Touch'd with the whip, the horses take the way, <lb/>
            And all the day long made their harness shake. <lb/>
            The sun went down, dark were the streets. Then they <lb n="455"/>
            At Pherme were. And there their rest they take. <lb/>
            There Diodes, Orsilochus his son, <lb/>
            Son of Alphæus them did entertain, <lb/>
            And with fair gifts presented them each one. <lb/>
            But soon as morning did appear again, <lb n="460"/>
            Their horses to the coach again they tie, <lb/>
            And from the porch drive them into the way, <lb/>
            Touched with the whip again away they fly. <lb/>
            The sun now down, and ended was the day.</p>

            Proteus. </note> AND then to Lacedæmon come were they, <lb/>
            And drove up to the house of Menelaus. <lb/>
            At home they found him, for there on that day <lb/>
            A double wedding celebrated was. <lb/>
            One of his daughters, fair Hermione, <lb n="5"/>
            Whom he before at Troy had promised <lb/>
            Of Neoptolemus the wife should be, <lb/>
            And on this day the same accomplished, <lb/>
            And her he sent unto the Myrmidons, <lb/>
            Where reigned he. To Pthia she was brought. <lb n="10"/>
            And then the second wedding was his son's, <lb/>
            Whom on a bond-woman he had begot, <lb/>
            And Megapenthes nam'd (for Helen's bed <lb/>

            And he Alector's daughter married, <lb n="15"/>
            Of Lacedæmon citizen was he. <lb/>
            And now they merry sat that bidden were, <lb/>
            Making good cheer, and hearing voice and fiddle, <lb/>
            And wond'ring at two tumblers that were there, <lb/>

            Meanwhile by th' horses, th' utter gate without, <lb/>
            Telemachus stood and Pisistratus. <lb/>
            Then Eteoneus by chance came out, <lb/>
            A careful servant of Menelaus. <lb/>
            And, having seen them, in he went again, <lb n="25"/>
            And being near to where his master sate, <lb/>
            O king, said he, there are without two men, <lb/>
            Like great mens sons, with their coach at the gate; <lb/>
            Shall I take out their horses, or shall I <lb/>
            Tell them where they may lodged be elsewhere ? <lb n="30"/>
            At this, Atrides, grieved, made reply: <lb/>
            Eteoneus, sure once you wiser were; <lb/>
            Have we not oft by strangers heretofore, <lb/>
            In our necessity relieved been ? <lb/>
            And I pray God it may be so no more. <lb n="35"/>
            Go, loose the horses, and the men bring in. <lb/>
            This said, he went again, with servants more, <lb/>
            Takes out the horses, ties them to the mangers, <lb/>
            And throws before them provender good store; <lb/>
            Sets up the coach, and then brings in the strangers, <lb n="40"/>
            Who at the beauty of the house amazed, <lb/>
            (For bright it shined as the moon or sun). <lb/>
            And when they had sufficiently gazed, <lb/>
            To where the bathing-room was, walked on. <lb/>
            After they were well washed and anointed, <lb n="45"/>
            And clothed with soft nappy cloak and coat, <lb/>
            That they should near him sit the king appointed, <lb/>
            And near unto his throne their chairs were brought. <lb/>
            A maid the golden bason and the ewer <lb/>
            To wash their hands, over a cauldron brings. <lb n="50"/>
            (The cauldron also was of silver pure); <lb/>
            Another on the table laid good things, <lb/>
            Another bread. The carver also cuts <lb/>
            Of every sort of meat the choicest bits, <lb/>
            And them on trenchers on the table puts. <lb n="55"/>
            And Menelaus, pointing to it, sits, <lb/>
            And heartily invites them to fall to. <lb/>
            Eat now, said he, we shall have time enough <lb/>
            When you have supp'd, to ask you where and who ? <lb/>
            Your ancestors are not obscure I know, <lb n="60"/>
            Such children are not got by wretched men. <lb/>
            And as he spake he took from his own mess <lb/>
            As much as both his hands could comprehend <lb/>
            Of good chine-beef, and gave it to these guests, <lb/>
            And then they laid their hands upon their meat. <lb n="65"/>
            But when their hunger and their thirst was gone, <lb/>
            Telemachus, that near sat to his seat, <lb/>
            Whispered Pisistratus, You, Nestor's son, <lb/>
            Do you not mark the splendour in this house, <pb n="334"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain­ <lb/>

            by Menelaus, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
            Of brass, gold, amber, silver, ivory ? <lb n="70"/>
            Such sure the house is of Olympius, <lb/>
            So many and so glorious things I see. <lb/>
            But Menelaus heard him. Let, said he, <lb/>
            No mortal man with Jupiter compare; <lb/>
            His house decays not, nor goods wasted be. <lb n="75"/>
            What men compare with me I do not care; <lb/>
            For why, my goods I paid for very dear, <lb/>
            With pain and peril in my coming home, <lb/>
            And wand'ring up and down at sea eight year, <lb/>
            Before I could into my country come. <lb n="80"/>
            I was in Cyprus and Phœnicia, <lb/>
            Came to the Cydons and Erembians, <lb/>
            To Egypt, and to Ethiopia, <lb/>
            And to the fertile ground o' th' Libyans, <lb/>
            Where ev'ry year the sheep three times do breed, <lb n="85"/>
            And all the lambs fall homed from the dam; <lb/>
            Nor master nor his man there stands in need <lb/>
            Of cheese or milk, or tender flesh of lamb. <lb/>
            While I my goods amongst them wand'ring got, <lb/>
            I lost my brother, by his wife betrayed, <lb n="90"/>
            And therefore in my riches glory not. <lb/>
            And all this to you have your fathers said. <lb/>
            Absent, I lost my house, and much rich stuff; <lb/>
            Had I my fellows sav'd I led to Troy, <lb/>
            I'd been content with the third part thereof. <lb n="95"/>
            So, all to all, I've little cause of joy: <lb/>
            For all my friends at Troy lost griev'd was I, <lb/>
            And sometimes wept, yet sometimes also not, <lb/>
            For quick of tears is the satiety. <lb/>
            But one there is, when he is in my thought, <lb n="100"/>
            I neither food nor sleep desire to take; <lb/>
            For all the while we were besieging Troy, <lb/>
            None suffer'd so much for the Argives' sake <lb/>
            As did Ulysses, nor so oft did pray. <lb/>
            And more, perhaps, he is to suffer yet; <lb n="105"/>
            Long stays he, and whether alive or dead <lb/>
            He be, I can from no man notice get, <lb/>
            Nor from my sorrow be delivered. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, as for a son of life bereft, <lb/>
            Laertes weeps; so does Penelope. <lb n="110"/>
            Telemachus, whom young Ulysses left, <lb/>
            Spends his best age in pain and misery. <lb/>
            This said, Telemachus before his eyes <lb/>
            Held up his purple robe, the tears to hide, <lb/>
            Drawn from him by his father's miseries. <lb n="115"/>
            And Menelaus, when he that espied, <lb/>
            Considered whether best it were or no <lb/>
            To tell him first what he had heard or seen <lb/>
            About his father, or what he would know <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            To let him ask. But Helen then came in, <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain­ <lb/>

            by Menelaus, &amp;c. </note> <lb n="120"/>
            Like to Diana in great majesty. <lb/>
            Adreste came in with her, with a chair; <lb/>
            Alcippe a soft carpet layed nigh; <lb/>
            Her basket brought in was by Phylo fair. <lb/>
            At Thebes, in Egypt, it was given her <lb n="125"/>
            By Polybus his wife, Alcandre, when <lb/>
            King Menelaus travelling was there; <lb/>
            And Polybus gave to him talents ten <lb/>
            Of gold, and lavers two of silver fine, <lb/>
            And two three-footed cauldrons of good brass. <lb n="130"/>
            Then by Alcandre t' Helena divine, <lb/>
            A silver-brim gilt basket given was, <lb/>
            With fine and curiously-spun thread press'd full, <lb/>
            With distaff on it, more thread yet to spin, <lb/>
            Ready invested with soft purple wool. <lb n="135"/>
            This was the basket Phylo then brought in. <lb/>
            Then Helen sat, and by her husband told <lb/>
            What hitherto had pass'd: I know, said she, <lb/>
            King Menelaus, now I them behold, <lb/>
            The guests that are come to you, who they be. <lb n="140"/>
            But shall I tell you what I think, or no ? <lb/>
            Ill tell you true. I never yet saw one <lb/>
            So like another, as this man is to <lb/>
            Telemachus, Ulysses' only son, <lb/>
            Whom, when with other Greeks to Ilium <lb n="145"/>
            He went, to fetch away this monkey, me, <lb/>
            By bloody war, he left a child at home. <lb/>
            Then Menelaus spake: Since you, said he, <lb/>
            Have put it in my mind, I think so too. <lb/>
            His eyes, his feet, his hands, his head, his hair, <lb n="150"/>
            Are like Ulysses', who I'd tell now you <lb/>
            What misery for me he suffer'd there, <lb/>
            But that it makes him weep, and hide his eyes. <lb/>
            Then to Atrides said Pisistratus, <lb/>
            The truth to you, 0 king, I'll not disguise; <lb n="155"/>
            This is Ulysses' son, Telemachus, <lb/>
            But jealous of his tongue, and fearful is, <lb/>
            Before a man experienc'd and wise, <lb/>
            Lest he should say something at first amiss, <lb/>
            And lay his weakness open to your eyes. <lb n="160"/>
            Nestor sent me along with him for guide, <lb/>
            Because he so much longed you to see, <lb/>
            And hear what of his father was betide, <lb/>
            And by you holpen and instructed be. <lb/>
            Unhappy is the child whose father's gone, <lb n="165"/>
            And this is now Telemachus his case; <lb/>
            For of Ulysses news he can hear none, <lb/>
            Who to defend him left none in his place. <lb/>
            How, how! then said Atrides, I have here <pb n="336"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain. <lb/>
            ment at Sparta <lb/>

            The son of one that I esteemed most, <lb n="170"/>
            And for my sake suffer'd and did more there <lb/>
            Than any other in the Argive host; <lb/>
            To whom I meant, had we come safely home, <lb/>
            To shew more kindness than to any one <lb/>
            Of all the Greeks? As soon as we were come, <lb n="175"/>
            I had to Argos brought him and his son, <lb/>
            Built them a city, made both but one state, <lb/>
            And laid the cities round about us waste; <lb/>
            And often there with one another sate, <lb/>
            And only death our friendship had displaced. <lb n="180"/>
            But by the Gods these thoughts are rendered vain ; <lb/>
            They have Ulysses from his country kept. <lb/>
            This said, they could from tears no more abstain. <lb/>
            Jove's daughter, Argive Helena, then wept, <lb/>
            And Menelaus and Telemachus; <lb n="185"/>
            Nor could Pisistratus his tears restrain, <lb/>
            But on his brother thought, Antilochus, <lb/>
            That by the fair Aurora's son was slain, <lb/>
            And him rememb'ring, to Atrides spake: <lb/>
            Atrides, oft have I heard Nestor tell, <lb n="190"/>
            (As oft as we did of you mention make) <lb/>
            That you 'mongst men in wisdom do excel. <lb/>
            I pray you think not I take any pleasure <lb/>
            To act at supper-time the rites of mourning; <lb/>
            For that another time we shall have leisure, <lb n="195"/>
            Unless we look no more to see the morning. <lb/>
            Not that I weeping for the dead condemn, <lb/>
            Or cutting off of hair. It is a debt <lb/>
            We owe to our dead friends. And one of them <lb/>
            My brother is, whom I cannot forget. <lb n="200"/>
            He was not of the Greeks the meanest man ; <lb/>
            For swift he was of foot, and bold in fight, <lb/>
            (Which you than I much better witness can) <lb/>
            To kill his foe in battle or in flight. <lb/>
            Dear friend, Atrides answer'd, you have said <lb n="205"/>
            What might an older man have well beseemed <lb/>
            To say and do; and Nestor's stock bewray'd, <lb/>
            Whose wisdom is of all men's most esteemed. <lb/>
            'Tis easy to discern the race of one <lb/>
            To whom a happy life the Gods shall grant, <lb n="210"/>
            As unto noble Nestor they have done, <lb/>
            Long life, and sons discreet and valiant. <lb/>
            Let's put off for the present tales of sorrow, <lb/>
            And to our meat again our minds apply. <lb/>
            Bring water for our hands. Betimes to-morrow <lb n="215"/>
            Well talk of this, Telemachus and I. <lb/>
            This said, Asphalion came in with water. <lb/>
            They wash'd, and on the meat their hands they laid; <lb/>
            But in the meantime Helena, Jove's daughter, <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            An antidote into the wine convey'd, <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain. <lb/>
            ment at Sparta <lb/>
            by Menelaus,&amp;c. </note> <lb n="220"/>
            An antidote that virtue had to keep <lb/>
            The man that drank it mixed with his wine, <lb/>
            So as for all that day he should not weep, <lb/>
            Nor for whatever should befall him whine ; <lb/>
            No, though his father or his mother died, <lb n="225"/>
            Or friend or brother slain were in his sight <lb/>
            By cruel enemies that them envied. <lb/>
            Such was of Helen's medicine the might, <lb/>
            Which t' her in Egypt Thon's wife given had, <lb/>
            Where many drugs of wondrous virtue grow, <lb n="230"/>
            Some here, some there, and some good, and some bad, <lb/>
            For all men there the art of physic know ; <lb/>
            For why, from Paean sprung are all those men. <lb/>
            The antidote put in, she bad the wine <lb/>
            Be borne about. And then she said again: <lb n="235"/>
            King Menelaus, offspring of Gods divine, <lb/>
            Descended from the Gods are also these; <lb/>
            And Jove good fortune gives sometimes to one, <lb/>
            And sometimes to another, as he please, <lb/>
            For he can do whatever can be done. <lb n="240"/>
            Feast then, and merrily together sit, <lb/>
            And please yourselves with stories. I'll tell one, <lb/>
            And which as to the time is not unfit, <lb/>
            Of what at Troy was by Ulysses done. <lb/>
            I will not tell you all the pranks he play'd, <lb n="245"/>
            But only how he came into the town, <lb/>
            With canvas mantle o'er his shoulders laid, <lb/>
            Bloody with stripes, from no hand but his own; <lb/>
            And by the name of Dectes there did pass, <lb/>
            And as a slave went freely up and down, <lb n="250"/>
            When such man in the fleet at all none was, <lb/>
            And was to every one but me unknown. <lb/>
            I questioned him, and he at first was shy; <lb/>
            But when I bath'd him and anointed had, <lb/>
            And cloth'd, and ta'en an oath of secresy, <lb n="255"/>
            He told me what design the Argives had. <lb/>
            Then, having gotten much intelligence, <lb/>
            And many of the Trojan people slain, <lb/>
            He safely to the fleet departed thence, <lb/>
            Leaving their wives lamenting there in vain. <lb n="260"/>
            But I was glad; for changed had my mind, <lb/>
            And griev'd, by Venus t' have been made so mad, <lb/>
            To leave my child Hermione behind, <lb/>
            And my good husband, when no cause I had. <lb/>
            Then Menelaus said: Your story, wife, <lb n="265"/>
            Is to the purpose. Countries I have seen <lb/>
            Many; and oft with heroes, in my life, <lb/>
            In councils sitten ; but was never in <lb/>
            The place where any like Ulysses sat. <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <pb n="338"/>

            I' th' wooden horse I'll tell you what he did, <lb n="270"/>
            (No man did ever such a thing as that); <lb/>
            The princes of the army there lay hid, <lb/>
            Death and destruction bearing into Troy. <lb/>
            Some demon then, that was no friend to us, <lb/>
            Made you come forth, our council to destroy, <lb n="275"/>
            And with you also came Deiphobus. <lb/>
            And thrice about the wooden horse you went, <lb/>
            And called to us ev'ry man by name, <lb/>
            And our wives' voices so did represent, <lb/>
            As not to be discerned from the same. <lb n="280"/>
            I' th' midst Ulysses, Diomed, and I, <lb/>
            Heard well your call as we together sat, <lb/>
            And ready were to go forth, or reply ; <lb/>
            But by Ulysses hinderd were of that. <lb/>
            But Anticlus had answer'd certainly, <lb n="285"/>
            Had not Ulysses, when he heard her call, <lb/>
            Laid hand upon his mouth immediately, <lb/>
            And held till you were gone. That sav'd us all. <lb/>
            'Twas much, then said Telemachus, but this <lb/>
            Was not enough the man alive to keep, <lb n="290"/>
            Though made of steel, whose end determin'd is; <lb/>
            But now, 0 king, the time is come for sleep. <lb/>
            Then Helen to her women order gave <lb/>
            To see their beds made ready, and lay on <lb/>
            Fair purple rugs, and under them to have <lb n="295"/>
            Soft blankets, and fine coverlids upon, <lb/>
            Before the house, in chamber o'er the gate. <lb/>
            But in the inmost of the palace lay <lb/>
            King Menelaus with his royal mate, <lb/>
            And rose again together with the day. <lb n="300"/>
            And when he had himself attir'd and shod, <lb/>
            And hung his trusty sword had by his side, <lb/>
            Out of his chamber came he like a God, <lb/>
            And to Telemachus himself applied. <lb/>
            Telemachus, said he, what bringeth you <lb n="305"/>
            To Lacedæmon, o'er the sea so wide ? <lb/>
            Public or private bus'ness ? Tell me true. <lb/>
            Telemachus unto him then replied: <lb/>
            To you, King Menelaus, I am come <lb/>
            T' enquire what of my father is betide. <lb n="310"/>
            My house is full of enemies at home, <lb/>
            That me consume; and there resolve t' abide. <lb/>
            I' th' fields they fruitless make my husbandry; <lb/>
            My stock they eat; and would my mother wed. <lb/>
            This made me come to know the certainty, <lb n="315"/>
            Whether my father be alive or dead; <lb/>
            Whether you saw him after he left Troy <lb/>
            Wand'ring abroad (for he was born to woe), <lb/>
            Or of him anything heard others say, <lb/>

            It in the Argive host he useful were, <lb/>
            In council or in battle, when need was, <lb/>
            Tell me the truth, be't never so severe. <lb/>
            To this, much grieved, answer'd Menelaus. <lb/>
            Yes, yes, said he, there many enter'd be <lb n="325"/>
            Into a strong man's house while he's away, <lb/>
            And are in hope to dwell there constantly, <lb/>
            Though not so valiant as he be they. <lb/>
            As when a stag and hind entering the den <lb/>
            Of th' absent lion, lulls his whelps with tales <lb n="330"/>
            Of hills and dales, the lion comes again, <lb/>
            And tears them into pieces with his nails; <lb/>
            So shall Ulysses all those suitors slay. <lb/>
            O that the Gods, Apollo, Pallas, Jove, <lb/>
            Amongst the suitors let him would one day, <lb n="335"/>
            Such as when with Philomelid he strove, <lb/>
            And threw him flat, and made the Argives glad. <lb/>
            If such as then Ulysses should be there, <lb/>
            Short would their lives be, and their wedding bad. <lb/>
            But to the matter whereof you would hear, <lb n="340"/>
            I can say nothing upon certainty, <lb/>
            And my own knowledge, but what I was told <lb/>
            By Proteus. And tell I will no lie, <lb/>
            Nor anything of what he said withhold. <lb/>
            Before the land of Egypt Pharos lies, <lb n="345"/>
            An island, and therein a haven good <lb/>
            Against whatever wind shall chance to rise; <lb/>
            And ready to depart, my ships there stood; <lb/>
            A day's sail distant stands it in the main; <lb/>
            But 'cause the hecatomb I offer'd not, <lb n="350"/>
            The Gods a long time did me there detain, <lb/>
            For they are angry when they are forgot. <lb/>
            There twenty days together we were pent, <lb/>
            Though fain we would have put again to sea; <lb/>
            And our provision had quite been spent, <lb n="355"/>
            But that I then met with Idothoë. <lb/>
            She daughter is of Proteus, and he <lb/>
            A herdsman old of Neptune is, and has <lb/>
            The charge his sea-calves kept and fed to see. <lb/>
            His daughter met me when alone I was ; <lb n="360"/>
            My company, their dinner to provide, <lb/>
            With angle rods were fishing on the strand. <lb/>
            Then said she to me, standing by my side, <lb/>
            Why stay you here, and nothing take in hand <lb/>
            To help yourself, as if a child you were, <lb n="365"/>
            Or negligent, or loved misery, <lb/>
            Suff'ring yourself to be so long pent here ? <lb/>
            Or can you no way find to be set free ? <lb/>
            What God you be soever, answer'd I, <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain­ <lb/>

            Thus much unto you I must plainly say, <lb n="370"/>
            That in this isle I stay unwillingly, <lb/>
            And for my freedom to the Gods I pray. <lb/>
            But tell me you (for Gods know everything) <lb/>
            What God is it that to this place me tied, <lb/>
            And what it is that must me from it bring ? <lb n="375"/>
            I'll tell you then, said she, and nothing hide. <lb/>
            By an old Sea-God haunted is this isle, <lb/>
            Call'd Proteus, that nothing says untrue, <lb/>
            Servant to Neptune, whom if by some wile <lb/>
            You could but catch and hold, he'd answer you <lb n="380"/>
            To all you ask, and he my father is. <lb/>
            He'll tell you how to get your ships to sea, <lb/>
            And how you shall get home. He knows all this. <lb/>
            And what's there done. So said Idothoë. <lb/>
            But how, said I, is't possible for man <lb n="385"/>
            Upon a God immortal to lay hold, <lb/>
            When he, foreseeing it, avoid it can, <lb/>
            If how to do't he be not by you told ? <lb/>
            Ill tell you, said she, how it may be done. <lb/>
            Hidden in the curls of the sea each day <lb n="390"/>
            Brought in by Zephyrus, he lands at noon, <lb/>
            And on the sand himself to sleep will lay; <lb/>
            About him will his footless sea-calves lie, <lb/>
            And of the brine abominably smell. <lb/>
            And thither bring you in the morn will I, <lb n="395"/>
            And how to place yourselves instruct you well; <lb/>
            For three more must come with you, lusty men, <lb/>
            Whom you shall choose from out your company. <lb/>
            The old Sea-God his flock will number then, <lb/>
            And, having done, i' th' midst of them will lie, <lb n="400"/>
            Just as a shepherd lies amongst his sheep. <lb/>
            Now waver not, but bold and constant be. <lb/>
            As soon as you shall see he is asleep, <lb/>
            Lay hold on him, and keep it constantly, <lb/>
            For he in divers shapes will with you struggle. <lb n="405"/>
            He will be any serpent that he please; <lb/>
            Himself he'll into fire or water juggle ; <lb/>
            Therefore hold fast, lest he your hands disease. <lb/>
            When of himself he shall contented be, <lb/>
            In his first form the matter to debate, <lb n="410"/>
            Take off your hands, and set the old God free. <lb/>
            Then of your business him interrogate, <lb/>
            What God it is that hath your hurt contrived, <lb/>
            How you shall put to sea, which way go home. <lb/>
            This said, into the sea again she dived. <lb n="415"/>
            Then, full of thoughts, back to my ships I come, <lb/>
            And supp'd, and when we supped had 'twas night. <lb/>
            Then slept we by our ships upon the sand, <lb/>
            But when Aurora had brought back the light, <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            Then went I with my three men to the strand, <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>

            ment at Sparta <lb/>

            And prayed to the Gods: my men I chose, <lb/>
            Such men as for the purpose fit I thought. <lb/>
            Idothoë then from the sea arose, <lb/>
            And in her hand four sea-calves' skins she brought <lb/>
            All raw, her father thereby to betray. <lb n="420"/>
            And with those skins upon us on the shore, <lb/>
            Scrap'd hollow by her, like sea-calves we lay, <lb/>
            And there our lodging had been very sore, <lb/>
            (For so abominably do they stink, <lb/>
            That no man near them can endure to lie. <lb n="430"/>
            Is it good lying with a whale, dye think ?) <lb/>
            But that she for it had a remedy. <lb/>
            Ambrosia she with her brought, and laid <lb/>
            The same unto our noses one by one, <lb/>
            Which the ill savour of the fish allay'd. <lb n="435"/>
            And thus we lay expecting till 'twas noon ; <lb/>
            Then all at once the sea-calves came ashore, <lb/>
            And there themselves they bedded orderly. <lb/>
            At noon came Proteus, and counts them o'er, <lb/>
            And first were counted my three men and I. <lb n="440"/>
            Then lay he also down, and by and by <lb/>
            He fell asleep. Then we unto him ran, <lb/>
            And laid hands on him with a hideous cry, <lb/>
            And he to shew his wondrous art began. <lb/>
            A shaggy lion first he seem'd to be; <lb n="445"/>
            And then a dragon ; then a leopard ; <lb/>
            And then a boar; then water; then a tree ; <lb/>
            But still we kept our hold, and press'd him hard. <lb/>
            He weary was at last, and then he said: <lb/>
            Atrides, how came you by so much skill <lb n="450"/>
            To hold me thus ? What God has me betray'd ? <lb/>
            What needed you to vex me ? What's your will ? <lb/>
            What need, said I, have you from me to hear, <lb/>
            That bound am to this isle, and know not how <lb/>
            To put to sea, nor what God holds me here, <lb n="455"/>
            When you can tell me (for Gods all things know)? <lb/>
            Then back, said he, to Greece you cannot come, <lb/>
            Till you to Egypt do return again, <lb/>
            And pay to all the Gods a hecatomb; <lb/>
            That done, you shall pass safely o'er the main. <lb n="460"/>
            Thus Proteus said. But that I must go first <lb/>
            Back into Egypt, an ill and long way, <lb/>
            My heart to hear it ready was to burst. <lb/>
            'Tis hard, said I, but I'll do all you say; <lb/>
            But tell me of the Argives first, if they <lb n="465"/>
            With their good ships came all in safety home, <lb/>
            That I and Nestor left behind at Troy, <lb/>
            How many by the way they lost, and whom ? <lb/>
            Some of them 'scap'd, said he, and some are lost; <pb n="342"/>

            But of the princes lost are only twain <lb n="470"/>
            In their return. Upon the Trojan coast <lb/>
            You know who died; and one the Gods detain. <lb/>
            First Ajax' ships by winds are laid aground <lb/>
            At Gyre, rocks that on the deep look down, <lb/>
            And 'gainst the sea protection there had found, <lb n="475"/>
            However Pallas did upon him frown, <lb/>
            But that a high provoking word he spake. <lb/>
            I'll pass, said he, although the Gods say no. <lb/>
            And Neptune then the rock he sat on brake; <lb/>
            Both he and it into the water go, <lb n="480"/>
            Where, when he had drunk brine enough, he died. <lb/>
            Your brother also safely pass'd the sea, <lb/>
            And came to Argos (Juno was his guide). <lb/>
            And when he was come near to mount Males, <lb/>
            Forc'd by foul weather, he disbarked, where <lb n="485"/>
            Thyestes formerly his age had spent, <lb/>
            But now his son JEgistus dwelled there. <lb/>
            The Gods then chang'd the wind, and homeward went. <lb/>
            Full glad he was, and kiss'd the ground for joy, <lb/>
            And from him fell the tears abundantly. <lb n="490"/>
            Ægistus, that long sought him to destroy, <lb/>
            Had plac'd a man on purpose to descry <lb/>
            Th' arrival of the fleet, whom he had hired <lb/>
            To watch upon a hill a year together, <lb/>
            For talents ten of gold, that he required, <lb n="495"/>
            And tell him when the fleet from Troy came thither. <lb/>
            The watchman saw them, and t' Ægistus went, <lb/>
            And gave him notice of their coming in. <lb/>
            Ægistus then, t' effect his bad intent, <lb/>
            Chose twenty lusty men, and them within <lb n="500"/>
            An inner room he placed, out of sight, <lb/>
            And a great supper bids his men provide; <lb/>
            Then down went, Agamemnon to invite, <lb/>
            With horses and with coaches to th' sea-side, <lb/>
            And brought him up to supper in great state; <lb n="505"/>
            Then rose the traitors that in ambush lay, <lb/>
            And killed him, as he at supper sate, <lb/>
            Nor any man alive went thence away, <lb/>
            That with Atrides or with him took part. <lb/>
            When of his story he had made an end, <lb n="510"/>
            To break with pity ready was my heart; <lb/>
            In streams down on my cheeks the tears descend. <lb/>
            I wished never more to see the sun, <lb/>
            And weeping, on the sand myself I roll'd. <lb/>
            But when my lamentation was done, <lb n="515"/>
            Then Proteus said again, Your weeping hold, <lb/>
            Tears are no remedy, but make haste home. <lb/>
            There lives Ægistus, or if he be slain <lb/>
            Already by Orestes, you will come <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>

            by Menelaus,&amp;c. </note> <lb n="520"/>
            And then I asked further of turn this: <lb/>
            Since you have told me what's become of two, <lb/>
            Tell me the third that stays abroad, who 'tis, <lb/>
            Alive or dead, though that will grieve me too. <lb/>
            It is, said he, Ulysses, whom I saw <lb n="525"/>
            In th' island where Calypso dwells, o' th' shore <lb/>
            Weeping, who fain would come to Ithaca, <lb/>
            But with him neither has a ship nor oar. <lb/>
            And you, 0 Menelaus, shall not die <lb/>
            In Argos (for 'tis otherwise decreed) <lb n="530"/>
            But be conveyed t' Elysium. For why, <lb/>
            Of Jupiter you wedded have the seed. <lb/>
            There humans lead their lives in greatest ease ; <lb/>
            No snow nor frost there is; refreshed there <lb/>
            They are by zephyrs rising from the seas, <lb n="535"/>
            And Jove's son Rhadamanthus dwelleth there. <lb/>
            This said, into the sea he went again, <lb/>
            But I, with thoughts confused in my head, <lb/>
            Returned back unto my ships and men, <lb/>
            And soon as we had supp'd, the night was spread. <lb n="540"/>
            Then back again into the Nile we go, <lb/>
            And offer'd to the Gods a hecatomb; <lb/>
            When we their anger had appeased so, <lb/>
            For Agamemnon there we rais'd a tomb. <lb/>
            When this was done, for Argos we set sail, <lb n="545"/>
            And quickly to our native soil we came; <lb/>
            Th' immortal Gods gave us a lusty gale, <lb/>
            And all the way continued the same. <lb/>
            Telemachus, you've heard all I can say, <lb/>
            But must not therefore straightway take your leave; <lb n="550"/>
            Until th' eleventh or twelfth day you'll stay, <lb/>
            The presents I intend you to receive. <lb/>
            A chariot you shall have and horses three, <lb/>
            And a fair cup emboss'd to offer wine, <lb/>
            That in your vows you may remember me. <lb n="555"/>
            Then said Telemachus, I here have lien <lb/>
            Long time already, and my men at Pyle <lb/>
            Are weary of expecting me; else I <lb/>
            Could stay a year, and never all that while <lb/>
            My mind have on my house or family, <lb n="560"/>
            So much I taken am with your discourse. <lb/>
            But let my present be some monument; <lb/>
            To Ithaca I'll never carry horse, <lb/>
            They for the plains are more convenient; <lb/>
            Large plains, which you have here in many places, <lb n="565"/>
            And where store is of wheat, and rice, and lote. <lb/>
            In Ithaca there is no ground for races, <lb/>
            Nor pastures good enough to feed a goat. <lb/>
            In th' isles about it, gallop can no horse; <pb n="344"/>

            In th' isle itself, nor gallop nor be fed. <lb n="570"/>
            When be had made an end of his discourse, <lb/>
            Atrides, smiling on him, strok'd his head. <lb/>
            'Tis spoken, said he, like a gallant man, <lb/>
            And that descended is of noble blood. <lb/>
             111 give you other presents, for I can, <lb n="575"/>
            In place of these, that shall be full as good. <lb/>
            A monument kept in my treasury, <lb/>
            Of massive silver a fair temperer, <lb/>
            The work of Vulcan, which was given me <lb/>
            At Sidon, by the king, when I was there. <lb n="580"/>
            Whilst they together thus discoursing staid, <lb/>
            The bidden guests, fat sheep, rich wine bring in, <lb/>
            And bread their wives upon the table laid, <lb/>
            And about supper busy were within. <lb/>
            And now the suitors at Ulysses' house <lb n="585"/>
            Were throwing of the stone and darts. And by <lb/>
            Antinous sat and Eurymachus, <lb/>
            Chief of the woo'ra. Then came Noemon nigh: <lb/>
            Unto Antinous he spake, and said, <lb/>
            When will Telemachus return from Pyle ? <lb n="590"/>
            My ship I lent him, and am now afraid <lb/>
            I shall have need of her myself the while. <lb/>
            For over into Elis I must pass; <lb/>
            Twelve mares of mine there go, and with the same <lb/>
            Twelve unbroke mules, with all their foals, at grass; <lb n="595"/>
            And some of them I would fetch home and tame. <lb/>
            At this they star'd. For never dreamed they <lb/>
            That in good earnest he would go to Pyle, <lb/>
            But in the fields would with some herdsman stay, <lb/>
            And there from us conceal himself awhile. <lb n="600"/>
            Antinous then ask'd, When parted he ? <lb/>
            What company went with him hence ? His own <lb/>
            Servants and husbandmen, for that might be, <lb/>
            Or young men of the best account i' th' town ? <lb/>
            And tell me further, was it willingly <lb n="605"/>
            You lent your ship, or were you forced thereto? <lb/>
            To this Noemon did again reply: <lb/>
            I lent it willingly. What should I do ? <lb/>
            Who would not yield to such a man's request, <lb/>
            When he has need and asks, as well as I ? <lb n="610"/>
            And with him went of Ithaca the best, <lb/>
            And Mentor chief of all the company; <lb/>
            If he it were not, 'twas some deity, <lb/>
            For, which is strange, I saw him yesterday <lb/>
            Before the sun was mounted half the sky, <lb n="615"/>
            Yet went the ship the night before away. <lb/>
            This said, he went his way. Antinous <lb/>
            And th' others sat there yet, and wondered. <lb/>
            The suitors left their sport, sat down; and thus <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            Antinous the case then opened, <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain­ <lb/>
            ment at Sparta <lb/>
            by Meuelaus, te. </note> <lb n="620"/>
            And in an angry tone, with fiery eye, <lb/>
            'Tis true, said he, Telemachus has done <lb/>
            A work to us of great indignity. <lb/>
            We thought he never could that way have gone. <lb/>
            We many are, and men ; yet he, a boy, <lb n="625"/>
            Has got a ship, and of our men the best. <lb/>
            But may Jove him, before he us, destroy. <lb/>
            Give me a good ship, ere we be oppress'd, <lb/>
            And twenty able men, and in the strait <lb/>
            'Twixt Ithaca and Same I will lie, <lb n="630"/>
            And for their coming back from Pylus wait, <lb/>
            And entertain him with hot coming by. <lb/>
            The suitors all were pleased with the plot, <lb/>
            And then they rose together and went in. <lb/>
            But Medon had heard all, which they knew not, <lb n="635"/>
            For he without the court was, they within. <lb/>
            And to inform Penelope he went, <lb/>
            And when she saw him coming in a door, <lb/>
            Medon, said she, what, are you hither sent <lb/>
            To bid my maids trouble themselves no more <lb n="640"/>
            With how the suitors they shall entertain; <lb/>
            But only for themselves make ready meat ? <lb/>
            Lest when they hither come to sup again, <lb/>
            It prove the last that they shall ever eat. <lb/>
            Telemachus his wealth you wasted have, <lb n="645"/>
            As if your fathers never told you how <lb/>
            Ulysses with them did himself behave, <lb/>
            That never did unkindness to them show <lb/>
            In deed or word. Although a liberty <lb/>
            Kings often take, one man to love or hate <lb n="650"/>
            Above another, without telling why; <lb/>
            But he cause of offence to no man gave. <lb/>
            But of good turns received heretofore <lb/>
            Your nature altogether senseless is. <lb/>
            O queen, said Medon, would it were no more; <lb n="655"/>
            But I must tell you somewhat worse than this. <lb/>
            The suitors have conspir'd to kill your son, <lb/>
            (Which Jove avert,) as he is coming home. <lb/>
            For he to Pylus is and Sparta gone <lb/>
            T' enquire what of his father is become. <lb n="660"/>
            This said, Penelope was stricken dumb, <lb/>
            And filled were with tears her eyes. But when <lb/>
            Her voice at last again was to her come, <lb/>
            She spake to Medon, and him asked then, <lb/>
            Medon, said she, why went my son away ? <lb n="665"/>
            What need had he upon the sea to ride ? <lb/>
            Meant he his name amongst men to destroy ? <lb/>
            And Medon to her then again replied: <lb/>
            I cannot tell. Perhaps encouraged <pb n="346"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain­ <lb/>

            T' enquire about his father, whether dead, <lb/>
            Or on what coast he is by fortune thrown. <lb/>
            This said, her tears she could no longer hold, <lb/>
            And lets herself sink down upon the sill. <lb/>
            Then came her maids about her, young and old. <lb n="675"/>
            Did ever Gods, said she, bear such ill will <lb/>
            To any woman as they bear to me ? <lb/>
            Why deal they worse with me than with the rest? <lb/>
            0 my dear husband ! What a man was he! <lb/>
            All manly virtues lodged in his breast. <lb n="680"/>
            Through Hellas and through Argos known was he; <lb/>
            Of him the Gods unkind me first bereft; <lb/>
            And now away my child must taken be, <lb/>
            That to sustain the house at home was left. <lb/>
            Sluts that you are, and of his going knew, <lb n="685"/>
            Why was it not to me discovered ? <lb/>
            For had I of it been inform'd by you, <lb/>
            I had him stayed, or he had left me dead. <lb/>
            To Dolius let one or other<lb/>
            (The servant which my father gave to me, <lb n="690"/>
            And with Laertes at the lodge is now, <lb/>
            And of my garden has the custody) <lb/>
            And tell him what the suitors are about, <lb/>
            That he may to Laertes tell the same; <lb/>
            And he unto the people may come out, <lb n="695"/>
            And them against these wicked men inflame. <lb/>
            Then spake Euryclea: Dear child, said she, <lb/>
            Kill me, or let me live as you think best; <lb/>
            No longer shall the truth concealed be. <lb/>
            I knew all this. So did none of the rest. <lb n="700"/>
            I furnished him with all that he commanded, <lb/>
            Sweet wine and flour, but first he made me swear, <lb/>
            I would not tell you till it was demanded, <lb/>
            Or that the same by others told you were; <lb/>
            For fear lest with much weeping hurt you take. <lb n="705"/>
            But wash, put on clean garments, and up go <lb/>
            Into your chamber, and your prayers make <lb/>
            To Pallas, who your son to save knows how. <lb/>
            The griev'd old man, why should you further grieve ? <lb/>
            Hated is not Arcesius his seed <lb n="710"/>
            By all the Gods. For I cannot believe <lb/>
            But some of them will help them in their need, <lb/>
            And both their houses and their lands protect. <lb/>
            This stopp'd her sobbing, and her weeping stay'd. <lb/>
            Then went she up, herself she wash'd and deck'd, <lb n="715"/>
            And to the Goddess Pallas thus she pray'd: <lb/>
            O Goddess, if you well accepted have <lb/>
            The victims by Ulysses sacrificed <lb/>
            Upon your altar here, his son now save, <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            And bring to nought what th' wooers have devised. <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain­ <lb/>

            Her prayer granted was. Then shouted they. <lb/>
            The suitors heard it in the hall, and one <lb/>
            T' another said, 'Tis for her wedding-day; <lb/>
            She knows not we intend to kill her son. <lb/>
            Thus said they, but upon no ground at all. <lb n="725"/>
            Alcinous then spake. Madmen, said he, <lb/>
            Such words as these what mean you to let fall ? <lb/>
            What if within they should reported be ? <lb/>
            Come rise, thus, gently, and the work effect <lb/>
            To which we all have given our consent. <lb n="730"/>
            Then did he twenty able men elect, <lb/>
            And down unto the water side they went, <lb/>
            And first of all they laid their ship afloat, <lb/>
            And in it with white sails the mast they laid, <lb/>
            And fit their oars. Then in their arms were brought: <lb n="735"/>
            The mast then rear'd was, and the sails display'd. <lb/>
            Then went they t' anchor in the open sea, <lb/>
            And stay'd all night. And then aboard they eat. <lb/>
            Then to her chamber went Penelope <lb/>
            Grieving, and tasting neither drink nor meat, <lb n="740"/>
            Casting about whether more likely 't were <lb/>
            Her son should 'scape the suitors' hands, or die. <lb/>
            Just as a lion that enclosed were <lb/>
            With toils about, would cast which way to fly. <lb/>
            When her sad reck'ning sleep had blotted out, <lb n="745"/>
            Dissolv'd her strength, and closed had her eyes, <lb/>
            PaRas another bus'ness went about. <lb/>
            She made an Idol in a woman's guise, <lb/>
            Like to the daughter of Icarius, <lb/>
            Wife of Eumelus, (at Pheræ dwell'd he), <lb n="750"/>
            And sent the same unto Ulysses' house, <lb/>
            T' allay the sorrow of Penelope. <lb/>
            In at the keyhole then the Idol goes <lb/>
            Into her chamber, and stood at her head. <lb/>
            Penelope, said it, amidst such woes <lb n="755"/>
            How can you sleep ? But now be comforted. <lb/>
            You must no longer weep nor grieved be, <lb/>
            For from the Gods you no such cause shall have, <lb/>
            For of your son the safe return you'll see. <lb/>
            To this Penelope then answer gave. <lb n="760"/>
            Sister, said she, 'tis strange to see you here; <lb/>
            You come but seldom. For far off you dwell. <lb/>
            And now you bid me weeping to forbear, <lb/>
            When how much cause I have you cannot tell. <lb/>
            A good and noble husband I have lost, <lb n="765"/>
            That had a lion's heart within his breast, <lb/>
            Hellas and Argos of his valour boast, <lb/>
            What virtue is there that he not possessed ? <lb/>
            And now my child at sea is in a tub, <pb n="348"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. IV. </note><note type="margin"> His entertain. <lb/>

            And has no skill in fight or parliament: <lb n="770"/>
            I fear extremely lest he meet some rub, <lb/>
            For him more than for th' other I lament. <lb/>
            What may befal him on the sea I dread, <lb/>
            And what at land, if e'er to land he come, <lb/>
            For many foes he hath that wish him dead, <lb n="775"/>
            And wait to kill him as he cometh home. <lb/>
            To this again replied the Idol dim, <lb/>
            Take courage, be not frighted for your son ; <lb/>
            He has a guide that taketh care of him; <lb/>
            A better would be wished for by none. <lb n="780"/>
            'Tis Pallas. For of you she pity takes, <lb/>
            And what I said, I said by her command. <lb/>
            Penelope again this answer makes, <lb/>
            Whoe'er you be, answer one more demand: <lb/>
            Is my poor husband yet alive, or no ? <lb n="785"/>
            Then said the Idol, That I do not find, <lb/>
            Nor will I tell you what I do not know. <lb/>
            Then through the keyhole went, and tum'd to wind. <lb/>
            Then wak'd Penelope, and joyful was <lb/>
            T' have had a dream so evident and clear. <lb n="790"/>
            Then o'er the humid plain the suitors pass, <lb/>
            Destruction to Telemachus to bear. <lb/>
            'Twixt Ithaca and Same, middle way, <lb/>
            There lies an island, and but small it is, <lb/>
            Yet hath it on each side a good safe bay. <lb n="795"/>

            To hear what of his father is become. <lb n="20"/>
            Why, child, said Jove, why say you this to me ? <lb/>
            'Twas you that sent Telemachus away ; <lb/>
            And you consenting were to our decree, <lb/>
            Ulysses should come back and th' wooers slay. <lb/>
            Go you and bring Telemachus from Pyle, <lb n="25"/>

            And Mercury, said he, go you the while <lb/>
            And tell the nymph Calypso what I say. <lb/>
            The Gods in council sitting ordered have, <lb/>
            Ulysses shall return to Ithaca. <lb n="30"/>
            And first upon a raft himself shall save, <lb/>
            Without a convoy in Phæacia <lb/>
            In twenty days; and there be honoured, <lb/>
            And to his country richly sent away, <lb/>
            With brass, and gold, and garments furnished, <lb n="35"/>
            More than his share had mounted to at Troy, <lb/>
            Though he had brought it thence all safely home; <lb/>
            For why, by destiny ordain'd it is <lb/>
            That to his friends he honourably come. <lb/>
            No sooner Jupiter had spoken this, <lb n="40"/>
            But that his shoes upon his feet he binds, <lb/>
            Ambrosian, golden shoes, wherewith he flies <lb/>
            On land or water, swifter than the winds. <lb/>
            Then takes the rod wherewith upon the eyes <lb/>
            Of mortals he lays on or takes off sleep, <lb n="45"/>
            And with his rod in hand j ump'd down to th' hill <lb/>
            Pierius, and thence into the deep; <lb/>
            And over the wide sea he passed, till <lb/>
            At last he was arrived at the isle <lb/>
            Where was the nymph Calypso resident; <lb n="50"/>
            And like a cormorant was all this while <lb/>
            That hunts the fishes. Then ashore he went, <lb/>
            And coming to her rock found her within. <lb/>
            Upon the hearth a fire was of sweet wood, <lb/>
            There did she sing, and as she sung did spin. <lb n="55"/>
            About the cave many fair trees there stood, <lb/>
            Beech, poplar, and the cyprus of sweet smell, <lb/>
            And many birds, hawks, and sea-crows, and owls, <lb/>
            Within their branches used were to dwell; <lb/>
            And, such as haunt sea-water, other fowls. <lb n="60"/>
            The rock itself with vines was covered, <lb/>
            And grapes abundance hanging were thereon ; <lb/>
            Four springs a-row four ways clear water spread. <lb/>
            Sweet meadows were about it many a one, <pb n="350"/>

            Stuck full of violets and flowers gay, <lb n="65"/>
            Which, though a God, he saw with admiration, <lb/>
            And for a little while he there did stay, <lb/>
            Pleas'd with the beauty of the habitation, <lb/>
            And then into the spacious cave he goes. <lb/>
            At the first sight Calypso knew him well, <lb n="70"/>
            For perfectly one God another knows, <lb/>
            How far soever they asunder dwell. <lb/>
            Ulysses now was gone out to the shore, <lb/>
            To look upon the sea that kept him in, <lb/>
            To sigh and weep as he had done before; <lb n="75"/>
            At Hermes' coming he was not within. <lb/>
            To Hermes, seated in a glistering chair, <lb/>
            The Goddess fair Calypso then began: <lb/>
            Tell me, beloved Hermes, your affair, <lb/>
            If it be possible it shall be done. <lb n="80"/>
            Come nearer, and with food yourself restore. <lb/>
            Then sets she him a table, and lays on <lb/>
            Of nectar and ambrosia good store. <lb/>
            Then Hermes took his food, and having done, <lb/>
            Goddess, said he, since me, a God, you ask, <lb n="85"/>
            You may be sure I tell you shall no lie. <lb/>
            Jove sent me 'gainst my will; for such a task <lb/>
            Who undertake would, think you, willingly ? <lb/>
            For, first, a horrible long journey 'tis; <lb/>
            And then no town to bait at by the way <lb n="90"/>
            On hecatomb or lesser sacrifice. <lb/>
            But what God is there dares Jove disobey ? <lb/>
            There is, said Jove, a man that stay'd is here, <lb/>
            Of th' Argives that besieged Ilium <lb/>
            The most unhappy. There they stay'd nine year, <lb n="95"/>
            The tenth they took it, and were coming home; <lb/>
            But by the way they Pallas had offended, <lb/>
            And she against them raised stormy weather, <lb/>
            In which Ulysses' mates their lives all ended, <lb/>
            But he himself by storms was driven hither. <lb n="100"/>
            Him Jupiter would have you send away; <lb/>
            For he is destin'd not to die from home, <lb/>
            Nor any longer from his friends to stay, <lb/>
            But back unto his house and country come. <lb/>
            Calypso, troubled at it, answered: <lb n="105"/>
            Malicious ye Gods, and jealous are, <lb/>
            That think much Goddesses should mortals wed. <lb/>
            See but how hardly did Orion fare, <lb/>
            After Aurora was become his wife. <lb/>
            How angry at him, 0 ye Gods, were you, <lb n="110"/>
            Until Diana took away his life, <lb/>
            With shafts invisible before 'twas due. <lb/>
            And so when Ceres with Iäsion <lb/>
            Themselves delighted with the gift of love, <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
             How soon it was by th' other Gods made known, <note type="margin">LIB. V. </note><note type="margin"> Calypso sends <lb/>

            a raft of trees, &amp;c. </note> <lb n="115"/>
            And with a thunder-bolt he slain by Jove! <lb/>
            And now they angry are with me. And why ? <lb/>
            Because I taken have a man to bed <lb/>
            Who in the sea had perish'd, had not I <lb/>
            Receiv'd him in my house and cherished. <lb n="120"/>
            For when his ship with thunder Jove had split, <lb/>
            And all his company away were cast, <lb/>
            Him on the mast unto the rudder knit, <lb/>
            The wind and waves brought hither at the last; <lb/>
            And here I him received and loved well, <lb n="125"/>
            And meant to give him immortality. <lb/>
            But since Jove will not let him with me dwell, <lb/>
            And I cannot resist him, farewell he. <lb/>
            But o'er the sea I shall not him convoy, <lb/>
            For in my power I have no ship, nor men <lb n="130"/>
            That have the art to walk in liquid way; <lb/>
            Prompt him I will how to get home again. <lb/>
            'Tis well, said Mercury; send him now hence; <lb/>
            The manner how, is left unto your will. <lb/>
            Be wise, and do not Jupiter incense, <lb n="135"/>
            Lest he upon you bring a greater ill. <lb/>
            This said, away went Mercury. And she <lb/>
            Unto Ulysses went to the sea-side. <lb/>
            Himself lamenting sitting there was he, <lb/>
            And when she came his eyes were not yet dried. <lb n="140"/>
            For now he lov'd the nymph less than before, <lb/>
            And lay with her a-nights unwillingly ; <lb/>
            A-days he weeping sat upon the shore, <lb/>
            And on tli' unbounded sea oft cast his eye. <lb/>
            Then to him said the nymph: Poor man, alas ! <lb n="145"/>
            No longer weep, but fall your work unto; <lb/>
            For on a raft you are the sea to pass, <lb/>
            And I will tell you what you are to do. <lb/>
            Cut down great trees, and them together join <lb/>
            With bands of brass; and on them make a deck; <lb n="150"/>
            And on it I will lay both bread and wine, <lb/>
            And water fresh, hunger and thirst to check. <lb/>
            And garments I will give you, and a wind, <lb/>
            That you may safe go home and speedily; <lb/>
            Unless the Gods be of another mind, <lb n="155"/>
            For stronger they and wiser are than I. <lb/>
            At this Ulysses troubled was, and said, <lb/>
            I looked for a convoy me to waft; <lb/>
            For on this sea a man would be afraid <lb/>
            Though in a ship; much more upon a raft. <lb n="160"/>
            I will not therefore pass upon a raft, <lb/>
            Unless to do me no more hurt you swear. <lb/>
            And when he had said that, Calypso laugh'd, <lb/>
            And of his head she stroked down the hair. <pb n="352"/>

            You are, she said, a true bird of the nest, <lb n="165"/>
            As by your answer very well I see: <lb/>
            By Heaven and by Earth I do protest, <lb/>
            And Styx, which is the greatest oath can be, <lb/>
            IT! never anything hereafter do <lb/>
            That shall procure you hurt in any case; <lb n="170"/>
            And what at present I advise you to, <lb/>
            I would myself do, were I in your place: <lb/>
            For why, the Fates I also must obey, <lb/>
            And in my breast no iron heart I bear. <lb/>
            This said, she turn'd and homeward took her way, <lb n="175"/>
            And on her steps Ulysses follow'd her. <lb/>
            When they were come together in the cave, <lb/>
            She made him sit where Hermes sat before, <lb/>
            And meat and wine, the best that mortals have, <lb/>
            The maids upon the table laid good store; <lb n="180"/>
            Before Calypso they laid other meat, <lb/>
            Ambrosia and nectar, food divine; <lb/>
            There face to face they sit and drink and eat. <lb/>
            When she refreshed him had with meat and wine, <lb/>
            Noble Ulysses, said she, that long so <lb n="185"/>
            To see your house and wife without delay, <lb/>
            If what you were to suffer you did know <lb/>
            Before you there arrived, you would stay <lb/>
            And live with me here, and immortal be. <lb/>
            Nor than that wife, for whom you take such care, <lb n="190"/>
            Less fairer or less wise can you think me; <lb/>
            Women with Goddesses cannot compare. <lb/>
            Goddess, said he again, I know all this. <lb/>
            Penelope I not compare with you <lb/>
            In form or stature. For she mortal is, <lb n="195"/>
            And you immortal. Yet, though this be true, <lb/>
            I cannot chuse but wish myself at home. <lb/>
            And though I were to perish in the deep <lb/>
            By th' anger of the Gods, and never come, <lb/>
            I'd rather suffer that, than always weep. <lb n="200"/>
            For patience long since I learned have <lb/>
            Sufficiently in tempest and in fight. <lb/>
            This said, they both in one part of the cave <lb/>
            To sleep went, where in love they took delight. <lb/>
            And when the morning was again displayed, <lb n="205"/>
            Ulysses cloth'd himself with cloak and coat; <lb/>
            The nymph herself in a great robe array'd <lb/>
            Of dainty stuff with gold all over wrought, <lb/>
            Which on her loins a golden girdle tied, <lb/>
            And cover'd with a golden scarf her head. <lb n="210"/>
            And how Ulysses o'er the sea so wide <lb/>
            Should safely pass, she there considered. <lb/>
            Then puts a plainer and an axe in's hand, <lb/>

            And when they were arrived at the wood, <lb/>
            Beeches they find, poplars, and fir-trees high, <lb/>
            Already dry, that lie light on the flood. <lb/>
            Calypso to her cavern back did hie. <lb n="220"/>
            Meanwhile Ulysses twenty trees brought low, <lb/>
            And hewed them, and plain'd them skilfully, <lb/>
            And laid them on the ground all in a row, <lb/>
            At corners square, and of one length they lie. <lb/>
            And then with wimbles back Calypso came; <lb n="225"/>
            Then pierced them, and set them one to one, <lb/>
            And with strong joints and nails fast bound the same. <lb/>
            And by the time that all this he had done, <lb/>
            As a good ship as broad it was and long. <lb/>
            Then for his decks he placed stoops upright <lb n="230"/>
            On every side, and many to be strong ; <lb/>
            And laid upon them planks at equal height. <lb/>
            Then made his mast, and set it up on end, <lb/>
            His rudder, and a place to sit and guide, <lb/>
            And laid on boughs from waves it to defend, <lb n="235"/>
            And all his cordage made of good cow-hide, <lb/>
            And then with levers set his raft afloat. <lb/>
            Four days in making of the raft he spent; <lb/>
            When he had done, and all his work had wrought, <lb/>
            Upon the fifth the nymph away him sent. <lb n="240"/>
            But first she bath'd him, and with clothes array'd, <lb/>
            Fine and perfum'd. Then wine of pleasant taste <lb/>
            One goat-skin full upon the raft she laid, <lb/>
            And one of water, greater, by it plac'd; <lb/>
            And sweetmeats, and good flesh of ev'ry kind. <lb n="245"/>
            And after he his sails had hoist and spread, <lb/>
            She fill'd them with a warm and cheerful wind. <lb/>
            Then he astern sat down and governed, <lb/>
            And on Bootes look'd, and Pleiades, <lb/>
            And on the Bear, which people call the Wain, <lb n="250"/>
            Which dogs Orion rising from the seas, <lb/>
            But she herself ne'er dives into the main. <lb/>
            This Bear she bade him leave on the left hand. <lb/>
            Then sev'nteen days he sail'd, on th* eighteenth day <lb/>
            He came in sight of the Phœacian land, <lb n="255"/>
            In that part where it nearest to him lay, <lb/>
            Which look'd as 'twere upon the sea a skin. <lb/>
            But now by Neptune, who returning was, <lb/>
            Ulysses' raft from Solymi was seen, <lb/>
            For o'er those mountains Neptune was to pass; <lb n="260"/>
            Who, wounded at the sight, with anger keen, <lb/>
            Thus said unto himself: What, what, I find, <lb/>
            While I in Ethiopia have been, <lb/>
            The Gods about this man have chang'd their mind. <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <pb n="354"/>

            But yet, I think, before he be on land, <lb/>
            He struggle shall with many a lusty wave. <lb/>
            Then with his trident he the sea enraged, <lb/>
            And made a night of clouds the sea upon, <lb n="270"/>
            And 'gainst Ulysses all the Winds engaged, <lb/>

            Each one a mighty wave against him rolled. <lb/>
            And then Ulysses' heart near broken was, <lb n="275"/>
            And with himself, himself he thus condoled. <lb/>
            Ah me, what will become of me at last! <lb/>
            I fear the nymph Calypso all this knew, <lb/>
            Who told me then that as I homeward pass'd <lb/>
            I should meet danger. Now I find it true. <lb n="280"/>
            With what thick clouds Jove cover'd has the sky! <lb/>
            In what a tumult is the sea! And how <lb/>
            On ev'ry side the winds the water ply <lb/>
            And storm ! My death, I see, is certain now. <lb/>
            Thrice, four times, Argives, happy were you, who <lb n="285"/>
            For Agamemnon's sake were slain. Would I <lb/>
            At Troy in battle my life lost had too, <lb/>
            I' th' show'r of spears about Achilles' body; <lb/>
            Then had I had a noble funeral, <lb/>
            And great among the Greeks had been my fame. <lb n="290"/>
            But now a wretched death will me befal, <lb/>
            For ever will unheard of be my name. <lb/>
            This said, he dash'd was 'gainst a point of land, <lb/>
            Which with great force whirled the raft about. <lb/>
            And then the rudder flew out of his hand; <lb n="295"/>
            And he into the water was cast out. <lb/>
            Of divers winds then followed one great blast, <lb/>
            And sail and tackle o'er-board far off bears, <lb/>
            And in the middle breaks in two the mast, <lb/>
            While he was in the sea o'er head and ears; <lb n="300"/>
            At last he rais'd his head above the pickle, <lb/>
            (Ilis heavy clothes awhile had hindered him), <lb/>
            Then from his hair into his mouth did trickle <lb/>
            The brine, which he spits out, and falls to swim. <lb/>
            And when he had his raft recovered, <lb n="305"/>
            And plac'd himself i' th' midst, then both together <lb/>
            The wind uncertainly them carried <lb/>
            From place to place, now hither and now thither; <lb/>
            Just as the wind in harvest blows pease-straw <lb/>
            Upon the plain field whilst it holds together; <lb n="310"/>
            So on the sea without a certain law <lb/>
            Ulysses' raft was driven by the weather. <lb/>
            In this distress by Ino he was seen, <lb/>
            A sea-nymph and immortal she was then, <lb/>

            And now in ngure Of a water-hen <lb/>
            She sat upon the raft and to him spake. <lb/>
            What meaneth Neptune that he hates you so ? <lb/>
            Do what he can your life he shall not take; <lb/>
            Do what I bid you. Off your garments throw, <lb n="320"/>
            And quit the raft; and to Phœacia <lb/>
            Swim with your hands, and there you shall find rest. <lb/>
            For so it is ordain'd by fatal law. <lb/>
            Here, take this scarf; apply it to your breast, <lb/>
            And fear not death. But when you come to land <lb n="325"/>
            Throw't in the sea as far off as you can, <lb/>
            Then turn. This said, she put it in his hand, <lb/>
            And diving there alone she left the man. <lb/>
            Ulysses grieving to himself then says, <lb/>
            What is it now I am advis'd unto! <lb n="330"/>
            Ah me! Some other God now me betrays <lb/>
            To quit my raft. I know what I will do. <lb/>
            For since my refuge is so near at hand, <lb/>
            Such counsel I will not too soon obey; <lb/>
            But do what does with greatest reason stand. <lb n="335"/>
            Upon my raft I mean so long to stay <lb/>
            As it shall hold together and be one. <lb/>
            But when the wind has broken it in pieces <lb/>
            I'll swim; since better counsel I have none. <lb/>
            While with himself consulting was Ulysses, <lb n="340"/>
            Neptune with wind the water sets upright <lb/>
            Into a high and formidable wave, <lb/>
            And threw it on the raft with all his might, <lb/>
            Which all the parts thereof asunder drave. <lb/>
            Just as the wind scatters a cock of hay, <lb n="345"/>
            So scattered was Ulysses* raft of trees; <lb/>
            Whilst he on one of them astride did stay, <lb/>
            And of his garments there himself he frees. <lb/>
            Then Ino's scarf applies he to his breast, <lb/>
            And on the troubled sea himself he laid <lb n="350"/>
            With open arms. To swim he now thought best. <lb/>
            Which Neptune seeing, thus unto him said: <lb/>
            Go wander now upon the sea in woe, <lb/>
            And do not make account that this is all. <lb/>
            This said, away to Ægæ did he go, <lb n="355"/>
            Where many men that need him on him call. <lb/>
            When he was gone Pallas the winds did lay, <lb/>
            All but a lusty gale of Boreas, <lb/>
            And broke the waves before him all the way, <lb/>
            That to Phœacia he might safely pass. <lb n="360"/>
            Two nights and days perpetual he swam, <lb/>
            And was of drowning all the while afraid. <lb/>
            But when the morning of the third day came, <lb/>
            The air was calm, and all the winds allay'd. <note type="footnote"> A A 2 </note> <pb n="356"/>

            Glad are his children; so Ulysses was <lb n="370"/>
            To see the so-much wish'd-for land so nigh, <lb/>
            And thither made what haste he could to pass. <lb/>
            When he was gotten so near to the shore <lb/>
            That one might hear another when he calls, <lb/>
            Torn by the rocks he heard the water roar. <lb n="375"/>
            (Loud is the sea when on hard rocks it falls.) <lb/>
            There neither haven was nor place to land, <lb/>
            But upright banks and cliffs and brows of stone. <lb/>
            And everywhere too deep it was to stand. <lb/>
            And now again quite was his courage gone, <lb n="380"/>
            And speaking to himself he said: Ah me, <lb/>
            This is the island. Jove has brought me to't, <lb/>
            That what must help me only I might see, <lb/>
            But not upon it ever set my foot. <lb/>
            There is no landing here. Rocks high and steep, <lb n="385"/>
            And unaccessible are all about. <lb/>
            The sea below so rugged is and deep, <lb/>
            That from it there will be no getting out. <lb/>
            If I should try, some mighty wave, I fear, <lb/>
            Against some rugged rock will carry me, <lb n="390"/>
            And make me find but woful landing there, <lb/>
            Amongst so many sharp stones as there be. <lb/>
            But if I swim along the coast to find <lb/>
            Some port or beach, though stormy, to land on, <lb/>
            I fear I shall again by some great wind <lb n="395"/>
            Far off from shore into the sea be blown; <lb/>
            And there by some great fish devoured be <lb/>
            (For many such are fed by Amphitrite) <lb/>
            Which Neptune may command to swallow me ; <lb/>
            For well I am acquainted with his spite. <lb n="400"/>
            While he thus doubted, came a mighty wave <lb/>
            That cast him to the bank amongst sharp stones. <lb/>
            But for the counsel Pallas to him gave, <lb/>
            He torn his skin and broken had his bones. <lb/>
            A rocher with his arms he then embrac'd, <lb n="405"/>
            And held it till the wave roll'd back again ; <lb/>
            And thought the danger of it now was past, <lb/>
            But then the same wave bore him to the main. <lb/>
            As looks a polypus when he is dragg'd <lb/>
            From out his hole, stuck full of stone and sands; <lb n="410"/>
            So, when Ulysses left his hold, were shagg'd <lb/>

            And now, had not Athena giv'n him wit, <lb/>

            He with his stretched arms the water cuts, <lb/>
            And swam along the shore; but kept his eye <lb/>
            Continually upon the land, to see <lb/>
            If any landing place he could espy. <lb/>
            At last before a river's mouth came he; <lb n="420"/>
            And knew it was a river's mouth. For there <lb/>
            Within the land smooth water might be seen, <lb/>
            And 'twixt the rocks a pause there did appear; <lb/>
            And here Ulysses thought fit to go in. <lb/>
            And in his mind unto the River spake: <lb n="425"/>
            Hear me, 0 king, from Neptune's rage I fly, <lb/>
            And of a man distress'd some pity take, <lb/>
            That at your knee and stream here prostrate lie; <lb/>
            Th' immortal Gods their suppliants respect, <lb/>
            When they before them humbly lay their want; <lb n="430"/>
            Whate'er your name be, do not me neglect <lb/>
            That am afflicted, and your suppliant. <lb/>
            This said, the stream stood still and sav'd the man. <lb/>
            But weary were his knees and arms, and brine <lb/>
            Abundance from his mouth and nostrils ran, <lb n="435"/>
            And all his body swell'd was. And in fine, <lb/>
            Speechless and breathless was he, like one dead. <lb/>
            But when he came unto himself again, <lb/>
            The scarf he to the stream delivered, <lb/>
            Which carried it again into the main. <lb n="440"/>
            And Ino took it then into her hand. <lb/>
            Then on a bulrush-bed himself he laid, <lb/>
            And, glad he had escaped, kiss'd the land. <lb/>
            But fearing still, unto himself he said, <lb/>
            Ah me, what will become of me at length! <lb n="445"/>
            For in the river if I spend the night, <lb/>
            So much already wasted is my strength, <lb/>
            With frost and dew I shall be killed quite. <lb/>
            If up the hill I go into the wood, <lb/>
            And in some thicket there lie warm and sleep, <lb n="450"/>
            I fear I shall for beasts and fowls be food. <lb/>
            At last concludes into some wood to creep. <lb/>
            A wood there was unto the river nigh; <lb/>
            Two thickets in it were; of olive one, <lb/>
            The other was of Phylia close by, <lb n="455"/>
            So twin'd they were together that nor sun, <lb/>
            Nor wind, nor rain, to th' ground could find a way. <lb/>
            Between them of dry leaves a bed made he, <lb/>
            And over head and ears there close he lay; <lb/>
            For leaves there were enough for two or three, <lb n="460"/>
            To keep them warm although cold weather 'twere. <lb/>
            As when a man takes up a brand of fire <lb/>
            In country-house, few neighbours dwelling near, <lb/>

            But by Nausithous transplanted were <lb/>
            To Scheria, that they might live at rest; <lb/>
            Who built them houses, and a city there, <lb/>
            And fortified the same with strong walls round, <lb/>
            And temples built, and gave them shares of land. <lb n="10"/>
            But he departed was, and under ground, <lb/>
            And now Alcinous had the command. <lb/>
            His house it was the Goddess went unto, <lb/>
            And int' a chamber gay, where lay a-bed <lb/>
            A godlike maid asleep, with less ado <lb n="15"/>
            Than could a gentle wind have entered. <lb/>
            This the king's daughter was, Nausicaa. <lb/>
            Within the door shut close, on each side one, <lb/>
            Two of her waiting-maids asleep she saw, <lb/>
            And as the Graces fair to look upon. <lb n="20"/>
            Then standing at Nausicaa's bed'a-head, <lb/>
            In form of Dymas' daughter, there she stay'd, <lb/>
            Who of her age was, and most favoured, <lb/>
            And to Nausicaa she spake, and said: <lb/>
            Careless Nausicaa, what do you mean, <lb n="25"/>
            When to your wedding-day you are so near, <lb/>
            To let so many garments lie unclean ? <lb/>
            You would be glad yourself fair clothes to wear, <lb/>
            And give to them that are to lead you out. <lb/>
            For e'en such things as these procure good fame <lb n="30"/>
            Amongst the people that dwell round about; <lb/>
            Your parents also take joy in the same. <lb/>
            Come therefore, to the river let's be gone <lb/>
            By break of day; for I will with you go <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            And help that you the sooner may have done. <note type="margin"> LIB. VI. <lb/>

            I'm sure your wedding is not far off now, <lb/>
            For sought you are in marriage by the best <lb/>
            Of all the town where you were born and bred. <lb/>
            Go early to your father and request <lb/>
            You may with mules and coach be furnished, <lb n="40"/>
            That aprons, gowns, and mantles you may bear <lb/>
            Unto the washing-place, for far 'tis to't, <lb/>
            And for your person so 'tis comelier <lb/>
            Than to be seen to go so far on foot. <lb/>
            This said, the Goddess up to heaven went, <lb n="45"/>
            Where is the dwelling of the Gods in bliss; <lb/>
            A pure and undecaying firmament <lb/>
            Which by no wind moved or shaken is, <lb/>
            Nor wet nor slabber'd is with show'r of rain, <lb/>
            Nor clouded, nor approach'd unto by snow; <lb n="50"/>
            But bright and shining always doth remain. <lb/>
            Here dwell th' immortals, and no sorrow know. <lb/>
            Thither went Pallas. Then Nausicaa <lb/>
            Awak'd, and through the house went to relate <lb/>
            Unto her parents what a dream she saw. <lb n="55"/>
            Her mother by the fire-side spinning sate <lb/>
            With distaff laden with fine purple wool. <lb/>
            Her father going out, she met i' th' hall, <lb/>
            Call'd by the lords sitting in council full, <lb/>
            And waiting for him to consult withal. <lb n="60"/>
            And to him said: Pray, father, shall not I <lb/>
            Allowed be a coach your clothes to bear <lb/>
            (Which in the house sullied and spotted lie) <lb/>
            Unto the river side to wash them there ; <lb/>
            For you yourself when you to council go <lb n="65"/>
            Would gladly have your garments clean and sweet. <lb/>
            Your five sons, whereof two be wedded now, <lb/>
            Would fain with clean clothes at the dancings meet. <lb/>
            So said Nausicaa. But to her father <lb/>
            To talk of wedding she forbore for shame, <lb n="70"/>
            Yet what she thought on he could eas'ly gather, <lb/>
            However she dissembled had the same. <lb/>
            Dear child, then said her father, you shall have <lb/>
            Both mules and coach with handsome covering. <lb/>
            Unto his servants then command he gave <lb n="75"/>
            To see it done. And out the coach they bring, <lb/>
            And to it set the mules. Then came her mother, <lb/>
            And laid in things to eat, of relish fine, <lb/>
            And such as eaten are with bread, much other; <lb/>
            And in a bag of goat-skin pleasant wine. <lb n="80"/>
            When in the coach the garments all were plac'd, <lb/>
            Nausicaa went up into her seat, <lb/>
            And with her took (when their toil should be past) <lb/>
            A cruse of oil to help wash off the sweat. <pb n="360"/>

            Then out, with whip and reins in hand, did drive. <lb n="85"/>
            And then, with strained limbs and clattering feet, <lb/>
            The mules soon at the river side arrive, <lb/>
            And pasture for them there was very sweet. <lb/>
            And there the mules first they unharnessed, <lb/>
            Then pushed them off to graze on the bank-side. <lb n="90"/>
            The clothes, in pits with water covered, <lb/>
            They tread, and who shall fastest tread they vied. <lb/>
            Then on the beach the garments wet they spread <lb/>
            Upon the cast up pebbles one by one. <lb/>
            Then washed they, and dried themselves, and fed, <lb n="95"/>
            And left the garments drying in the sun. <lb/>
            And after they with food were satisfied, <lb/>
            It came into their minds to play at ball, <lb/>
            And spend the time so till the clothes were dried. <lb/>
            The tune Nausicaa sung for them all. <lb n="100"/>
            As when upon Mount Erymanthus high <lb/>
            Or on Täygetus stands Artemis, <lb/>
            And many rural fair nymphs playing by. <lb/>
            But she than all the rest much taller is; <lb/>
            And the wild boars and harts delights to see, <lb n="105"/>
            But more her mother Leda to see her, <lb/>
            For though they fair were all, yet fairer she; <lb/>
            So shew'd Nausicaa and her maidens there. <lb/>
            And when 'twas time that they should homewards go, <lb/>
            And that the clothes into the coach were laid, <lb n="110"/>
            And mules set to, Athena thought on how <lb/>
            Ulysses should awake and see the maid, <lb/>
            And be conducted by her to the town. <lb/>
            Nausicaa then throws the ball and misses, <lb/>
            The ball into the river falleth down; <lb n="115"/>
            Then shout the maids. At that awak'd Ulysses, <lb/>
            And sitting up, unto himself he said, <lb/>
            Ay me, where am I now ? 'Mongst men unjust, <lb/>
            And such as of the Gods are not afraid ? <lb/>
            Or good and godly men, whom I may trust? <lb n="120"/>
            But female are the voices which I hear. <lb/>
            Are they some nymphs that haunt the mountains high, <lb/>
            Or keep the meadows green, or waters clear, <lb/>
            Or are they mortals whom I am so nigh ? <lb/>
            But why go I not out myself and see? <lb n="125"/>
            Then with strong hand he wringed off a bough <lb/>
            With many leaves upon it from a tree, <lb/>
            To cover what became him not to show; <lb/>
            Then as a lion, confident and bold, <lb/>
            Howe'er it blow or rain, with fiery eyes <lb n="130"/>
            Comes from the mountain to a herd or fold, <lb/>
            And on the flock at last his fortune tries; <lb/>
            So came Ulysses boldly from the wood <lb/>
            Stark naked, forc'd to't by necessity, <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            And in the presence of the maidens stood. <note type="margin"> LIB. VI. <lb/>

            The sight was terrible and made them fly; <lb/>
            Nausicaa fled not, but hid her eyes. <lb/>
            Off stood Ulysses, with himself to weigh <lb/>
            Whether to speak from thence was the more wise, <lb/>
            Or else himself before her feet to lay. <lb n="140"/>
            To stay there right at last resolved he, <lb/>
            Lest she should take his coming near her ill: <lb/>
            Then said, 0 queen, I beg upon my knee <lb/>
            That you with patience hear my prayer will. <lb/>
            You are a Goddess, or of human race; <lb n="145"/>
            If Goddess, you can then no other be <lb/>
            Than Artemis, Jove's daughter. In your face <lb/>
            Such beauty is; in height such majesty. <lb/>
            If mortal, and of human race you be, <lb/>
            Thrice happy are your parents and your brothers, <lb n="150"/>
            How glad in the processions they will see, <lb/>
            How much they are more grac'd by you than others; <lb/>
            For such a branch I ne'er saw with my eyes <lb/>
            On mortal stock. To see't I am amazed. <lb/>
            But once a palm at Delus saw arise <lb n="155"/>
            In the same manner, and long on it gazed <lb/>
            (For that way went I once well followed, <lb/>
            Which the first cause was of my trouble sore); <lb/>
            And then, as I do now, I wondered, <lb/>
            For I had never seen the like before. <lb n="160"/>
            T' approach unto your knees I was afraid, <lb/>
            Or show myself. But such is my estate. <lb/>
            For twenty days upon the sea I stray'd, <lb/>
            And here in storms was thrown ashore by fate <lb/>
            From th'isle Ogygia last night, and fear <lb n="165"/>
            I am to suffer yet more misery, <lb/>
            And that the Gods will persecute me here. <lb/>
            And since my landing you the first I see; <lb/>
            Now pity me, 0 queen, and show me where <lb/>
            The city stands. And t'hide my nakedness, <lb n="170"/>
            Give me some rag if there be any here; <lb/>
            And may Jove you with all you wish for bless, <lb/>
            A husband and a house, and concord good; <lb/>
            For man and wife to live in unity <lb/>
            Is the greatest blessing can be understood: <lb n="175"/>
            It joys your friend, and grieves your enemy. <lb/>
            Nausicaa then speaks, and to him says, <lb/>
            You seem to be a good man and discreet, <lb/>
            But Jove on good and bad such fortune lays, <lb/>
            Happy or otherwise, as he thinks meet; <lb n="180"/>
            And since distress is fallen to your share, <lb/>
            You must contented be to suffer it. <lb/>
            But seeing to this place arrived you arc, <lb/>

            Alcinous, the king. And then she cried <lb/>
            Aloud unto the maids to make them stay; <lb n="190"/>
            Why, said she, run you so away and hide ? <lb/>
            D'ye think the man will carry you away ? <lb/>
            For why, no enemy can come in hither, <lb/>
            The Gods so with the sea have wall'd us in. <lb/>
            Nor stranger dwells here. But by evil weather <lb n="195"/>
            To come to land this man hath forced been; <lb/>
            Let's do him good. From Jove come beggars all, <lb/>
            And welcome to them is whate'er they get; <lb/>
            Our givings to him will be very small. <lb/>
            Go, therefore, set before him wine and meat, <lb n="200"/>
            And wash him in the river, in such part <lb/>
            As cover'd is from wind. And then they did <lb/>
            (When they had given one another heart) <lb/>
            Set him in such a place as they were bid; <lb/>
            And gave him th' oil to scour his skin withal. <lb n="205"/>
            And by him a good cloak and coat they laid, <lb/>
            And then they bade him to his washing fall. <lb/>
            Ulysses answer'd them, and to them said, <lb/>
            Stand further off, I pray, fair maids; for I <lb/>
            My body naked am asham'd to show. <lb n="210"/>
            Then stand they off, and tell their mistress why, <lb/>
            (For washing he must have put off his bough.) <lb/>
            Then washed he his head and shoulders wide, <lb/>
            And with his hand from's head strok'd down the brine, <lb/>
            And with the clothes that laid were by his side <lb n="215"/>
            Array'd himself, that comely were and fine. <lb/>
            Then Pallas to him came, and made him look <lb/>
            Taller and broader than he was before; <lb/>
            And from his hair the colour grey she took, <lb/>
            And made it like the hyacynthinc flower. <lb n="220"/>
            As one by Vulcan or Athena taught, <lb/>
            Gold upon silver skilfully had spread; <lb/>
            So Pallas on Ulysses beauty wrought, <lb/>
            And graceful majesty upon his head; <lb/>
            Then sat he on the sands. Nausicaa <lb n="225"/>
            Then said unto her maidens, Do you hear, <lb/>
            How poor he look'd the first time we him saw, <lb/>
            And now how like a God he does appear; <lb/>
            And by the Gods, it may be, he was sent, <lb/>
            To dwell amongst the people of this place. <lb n="230"/>
            With such a husband I could be content <lb/>
            (If he would stay) and think it no disgrace; <lb/>
            Go, maids, and set before him wine and meat. <lb/>
            Away they went and did as the them bade; <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>

            Then harnessed the mules and set them to, <lb/>
            And folded and put up the garments all. <lb/>
            Nausicaa went up with maidens two, <lb/>
            And then unto Ulysses did she call, <lb n="240"/>
            Rise, stranger, to the city let us go, <lb/>
            That I may send you to my fathers house, <lb/>
            Where all the best Phœacians you'll know; <lb/>
            But hear you (for I think you cautelous), <lb/>
            Whilst in the fields the coach is on the way, <lb n="245"/>
            Amongst my maidens follow it apace, <lb/>
            But when you see it near the city, stay; <lb/>
            And that you may well understand the place, <lb/>
            A tower there is, you'll see it, for 'tis high: <lb/>
            There, 'twixt two havens is a narrow way, <lb n="250"/>
            You'll see it by the masts, for ships there lie; <lb/>
            Near it the people meet o'th'market-day, <lb/>
            And there a temple fair of Neptune stands, <lb/>
            Of free-stone from. the quarry hewn and fit; <lb/>
            For the Phœacians employ their hands <lb n="255"/>
            On shipping, and no other art but it. <lb/>
            For bows and arrows they care not a pin, <lb/>
            But for such things as serve to pass the seas, <lb/>
            Ships, cordage, oars, they take their pleasure in, <lb/>
            And spend their time and labour upon these. <lb n="260"/>
            I am afraid these men will censure me, <lb/>
            And say (for censurers are many here), <lb/>
            This handsome and tall fellow who is he, <lb/>
            That's with Nausicaa, from God knows where? <lb/>
            Where did she find him; must he marry her? <lb n="265"/>
            From some far country he is landed here, <lb/>
            Wand'ring by fortune, or a traveller; <lb/>
            For sure I am no such man dwelleth near. <lb/>
            May be some God from heaven descended is, <lb/>
            And to live with her always hither come, <lb n="270"/>
            So, then to wed a stranger better 'tis, <lb/>
            Since she thinks none is good enough at home; <lb/>
            For many seek her, and the best men here. <lb/>
            So will they say, and 'twill be to my shame; <lb/>
            For if another that had done it 'twere, <lb n="275"/>
            I should myself condemn her for the same; <lb/>
            For 'tis unseemly a fair maid to see, <lb/>
            That subject is t'her parents' government, <lb/>
            Converse with any man, unless she be <lb/>
            First married, or their parents give consent. <lb n="280"/>
            And, therefore, stranger, if you mean to be <lb/>
            Convoyed by my father to your home, <lb/>

            You'll find my father's vineyard, from the town <lb n="285"/>
            As far as one that hollas heard can be, <lb/>
            And when you thither come, there sit you down <lb/>
            Till at my father's house you think are we. <lb/>
            Then to the city go; ask where does dwell <lb/>
            Alcinous. For you shall meet with none, <lb n="290"/>
            Though but a child, but can inform you well; <lb/>
            So well his house is known to every one. <lb/>
            And there go in, and on, until you find <lb/>
            My mother. Whom you'll by the fire-side see <lb/>
            Spinning; and maids at the same work behind <lb n="295"/>
            The pillar under which sits working she. <lb/>
            My father's chair by the same pillar stands, <lb/>
            Where, when he drinketh, like a God he is. <lb/>
            Pass by it to my mother, and your hands, <lb/>
            If you mean to get home, lay on her knees. <lb n="300"/>
            If once her favour you can but obtain, <lb/>
            You need not fear, but you your friends shall see, <lb/>
            And to your house and country come again. <lb/>
            This said, her whip upon the mules laid she. <lb/>
            The mules start swiftly from the river side, <lb n="305"/>
            For nimble was the motion of their feet: <lb/>
            But she for those who went afoot, did guide <lb/>
            The swiftness of their pace as she thought meet. <lb/>
            When they were come t'Athena's sacred grove, <lb/>
            The sun went down; and there Ulysses staid <lb n="310"/>
            And to the Goddess, daughter of great Jove, <lb/>
            That he might good reception find, he pray'd. <lb/>
            Hear me, Jove's virgin daughter, hear me now, <lb/>

            Thus pray'd he, and was by Athena heard, <lb/>
            Though to him face to face she would not come, <lb/>
            But of her uncle Neptune was afeard, <lb/>

            Nausicaa straight to her chamber went; <lb/>

            Who, ta'en by rovers on the continent, <lb/>
            Was given to the king Alcinous, <lb/>
            That like a God was honour'd by the nation <lb n="10"/>
            Of the Phœacians at home. And thus <lb/>
            She of Nausicaa had th' education. <lb/>
            A fire she made her, and her supper brought. <lb/>
            Ulysses then into the city went, <lb/>
            Pallas of air had made him such a coat, <lb n="15"/>
            As he could not be seen; lest insolent <lb/>
            And sturdy townsmen should him mock and jeer, <lb/>
            Or ask him questions, who, what, or why. <lb/>
            But when he was unto the gate come near, <lb/>
            Pallas appeared to him openly, <lb n="20"/>
            Like a young maid with pail upon her head. <lb/>
            Ulysses then spake to her, and said thus: <lb/>
            Sweet pretty girl, will you be pleas'd to lead <lb/>
            Me to the house of king Alcinous ? <lb/>
            For I a stranger come, and no man know, <lb n="25"/>
            Nor ever in my life was here before. <lb/>
            Yes, then said Pallas, I will you it show, <lb/>
            For 'tis the next unto my father's door. <lb/>
            Go softly, thus, and I will lead the way, <lb/>
            For our folk strangers do not well endure; <lb n="30"/>
            But in good ships their honour wholly lay, <lb/>
            And the wide sea to pass themselves inure: <lb/>
            For Neptune given to them has this gift, <lb/>
            That their good ships fly like to thought or wind. <lb/>
            This said, the Goddess led with motion swift; <lb n="35"/>
            And on her steps he treading went behind. <lb/>
            And through the people so he pass'd unseen. <lb/>
            For why, the Goddess Pallas, for good will, <lb/>
            A wondrous mist of air had wrapt him in. <lb/>
            Then looking at the house he there stood still. <lb n="40"/>
            The havens and the ships he wonder'd at; <lb/>
            The market-place, and walls so thick and high. <lb/>
            Then Pallas said, Alcinous' house is that. <lb/>
            There sup the king and queen now merrily. <lb/>
            Though you a stranger be, fear not, go in; <lb n="45"/>
            The bold than fearful always better speed. <lb/>
            And first of all the house you'll find the queen, <lb/>
            Arete is her name. Both from one seed <lb/>
            Descended are she and Alcinous, <lb/>
            In Perrhæa, child of Eurimedon. <lb n="50"/>
            The God o' th' seas begot Nausithous <lb/>
            Who two sons had ; Alcinous was one, <lb/>
            The other was Rexenor, who no son <lb/>
            But one fair daughter only left behind. <pb n="366"/>

            .Alcinous and she in wedlock join'd; <lb/>
            And he to her so much respect doth bear, <lb/>
            As no man living to a wife bears more, <lb/>
            And honour'd is by all her children dear. <lb/>
            The people like a Goddess her adore, <lb n="60"/>
            And bless her when she comes into the street; <lb/>
            And loving to them all is also she, <lb/>
            For a wise woman is she and discreet. <lb/>
            When they fall out she makes them to agree. <lb/>
            If you her favour can but once obtain. <lb n="65"/>
            You need not fear but you your friends shall see. <lb/>
            And safely to your country come again. <lb/>
            And when she this had said, away went she <lb/>
            O'er sea to Marathon in Attica, <lb/>
            T* Erectheus' house. And he now was to enter <lb n="70"/>
            Into the house. But long he laid the law <lb/>
            Unto himself before he would adventure. <lb/>
            Ent'ring he saw the walls lin'd round with brass, <lb/>
            And fring'd about with colour of the sky. <lb/>
            The door within golden all over was, <lb n="75"/>
            And all appear'd like heaven to the eye. <lb/>
            The door-posts silver, glorious to behold, <lb/>
            The lintle-tree upon them silver too; <lb/>
            The sill was brass, the ring to pull it, gold. <lb/>
            And by the door great dogs were standing two, <lb n="80"/>
            Of silver one. the other was of gold, <lb/>
            As watch before the royal gate to stay, <lb/>
            Immortal dogs that never can grow old. <lb/>
            And round about them all, thrones ev'ry way, <lb/>
            All cover'd with a dainty stuff and fine, <lb n="85"/>
            The work of women's hand. There us'd to eat <lb/>
            The king and lords, and drink and make good cheer. <lb/>
            His riches was a never-dying teat. <lb/>
            About the altar were set boys of gold, <lb/>
            That to the guests, as soon as it was night, <lb n="90"/>
            With burning torches they the light might hold; <lb/>
            For now the sun had borne away his light. <lb/>
            Fifty maid-servants were at work within. <lb/>
            Some at the mill were grinding wheat for bread, <lb/>
            And others with their distaffs sat to spin, <lb n="95"/>
            And others cloth were weaving with the thread; <lb/>
            Like to the leaves of a high aspen tree <lb/>
            Their fingers went. So much they did excel <lb/>
            In all the works, that taught by Pallas be, <lb/>
            The women that in other places dwell; <lb n="100"/>
            As do these men all other men surpass <lb/>
            In all things that belong to navigation; <lb/>
            For wit and art more Pallas given has <lb/>
            To them, than women of another nation. <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            Close by the house a dainty orchard is, <note type="margin"> LIB. VII. <lb/>

            Four-square and fenc'd with hedge and pale about, <lb/>
            Of pear, pomegranate, apple, olive-trees, <lb/>
            And fig-trees. For the season ne'er goes out <lb/>
            Summer nor winter, for by Zephyrs some <lb/>
            Are made put forth, and others ripened; <lb n="110"/>
            Pears after pears, apples to apples come; <lb/>
            Grapes are by grapes, figs by figs followed; <lb/>
            And in it was the vineyard of the king. <lb/>
            Grapes in some places by the sun were dried, <lb/>
            In others staid till vintage ripening. <lb n="115"/>
            Upon some vines no flower yet was spied, <lb/>
            And grapes on some to blacken now began. <lb/>
            Green beds of herbs there were on ev'ry side, <lb/>
            And through it from two springs the water ran, <lb/>
            And to and fro the one did winding glide, <lb n="120"/>
            The other to the house his stream did bear, <lb/>
            And under ground was to the town convey'd, <lb/>
            And rose a fountain for the people there. <lb/>
            And when Ulysses had all this survey'd, <lb/>
            Then went he in, and found them in the hall <lb n="125"/>
            Sitting at supper, and to Mercury <lb/>
            There off'ring up of wine : which last of all <lb/>
            At bed-time men do offer usually. <lb/>
            And on he went up to the king and queen, <lb/>
            And both his hands upon her knee did lay. <lb n="130"/>
            Pallas had kept him in the mist unseen ; <lb/>
            But thither come, the mist straight fell away. <lb/>
            Amaz'd they were when first they saw the man, <lb/>
            And like to men that had been stricken dumb. <lb/>
            Ulysses then t' Arete thus began : <lb n="135"/>
            O queen Arete, to your knee I come, <lb/>
            And to the king, and those that with you sit: <lb/>
            May the Gods grant you all much happiness, <lb/>
            Long life, and your possessions to transmit <lb/>
            T' your children, and your honours still possess; <lb n="140"/>
            And may you me send presently away <lb/>
            Unto my house: long absent I have been. <lb/>
            This said, he sat down by the fire. And they <lb/>
            Said nothing, such amazement they were in. <lb/>
            At last old Echineus spake, that knew <lb n="145"/>
            Both what in former times and now was fit: <lb/>
            0 king Alcinous, is't good, think you, <lb/>
            To let the stranger in the ashes sit ? <lb/>
            We silent sat to see what was your will; <lb/>
             Pray make him rise, and to a chair him bring, <lb n="150"/>
            And bid the squire to temper wine and fill, <lb/>
            That we to Jove may make our offering, <lb/>
            Who with poor strangers keepeth company; <lb/>
            And bid the maid before him set such meat <pb n="368"/>

            This said, Alcinous rose from his seat, <lb/>
            T' Ulysses went, and took him by the hand. <lb/>
            And to a chair him led, where sat his son <lb/>
            Laodamas, to whom he gave command <lb/>
            To give him place, although he loved none <lb n="160"/>
            So dearly as he lov'd Laodamas, <lb/>
            Who next unto him us'd to sit at meat. <lb/>
            Then by a maid brought in a bason was <lb/>
            And ewer of gold, to wash ere he did eat; <lb/>
            Another maid before him layed bread, <lb n="165"/>
            And other good things on his table laid, <lb/>
            And heartily thereon Ulysses fed. <lb/>
            Alcinous then to the squire said: <lb/>
            Temper the wine, Pontonous, that we <lb/>
            Wine-offering to Jove may offer up, <lb n="170"/>
            In whose protection all suppliants be, <lb/>
            And round about presented be the cup. <lb/>
            Then went about the wine from one to one; <lb/>
            And when the sacred offering was over, <lb/>
            Then said Alcinous: Since we have done, <lb n="175"/>
            Let's go to bed, and soon as we discover <lb/>
            Aurora rising, hither come again, <lb/>
            And make unto the Gods a sacrifice, <lb/>
            And this our stranger farther entertain, <lb/>
            And how to send him to his house advise, <lb n="180"/>
            That safely he may go, and joyfully, <lb/>
            And swiftly to the place where he would be, <lb/>
            How far soever hence his dwelling lie, <lb/>
            Nor on the sea delay or trouble see, <lb/>
            Until his native country he be at: <lb n="185"/>
            But what his fate is after he is there, <lb/>
            Be't good or evil, he must suffer that. <lb/>
            But if it be some God that sittetli here, <lb/>
            'Tis only our devotion t' approve; <lb/>
            For to that end Gods let themselves be spied, <lb n="190"/>
            To sit with men at holy feasts they love, <lb/>
            And not themselves in caves like giants hide. <lb/>
            To this Ulysses said: 0 king, lay by <lb/>
            That thought of yours. With Gods I'll not compare, <lb/>
            For body or for mind. Of misery <lb n="195"/>
            If man can boast, to boast 'mong them I dare; <lb/>
            For I more tokens can produce of woe <lb/>
            Than any man that shall with me contend, <lb/>
            Though all I tell not that I can. Yet so <lb/>
            I fain would of my supper make an end. <lb n="200"/>
            No creature is so fierce as is the gut, <lb/>
            And so loud barketh when it is forgot, <lb/>
            That out of mind it never can be put, <lb/>
            But will be heard whether one will or not. <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            So 'tis with me, that am afflicted sore, <note type="margin"> LIB. VII. <lb/>

            Yet still my belly bids me eat and drink, <lb/>
            And forget all I had endured before, <lb/>
            And on my misery no more to think. <lb/>
            And so, since now I hunger to go home, <lb/>
            Forget not with a ship me to supply <lb n="210"/>
            To-morrow: for were I once thither come, <lb/>
            I could be well contented there to die. <lb/>
            When this was said, he was by all commended. <lb/>
            He speaks discreetly; let him then, said they, <lb/>
            A speedy conduct have. When all was ended, <lb n="215"/>
            The rest unto their houses went away. <lb/>
            Only Ulysses stay'd, and by him sate <lb/>
            The king and queen. Tables removed were, <lb/>
            And all that to the supper did relate; <lb/>
            The queen then marked what garments he did wear, <lb n="220"/>
            And that she and her maids had made them, knew. <lb/>
            Stranger, said she, who are you? whence? and more, <lb/>
            The garments you have on, of whom had you? <lb/>
            Had you them on, then, when you came ashore ? <lb/>
            Grievous, said he, 0 queen, is your command, <lb n="225"/>
            That calls again, when past it is, my pain; <lb/>
            Yet will I answer make to this demand. <lb/>
            An island lieth far hence in the main, <lb/>
            Ogygia 'tis call'd ; Calypso there, <lb/>
            The daughter fair of Atlas, lives alone, <lb n="230"/>
            Nor God nor man she has to dwell with her; <lb/>
            And I by fate upon that isle was thrown, <lb/>
            For Jove my good ship had with thunder split: <lb/>
            My fellows in the sea all perished, <lb/>
            But I the rudder had, and held by it: <lb n="235"/>
            And thus nine days and nights I wandered, <lb/>
            And thrown was on that isle the tenth, at night. <lb/>
            Calypso there received me, and fed ; <lb/>
            And immortality have had I might, <lb/>
            If I had with her there inhabited. <lb n="240"/>
            But I to that would never give consent. <lb/>
            Yet there by force I stayed seven years, <lb/>
            For want of ship and men, in discontent, <lb/>
            Washing the clothes she gave me with my tears. <lb/>
            The eighth year come, she did my going press, <lb n="245"/>
            Whether by Jove's command I cannot say, <lb/>
            Or whether 'twere because she loved me less. <lb/>
            Then on a raft of trees I came away. <lb/>
            Bread and sweet wine upon the deck she laid, <lb/>
            And garments gave me fair, and a good wind ; <lb n="250"/>
            And good for seventeen days the weather stay'd. <lb/>
            On th' eighteenth near your coast myself I find ; <lb/>
            And glad I was, though still unfortunate, <lb/>
            For more I was to suffer by and by: <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <pb n="370"/>

            A storm of winds, with furious waves and high, <lb/>
            And then I forced was the raft to quit: <lb/>
            The trees asunder floated here and there, <lb/>
            The storm so broken had and scattered it. <lb/>
            Then swam I: 'gainst the rocks the waves me bear, <lb n="260"/>
            And falling off, they cast me back again. <lb/>
            Again I swam, and to the river came, <lb/>
            And there I saw the landing smooth and plain, <lb/>
            And from the wind defended was the same: <lb/>
            There landed I, half dead, and now 'twas night. <lb n="265"/>
            Then up I went and in a thicket lay, <lb/>
            Covered with leaves abundance, dry and light, <lb/>
            And slept till almost spent was the next day, <lb/>
            For then the sun was setting. There I hear <lb/>
            The voice of women playing by the brook; <lb n="270"/>
            And going out I saw your daughter there, <lb/>
            That like a Goddess come from heaven did look. <lb/>
            To her I made my prayer in this distress: <lb/>
            Wisely she answered, and beyond her age, <lb/>
            (For th' younger commonly consider less), <lb n="275"/>
            And gave me food my hunger to assuage. <lb/>
            Of her I had the garments I have on. <lb/>
            Nay, stranger, answered Alcinous, <lb/>
            'Twas in my child an indiscretion, <lb/>
            That she not brought you with her to my house. <lb n="280"/>
            To this Ulysses answered and said: <lb/>
            'Twas not her fault we came not both together: <lb/>
            She bade me, I would not; but was afraid <lb/>
            Whatyou and they would think that saw me with her, <lb/>
            For jealous and mistrustful mortals be. <lb n="285"/>
            To this again Alcinous replied: <lb/>
            From such ill thoughts I always have been free. <lb/>
            O Jove and Pallas make you here abide; <lb/>
            Such are you, and our thoughts so well agree, <lb/>
            That you Nausicaa should have for bride, <lb n="290"/>
            If you would with me live here willingly, <lb/>
            And for your house and wealth I would provide. <lb/>
            But 'gainst your will I will not make you stay <lb/>
            (From such iniquity the Gods me keep); <lb/>
            To-morrow shall be ready your convey, <lb n="295"/>
            And till then go you to your bed and sleep. <lb/>
            And here be men, that, when the wind shall fail, <lb/>
            Can row you on how far soe'er you'll go; <lb/>
            Their hands can do as much as any sail, <lb/>
            Although beyond Eubœa they must row: <lb n="300"/>
            For farther no Phœacian ever went. <lb/>
            But thither once they carried Rhadamant, <lb/>

            But you yourself, when you are on the way, <lb/>

            This said, Ulysses joyful was, and pray'd, <lb/>

            The glory of the king will be displayed, <lb/>

            Whilst they together thus discoursing stay'd, <lb/>

            And under them soft woolly blankets spread. <lb/>
            Then went away the maids into the porch, <lb/>

            Ulysses to his bed went willingly. <lb/>

            When they should put him to experiment. <lb/>
            Alcinous unto them then arises; <lb/>
            Hear, said he, princes of Phœacia, <lb n="25"/>
            This man (who 'tis, or whence, I cannot say) <lb/>
            Cast here ashore, till then I never saw. <lb/>
            Since 'tis our custom, grant him a convoy. <lb/>
            For no man yet unto my house did come, <lb/>
            By force of weather wandering on the main, <lb n="30"/>
            Lamenting and desiring to go home, <lb/>
            That can affirm he sought our help in vain. <lb/>
            Come then, let's launch a good new ship, and choose <lb/>
            Out two-and-fifty lusty youths to row; <lb/>
            And let them ready have their oars to use, <lb n="35"/>
            And to my house, when that's done, let them go. <lb/>
            And you the princes thither come with me, <lb/>
            That we may well the stranger entertain. <lb/>
            And let the singer too sent thither be, <lb/>
            To give us sometimes of his art a strain. <lb n="40"/>
            This said, the princes to his house he led. <lb/>
            The squire unto the house the singer sent. <lb/>
            The fifty-two, as they were ordered, <lb/>
            Down to the haven where the ship lay went. <lb/>
            The ship they launch, and up they set the mast; <lb n="45"/>
            And then the yards and sails they hoisted high ; <lb/>
            Their oars, where they be placed should, they plac'd. <lb/>
            This done they let her in the water lie. <lb/>
            Then also to the house these men went up. <lb/>
            The porches, court, and rooms with men were fill'd, <lb n="50"/>
            Some old, some young. The king to make them sup, <lb/>
            Two kine, eight swine, and twice six fat sheep kill'd. <lb/>
            These flay'd and dress'd, and to the tables brought, <lb/>
            Came in the singer, whom the muses kind <lb/>
            Had taught to sing divinely; but, could not <lb n="55"/>
            Or would not him preserve from being blind. <lb/>
            Pontonous the squire then led him in, <lb/>
            And set him by a pillar in the hall, <lb/>
            And hung his fiddle o'er him on a pin, <lb/>
            And how to reach it showed him withal: <lb n="60"/>
            Sets him a table and a basket by, <lb/>
            And a great bowl of wine before him plac'd, <lb/>
            To drink as often as he should be dry. <lb/>
            And when their thirst and hunger was displac'd, <lb/>
            The singer sung the song in most request, <lb n="65"/>
            How once Ulysses and Achilles great <lb/>

            When he at Pythos asked him about <lb/>
            The issue of the fleet design'd for Troy. <lb/>
            This song Demodocus sung to them then; <lb/>
            Which to Ulysses was of little joy; <lb n="75"/>
            But he his tears to hide before those men, <lb/>
            Before his eyes his cloak of purple drew, <lb/>
            And when the singer ceas'd, his eyes he dried, <lb/>
            And from before his face his cloak withdrew, <lb/>
            And of the wine perform'd the sacrifice. <lb n="80"/>
            And when the lords call'd for the song anew, <lb/>
            (For they to hear him took no small delight), <lb/>
            His cloak again before his eyes he drew, <lb/>
            And as before again he sobb'd and sigh'd. <lb/>
            Alcinous, none else, observed it, <lb n="85"/>
            And well enough could hear him sigh and groan; <lb/>
            For he the nearest there did to him sit, <lb/>
            And would not to the princes make it known. <lb/>
            But speaking to them all said only this: <lb/>
            Since you with feasting are well satisfied, <lb n="90"/>
            And music (which to feasts annexed is), <lb/>
            Let now our men's activity be tried, <lb/>
            That when the stranger is where he doth dwell, <lb/>
            He to his friends and countrymen may tell <lb/>
            How much we do all other men excel <lb n="95"/>
            At wrestling, buffets, leaping, running well. <lb/>
            Then went the king and princes out a door; <lb/>
            The squire then took the singer by the hand, <lb/>
            And hung the fiddle where it hung before, <lb/>
            And him led out amongst the rest to stand. <lb n="100"/>
            Unto the place they went; and follow'd were <lb/>
            By people numberless the sports to see; <lb/>
            And many lusty youths amongst them there, <lb/>

            Eretmeus, Thoon, Nautes, and Prymneus, <lb/>

            Then start they all at once, and swiftly run <lb/>

            Euryalus at wrestling was the best. <lb/>
            Amphialus at leaping victor was. <lb/>
            Elatreus surpassed all the rest <lb/>
            To throw the stone. At cuffs Laodamas. <lb/>
            When all was done Laodamas up stood. <lb n="125"/>
            Come friends, said he, let us the stranger try <lb/>
            If he at any of these games be good; <lb/>
            For in his person no defect I spy. <lb/>
            His thighs, his knees, his arms, his neck, are strong, <lb/>
            Nor over aged yet he seems to me; <lb n="130"/>
            Only he hath endured the sea so long, <lb/>
            As for that cause he may excused be. <lb/>
            For than the sea nothing more potent is <lb/>
            To break a man how strong soe'er he be. <lb/>
            Go, said Euryalus, 'tis not amiss <lb n="135"/>
            T'invite him to it, and his mind to see. <lb/>
            Then to Ulysses said Laodamas, <lb/>
            Come, stranger, father, pray, your virtue show; <lb/>
            'Tis no dishonour for you in this place <lb/>
            To show your skill at any game you know, <lb n="140"/>
            As long as feet and hands continue strong. <lb/>
            ' Come, try, and cast your careful thoughts away: <lb/>
            Your convoy ready is. 'Twill not be long <lb/>
            Before you shall be set upon your way. <lb/>
            Laodamas, then said Ulysses, why <lb n="145"/>
            To these your games invite you me in scorn, <lb/>
            Upon whose heart so many sorrows lie, <lb/>
            And am to nothing with much hardship worn, <lb/>
            And publicly a suppliant now sit, <lb/>
            And to the king and people grief profess? <lb n="150"/>
            Think you that pastimes for such men are fit, <lb/>
            As from their country wander in distress? <lb/>
            Then spake Euryalus, uncivilly: <lb/>
            No, no, said he, I do not think you are <lb/>
            Much us'd to pastimes of activity, <lb n="155"/>
            But rather one that of a ship takes care, <lb/>
            That merchantmen from place to place conveys, <lb/>
            And mindful of your fraught are, and can tell <lb/>
            Which are to sudden wealth the nearest ways, <lb/>
            What merchandise will not, and what will sell, <lb n="160"/>
            And in such boisterous games has little skill. <lb/>
            Ulysses frowning on him then replied: <lb/>
            My friend, such words are indiscreet and ill. <lb/>
            The Gods the gifts as they think fit divide. <lb/>
            To one, of beauty they deny the grace, <lb n="165"/>

            Only you want the grace to say what's fit. <lb/>
            Your words have put me into passion. <lb/>
            In these your games you say no skill have I. <lb/>
            I thought myself interior to none, <lb n="175"/>
            Whilst on my youth and hands I could rely. <lb/>
            But tamed now my strength is with much woe, <lb/>
            Wandering at sea, and often hurt in fight. <lb/>
            Yet of your games I'll make a trial so, <lb/>
            Weak as I am. So much your words me bite. <lb n="180"/>
            This said, he took up a much greater stone <lb/>
            Than that which the Phceacians had flung, <lb/>
            Now hollow as a quoit, his cloak still on. <lb/>
            And when above his head he had it swung, <lb/>
            Swiftly away the stone flew with a hum, <lb n="185"/>
            Which made the brave Phceacian seamen couch, <lb/>
            As o'er their heads they heard it singing come, <lb/>
            And outwent all the other marks by much. <lb/>
            For Pallas in the likeness of a man <lb/>
            Did set a mark at where the stone did light, <lb n="190"/>
            And said the difference be discerned can <lb/>
            By feeling, though a man had lost his sight. <lb/>
            And to Ulysses said he, Do not fear <lb/>
            That any man i' th' town shall out-throw this. <lb/>
            Ulysses very glad was this to hear, <lb n="195"/>
            And that amongst them stood one friend of his. <lb/>
            Then of himself began to speak more high. <lb/>
            Come youths, throw first as far as I have done, <lb/>
            And then as far or further throw will I. <lb/>
            And for the other games come any one, <lb n="200"/>
            Since your sharp words provok'd me have thereto, <lb/>
            Buffets, or wrestling, or to run the race, <lb/>
            And see if you at these can me out-do, <lb/>
            Any of you except Laodamas. <lb/>
            For I to him have come as to a friend <lb n="205"/>
            Of whom I hope for succour in my need. <lb/>
            He were a fool that with him would contend, <lb/>
            Without whose help his business cannot speed. <lb/>
            But of the rest not any I refuse; <lb/>
            And will contend with them for mastery. <lb n="210"/>
            For I know all the games the best men use. <lb/>
            To use the bow none abler is than I. <lb/>
            When many of us had a mind to kill <lb/>
            Some noted foe, and all at once did shoot, <lb/>
            Though every one of us had the same will, <lb n="215"/>
            My arrow was the first that found him out. <lb/>
            At Ilium in trials of the bow <lb/>
            None found I better than myself but one; <lb/>
            'Twas Polyctetes. Of those that are now <pb n="376"/>

            I think myself inferior to none. <lb n="220"/>
            With those of former time I'll not compare, <lb/>
            As Hercules, or Eurytus that durst <lb/>
            Challenge Apollo. Apollo took a care <lb/>
            That prize should not be play'd, and kill'd him first. <lb/>
            As far as other men can shoot an arrow, <lb n="225"/>
            So far I able am to dart a spear. <lb/>
            But lodging I have had at sea so narrow, <lb/>
            That I may be out-run by some man here. <lb/>
            So said Ulysses; and all silent sat <lb/>
            Except the king, who thus unto him said: <lb n="230"/>
            Stranger, there's no man here offended at <lb/>
            The words you say. For open you have laid <lb/>
            Your virtue, when you were thereto constrain'd <lb/>
            By the unjust reproaches of this man. <lb/>
            For such it is as by none can be stain'd, <lb n="235"/>
            But those that nothing say discreetly can. <lb/>
            And hear me farther what I have to say, <lb/>
            That t'other heroes you the same may tell, <lb/>
            Who with you and your wife shall feasting stay, <lb/>
            In what from other men we bear the bell. <lb n="240"/>
            For cuffs and wrestling, not much praise we merit, <lb/>
            But our good ships and fleets are wondrous swift. <lb/>
            And these gifts from our fathers we inherit, <lb/>
            Dance, song, feasts, fiddle, and of garments shift, <lb/>
            And baths, and beds. Dance you that dance the best <lb n="245"/>
            Before the stranger, that his friends among <lb/>
            He may say how much we exceed the rest <lb/>
            Of men, in ships, in running, dance, and song. <lb/>
            Fetch out the fiddle. Then the squire went in <lb/>
            To fetch the fiddle. And the judges rise, <lb n="250"/>
            In number nine, who had elected been <lb/>
            By public vote, of games to hold assize; <lb/>
            And order took for large room in the middle, <lb/>
            And made it to be planed well and even. <lb/>
            When this was done, then brought out was the fiddle, <lb n="255"/>
            And by the squire was to the singer given. <lb/>
            Then came the young men that had learnt to dance, <lb/>
            And of their age were yet but in the flower, <lb/>
            And to the middest of the place advance. <lb/>
            Their feet play up and down like drops in show'r; <lb n="260"/>
            Such sparkling feet Ulysses ne'er had seen. <lb/>
            The singer as he played sung the song <lb/>
            Of Mars and Venus, and what love had been <lb/>
            Held secretly between them all along; <lb/>
            And how in Vulcan's house they used to meet; <lb n="265"/>
            And what he gave her; how the prying Run, <lb/>
            As they embrae'd each other, chanc'd to see't, <lb/>
            And told her husband Vulcan what was done- <lb/>
            How Vulcan to his forge in anger went, <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            And on his anvil hammered out strong chains, <note type="margin"> LIB. VIII. <lb/>

            Which neither could be broken, nor relent; <lb/>
            And when he made an end had of his pains, <lb/>
            Into the chamber went where stood his bed. <lb/>
            His net o'th'bed-posts, and the beams he threw, <lb/>
            Like spider-webs about a chamber spread; <lb n="275"/>
            And then to go to Lemnos made a show. <lb/>
            So subtle were the chains and finely wrought, <lb/>
            They could by none, although a God, be seen. <lb/>
            How Mars to watch his going failed not. <lb/>
            When Vulcan was gone out, then Mars went in. <lb n="280"/>
            How Venus entered in, new come from Jove, <lb/>
            And by him sate. Mars took her by the hand, <lb/>
            And to her said, Let's go to bed, my love. <lb/>
            Vulcan is now at Lemnos gone a land. <lb/>
            And how they went to bed and made the net <lb n="285"/>
            Fall down upon, and hold them as they lay. <lb/>
            And how they knew no way from thence to get, <lb/>
            But must till Vulcan came to free them stay. <lb/>
            How Vulcan from hard by came quickly in; <lb/>
            For back he came before he was half way: <lb n="290"/>
            For by the Sun advertised he had been, <lb/>
            And angrily turn'd back without delay; <lb/>
            And roaring to the Gods, he said, Dye see <lb/>
            What work is here, and how unseemly 'tis? <lb/>
            And how Jove's daughter does dishonour me, <lb n="295"/>
            Because my limbs are maim d, and whole are his ? <lb/>
            I grant he's fair, nor doth as I do halt; <lb/>
            Ought she to love him therefore more than me? <lb/>
            For that my parents' is, and not my fault. <lb/>
            But come, ye Gods all, and their posture see; <lb n="300"/>
            I hate the sight, yet they must not therefore <lb/>
            Hope e'er the sooner for that, to be free. <lb/>
            The net will suffer them to move no more, <lb/>
            How keen soever on their love they be; <lb/>
            And till her father shall the dow'r repay <lb n="305"/>
            Which for the girl, although incontinent, <lb/>
            I paid him down, 'cause fair she was and gay, <lb/>
            There they shall lie. This said, the Gods straight went <lb/>
            To Vulcan's house. Neptune and Mercury, <lb/>
            And with them, with his silver bow, Apollo, <lb n="310"/>
            And many others. But (for modesty) <lb/>
            No Goddess could persuaded be to follow. <lb/>
            As soon as they perceived had the craft, <lb/>
            Which standing in the door they had survey'd; <lb/>
            At first aloud they altogether laugh, <lb n="315"/>
            And by-and-by to one another said, <lb/>
            I see that evil works do ill succeed. <lb/>
            The slow has gotten of the swift the better ; <lb/>
            Vulcan of Mars the God of greatest speed, <pb n="378"/>

            And that by arts which make his ransom greater. <lb n="320"/>
            And how Apollo did the question put <lb/>
            To Mercury, if he content would be <lb/>
            In such strong chains with Venus to be shut, <lb/>
            While all the Gods are standing by and see. <lb/>
            How Hermes said, 0 Phoebus, that I were <lb n="325"/>
            In Mars his place, and did with Venus lie, <lb/>
            And thrice as many chains about us there, <lb/>
            Though all the Gods and Goddesses stood by. <lb/>
            And how the Gods at this laugh'd out again, <lb/>
            Save Neptune only, who did never cease <lb n="330"/>
            T'importune Vulcan and his wrath restrain, <lb/>
            And that he would the God of war release; <lb/>
            And that himself would pay him what was due <lb/>
            If Mars did not. How Vulcan said again, <lb/>
            If Mars should fly, shall I imprison you ? <lb n="335"/>
            Unsure the suretyship is of fled men. <lb/>
            And that again Neptune replying said, <lb/>
            Though Mars should run away, yet I will not. <lb/>
            And how that Vulcan at the last obey'd, <lb/>
            And Mars and Venus out of prison got, <lb n="240"/>
            And he to Thrace went, but to Cyprus she; <lb/>
            Where she a temple and an altar had, <lb/>
            And by the Graces that her servants be <lb/>
            Bath'd and anointed was and Godlike clad. <lb/>
            These of the merry song were the contents. <lb n="245"/>
            Ulysses was well pleased with the same; <lb/>
            And of the rest delighted was the sense. <lb/>
            Alcinous then called out by name <lb/>
            Laodamas and Halius to dance. <lb/>
            None else for either of them was a match. <lb n="250"/>
            And they into the midst themselves advance <lb/>
            The one to throw a ball, th' other to catch. <lb/>
            One threw't up high, reclining on his hip; <lb/>
            The other of the same the downfall watch'd, <lb/>
            And taking from the ground a lusty skip, <lb n="255"/>
            His feet above ground, in the air it catch'd. <lb/>
            When this was done, they laid aside the ball, <lb/>
            And danc'd with often changes on the ground; <lb/>
            Applauded much by the spectators all, <lb/>
            Who with their praises made the place resound. <lb n="260"/>
            O king, then said Ulysses, what you said <lb/>
            Of how your men pass all the world beside <lb/>
            In noble dance, can never be gainsaid. <lb/>
            I see it to my wonder justified. <lb/>
            The king well pleased to the princes spake: <lb n="265"/>
            A worthy man the stranger seems to me; <lb/>
            Let's think upon what present him to make. <lb/>
            Twelve princes in Phœacia there be, <lb/>
            And I the thirteenth am. Let's ev'ry one <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            Bestow on him a handsome cloak and coat, <note type="margin"> LIB. VIII. </note><note type="margin"> The next day's <lb/>

            Besides a talent of pure gold. That done, <lb/>
            Let it be altogether to him brought, <lb/>
            That he at supper may sit cheerfully. <lb/>
            And you, Euryalus, go speak him fair, <lb/>
            For what you said before was injury; <lb n="275"/>
            Go therefore with some gift your fault repair. <lb/>
            This said, to fetch the gifts they sent the squire. <lb/>
            Then said Euryalus, 0 king, since 'tis, <lb/>
            That also I present him, your desire; <lb/>
            I will for reconcilement give him this <lb n="280"/>
            My sword, with scabbard all of ivory, <lb/>
            And silver hilt. The present is not poor. <lb/>
            And giving it: 0 father, though, said he, <lb/>
            I said amiss, pray think upon't no more; <lb/>
            And may the Gods restore you to your land, <lb n="285"/>
            Since absent from your friends you live in pain. <lb/>
            Ulysses took the sword into his hand, <lb/>
            And to Euryalus thus said again: <lb/>
            And you, my friend, may you still happy be, <lb/>
            And of this sword for ever need have none, <lb n="290"/>
            Which reconciling you have given me. <lb/>
            And as he speaking was he put it on. <lb/>
            The sun now set, the king no longer tarried, <lb/>
            But with the lords went to his house to sup. <lb/>
            Along with them the squires the presents carried <lb n="295"/>
            Unto the queen Arete to lay up. <lb/>
            Alcinous then said unto the queen, <lb/>
            Let a fair chest be straightway hither brought, <lb/>
            And for the stranger see there be laid in <lb/>
            A comely and well-wash'd cloak and coat, <lb n="300"/>
            And of warm water let a bath stand by, <lb/>
            That washing he may see the presents there, <lb/>
            And sit at supper the more joyfully, <lb/>
            And hearken to the song with better cheer; <lb/>
            And I will give him this my cup of gold, <lb n="305"/>
            That off'ring up unto the Gods the wine, <lb/>
            As often as he doth the cup behold, <lb/>
            He may both for his own health pray and mine. <lb/>
            This said, the maids, commanded by the queen, <lb/>
            Set up a cauldron with a triple foot, <lb n="310"/>
            Then make fire under, and pour water in. <lb/>
            Keen was the fire, and soon the water hot. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the queen came in, and with her brought <lb/>
            A curious chest, and into it laid in <lb/>
            The gold, and with it every cloak and coat, <lb n="315"/>
            That by the princes given him had been. <lb/>
            And then unto Ulysses said, Take care <lb/>
            You bind it fast, lest you be robb'd by one <lb/>
            Or other, whilst aboard you sleeping are, <pb n="380"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. VIlI. </note><note type="margin"> The next day's <lb/>

            Lest anything should missing be and gone. <lb n="320"/>
            And when she thus had him admonished, <lb/>
            Ulysses of the chest pull'd down the lid, <lb/>
            And girt it with a cord of various thread, <lb/>
            Thereby to know if any it undid, <lb/>
            For that trick he by Circe taught had been. <lb n="325"/>
            A woman then unto Ulysses said, <lb/>
            There stands your bath, which way you please go in. <lb/>
            Then went he in, and not a little joy'd; <lb/>
            For after he had left Calypso's house, <lb/>
            Warm and sweet water he had never seen, <lb n="330"/>
            But roll'd by Neptune always was in souse, <lb/>
            But had with her carefully treated been. <lb/>
            When him the maids wash'd and anointed had, <lb/>
            Out from the bath he came amongst the men, <lb/>
            With a clean cloak and comely garments clad. <lb n="335"/>
            To th' door the bright Nausicaa came then, <lb/>
            And to Ulysses said, Stranger, farewell, <lb/>
            And may you safely at your land arrive; <lb/>
            Remember that into my hand you fell, <lb/>
            And owe to me that you were kept alive. <lb n="340"/>
            0, said Ulysses, daughter of the king, <lb/>
            To you the ransom of my life is due, <lb/>
            And if the Gods me to my country bring, <lb/>
            As to a Goddess I will pray to you. <lb/>
            This said, he went and sat down by the king. <lb n="345"/>
            And now the meat in messes some divided, <lb/>
            Others the lusty wine were tempering, <lb/>
            And by a squire the singer in was guided, <lb/>
            And at a pillar in the midst made sit. <lb/>
            Ulysses half a chine of pork and fat <lb n="350"/>
            Cuts off, and in the squire's hands putteth it, <lb/>
            And said unto him, Give the singer that; <lb/>
            Singers through all the world have reputation, <lb/>
            And well respected be in ev'ry land; <lb/>
            The Muses teach them song, and love the nation. <lb n="355"/>
            Then went the squire and put it in his hand; <lb/>
            Demodocus received it and was glad. <lb/>
            Then fell they to the meat before them laid. <lb/>
            When thirst and hunger overcome they had, <lb/>
            Unto the singer then Ulysses said: <lb n="360"/>
            Demodocus, you all men else excel. <lb/>
            The Muses sure did teach you, or it was <lb/>
            Phoebus himself. For you have sung so well <lb/>
            The acts that did 'twixt Greeks and Trojans pass, <lb/>
            And all related that they did at Troy, <lb n="365"/>
            Or suffer'd there, or when they homeward came, <lb/>
            As if yourself beheld had their annoy, <lb/>

            And how they fir'd their tents; and how the lords <lb/>
            Of Greece i' th' council of the Trojans sate, <lb/>
            Inclos'd and hidden in the horse of boards, <lb/>
            That by the Trojans was fetch'd in in state. <lb n="380"/>
            The Trojans sitting round about debate, <lb/>
            And many a foolish speech they uttered, <lb/>
            And on three points they there deliberate, <lb/>
            And voted what the Gods determined. <lb/>
            The three points which were most insisted on, <lb n="385"/>
            Were, whether they should cut the horse in twain, <lb/>
            Or throw it down the rock it stood upon, <lb/>
            Or let it, to appease the Gods, remain. <lb/>
            r th' end they all resolved on the last. <lb/>
            For by the Fates it was determined <lb n="390"/>
            That Ilium should then be layed waste, <lb/>
            When o'er its walls a great horse entered, <lb/>
            And in his belly brought the enemy. <lb/>
            And how the Argives from the horse came out, <lb/>
            How divers ways they went and cruelly <lb n="395"/>
            Killed and burned as they went about. <lb/>
            Ulysses then, like Mars, with Menelaus <lb/>
            Unto Deiphobus together hie, <lb/>
            And for awhile there sharp the battle was, <lb/>
            But to Ulysses fell the victory. <lb n="400"/>
            This sung Demodocus. And then upon <lb/>
            Ulysses' cheeks the tears ran down apace. <lb/>
            As when in fight a woman looketh on, <lb/>
            And sees her husband fallen on the place, <lb/>
            That fought had for his town and children dear; <lb n="405"/>
            There sprawleth he, she o'er him falls and cries, <lb/>
            But back and shoulders is well basted there, <lb/>
            And carried captive by the enemy. <lb/>
            As wofully as then this woman wept, <lb/>
            So wofully Ulysses now sheds tears; <lb n="410"/>
            But from the king it was not secret kept, <lb/>
            Who sitting next him all his groaning hears. <lb/>
            And speaking to the princes sitting by, <lb/>
            Let us, said he, Demodocus release, <lb/>
            His song not pleaseth all the company; <lb n="415"/>
            It makes the stranger's sorrow to increase, <lb/>
            And brings some grief or other to his mind. <lb/>

            A guest is as a brother to be used, <lb/>

            And you, my guest, you cannot be excus'd, <lb/>
            If you not answer truth to all I ask. <lb n="425"/>
            Say what's the name your parents call you by? <lb/>
            You must no longer now keep on your mask, <lb/>
            Children new-born not long unnamed lie; <lb/>
            Tell me your land and city where it<lb/>
            That my good ship may know where you would be, <lb n="430"/>
            For in Phœacia no steersman is, <lb/>
            Nor rudder as in other ships you see; <lb/>
            Whither men bid them go they understand, <lb/>
            And pass in clouds concealed o'er the main, <lb/>
            And where the havens be in every land. <lb n="435"/>
            No fear they have of perishing or pain, <lb/>
            And yet my father to me once did say, <lb/>
            That with our convoys Neptune was offended, <lb/>
            And that one day our good ship to destoy <lb/>
            As it returned homewards he intended, <lb n="440"/>
            And from men hide our city with a hill. <lb/>
            But whether that shall be performed now, <lb/>
            I cannot tell. It lies in Neptune's will, <lb/>
            And not concerneth you at all to know. <lb/>
            But tell me now what lands you wand'ring saw, <lb n="445"/>
            What nations, and what cities you came to; <lb/>
            What kind of people, civil, or without law; <lb/>
            Civil or kind to strangers, godly or no. <lb/>
            When you heard sung the woful fate of Troy, <lb/>
            Why did you weep ? The Gods that built the town <lb n="450"/>
            Decreed thereat much people to destroy, <lb/>
            And that their fate should be sung up and down. <lb/>

            This is a thing that I love best; but you <lb/>
            Had rather hear the dangers I have pass'd, <lb n="10"/>
            Which fright me yet, and do my pain renew. <lb/>
            But which shall I tell first? which next? which last? <lb/>
            For they be many. First my name I'll tell, <lb/>
            And place, that whensoe'er you thither come <lb/>
            You may there lodge, although far off I dwell, <lb n="15"/>
            And am uncertain of my getting home. <lb/>
            I am Ulysses Laertiades, <lb/>
            And far and wide I am reputed wise <lb/>
            'Mongst men that love subtile conveyances, <lb/>
            And known I am by fame up to the skies. <lb n="20"/>
            My place is Ithaca, in which is store <lb/>
            Of wool. Mount Neriton is cloth'd with wood, <lb/>
            A goodly hill; and many islands more <lb/>
            Lie close about it, yielding store of food. <lb/>
            Dulichium, Same, and the woody Zant, <lb n="25"/>
            On th'east of Ithaca are situate. <lb/>
            Another island, which is called Ant, <lb/>
            Lies westward of it, but is low and flat. <lb/>
            Rocky is Ithaca, and uneven ground; <lb/>
            But breedeth able men. Nor have I known <lb n="30"/>
            The man that to his own mind ever found <lb/>
            A country that was better than his own. <lb/>
            From mine Calypso kept me in a cave, <lb/>
            T'have been her husband; so did Circe too: <lb/>
            But neither of them my consent could have, <lb n="35"/>
            So much could love of my own country do; <lb/>
            For though far off I might have better land, <lb/>
            Yet should I from my kindred absent live. <lb/>
            But now 'tis time to let you understand <lb/>
            What passage to me Jove was pleas'd to give. <lb n="40"/>
            From Troy to Ismarus we first were blown, <lb/>
            Within an isle, Cicons the natives are; <lb/>
            And soon we plundered and burnt the town, <lb/>
            And of the plunder each man had his share. <lb/>
            The wives we prisoners made, and to the sword <lb n="45"/>
            We put the men: and then without delay <lb/>
            I did command them all to go aboard; <lb/>
            But they, fools as they were, would not obey: <lb/>
            For they to kill, eat, drink, themselves apply, <lb/>
            Beeves, sheep, and wine, which they had on the beach. <lb n="50"/>
            Cicons meanwhile to Cicons so loud cry, <lb/>
            That to the continent their voices reach; <lb/>
            And presently came others, numberless <lb/>
            As leaves in summer; stout and men of skill, <pb n="384"/>

            Or else on foot, according as they will <lb/>
            Jove had decreed us mischief, and the hour <lb/>
            Was come: and just before our ships we fought, <lb/>
            Spears were our weapons, which with all our power <lb/>
            We lanced on both sides with courage stout. <lb n="60"/>
            Whilst the sun mounted we resisted well, <lb/>
            But after noon they pressed us so sore, <lb/>
            That with the falling sun our courage fell; <lb/>
            And then in haste we thrust our ships from shore. <lb/>
            From out of every ship six men we lost: <lb n="65"/>
            And then with heavy hearts our sails we hoist, <lb/>
            And grieved for our fellows left the coast; <lb/>
            But first to ev'ry of them called thrice <lb/>
            Whom slain by th' enemy we left behind. <lb/>
            Then Jove with clouds both land and water veils, <lb n="70"/>
            And night came on us with a furious wind <lb/>
            From the north part of heaven, and tore our sails <lb/>
            In threes and fours, and all our ships were tost <lb/>
            Hither and thither, sideways with their blasts, <lb/>
            And one another's way hindered and crost. <lb n="75"/>
            Then took we in our sails, and down our masts, <lb/>
            For fear of death, and laid them on the decks, <lb/>
            And with our oars rowed our ships to land; <lb/>
            Two nights and days we staid, while grief did vex <lb/>
            Each mind, and labour tired had each hand. <lb n="80"/>
            But when the morn had led forth the third day, <lb/>
            We then set sail, and left their course to th' wind ; <lb/>
            The which (we sitting still) did them convey <lb/>
            According as the steersmen had design'd. <lb/>
            And I had safely come to Ithaca, <lb n="85"/>
            Had not the north wind with the tide o' th' sea, <lb/>
            When I was come to th' Cape of Malea, <lb/>
            Forced us without the isle of Cyther6. <lb/>
            The horrid winds now found me on the main, <lb/>
            And toss'd me into one another's hand. <lb n="90"/>
            Nine days together I endur'd this pain; <lb/>
            Upon the tenth they cast me on a land <lb/>
            Where dwell a people call'd Lotophagi, <lb/>
            That have and live upon a fruit full sweet <lb/>
            I'th'continent. We went ashore; there I <lb n="95"/>
            Made them take in fresh water for the fleet. <lb/>
            Then having quickly supp'd, I chose out two <lb/>
            Of my companions to go and see <lb/>
            What men they were; with them I sent also <lb/>
            A third, who went as messenger from me. <lb n="100"/>
            They quickly went; but mingled with those men, <lb/>
            Who meant no harm, but gave them lote to eat, <lb/>
            Which made them hate returning back again, <lb/>
            And suddenly their country to forget: <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            And with the people there resolv'd to stay, <note type="margin"> LIR. IX. <lb/>

            forgetting home tor love of lote. But I <lb/>
            Sent those that quickly fetched them away <lb/>
            By force, and under hatches did them tie. <lb/>
            The rest I bade unto their ships to haste, <lb/>
            Lest eating lote they should return no more. <lb n="110"/>
            Aboard they quickly come, and each one plac'd <lb/>
            In order, beats the grey sea with his oar. <lb/>
            Then to the land of Cyclopses we row, <lb/>
            Men proud and lawless, that rely for food <lb/>
            Upon the sky, and neither plant nor plough; <lb n="115"/>
            Yet have they barley, wheat, wine very good, <lb/>
            Unplough'd, unsown, fetch'd up by show'rs of rain. <lb/>
            They have no courts of counsel, nor of right. <lb/>
            On high huge hills themselves they entertain, <lb/>
            And in their rocky bellies pass the night. <lb n="120"/>
            Each man gives law to his own wife and brood: <lb/>
            Nor do they much for one another care. <lb/>
            Before the port an isle lies clad with wood, <lb/>
            Not very near, nor from it very far. <lb/>
            Wild goats in great abundance were therein : <lb n="125"/>
            Because there dwelt no man that might them kill, <lb/>
            Nor wretched hunters ever enter in, <lb/>
            To tire themselves running from hill to hill. <lb/>
            For the good ship with the vermilion cheeks <lb/>
            The Cyclopses have not, nor art to make <lb n="130"/>
            All that is needful for a man that seeks <lb/>
            Trade, and to pass the seas must undertake. <lb/>
            The island else they quickly might adorn. <lb/>
            The land is good; to th' sea sweet meadows lie, <lb/>
            And plentifully would yield wine and corn, <lb n="135"/>
            If it were helped with good husbandry. <lb/>
            Anchors and cables in the port needs none, <lb/>
            Nor any rope to tie the ship to land; <lb/>
            And when the master thinks fit to be gone, <lb/>
            With the first wind they take the oar in hand. <lb n="140"/>
            Within the entrance riseth a sweet spring <lb/>
            From out a cave, shaded with poplars tall; <lb/>
            Thither to shore our ships we safely bring. <lb/>
            Some God was guide. Nothing we saw at all. <lb/>
            Dark night it was, and nothing to be seen; <lb n="145"/>
            The air about us thick, and from the sky <lb/>
            The moon could not shine through the clouds between; <lb/>
            Nor waves, nor isle appear'd to any eye. <lb/>
            Then took we in our sails, and went to land, <lb/>
            And waited for the coming of the day, <lb n="150"/>
            And in the mean time slumbered on the sand; <lb/>
            But when we saw appear the morning gay, <lb/>
            Admiring th' isle, we walked to and fro, <lb/>
            Whilst the nymphs (sprung from Jove Ægiochus) <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> c c </note> <pb n="386"/>

            Down from the mountain brought the goats to us. <lb/>
            And presently from out our ships we take <lb/>
            Our bows and arrows keen and came away, <lb/>
            And of our company three troops we make; <lb/>
            Then shooting, soon we had a lovely prey. <lb n="160"/>
            Our ships were twelve, to which they equally <lb/>
            Divide the spoil; for every ship had nine, <lb/>
            Save only mine had ten: then merrily <lb/>
            All day we sit and feast on flesh and wine; <lb/>
            For we had wine enough as yet unspent, <lb n="165"/>
            Of that we got and brought away with us, <lb/>
            Which ev'ry man had into budgets pent, <lb/>
            Then when we took the town of Ismarus. <lb/>
            Close by we saw the land of Cyclopses, <lb/>
            And smoke, and heard the voice o'th'men, and sheep <lb n="170"/>
            And goats. 'Twas night, and on the sand o'th'sea <lb/>
            Ourselves till morning we refreshed with sleep. <lb/>
            But when the rosy morning 'gan t'appear, <lb/>
            My fellows I together call'd, and spake: <lb/>
            You, my companions, by the ships stay here; <lb n="175"/>
            I with my ship and crew will undertake <lb/>
            A trial of this people, whether wild, <lb/>
            And proud, and insolent their nature be, <lb/>
            Or whether they be men of nature mild, <lb/>
            Godly, and loving hospitality. <lb n="180"/>
            This said, I went aboard, and bade my crew <lb/>
            Embark themselves. Aboard they quickly come, <lb/>
            And sitting each man in his order due, <lb/>
            With stroke of oar they made the gray sea foam. <lb/>
            Arriv'd, we of a cavern saw the door, <lb n="185"/>
            Both high and wide, and sheep and goats there lay <lb/>
            Abundance sleeping. It was shaded o'er <lb/>
            With boughs that downward grew of laurel gay. <lb/>
            Before it was a court well fenced with stone, <lb/>
            And lusty oaks, and many a pine tree high. <lb n="190"/>
            I' th' cave a giant lodged, who used alone <lb/>
            His sheep to feed, no other Cyclops nigh. <lb/>
            It was a huge and ugly monster, and <lb/>
            Look'd not unlike a rocky mountain's head <lb/>
            That does 'mongst other hills asunder stand, <lb n="195"/>
            With a great perriwig of trees o'erspread. <lb/>
            Then bade I my companions to stay <lb/>
            And guard the ship, save that by lot a dozen <lb/>
            I took of them along with me, and they, <lb/>
            By chance, were the same men I would have chosen. <lb n="200"/>
            With me I took a goatskin full of wine, <lb/>
            Pleasant and strong, by Maron given me, <lb/>

            For which s ven talents of pure beaten gold, <lb/>
            And a large silver bowl he did me give <lb/>
            Freely, besides twelve budgets of wine old, <lb/>
            Pure, pleasant, precious drink it was, which none <lb/>
            Knew of besides himself, his wife and maid ; <lb n="210"/>
            Of the men servants that he kept, not one. <lb/>
            Which, when he drank, he usually allay'd <lb/>
            With water pure, full twenty times as much; <lb/>
            And when a man so temper'd had his cup, <lb/>
            Yet still the fragrant smell thereof was such, <lb n="215"/>
            He hardly could forbear to drink it up. <lb/>
            This goatskin I took with me in a case, <lb/>
            Expecting of some great and ghastly man, <lb/>
            That knew not law, nor right, to see the face; <lb/>
            And landing, quickly to the den we ran. <lb n="220"/>
            We entered in, but did not find him there; <lb/>
            But gaze we did at every thing with wonder: <lb/>
            Shelves full of cheese, as much as they could bear, <lb/>
            Pens full of sheep and goats, each sort asunder, <lb/>
            Old, younger, youngest; all vessels to the brim, <lb n="225"/>
            Pans, trays, and milking pails were full of whey. <lb/>
            My men desir'd me not to stay for him, <lb/>
            But make what haste I could to get away, <lb/>
            And take some of his cheeses from the shelves, <lb/>
            And sheep from out the pens, and then to go, <lb n="230"/>
            And setting up our sails to save ourselves. <lb/>
            But I would not, though 'thad been better so. <lb/>
            But I desired to see the man, and try <lb/>
            If from him some good gift I might obtain; <lb/>
            But they with fear were ready for to die, <lb n="235"/>
            And could not think upon him but with pain. <lb/>
            Then kindled we a fire, and kill'd and fed <lb/>
            On flesh and cheese, and for his coming staid. <lb/>
            He came, and a great burden carried <lb/>
            Of withered boughs, which at the door he laid. <lb n="240"/>
            His supper with this wood he meant to dress, <lb/>
            And threw it down with such a hideous noise, <lb/>
            As frighted us to th' innermost recess <lb/>

            Into the cave he comes, he and his flock, <lb n="245"/>

            In order due, to see them suckled well, <lb/>
            And each young goat he puts under her dam. <lb/>

            For drink to serve him when he was to sup. <lb/>
            When he had ended all his business, <lb/>
            He made a fire, and thereby spied us out. <lb/>
            What are you, says he, whence d' ye cross the seas ? <lb/>
            Is it on business, or d' ye rove about <lb n="260"/>
            As pirates walk at sea, to and agen, <lb/>
            And are content to set their lives at stake, <lb/>
            So they may mischief do to other men? <lb/>
            Our hearts dismayed before, this language brake. <lb/>
            We fear'd his hollow voice, and body great; <lb n="265"/>
            But yet I made him answer, and said thus: <lb/>
            We are Achæans, making our retreat <lb/>
            Homewards from Troy, but winds have forced us <lb/>
            Upon this coast (for Jove would have it so.) <lb/>
            We are a part of Agamemnon's bands, <lb n="270"/>
            Whose glory for his sacking Troy is now <lb/>
            Renown'd both far and wide throughout all lands. <lb/>
            And now ourselves we prostrate at your feet, <lb/>
            Hoping for some good thing as visitants, <lb/>
            Such as all men have commonly thought meet; <lb n="275"/>
            Or, for the Gods' sake, as to suppliants. <lb/>
            As suppliants we before you here do lie, <lb/>
            With whom, and strangers, Jove still goes along; <lb/>
            He is the God of hospitality, <lb/>
            To punish whosoever does them wrong. <lb n="280"/>
            Thus I. But he replied with fell intent: <lb/>
            Stranger, thou art a fool, or com'st from far, <lb/>
            That counsel'st me to fear the punishment <lb/>
            Of Jove, or for the blessed Gods to care. <lb/>
            The Cyclopses care not at all for Jove <lb n="285"/>
            Ægiochus, or any other Gods. <lb/>
            For why, we stronger are than those above; <lb/>
            And if we strength compare, we have the odds. <lb/>
            No, no, 'tis not the fear of Jupiter <lb/>
            Can me from thee, or these with thee, restrain, <lb n="290"/>
            Unless I please. But tell me truly where <lb/>
            The ship that brought you rides, and do not feign. <lb/>
            This was to sound me. But I saw his mind, <lb/>
            And a deceitful answer did intend. <lb/>
            My ship was wreck'd by Neptune, and by wind <lb n="295"/>
            Thrown 'gainst the rocks at the land's furthest end, <lb/>
            Where all besides myself and these were drown'd. <lb/>
            To this he answer'd nothing, nor said more, <lb/>
            But snatching up a couple from the ground, <lb/>
            Knocks out their brains, like whelps against the floor; <lb n="300"/>
            Then cuts them into joints, and on them fed; <lb/>
            Nor did he flesh, or bone, or entrails leave, <lb/>
            Like hungry lion on the mountains bred. <lb/>
            Then weep we, and to Jove our hands upheave <lb/>

            When he with human flesh his belly deep <lb/>
            Had fill'd, and drunk the milk that stood him by, <lb/>
            He laid himself along amongst his sheep, <lb/>
            And slept. And then I saw I might him slay: <lb/>
            'Twas but to draw my good sword from my side. <lb n="310"/>
            And gently on his breast my hand to lay, <lb/>
            And to the hilt my sword in's body hide. <lb/>
            Upon new thoughts that purpose I gave o'er, <lb/>
            For certainly it had destroyed us quite; <lb/>
            So great the stone was that lay on the door, <lb n="315"/>
            That to remove it was past all our might. <lb/>
            So there we sighing stay'd for day: and when <lb/>
            The rosy-finger'd morning did appear, <lb/>
            He made a fire, and milk'd his flock again, <lb/>
            And the young kids and lambs new suckled were. <lb n="320"/>
            When all his work was at an end and past, <lb/>
            Two more of my companions he takes, <lb/>
            And on those two he quickly breaks his fast, <lb/>
            And for his flock the way he open makes. <lb/>
            For easily he took the stone away, <lb n="325"/>
            And then again with no less ease he did <lb/>
            Set up the same, and in its right place lay, <lb/>
            Than of a quiver one would do the lid. <lb/>
            His flock with noise he drives up to the hills, <lb/>
            And in the den leaves us to meditate <lb n="330"/>
            How to revenge, with Phœbus' help, our ills. <lb/>
            At last within my breast this counsel sate. <lb/>
            Near one o' th' pens there lay an olive-tree, <lb/>
            Straight, and the boughs cut off, which, when 'twas dried, <lb/>
            Designed was a walking staff to be <lb n="335"/>
            Of the great Cyclops; which when we espied, <lb/>
            Of some good ship we thought might be the mast, <lb/>
            Or of a bark of twenty oars or more, <lb/>
            That Neptune's rugged waters might have passed <lb/>
            With a great burthen safe from shore to shore. <lb n="340"/>
            Of this a fathom I cut off, and gave it <lb/>
            To my companions to taper it: <lb/>
            They smoothed and taper'd it as I would have it, <lb/>
            I sharpened it at point as I thought fit. <lb/>
            Then in the fire the same I hard'ned well, <lb n="345"/>
            And laid it by with dung all cover'd o'er, <lb/>
            Which in the cave from so much cattle fell; <lb/>
            For sheep and goats there always was good store. <lb/>
            From all my company who did not fear <lb/>
            To help me thrust this bar into his eye, <lb n="350"/>
            I took out four by lot, and such they were <lb/>
            As I myself did wish; and fifth was I. <lb/>
            At evening he returneth with his sheep, <lb/>
            Into the hollow cave he brings them all: <pb n="390"/>

            Without, he neither sheep nor goat did keep, <lb n="355"/>
            By presage, or upon some heavily call. <lb/>
            Then with the stone the cave's mouth up he dams, <lb/>
            And milks his she-goats and his ewes each one, <lb/>
            And suckles all his young kids and his lambs. <lb/>
            But after he his work had fully done, <lb n="360"/>
            Another couple of my men he took. <lb/>
            Then having in my hand an ivy can <lb/>
            Of good black wine, I thus unto him spoke: <lb/>
            Cyclops, since you have eaten flesh of man, <lb/>
            Here, drink this good black wine upon't, and see <lb n="365"/>
            What excellent good drink we had aboard, <lb/>
            Whereof I've hither brought a taste to thee, <lb/>
            Hoping you will some kindness me afford, <lb/>
            And some assistance in our voyage home; <lb/>
            But so intolerably furious <lb n="370"/>
            You are, that no man will dare near you come, <lb/>
            Knowing how cruel you have been to us. <lb/>
            When I had said, the good wine he drank up, <lb/>
            And was extremely pleased with the same; <lb/>
            And straightway calling for another cup, <lb n="375"/>
            Tell me, quoth he, right now what is thy name; <lb/>
            And I will give thee that shall please thy heart. <lb/>
            We Cyclopses have vines that yield good wine, <lb/>
            Which from the earth by rain from heaven start; <lb/>
            But this some branch of nectar is divine. <lb n="380"/>
            When he had said, I gave him wine again; <lb/>
            Three times I fill'd the can, and he as oft <lb/>
            Drank't off. But when it came up to his brain, <lb/>
            Then spake I to him gentle words and soft: <lb/>
            Cyclops, since you my name desire to know, <lb n="385"/>
            I'll tell it you, and on your word rely. <lb/>
            My name is Noman, all men call me so, <lb/>
            My father, mother, and my company. <lb/>
            To which he soon and sadly made reply, <lb/>
            Noman, I'll eat you last, none shall outlive you <lb n="390"/>
            Of all that are here of your company; <lb/>
            And that's the gift I promised to give you. <lb/>
            And having said, he laid himself along <lb/>
            With bended neck, sleeping and vomiting <lb/>
            Gobbets of human flesh, and wine among, <lb n="395"/>
            All he before had eaten uttering. <lb/>
            The bar with embers then I covered, <lb/>
            Till, green as 'twas, with heat I made it shine, <lb/>
            And with few words my men encouraged, <lb/>
            Lest any should have shrunk from the design. <lb n="400"/>
            The bar now hot, and ready to flame out, <lb/>
            And, though green wood, yet glowing mightily, <lb/>
            To him my fellows carried now stout, <lb/>
            And set the point thereof upon his eye; <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            But I myself erecting, with my hand <note type="margin"> LIB. IX. <lb/>
             </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses relates <lb/>

            Twirled the bar about, with motion nimble, <lb/>
            As joiners with a string below do stand <lb/>
            To give a piercing motion with a wimble, <lb/>
            So, whilst the brand was entering, I it turn'd. <lb/>
            The blood that down along it ran was hot, <lb n="410"/>
            And with his eye the lids and brows were burn'd, <lb/>
            And all his eye-strings with the fire did strut, <lb/>
            As when a smith hath heat his axe or spade, <lb/>
            And quickly quenches it while hot it<lb/>
            To harden it, it makes a noise; so made <lb n="415"/>
            His great moist eye the glowing brand to hiss. <lb/>
            He roared so as made the rocks resound, <lb/>
            And from his eye he pull'd, with both his hands, <lb/>
            The burning brand, and threw it to the ground; <lb/>
            And so awhile he there amazed stands, <lb n="420"/>
            And thence for more Cyclopses calls; and they, <lb/>
            Who dwelt about in every hollow cave, <lb/>
            Came in, some one, and some another way; <lb/>
            And from without the den ask'd what he'd have. <lb/>
            What ails thee, Polyphemus, so to cry <lb n="425"/>
            In dead of night, and make us break our sleep ? <lb/>
            Goes any one about to make thee die, <lb/>
            By force or fraud, or steal away thy sheep ? <lb/>
            Then Polyphemus answered from his cave, <lb/>
            Friends, Noman killeth me. Why then, said they, <lb n="430"/>
            We have no power from sickness you to save; <lb/>
            You must unto your father Neptune pray. <lb/>
            This said, they parted each one to his own <lb/>
            Dark cavern ; then within myself I laugh'd <lb/>
            To think how with my name the mighty clown <lb n="435"/>
            I so deceived had, and gull'd by craft. <lb/>
            The Cyclops for the stone now grop'd about, <lb/>
            Found it, and threw it down, though pained sore; <lb/>
            Thinking to catch us at our coming out, <lb/>
            Sitting with arms extended in the door, <lb n="440"/>
            Such fools he thought us; but I formerly <lb/>
            Had thought upon the course I was to take; <lb/>
            And all my cunning, and my art to try, <lb/>
            Since no less than our lives was now at stake, <lb/>
            This counsel 'twas that in my breast then sat: <lb n="445"/>
            Male sheep there were within the cave well fed, <lb/>
            Fair, big, and deeply clad in wool and fat, <lb/>
            And these, with twigs ta'en from Cyclops his bed, <lb/>
            I bound together three and three; each three <lb/>
            Bore one under the middlemost fast bound; <lb n="450"/>
            One ram, by far the best of all, bore me <lb/>
            Under his breast, my hands in deep wool wound, <lb/>
            Thus hung we constantly, expecting day. <lb/>
            The morning came, the males to pasture hie, <pb n="392"/>

            (The ewes with strutting udders bleating stay), <lb n="455"/>
            Their master sitting there in misery, <lb/>
            Laid's hand upon their backs as out they pass'd, <lb/>
            Ne'er thinking of their bellies we were under. <lb/>
            Mine, heavy with his wool and me, came last, <lb/>
            To whom the Cyclops said, seeming to wonder, <lb n="460"/>
            Why, silly rani, art thou the last to come <lb/>
            Out of the cave, that formerly was ever <lb/>
            The foremost to go out, and to come home, <lb/>
            And foremost at the going to the river; <lb/>
            But now art last ? Is't for thy master's eye, <lb n="465"/>
            Which Noman and his fellows have put forth ? <lb/>
            0 couldst thou speak, and tell me where doth lie <lb/>
            Hidden within, that Noman, nothing worth, <lb/>
            I soon would with his brains besmear the floor, <lb/>
            And ease my vexed heart within me so, <lb n="470"/>
            Which Noman hath within me wounded sore. <lb/>
            This said, he let the ram that bore me go. <lb/>
            Got forth a little from the den and yard, <lb/>
            I left my ram, and set my fellows free; <lb/>
            Unto my ships I brought part of the herd, <lb n="475"/>
            That to our fellows we might welcome be, <lb/>
            We that escap'd ; but they began to weep <lb/>
            For those we left behind us dead, till I <lb/>
            Commanded them to fetch aboard more sheep, <lb/>
            And after that their oars again to ply. <lb n="480"/>
            They brought in more, and each man takes his seat, <lb/>
            And in due order, with his oar in hand, <lb/>
            The water grey into a foam they beat, <lb/>
            And rowed us a little way from land, <lb/>
            As far as one that hallos can be heard; <lb n="485"/>
            So far I stood from shore, I hallo'd then: <lb/>
            Cyclops, Cyclops, why were you not afraid <lb/>
            To kill and eat, as you have done, my men ? <lb/>
            For since you strangers do so ill intreat, <lb/>
            And of the Gods themselves no reckoning make, <lb n="490"/>
            You ought to have expected vengeance great, <lb/>
            And that your wicked deeds should you overtake. <lb/>
            The Cyclops then provoked with this mock, <lb/>
            Threw a great stone at us with all his might, <lb/>
            And first he swing'd round o'er his head the rock, <lb n="495"/>
            Which just behind the rudder chanc'd to light; <lb/>
            And so much stirr'd the water falling in, <lb/>
            That what with th' eddy and tide from the main, <lb/>
            Brought back to th' land, and sure we dead had bin, <lb/>
            But that I quickly thrust it off again; <lb n="500"/>
            Then bade I my companions to row <lb/>
            Still further off, till we were out of fear. <lb/>
            They plied their oars again, and we were now <lb/>
            At twice the distance that before we were. <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            And then again I to the Cyclops spoke, <note type="margin"> LID. IX. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses relates <lb/>
            his adventures. </note> <lb n="505"/>
            Though my companions would have hindered me: <lb/>
            Why, say they, will you still the man provoke ? <lb/>
            How great a stone, how far he throws you see, <lb/>
            How near to land we were, how near to die; <lb/>
            If he but any one of us hear speak, <lb n="510"/>
            A rock will straightway from him hither fly, <lb/>
            And knock our brains out, and our vessel break. <lb/>
            So said they; but with me could nothing do, <lb/>
            I was resolv'd to vex him bitterly. <lb/>
            Cyclops, quoth I, if any ask thee who, <lb n="515"/>
            What was his name that robbed thee of thy eye, <lb/>
            Say 'twas Ulysses, prince of Ithaca, <lb/>
            Son to the old Laertes. He it was. <lb/>
            At which the Cyclops howling answered, Ha, <lb/>
            I see old prophecies are come to pass, <lb n="420"/>
            For Telemus Eurymedes, that here <lb/>
            Dwelled, and telling fortunes went about, <lb/>
            Told me I should by name Ulysses fear, <lb/>
            As he that one day should my eye put out; <lb/>
            But I some strong and mighty man expected, <lb n="425"/>
            Of stature great, should come to do that deed, <lb/>
            And never such a little wretch suspected, <lb/>
            Nor ever did of being drunk take heed. <lb/>
            But come, Ulysses, nearer, that I may <lb/>
            Give you a precious gift as you deserve ; <lb n="530"/>
            And also to my father Neptune pray, <lb/>
            That you upon the seas he would preserve; <lb/>
            For I his son, and he my father is, <lb/>
            And to my sight again restore me can; <lb/>
            He, and no other of the Gods in bliss, <lb n="535"/>
            Nor any pow'r on earth. So said the man. <lb/>
            Cyclops, quoth I, I would I could as well <lb/>
            Send thee now down to Pluto's ugly den, <lb/>
            Depriv'd of life and soul i' th' deepest hell, <lb/>
            As I am sure thou ne'er shalt see again. <lb n="540"/>
            Then held he up his hands to heav'n, and pray'd: <lb/>
            Hear me, 0 Neptune, if thy son I be, <lb/>
            And thou my father truly, as 'tis said, <lb/>
            Grant that Ulysses never more may see <lb/>
            His native soil; or if perhaps by Fate <lb n="545"/>
            It be decreed he shall return again, <lb/>
            Let him return both wretchedly and late, <lb/>
            His ships and men lost, and at home meet pain. <lb/>
            His prayer granted was; and then he threw <lb/>
            A greater stone, first swing'd it o'er his head, <lb n="550"/>
            Which by good chance above the vessel flew, <lb/>
            But almost to the shore us carried. <lb/>
            When we were come into the isle again, <lb/>
            Where all the rest of our fleet then abode, <pb n="394"/>
            <note type="margin"> LID. IX. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses relates <lb/>

            Expecting our return, in grievous pain, <lb n="555"/>
            And wondering why we were so long abroad; <lb/>
            Then with our sheep we landed on the beach, <lb/>
            And 'mongst the barks divided them with care, <lb/>
            Their just and equal number unto each, <lb/>
            That no ship might be wronged of his share. <lb n="560"/>
            On me my fellows over and above <lb/>
            Bestow'd a ram, which on the sand there-right <lb/>
            I made a sacrifice to mighty Jove ; <lb/>
            But in my off'rings he took no delight, <lb/>
            And was contriving how to make away <lb n="565"/>
            My ship and fellows, and destroy them quite. <lb/>
            There on the shore we sat and spent the day. <lb/>
            With flesh and wine from morning unto night. <lb/>
            All night we slept upon the shore, and when <lb/>
            The morning had again the day restored, <lb n="570"/>
            I presently commanded all my men <lb/>
            To loose the ropes, and put themselves aboard. <lb/>
            Aboard they go, and beat the sea with oars, <lb/>
            All for their fellows that were eaten, sad, <lb/>
            And forward to the main we take our course, <lb n="575"/>
            For that we had ourselves escaped, glad.</p>

            who refused to <lb/>
            receive him. </note> AT th' floating Isle Æolia we landed, <lb/>
            Where JEolus, the son of Hippotas, <lb/>
            Beloved of th' immortal Gods, commanded. <lb/>
            His house was walled all about with brass, <lb/>
            Th' ascent unto it was all one smooth stone. <lb n="5"/>
            Twelve were his children, six sons and their wives; <lb/>
            In wedlock he had join'd them one to one, <lb/>
            And with him in his house they led their lives, <lb/>
            And made good cheer; all day the house they make <lb/>
            To ring with mirth, and smoke with boil'd and roast; <lb n="10"/>
            At night their loyal wives to beds they take, <lb/>
            Richly set out with coverings of great cost. <lb/>
            A month he entertained me with delight, <lb/>
            Ask'd me of Troy, and th' Argive fleet, and how <lb/>
            The Greeks got home. And him I answer'd right <lb n="15"/>
            To ev'ry thing, as far as I did know. <lb/>
            And when I left his house, he was content <lb/>
            T' assist me friendly in ray voyage back <lb/>
            With a west wind, and all winds else he pent <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            Into a tough and strong neat's-leather sack; <note type="margin"> LIB. X. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' en. <lb/>

            by Æolus, &amp;c. </note> <lb n="20"/>
            (For Jove had made him master of the winds, <lb/>
            To hold their breath, or blow as he thought fit), <lb/>
            And with a silver string the sack he binds; <lb/>
            No wind could stir but as I ordered it, <lb/>
            But all this did no good for want of wit. <lb n="25"/>
            Nine days we sail'd fore-right, and came so near <lb/>
            To th' coast of Ithaca, that we could see't <lb/>
            By th' light of beacons that were fired there; <lb/>
            But then with weariness I fell asleep; <lb/>
            For I had ne'er till now the helm let go, <lb n="30"/>
            Nor suffer'd any else my place to keep, <lb/>
            I long'd to see my native country so. <lb/>
            Meanwhile my fellows to discourse begin, <lb/>
            Thinking much gold and silver was i' th' sack, <lb/>
            By AEolus Hippodates put in, <lb n="35"/>
            Which now to Ithaca I carried back. <lb/>
            And, Oh, did one unto another say, <lb/>
            How much this man is lov'd where'er he comes! <lb/>
            He brings from Troy a great share of the prey, <lb/>
            Though we go empty-handed to our homes. <lb n="40"/>
            Now AEolus has given him God knows what; <lb/>
            Come quickly, let us while we think upon't, <lb/>
            And sleeping he upon the deck lies flat, <lb/>
            Undo the sack and see how much there's on't. <lb/>
            This wretched counsel taken by the crew, <lb n="45"/>
            The budget they undid, to see my store; <lb/>
            And then at once the furious winds outflew, <lb/>
            And whistling, snatch'd our ship away from shore. <lb/>
            My fellows wept, I studied which was best, <lb/>
            To fall into the sea and end my pain, <lb n="50"/>
            Or patiently to live among the rest? <lb/>
            I chose to live, as better of the twain, <lb/>
            And hoodwink'd laid me down i' th' ship. At last <lb/>
            We found ourselves upon th' Æolian shore, <lb/>
            On which th' unruly winds our ship had cast, <lb n="55"/>
            Just at the place where we set forth before : <lb/>
            And there we landed, and short supper made <lb/>
            With my companions on the rocky shore. <lb/>
            I one man with me and a herald take, <lb/>
            And went up to the porch before the door <lb n="60"/>
            Of th' hall, where Æolus sat banqueting <lb/>
            Amongst his sons and daughters. They admir'd. <lb/>
            What wind, said they, did you now hither bring? <lb/>
            We furnish'd you for what place you desir'd. <lb/>
            Some devil cross'd you. Softly, I replied. <lb n="65"/>
            Of our misfortune other cause was none <lb/>
            But my men's folly, who the bag untied <lb/>
            The whilst I slept; you can repair what's done. <lb/>
            Their father answer'd at another rate : <pb n="396"/>

            Hence, rascal, hated of the Gods above: <lb n="70"/>
            I entertain none whom the Gods do hate. <lb/>
            Away, I say, the Gods thee do not love. <lb/>
            Thus sighing we were sent away; and though <lb/>
            We were already tired with the oar, <lb/>
            To sea we put, and forward still we row, <lb n="75"/>
            Six days and nights entire, ne'er giving o'er. <lb/>
            Upon the seventh day we landed near <lb/>
            To Lestrigonia, the royal seat <lb/>
            Of Lamus and his race ; the herd's-men there, <lb/>
            When from the field they bring their sheep or neat, <lb n="80"/>
            Hallo to those at home; then they a-field <lb/>
            Their cattle drive. To one of little sleep <lb/>
            The site o' tli' place doth double wages yield, <lb/>
            By tending one day cows, another sheep. <lb/>
            For it is seated just 'twixt day and night; <lb n="85"/>
            Into the port we came, the which within <lb/>
            On each side was beset with rocks upright, <lb/>
            Whereof two made it narrow coming in. <lb/>
            My fellows with their ships were in the port, <lb/>
            Near to the city ; for the sea was still, <lb n="90"/>
            And not a wind stirring of any sort. <lb/>
            But I kept mine without, suspecting ill, <lb/>
            And with a rope had tied it to the rocks. <lb/>
            Then up a hill I went to look about, <lb/>
            But could no sign espy of man or ox ; <lb n="95"/>
            Then down I came again, and straight sent out <lb/>
            T' enquire what kind of people lived there. <lb/>
            A herald then and two men more I sent, <lb/>
            Who as they going on the high-way were, <lb/>
            That from the woody hill to the city went, <lb n="100"/>
            Met with the daughter of Antiphates, <lb/>
            That was of Lestrigonians the king. <lb/>
            She had fetcht water from Artracies; <lb/>
            Artracies the name was of a spring. <lb/>
            They ask'd her of the king, and of the people, <lb n="105"/>
            Her father's house she shows. They thither hie, <lb/>
            And find the queen there looking like a steeple, <lb/>
            And straight abhor'd her as a prodigy. <lb/>
            Then she her husband from the market-place <lb/>
            Calls home, who straight intended to dispatch 'em, <lb n="110"/>
            And laid his hands on one; but in that space <lb/>
            The rest escap'd by flight, he could not catch 'em ; <lb/>
            But then he raised with a mighty shout <lb/>
            The town and country, who in numbers great, <lb/>
            Liker to giants than to men, came out, <lb n="115"/>
            And with huge stones of a man's weight they beat <lb/>
            My men and ships. A woful noise and wild <lb/>
            I heard of dying men, and tearing planks. <lb/>
            When they had slain my men, they them enfil'd, <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            And carried them like fishes hung in ranks. <note type="margin"> LIB. X. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' en­ <lb/>

            While they did this, 1 had no other hope <lb/>
            To save myself, but quickly with my sword, <lb/>
            My ship being tied to th' rocks, to cut the rope, <lb/>
            And make what haste I could to get aboard. <lb/>
            My crew into the ship leapt all at once, <lb n="125"/>
            And row'd for life, till they got far enough <lb/>
            From land, to stand in fear of throwing stones, <lb/>
            And glad they had escaped, onwards row; <lb/>
            The rest, both ships and men, all perished. <lb/>
            Next at Ææa Isle ashore we run, <lb n="130"/>
            Where the wise Goddess Circ' inhabited, <lb/>
            Æetes' sister, daughter of the Sun, <lb/>
            And Perse daughter of Oceanus; <lb/>
            There in a good safe harbour quietly <lb/>
            We rest ourselves ; some God conducted us. <lb n="135"/>
            There full of grief two days and nights we lie. <lb/>
            Soon as the morn had shown us the third day, <lb/>
            With spear in hand, and sword girt at my thigh, <lb/>
            Up to a mountain's top I took my way, <lb/>
            Some word of man to hear, or work to spy; <lb n="140"/>
            Through the thick wood I saw a smoke arise <lb/>
            About the place where th' house of Circe stood: <lb/>
            Then with myself I did awhile advise <lb/>
            What I should do; at last I thought it good <lb/>
            To make my people all to dine, and then <lb n="145"/>
            Safely with company to go or send. <lb/>
            So back I came unto my ship and men; <lb/>
            But by the way (some God was sure my friend) <lb/>
            A gallant stag came by, whom heat and thirst <lb/>
            Invited had down to the stream divine; <lb n="150"/>
            At him I quickly threw my spear, which pierc'd <lb/>
            Both his sides thorough, close beneath the chine. <lb/>
            Down dead he falls; on's neck my foot I set, <lb/>
            Pluck'd out the spear, and laid it on the ground; <lb/>
            To make a rope, I twigs and rushes get, <lb n="155"/>
            And his four feet together fast I bound ; <lb/>
            Within his legs I place my head, and bear <lb/>
            His body on my neck ; 'twas hard to rise. <lb/>
            Leaning with both my hands upon my spear: <lb/>
            lie was too great to take up otherwise. <lb n="160"/>
            I threw him down o' th' shore, and cheer'd my crew. <lb/>
            Friends, quoth I, though our present state be bad, <lb/>
            Death shall not come, I hope, before 'tis due: <lb/>
            Come, let us cut and drink, and not be sad. <lb/>
            This said, they straightway from the ship descend, <lb n="165"/>
            And gaze upon 't, for 'twas a mighty beast: <lb/>
            And when their wondering was at an end, <lb/>
            They wash'd their hands, and dress'd it for their feast; <lb/>
            And all the remnant of the day till night <pb n="398"/>

            We made good cheer with wine and ven'son store. <lb n="170"/>
            After the sun had borne from us his light, <lb/>
            We laid us down to sleep upon the shore; <lb/>
            But when the rosy morn appear'd again, <lb/>
            I said to all my men, who grieved were: <lb/>
            My mates, although I have endur'd much pain, <lb n="175"/>
            I must entreat you patiently to hear; <lb/>
            We know not where is west or east, nor where <lb/>
            The sun does rise or set, nor where we be; <lb/>
            To me does little hope as yet appear, <lb/>
            And therefore we must go abroad and see. <lb n="180"/>
            In a low island, rising through the trees, <lb/>
            I saw a smoke when I stood on the hill; <lb/>
            Though I had utter'd no more words but these, <lb/>
            They heard them with a very evil will. <lb/>
            Of Cyclops and Antiphates they speak, <lb n="185"/>
            That had devoured their fellows formerly: <lb/>
            And ready were their hearts with grief to break; <lb/>
            They weep and whine, but without remedy. <lb/>
            Of my companions then two bands I make; <lb/>
            Of one Eurylochus had the command, <lb n="190"/>
            The charge o' th' other to myself I take: <lb/>
            And two-and-twenty men were in each band. <lb/>
            Who should go first abroad, and who should stay, <lb/>
            We were content should be by lot defin'd; <lb/>
            To go, fell to Eurylochus. Away <lb n="195"/>
            They weeping went, we weeping stayed behind ; <lb/>
            Down in a dale they Circe's palace found, <lb/>
            Built of square stone; the place was full of shade: <lb/>
            Lions and wolves about it lay o' th' ground, <lb/>
            Whom Circe tame with magic arts bath made; <lb n="200"/>
            These flew not at my men, but laid their noses <lb/>
            Upon them lovingly, and wagg'd their tails, <lb/>
            As dogs salute their masters; Circe's doses <lb/>
            So much above their natures fierce prevail. <lb/>
            Eurylochus i' th' door stood with his band. <lb n="205"/>
            The Goddess Circe busy was within ; <lb/>
            For she a wondrous fine-work had in hand, <lb/>
            Past art of man, and sung as she did spin. <lb/>
            Then did Polites, whom I lov'd most dear <lb/>
            Of all my crew, speak out unto them all: <lb n="210"/>
            My friends, quoth he, somebody singeth there, <lb/>
            A Goddess or a woman; let us call. <lb/>
            This said, they call, and she sets ope the gate, <lb/>
            Bids them come in; fools as they were, they enter, <lb/>
            All but Eurylochus ; without he sat, <lb n="215"/>
            Suspecting somewhat, therefore durst not venture. <lb/>
            She places them, and sets before them food, <lb/>
            Cheesecakes of cheese, and honey, flour and wine ; <lb/>

            She drove them to the sties, and there them pent: <lb/>
            For body, head, hair, voice, all but the mind, <lb/>
            Right swine they were, and grunted as they went; <lb/>
            There to them threw she acorns, crabs and bran, <lb n="225"/>
            The things wherewith swine commonly are fed. <lb/>
            Eurylochus stayed long, but not a man <lb/>
            Came out to let him know how they had sped. <lb/>
            Then back he comes: at first he could not speak, <lb/>
            Though he endeavoured; he grieved so, <lb n="230"/>
            The sighs and sobs his words did often break, <lb/>
            Till urg'd by us that long'd the truth to know ; <lb/>
            At last he said, Renown'd Ulysses, we <lb/>
            Passing the woods, as we commanded were, <lb/>
            In a dark vale a stately palace see ; <lb n="235"/>
            A Goddess, or a woman, dwelleth there. <lb/>
            We call'd, and straight she opening the gate, <lb/>
            Bids us come in; they ill advised enter, <lb/>
            All but myself; alone without I sat, <lb/>
            Suspecting fraud, and durst no further venture. <lb n="240"/>
            Lost they are all: for if they could, I know <lb/>
            Some of them would have come and brought me word, <lb/>
            For I stay'd long enough ; this said, my bow <lb/>
            I took, and at my side my trusty sword, <lb/>
            And bad him guide me back the self-same way. <lb n="245"/>
            Then fell he at my feet on both his knees, <lb/>
            And weeping me entreats to let him stay; <lb/>
            Your life, quoth he, amongst the rest you'll leese. <lb/>
            To this I said: Eurylochus, stay you <lb/>
            Here at the ship, since you are frighted so, <lb n="250"/>
            Eating and drinking with the rest o' th' crew ; <lb/>
            Necessity compelleth me to go. <lb/>
            This said, I went along the shore, till I <lb/>
            Was at the entrance of the valley, where <lb/>
            The house of Circe stood. Then Mercury <lb n="255"/>
            Encounter'd me; in form he did appear <lb/>
            Of a fair youth, whose beard but now began <lb/>
            In a soft down to peep above his face, <lb/>
            Which is the prime of beauty in a man. <lb/>
            Alas, said he, what make you in this place <lb n="260"/>
            'Mongst trees and shrubs ? For I can tell you this, <lb/>
            Your mates at Circe's house are lodg'd in sties, <lb/>
            They now are swine; you'll of your purpose miss ; <lb/>
            You cannot set them free though you be wise, <lb/>
            But rather you will with them lie. But well; <lb n="265"/>
            I'll give you such an antidote as you <lb/>
            Need not to be afraid of any spell; <lb/>
            And will, besides, her purpose to you show. <lb/>
            To make you drink she'll temper you a cup, <pb n="400"/>

            Which shall not, for the antidote, bewitch you; <lb n="270"/>
            And when she sees that you have drank it up, <lb/>
            With her long wand she presently will switch you. <lb/>
            Then to her with your naked sword in hand, <lb/>
            As if you purposed to cut off her head; <lb/>
            Then she will shriek, and weep, and trembling stand, <lb n="275"/>
            And buy her life with proffer of her bed; <lb/>
            You must not then refuse the Goddess' love, <lb/>
            If you intend your fellows to restore: <lb/>
            Yet make her swear by all the Gods above <lb/>
            She never will attempt to hurt you more. <lb n="280"/>
            Then gave he me the herb; the flow'r was white, <lb/>
            The root was black; the Gods do call it Moly, <lb/>
            And gather it, who have no stint of might; <lb/>
            For men to think to find it is a folly. <lb/>
            Then Hermes parting, mounted to the sky, <lb n="285"/>
            And I to Circe's house went on my way, <lb/>
            And musing stood awhile; but by and by <lb/>
            I call'd, and she came forth without delay, <lb/>
            And calls me in. I enter with sad heart; <lb/>
            There in a glorious chair she made me sit, <lb n="290"/>
            Studded with silver nails, and carv'd with art; <lb/>
            Then puts a low stool to it for my feet, <lb/>
            And brought the potion in a golden cup, <lb/>
            Which she had tempered to her bad design ; <lb/>
            And soon as ever I had drank it up, <lb n="295"/>
            She switch'd and bad me go lie with the swine. <lb/>
            Then start I up with my drawn sword, and make <lb/>
            As if I purpos'd to cut off her head; <lb/>
            Then did she shriek most fearfully and quake, <lb/>
            And weeping to me these words uttered: <lb n="300"/>
            Who, whence are you ? what is your father's name ? <lb/>
            That this drink worketh not, is very strange, <lb/>
            If any else had tasted but the same, <lb/>
            He soon had of his figure found a change; <lb/>
            But you a stubborn heart have in your breast. <lb n="305"/>
            Are you Ulysses, that should hither come, <lb/>
            As Hermes told me oft, and be my guest, <lb/>
            When from the Trojan shore he sailed home? <lb/>
            Put up your sword; and that we may confide <lb/>
            In one another better without dread, <lb n="310"/>
            Let's to my chamber go, and side by side <lb/>
            Compose the things we differ in a bed. <lb/>
            Circe, said I, oh how can I be kind, <lb/>
            When you to swine my fellows turned have ? <lb/>
            And now you have me here, 'tis in your mind <lb n="315"/>
            To make me tame, and keep me for a slave. <lb/>

            Un Circe waiting-women four attended <lb/>
            To do the service of the house, and were <lb/>
            From sacred rivers, springs, and groves descended; <lb/>
            Each had her proper work assigned her. <lb/>
            One does the chairs with coverings array ; <lb n="325"/>
            Another does the silver tables spread, <lb/>
            And on each one of them a basket by <lb/>
            Of gold, and into it she puts the bread; <lb/>
            The third does in a silver flagon mix <lb/>

            The fourth to make a fire brings in the sticks, <lb/>
            And for a bath makes ready water hot. <lb/>
            Circe herself the water tempered <lb/>
            Into a just and comfortable heat, <lb/>
            And pour'd it on my shoulders and my head, <lb n="335"/>
            Washing my limbs, till I my toil forget. <lb/>
            And when I bathed and anointed was, <lb/>
            She put upon me a fair coat and vest, <lb/>
            And led me in, into the dining-place, <lb/>
            And to my chair and table me address'd. <lb n="340"/>
            One maid a golden bason, with the ewer, <lb/>
            To wash our hands over a cauldron brings, <lb/>
            The cauldron also was of silver pure; <lb/>
            Another loads the table with good things; <lb/>
            Another on the table sets on bread, <lb n="345"/>
            And then the Goddess Circe bids me eat; <lb/>
            But other dangers running in my head. <lb/>
            I had but little stomach to my meat: <lb/>
            Which she observing, said, Ulysses, why <lb/>
            Do you thus sullenly your meat refuse, <lb n="350"/>
            And like a dumb man sit ? D'ye think that I <lb/>
            Intend against you some new art to use ? <lb/>
            Have I not sworn ? To which I answered : <lb/>
            O Circe, how can I be pleas'd d'ye think <lb/>
            (When you my fellows keep disfigured <lb n="355"/>
            And pounded up in hog-sties) t' eat and drink ; <lb/>
            If you mean well, set them at liberty, <lb/>
            And in the shape of men before my eyes, <lb/>
            That I may look on them, and they on me. <lb/>
            With switch in hand then out of doors she hies, <lb n="360"/>
            And opens all their prisons; out they come, <lb/>
            And were, to look to, pigs of nine years old. <lb/>
            She drives them with her wand into the room, <lb/>
            And makes them stand there while I them behold. <lb/>
            Then Circe went amongst them, and each one <lb n="365"/>
            Smear'd with an unguent, which straightway did make <lb/>
            Their hair fall off, and undid all was done; <lb/>

            So glad they were, their eyes for joy ran oler; <lb/>
            The whole house wept, and Circe with the rest. <lb/>
            This past, the Goddess said: Ulysses, go <lb/>
            And bring your ship a-land, and let her lie; <lb/>
            Your goods within the rocky caves bestow, <lb n="375"/>
            And make haste back with all your company. <lb/>
            Tins pleas'd me well. Down to the sea I hie, <lb/>
            Where my companions I weeping find; <lb/>
            But soon as I appeared, they presently <lb/>
            About me came, their care now out of mind. <lb n="380"/>
            As when from pastures fat a herd of cows <lb/>
            Well fed return at evening to their home, <lb/>
            Their calves will not be kept within the house, <lb/>
            But play, and skip, and round about them come; <lb/>
            So did my fellows, soon as they me saw, <lb n="385"/>
            Come skipping out o' th' ship, with no less joy <lb/>
            Than if they had been come to Ithaca, <lb/>
            Their native country, from the town of Troy. <lb/>
            Our joy, said they, Ulysses, cannot be <lb/>
            Greater when we at Ithaca arrive, <lb n="390"/>
            Which we so wish for, than 'tis now to see <lb/>
            That you from Circe are retum'd alive. <lb/>
            But tell us, pray, how died our fellows there ? <lb/>
            But first, said I, hale up your ship to land, <lb/>
            And in the rocks hide all that's loose in her, <lb n="395"/>
            And come with me to Circe out of hand. <lb/>
            There shall you see your fellows how they live, <lb/>
            In want of nothing that they can devise. <lb/>
            To these my words my fellows credit give; <lb/>
            Eurylochus alone thought otherwise. <lb n="400"/>
            Wretches, said he, what mean you ? Will you go ? <lb/>
            Have you a longing to be lions tame, <lb/>
            Or swine, or wolves, and being transformed so, <lb/>
            To live at Circe's house, and guard the same? <lb/>
            Remember Cyclops, and how all they sped <lb n="405"/>
            That dar'd to put themselves within his cave, <lb/>
            By too much valour of Ulysses led. <lb/>
            Bethink you well how you yourselves may save. <lb/>
            When I heard that, I drew my sword, and meant, <lb/>

            T' have made his head fly. But of that intent <lb/>
            I was made frustrate by the company, <lb/>
            That interposing spoke me fair, and said, <lb/>
            Let him stay here, but we'll go every man, <lb/>
            While he looks to the ship, since he's afraid. <lb n="415"/>
            Thus having said, to march they straight began ; <lb/>
            Nor staid Eurylochus behind, for I <lb/>
            Had so affrighted him he went with th' rest. <lb/>
            Meanwhile at Circe's house my company <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            Were bath'd, and oil'd, and cloth'd with coat and vest. <note type="margin"> LIB. X. <lb/>

            Feasting we found them in a stately hall. <lb/>
            But when we saw them, and heard everything <lb/>
            That had befallen them, suddenly we all <lb/>
            Wept out so loud, as made the house to ring. <lb/>
            Then Circe said: Ulysses, why d'ye weep? <lb n="425"/>
            I know your sufferings both at land by men, <lb/>
            And what you have endured on the deep; <lb/>
            Drink wine, eat meat, and merry be again. <lb/>
            Recruit your hearts with courage, till they be <lb/>
            As strong as when from home you first set out; <lb n="430"/>
            Put all your danger out of memory. <lb/>
            Nor trouble more your wearied minds with doubt. <lb/>
            These words of Circe's did our spirits cheer, <lb/>
            And made us willingly fall to our meat; <lb/>
            Both then, and ev'ry day throughout the year, <lb n="435"/>
            In Circe's house we freely drink and eat. <lb/>
            But when the season was come round about, <lb/>
            And months and days of th' year had made an end, <lb/>
            Then my impatient fellows call'd me out, <lb/>
            And said, Strange man, do you no more intend <lb n="440"/>
            To see your country Ithaca ? Shall we <lb/>
            For ever stay with Circe here ? Have Fates <lb/>
            Decreed that you your house no more should see, <lb/>
            But perish here together with your mates ? <lb/>
            This my companions said, and said but right. <lb n="445"/>
            Then what remained of the day we spent <lb/>
            Eating and drinking merrily. At night <lb/>
            They to their own beds, I to Circe's went: <lb/>
            Where prostrate at her knees, I press her hard <lb/>
            To keep her word, and let me go my way; <lb n="450"/>
            My mind, said I, is going thitherward <lb/>
            Now, and my fellows ask me why I stay. <lb/>
            Renowned Ulysses, answered Circe, here <lb/>
            Against your will with me you shall not stay. <lb/>
            But ere you go unto your country dear, <lb n="455"/>
            You must a voyage make another way. <lb/>
            You must to the house of Hades first repair; <lb/>
            For with Tiresias the prophet blind, <lb/>
            You must consult concerning your affair. <lb/>
            He knows what course the Fates have you design'd, <lb n="460"/>
            Though blind his eye, yet is his judgment clear. <lb/>
            For why, to him Proserpina alone <lb/>
            Hath granted to peruse Fate's register, <lb/>
            And know the history of things not done. <lb/>
            The ghosts to him stand up when he goes by. <lb n="465"/>
            At this my heart was ready ev'n to break, <lb/>
            And in the bed long time I weeping lie, <lb/>
            And turn'd, and wish'd for death. At last I speak: <lb/>
            Circe, said I, who shall me thither guide? <note type="footnote"> D D 2 </note> <pb n="404"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. X. <lb/>

            Never man yet to Hell went in a ship. <lb n="470"/>
            Then to me Circe presently replied: <lb/>
            Ulysses, let not that thought break your sleep. <lb/>
            You need but set your mast up, hoist your sail, <lb/>
            And then sit still; you shall not want a wind; <lb/>
            For Boreas to waft you will not fail. <lb n="475"/>
            When you are come to th' Ocean's end, you'll find <lb/>
            The woody shore and grove of Proserpine; <lb/>
            There the tall poplar and soft willow grows, <lb/>
            And there it is your bark you must put in. <lb/>
            Then go along the shore to Pluto's house, <lb n="480"/>
            And you shall see where into Acheron <lb/>
            Cocytas falls, which is a branch of Styx, <lb/>
            And with it also Pyriphlegeton, <lb/>
            And a great rock where the two rivers mix. <lb/>
            Close by that place make with your sword a pit <lb n="485"/>
            A cubit wide, and round about it pour <lb/>
            Wine mix'd with honey, and pure wine after it; <lb/>
            Then water pure, and over all throw flour. <lb/>
            Such is the drink that's offer'd to the dead. <lb/>
            And further, to them you must make a vow, <lb n="490"/>
            That when you be at home, and out of dread, <lb/>
            You'll gratify them with a barren cow. <lb/>
            But to Tiresias you must alone <lb/>
            Promise at your return to kill a ewe <lb/>
            All over black. The ceremonies done <lb n="495"/>
            Which to the dead by common law are due, <lb/>
            Then of the ram and ewe let out the blood <lb/>
            Into the pit; their heads to hellward place, <lb/>
            And turn your back, and so go tow'rd the flood; <lb/>
            Then shall you see the ghosts come out apace. <lb n="500"/>
            Bid your companions meanwhile to flay <lb/>
            The slaughter'd sheep. To Pluto must you and <lb/>
            To his queen Proserpine your prayers say, <lb/>
            Then sit down at the pit with sword in hand. <lb/>
            Let none come near the blood until you see <lb n="505"/>
            Tiresias the Theban prophet come. <lb/>
            'Twill not be long before he with you be; <lb/>
            He'll tell you all the ways to bring you home. <lb/>
            This said, Aurora had the light display'd, <lb/>
            And Circe cloth'd me with a coat and vest, <lb n="510"/>
            And with a pure white robe herself array'd, <lb/>
            With a gold girdle girt beneath her breast, <lb/>
            And put upon her head her veil. Then I <lb/>
            Went through the house to make my fellows rise, <lb/>
            And gently said unto them severally, <lb n="515"/>
            Lees go, for Circe now doth so advise; <lb/>
            And well content they were. But safe away <lb/>
            I could not bring them all. For there was one, <lb/>
            Elpenor, neither forward in a fray, <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            Not yet of very much discretion; <note type="margin"> LIB. X. <lb/>

            Heated with wine o'er night, himself to cool, <lb/>
            Up to the house's top he went to sleep; <lb/>
            But, wak'd with noise the rest made, like a fool <lb/>
            Ne'er thought of coming down the stairs steep <lb/>
            Backward, and so to th' earth he headlong fell, <lb n="525"/>
            And broke his neck-bone, and lay dead o'th' ground, <lb/>
            And his soul leaving him, went down to Hell. <lb/>
            The rest came forth, and stood about me round. <lb/>
            To these I said: You think without delay <lb/>
            That we to Ithaca are going now; <lb n="530"/>
            But Circe bids us go another way, <lb/>
            Of old Tiresias the mind to know, <lb/>
            The Theban prophet, who is now in Hell. <lb/>
            This broke the very heart-strings of my mates; <lb/>
            They sob and tear their hair, but cannot tell <lb n="535"/>
            How to avoid what's once decreed by th' Fates. <lb/>
            Then to our ship we weeping went. Mean space <lb/>
            Circe a ram and black ewe there had tied, <lb/>
            Unseen to us; we found them on the place. <lb/>
            For Gods, but when they list, cannot be spied.</p>

            Our ship lay, which we shov'd into the deep; <lb/>
            We rear our mast, pull up our sails, and bear <lb/>
            Aboard with us one male, one female sheep. <lb/>
            And so for Hell we stood, with fears in mind, <lb n="5"/>
            And tears in eye. But the fair Circe sent, <lb/>
            To bear us company, a good fore-wind, <lb/>
            That kept our sails full all the way we went. <lb/>
            To winds and steerage we our way commend, <lb/>
            And careless sit from morning till 'twas dark; <lb n="10"/>
            Then found ourselves at th' Ocean's farthest end, <lb/>
            Where up to land the wind had forc'd our bark. <lb/>
            Here dwell the Cimbers, hid in clouds and mist, <lb/>
            Whom thou, 0 Ph­­œbus, with thy golden eye, <lb/>

            Nor when from earth thou mountest to the sky; <lb/>
            But live, poor men, under a horrid night. <lb/>
            Here seek we for the place of which the wise <lb/>
            Circe had told us, and soon on it light, <pb n="406"/>

            And thither fetch'd the sheep for sacrifice.. <lb n="20"/>
            Then with my sword i' th' ground I digg'd a pit, <lb/>
            And round about it wine with honey pour; <lb/>
            And round again pure wine pour after it, <lb/>
            Then water pure. O'er all I sprinkle flour; <lb/>
            And vowed, to those feeble folk, to kill, <lb n="25"/>
            As soon as I to Ithaca should come, <lb/>
            A barren heifer, and the altar fill <lb/>
            With many more good things I had at home. <lb/>
            And promised to Tiresias alone <lb/>
            A fat black ewe, the best in all my cotes. <lb n="30"/>
            When I my vows and prayers had rightly done, <lb/>
            Of both the victims straight I cut the throats. <lb/>
            Their reeking blood streamed down into the pit; <lb/>
            Out come the ghosts; maids, youths, decrepid age, <lb/>
            And tender virgins, they all scented it; <lb n="35"/>
            And warriors clad in gory arms, all rage, <lb/>
            And rushing out of Hell, with hideous cry, <lb/>
            About the blood bustling they go and turn, <lb/>
            Which not a little frighted me. Then I <lb/>
            Bade flay the victims, and their bodies burn, <lb n="40"/>
            And say their prayers to Pluto and his queen. <lb/>
            With sword in hand I sat on the pit's brink, <lb/>
            Resolv'd till I Tiresias had seen, <lb/>
            That not, a ghost a drop of blood should drink. <lb/>
            First came my soldier Elpenor's spirit, <lb n="45"/>
            Which left the body just when we set sail, <lb/>
            So that we had no leisure to inter it; <lb/>
            His heavy fate I did with tears bewail. <lb/>
            How now, quoth I, Elpenor? art thou here <lb/>
            Already? Couldst thou me so much outstrip? <lb n="50"/>
            I first came forth, and left thee in the rear, <lb/>
            Hast thou on foot outgone my good black ship? <lb/>
            Then said Elpenor: Issue of Jove, divine <lb/>
            Ulysses, I had come along with th' bark, <lb/>
            But that the Devil and excess of wine <lb n="55"/>
            Made me to fall, and break my neck i' th' dark. <lb/>
            I went to bed late by a ladder steep, <lb/>
            At top o' th' house the room was where I lay; <lb/>
            Wak'd at the noise of parting, half asleep, <lb/>
            Headlong I hither came, the nearest way. <lb n="60"/>
            Now I adjure you by your father, and <lb/>
            Your wife, and son, and all his seed to come, <lb/>
            (For I assured am that you will land <lb/>
            Where Circe dwells before your going home), <lb/>
            To see I have the rites due to the dead. <lb n="65"/>
            Fear th' anger of the Gods above, and burn <lb/>
            My body with my arms, from foot to head, <lb/>
            And cast on earth to cover o'er my urn. <lb/>
            This done, for men hereafter sailing by, <lb/>

            Lastly, upon it upright plant my oar. <lb/>
            All this, quoth I, I'll do upon my word. <lb/>
            Thus we discours'd amongst the shades. lie stood <lb/>
            While I continued with my naked sword <lb n="75"/>
            To keep the sprites from tasting of the blood. <lb/>
            Then came Anticlia my mother's ghost. <lb/>
            Alive I left her, when to Troy I sail'd, <lb/>
            To fight against it in the Argive host. <lb/>
            Now seeing her, exceedingly I wail'd; <lb n="80"/>
            And though I grieved were to keep away <lb/>
            My mother from the loved blood, yet still <lb/>
            In the same posture patiently I stay, <lb/>
            Till I might know Tiresias his will. <lb/>
            Then came the soul of old Tiresias, <lb n="85"/>
            And of the gilded staff he had in's hand. <lb/>
            Poor man, quoth he, perceiving what I was, <lb/>
            What brought thee hither to this ugly land ? <lb/>
            Stand back awhile, and take your sword away, <lb/>
            That I may drink, and the unerring word <lb n="90"/>
            Of Fate deliver to you. I obey, <lb/>
            Retire, and up I put my trusty sword. <lb/>
            Then said the good old prophet: You are come, <lb/>
            Honour'd Ulysses, to enquire of me, <lb/>
            What the Gods say about your going home. <lb n="95"/>
            I tell you true, 'twill not be easily. <lb/>
            I think you'll not escape at sea unseen <lb/>
            Of angry Neptune, who I do not doubt <lb/>
            Will do his worst, and make you feel his spleen, <lb/>
            For Polyphemus' eye which you put out. <lb n="100"/>
            Yet for all that, you may to Ithaca <lb/>
            Safely return, if you can but command <lb/>
            Your passion when in th' isle Thrinacia, <lb/>
            An island lying in your way you land; <lb/>
            There feed the kine of the all-seeing Sun, <lb n="105"/>
            And flocks of goodly sheep. Hurt none of these. <lb/>
            Then shall your ship her course with safety run <lb/>
            At length to Ithaca, though not with ease. <lb/>
            But if you touch them, I denounce a wreck <lb/>
            To your good ship, and death to all your crew. <lb n="110"/>
            And though yourself may happen to come back <lb/>
            At last, and this unhappy fate eschew, <lb/>
            'Twill be alone, and in a ship not yours; <lb/>
            Besides that, when you are returned home <lb/>
            You'll fall into the danger of the wooers, <lb n="115"/>
            Who for your wife's and meat's sake thither come. <lb/>
            But you will be reveng'd of these; and when <lb/>
            You shall have made away these wooers, go <lb/>

            Then home again, and offer unto all <lb/>

            Tiresias, quoth I, when he had done, <lb/>
            'Tis well. My mother yonder I espy <lb/>
            Amongst the shades; she knoweth not her son; <lb/>
            What shall I do to make her know 'tis I ? <lb n="130"/>
            That, quoth he, I can tell you easily. <lb/>
            What soul soever you admit to drink, <lb/>
            To what you ask will make a true reply; <lb/>
            Those you put back, back into Hell will slink. <lb/>
            The prophet having thus my fate foretold, <lb n="145"/>
            Into the house of Pluto back retir'd. <lb/>
            I o'er the blood my former posture hold, <lb/>
            But let my mother drink as she desir'd. <lb/>
            She knew me then, and wept. My son, said she, <lb/>
            How came you to this place of ours so dark ? <lb n="150"/>
            Th' ocean and so many gulphs there be <lb/>
            'Twixt you and us, that but with a good bark <lb/>
            No living man can pass. Come you but now <lb/>
            From Troy, and all this while have wand'ring been, <lb/>
            You and your company? You have, I trow, <lb n="155"/>
            Your wife Penelope by this time seen. <lb/>
            Mother, said I, the cause I came this way <lb/>
            Was to ask counsel of Tiresias. <lb/>
            Since I with Agamemnon went to Troy, <lb/>
            In Ithaca or Greece I never was. <lb n="160"/>
            But, mother, tell me, pray you, how came you <lb/>
            Unto this place? Was it by sickness long? <lb/>
            Or did Diana with a death undue <lb/>
            Send you down hither to this feeble throng? <lb/>
            And tell me if my father and my son <lb n="165"/>
            Remain as formerly in their estate; <lb/>
            Or that some prince of Greece my wife have won, <lb/>
            Supposing me now cast away by fate? <lb/>
            Tell me besides, whether Penelope <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            Remain at home together with my son, <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' de­ <lb/>

            Assisting him to rule my family; <lb/>
            Or whether she be married, and gone? <lb/>
            Your wife, said she, does still continue there; <lb/>
            For your long absence weepeth days and nights. <lb/>
            Your son still holds his own, and makes good cheer; <lb n="175"/>
            Oft he invited is, and oft invites. <lb/>
            Your father from his vineyard never budges; <lb/>
            Rich coverlets and bedding he refuses; <lb/>
            Ne'er comes to the town; in winter with his drudges <lb/>
            To lay him down, sleep by th' fire he uses. <lb n="180"/>
            In vile array in summer-time he creeps, <lb/>
            Till vintage pass, about his fruit-trees round, <lb/>
            And visits them each one; at night he sleeps <lb/>
            On bed of heaped leaves upon the ground. <lb/>
            Thus lies he griev'd and pining with the thought <lb n="185"/>
            Of your sad fate; afflicted too with age. <lb/>
            The like sad thoughts me also hither brought: <lb/>
            I neither died by Diana's rage, <lb/>
            Nor any long-consuming malady; <lb/>
            But very woe, thinking that you were dead, <lb n="190"/>
            My noble, dear Ulysses, made me die ; <lb/>
            My soul thus hither from my body fled. <lb/>
            When she had spoken, I would very fain <lb/>
            Have ta'en her in my arms; three times I grasp'd <lb/>
            At the beloved shadow, but in vain. <lb n="195"/>
            Mine arms I closed, but did nothing clasp. <lb/>
            Sore griev'd hereat, I said unto my mother, <lb/>
            I am your son, why do you fly me so? <lb/>
            Why may we not, embracing one another, <lb/>
            Although in Hell, give ease unto our woe? <lb n="200"/>
            Hath Proserpine, my sorrows to augment, <lb/>
            Sent me a phantom in my mother's stead? <lb/>
            Oh no, quoth she, my son, she'd no intent <lb/>
            T' abuse you. 'Tis the nature of the dead. <lb/>
            We are no longer sinews, flesh, and bones, <lb n="205"/>
            We are substances incorporeal, <lb/>
            All that's consumed i' th' fun'ral fire; when once <lb/>
            That's done, it in itself stands several; <lb/>
            Flies like a dream. No, go your ways to th' light, <lb/>
            And tell all I have told you to your wife, <lb n="210"/>
            That she may know in this perpetual night <lb/>
            The dead enjoy an everlasting life. <lb/>
            When we had thus discours'd, the ladies eame, <lb/>
            Sent out by Proserpine to taste the blood; <lb/>
            Daughters and wives to princes of great fame, <lb n="215"/>
            And round about me at the pit they stood. <lb/>
            But I to know each one that came to drink, <lb/>
            Studied awhile; then thought this counsel best, <lb/>
            With sword in hand t' abide upon the brink, <pb n="410"/>

            Whilst one was drinking to keep off the rest. <lb n="220"/>
            There was not one but I enquired her name <lb/>
            And pedigree. All told me who they were. <lb/>
            And first of all the well-born Tyro came, <lb/>
            Who said Salmoneus was her ancestor, <lb/>
            And that of Cretheus she bad been the wife, <lb n="225"/>
            And on Enipeus had enamour'd been <lb/>
            Once on a time whilst she remained in life; <lb/>
            On Enipeus, fair'st stream that e'er was seen, <lb/>
            Upon whose bank, Neptune, that chanc'd to spy her, <lb/>
            On Enipeus' sweet stream drew her aside, <lb n="230"/>
            And at the river's mouth laid him down by her, <lb/>
            Between two waves rais'd high, their deed to hide. <lb/>
            When he love's work had done, Thou shalt, said he, <lb/>
            Ere th' year be ended, bring forth children twain, <lb/>
            Who princes both of great renown shall be. <lb n="235"/>
            I Neptune am ; the Gods ne'er work in vain. <lb/>
            See you that they be educated well, <lb/>
            Till they shall be at man's estate arriv'd. <lb/>
            go you home: my name you must not tell. <lb/>
            This said, into the rolling sea he div'd. <lb n="240"/>
            Her time being come, she was delivered <lb/>
            Of two great boys, Neleus and Pelias, <lb/>
            Who for the service of high Jove were bred. <lb/>
            One king of Pyle, th' other of Ideas was. <lb/>
            The noble lady Tyro, besides these, <lb n="245"/>
            Did many other goodly children bear: <lb/>
            Amatheon, and Æson, and Pheres, <lb/>
            But these her husband Cretheus' children were. <lb/>
            Next came the daughter of AEsopus (who <lb/>
            Through Theban fertile plains and meadows runs) <lb n="250"/>
            Antiope. Of Jove she boasteth too, <lb/>
            That by him she conceived had two sons; <lb/>
            Their names were Zethus and Amphion. They <lb/>
            The founders were of Thebes; with walls and towers, <lb/>
            And sev'n strong gates they fenc'd it ev'ry way <lb n="255"/>
            Against invasion from all neighb'ring powers. <lb/>
            Amphitrion's wife Alcmena there I saw, <lb/>
            That lov'd by Jove brought Hercules to life. <lb/>
            And the king Cretheus' daughter Megara, <lb/>
            That was the mighty Hercules his wife. <lb n="260"/>
            I saw there also the unfortunate <lb/>
            Mother of Œdipus, Jocasta bright, <lb/>
            That blindly did a horrid act, by fate, <lb/>
            Which the Gods' pleasure was should come to light. <lb/>
            Not knowing him, she married her own son; <lb n="265"/>
            Not knowing him, he his own father slew: <lb/>
            When they perceived both what they had done, <lb/>
            Site hang'd herself; her Furies him pursue. <lb/>
            Chloris I saw, whom Neleus did wed <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            For beauty, got by the son of Joseus, <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' de­ <lb/>

            And with great dower he gain d her to his bed; <lb/>
            Her father Amphion rul'd Orchomenus. <lb/>
            She queen of Pyle, by Neleus had three boys; <lb/>
            Nestor, Chronius, Periclumenus; <lb/>
            And one fair daughter to make full their joys, <lb n="275"/>
            Pero by name, for beauty wondrous. <lb/>
            The princes round about were suitors to her; <lb/>
            But Iphiclus had Neleus' cattle ta'en, <lb/>
            And Neleus was resolved to bestow her <lb/>
            On him that could his herds fetch back again. <lb n="280"/>
            There was a prophet undertook the task; <lb/>
            But ta'en by clowns, and into prison pent, <lb/>
            For answering Iphyclus t' all he could ask <lb/>
            Was freed, and did the thing he underwent. <lb/>
            I saw the wife too of Tyndareus there, <lb n="285"/>
            Fair Leda; she two twins unto him bare, <lb/>
            Pollux, good cuffer; Castor, cavalier: <lb/>
            Twins, and alive, though under ground they arc, <lb/>
            And have obtained of their father Jove <lb/>
            Both to be canonized Gods; but so, <lb n="290"/>
            As he that is to-day in heaven above, <lb/>
            Shall be to-morrow amongst men below. <lb/>
            Iphimedea, Alciæus' wife, <lb/>
            I saw, that did two sons to Neptune bear, <lb/>
            Otus and Ephialtes; of short life; <lb n="295"/>
            The greatest and the fairest that ever were <lb/>
            Except Orion; each at nine years old <lb/>
            Between the shoulders was nine cubits wide, <lb/>
            And was in length nine cubits four times told, <lb/>
            And all the Gods in heaven terrified; <lb n="300"/>
            And threat'ned them with war, and heav'n to storm <lb/>
            They Ossa set upon Olympus high, <lb/>
            And Pelius on Ossa, and so form <lb/>
            Against the sky a mighty battery; <lb/>
            And surely they had storm'd it had they been <lb n="305"/>
            At man's estate; their beards were not yet grown; <lb/>
            Apollo kill'd them with his arrows keen, <lb/>
            Ere on their cheeks appeared any down. <lb/>
            Phædra and Procris there I also saw, <lb/>
            And Minos' daughter Ariadne, whom <lb n="310"/>
            Theseus was bringing towards Attica <lb/>
            From Creta, but he could not bring her home; <lb/>
            Diana killed her in Dia isle <lb/>
            On Bacchus' quarrel. There I did behold <lb/>
            l\læra and Clymene, and th' woman vile <lb n="315"/>
            Eryphile, that her own husband sold. <lb/>
            To name the ladies all I saw, would make <lb/>
            My tale to last all night. 'Tis bed-time now, <lb/>
            Here or aboard, though not till you think fit; <pb n="412"/>

            This said, the company deep silence seiz'd, <lb/>
            Delighted with the things they heard him speak. <lb/>
            The queen herself, Arete, no less pleas'd, <lb/>
            At last resolv'd the silence thus to break. <lb/>
            Princes, what think you of this man so rare, <lb n="325"/>
            His look, his stature, and his noble heart? <lb/>
            My guest he is, but you have all a share <lb/>
            In th' honour of this visit. Ere he part <lb/>
            Make him a present to relieve his need. <lb/>
            Be liberal, have no respect to thrift; <lb n="330"/>
            For you the Gods from fear of want have freed <lb/>
            With wealth abundant. Do not pinch your gift. <lb/>
            Old Echinous said : The queen says right; <lb/>
            We shall do well her counsel to obey. <lb/>
            But since in king Alcinous lies the might, <lb n="335"/>
            'Tis better first to hear what he will say. <lb/>
            Then said Alcinous, It shall be so, <lb/>
            Unless I bear the name of king in vain; <lb/>
            Let not the stranger till to-morrow<lb/>
            Till we prepare our gift he must remain. <lb n="340"/>
            As for his passage we will all provide, <lb/>
            And chiefly I that do the sceptre bear. <lb/>
            To whom the wise Ulysses thus replied: <lb/>
            Renown'd Alcinous, that reignest here, <lb/>
            Though a whole year you should command my stay. <lb n="345"/>
            It will not trouble me. Nay, that I'd chuse, <lb/>
            Since you intend to send me rich away: <lb/>
            For I am sure I shall no honour lose <lb/>
            By coming richly home. Kings that have store <lb/>
            Of wealth, are better commonly obey'd, <lb n="350"/>
            And by their subjects are respected more, <lb/>
            Than those whose treasuries and chests are void. <lb/>
            There be, the king said, many that can lie; <lb/>
            But there is form and sense in all you say; <lb/>
            Both your own fate you tell with harmony, <lb n="355"/>
            And of the Greeks with whom you went to Troy. <lb/>
            I should be well content to sit up here <lb/>
            All the night long, so you would undertake <lb/>
            To tell me ev'ry thing that you saw there. <lb/>
            To him Ulysses then did answer make: <lb n="360"/>
            Renowned king Alcinous, you know <lb/>
            There is a time for talk, a time for rest; <lb/>
            But since you long to hear, I'll tell you now <lb/>
            Whom else I saw, and what fate them oppress'd- <lb/>
            And first the saddest end of those that had <lb n="365"/>
            Escaped the fury of the enemy, <lb/>
            And in their countries landed were and glad, <lb/>
            Were murder'd by a woman's treachery. <lb/>
            The female ghosts scattered by Proserpine, <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            Some one way, some another; thither came <note type="margin"> LIB. XT. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses de­ <lb/>
            scent into Hell. </note> <lb n="370"/>
            Atrides' soul, first of the masculine, <lb/>
            And others with him, whose fates were the same. <lb/>
            No sooner he the blood had tasted, but <lb/>
            He knew me, sorely wept, and would have cast <lb/>
            His arms about my waist, but could not do't, <lb n="375"/>
            For now, alas, his strength was gone and past. <lb/>
            I griev'd to see him, and thus to him said: <lb/>
            King Agamemnon, what fate brought you hither? <lb/>
            Were you by Neptune on the sett betray'd, <lb/>
            And hither sent by fury of the weather? <lb n="380"/>
            Or landing to find booty, met with death? <lb/>
            Or else besieging of some town were slain? <lb/>
            Or for fair women were bereav'd of breath? <lb/>
            Then Agamemnon answer'd me again: <lb/>
            Noble Ulysses, I lost not my life <lb n="385"/>
            By Neptune's fury, nor in fight at land <lb/>
            For booty or for women; but my wife <lb/>
            Did basely kill me by Ægistus' hand. <lb/>
            At my first landing he invited me, <lb/>
            And slew me then when I at supper sate. <lb n="390"/>
            Just as a man would kill a cow, so he <lb/>
            Kill'd me. There's no such woful death as that. <lb/>
            My friends were butchered like so many swine, <lb/>
            Which when within a mighty rich man's hall <lb/>
            Numbers of men invited are to dine <lb n="395"/>
            At wedding, or at feast, are made to fall. <lb/>
            You very many men have seen to die <lb/>
            In ranged battle, and in single fight, <lb/>
            But never felt such pity certainly <lb/>
            As you had felt, had you but seen this sight, <lb n="400"/>
            How we 'mongst tables on the ground did lie, <lb/>
            That ran with blood. But my heart most did rue <lb/>
            To hear Cassandra, Priam's daughter, cry, <lb/>
            Whom close beside me Clytemnestra slew. <lb/>
            Then, though I were at the last gasp, I tried <lb n="405"/>
            If groping I might find my fallen sword; <lb/>
            But the curs'd woman push'd it from my side. <lb/>
            I died; to close mine eyes she'd not afford. <lb/>
            Nothing so cruel as a woman yet <lb/>
            Did nature e'er produce; a thought so ill <lb n="410"/>
            In any other breast did never sit, <lb/>
            As her own loving husband's blood to spill. <lb/>
            Yet this my wife, to the eternal shame <lb/>

            But ev'n of those that have no evil fame), <lb n="415"/>
            Betray'd my life, and of my death was glad. <lb/>
            Jove meant to Atreus' seed, said I, great spite <lb/>
            By womankind. By Helen first. At Troy, <lb/>

            And Clytemnestra now did you betray. <lb n="320"/>
            Therefore, said Agamemnon, never trust <lb/>
            A woman more, although she be your own. <lb/>
            Tell her not all you think : somewhat you must; <lb/>
            And somewhat keep t' yourself to her unknown. <lb/>
            But you, Ulysses, need not fear your wife, <lb n="325"/>
            Icareus' daughter, fair Penelope; <lb/>
            She loves you better than to take your life: <lb/>
            A wife so wise will scorn disloyalty. <lb/>
            When we for Troy set forth together, then <lb/>
            She gave suck to your son; but he is grown <lb n="430"/>
            A man by this time, and takes place with men; <lb/>
            Is rich, and one day shall his father own, <lb/>
            And he and you at home embrace each other. <lb/>
            But I was not allow'd my son to see, <lb/>
            But was first murder'd by his wicked mother. <lb n="435"/>
            Now hear ye; if you will be rul'd by me, <lb/>
            Let no man know beforehand, when and where <lb/>
            You mean to land in Ithaca. Beware <lb/>
            Of suffering your bark in sight t' appear. <lb/>
            Remember still, women unfaithful are. <lb n="440"/>
            But tell me, have you nothing all this while <lb/>
            Heard of my son Orestes? Whether he <lb/>
            At Sparta with his uncle be, or Pyle? <lb/>
            For dead he is not, I know certainly. <lb/>
            Alas, said I, Atrides, how should I, <lb n="445"/>
            That wand'ring was at sea, hear any news <lb/>
            Whether alive or dead he be? Or why <lb/>
            Should I with tales uncertain you abuse? <lb/>
            Discoursing thus, and weeping there we stood, <lb/>
            When great Achilles' soul appear'd to us; <lb n="450"/>
            And with him also the two spirits good <lb/>
            Of stout Patroclus and Antilochus. <lb/>
            The soul of Ajax, son of Telamon, <lb/>
            Was also there, who 'mongst those warriors tall <lb/>
            The goodliest person was, except the son <lb n="455"/>
            Of Peleus, who did much excel them all. <lb/>
            Achilles drank, and presently me knew, <lb/>
            And said, Ulysses, what brought you to Hell? <lb/>
            What plot upon the dead you hither drew, <lb/>
            Where none but shades of wretched mortals dwell? <lb n="460"/>
            Achilles, said I, I was forc'd to come <lb/>
            T' inquire of th' wizard, old Tiresias, <lb/>
            What the Fates say about my going home, <lb/>
            Whether or no, and how 'twill come to pass. <lb/>
            For since I came from Troy I have not seen <lb n="465"/>
            Nor Ithaca, nor any Grecian shore; <lb/>
            For toss'd and cross'd at sea I still have been; <lb/>
            But you are now as well as heretofore. <lb/>
            Like any God we honoured you at Troy, <lb/>

            Death hath not chang d your state; you still enjoy <lb/>
            A regal power. To this Achilles said : <lb/>
            Talk not to me of honour here in Hell; <lb/>
            I'd rather serve a clown on earth for bread, <lb/>
            Than be, of all things incorporeal, <lb n="475"/>
            That are, or ever shall be, supreme head. <lb/>
            But tell me of my son, Neoptolemus ; <lb/>
            Whether he came to Troy, and how he fought; <lb/>
            And of my aged father, Peleus, <lb/>
            Whether he keep his place, or be put out. <lb n="480"/>
            For since much time his vigour hath decay'd, <lb/>
            Some foe, it may be, bath usurp'd his place <lb/>
            In Pthia, and in Ilellas where he sway'd, <lb/>
            And put him, with his people, in disgrace. <lb/>
            But were I now above, and strong as then, <lb n="485"/>
            When for the Greeks I fought at Ilium, <lb/>
            And slew so many of their bravest men, <lb/>
            And to my aged father's house should come ; <lb/>
            If there I were, 'twould not be very long <lb/>
            Before I made some of their hearts to ache, <lb n="490"/>
            That go about to do my father wrong, <lb/>
            And would by force his honour from him take. <lb/>
            When he had done, I made him answer thus : <lb/>
            Concerning Peleus I can nothing say; <lb/>
            But of your son, stout Neoptolemus, <lb n="495"/>
            I know enough : 'twas I brought him to Troy <lb/>
            From Scyros' isle. In council, always he <lb/>
            First spake his mind, and never spake but well. <lb/>
            Nestor and I, sometimes, and only we, <lb/>
            Th' advice he gave were able to refel. <lb n="500"/>
            In fight, he sought no shelter in the throng, <lb/>
            But ever out he ran before the rest, <lb/>
            To show his courage and his strength among <lb/>
            Those foes that were in Troy esteem'd the best. <lb/>
            The names of all he slew I cannot tell; <lb n="505"/>
            They are too many. But 'twas by his sword <lb/>
            That great Eurypylus in battle fell, <lb/>
            Of all the Trojan aids the goodli'st lord, <lb/>
            Excepting Memnon. After, when we were <lb/>
            Within the wooden horse concealed, and I <lb n="510"/>
            The power had of ordering all things there, <lb/>
            I never saw your son to wipe his eye, <lb/>
            Or to wax pale, as many of us did. <lb/>
            He never longed to be set on land <lb/>
            From out the hole in which we all lay hid; <lb n="515"/>
            And to his hilt he often put his hand, <lb/>
            And often to his spear. And when at last <lb/>
            We won, and rifled had the town of Troy, <lb/>
            He home into his country safely passed, <pb n="416"/>

            And which is more, he came off safe and sound; <lb/>
            Though Mars each way threw deaths and wounds about <lb/>
            Amongst the crowd, he ne'er received wound, <lb/>
            Neither from them that shot, nor them that fought. <lb/>
            This said, the swift Achilles' soul retir'd, <lb n="525"/>
            Strutting into the mead of Asphodel, <lb/>
            Proud of his son, to hear what he desir'd. <lb/>
            Then other grieved souls their stories tell. <lb/>
            Only the soul of Ajax stood off mute <lb/>
            And sullen, because I did from him bear <lb n="530"/>
            Achilles' armour in that sad dispute, <lb/>
            Where Pallas and the Trojans judges were. <lb/>
            I would I had not had that victory, <lb/>
            Which cost the life of him that was the most <lb/>
            Admir'd by all, for form and chivalry, <lb n="535"/>
            Except Achilles, in the Argive host. <lb/>
            I gently to him spake Ajax, said I, <lb/>
            Forget that cursed armour now at last; <lb/>
            And since you dead are, let your anger die : <lb/>
            For why, the Gods determin'd had to cast <lb n="540"/>
            Those arms amongst us for a punishment, <lb/>
            Offended with us, what e'er was the matter, <lb/>
            And us'd them as an engine, with intent <lb/>
            Our greatest tower, which was yourself, to batter. <lb/>
            For whom the Argives did lament no less <lb n="545"/>
            Than for Achilles, Thetis' son. Come nigh, <lb/>
            And hear what I can answer, and suppress <lb/>
            Your mighty heart awhile. So ended I. <lb/>
            To this just nothing he replied, but went <lb/>
            Int' Erebus 'mongst other shadows dim; <lb n="550"/>
            Yet there, I think, he would have been content <lb/>
            To speak to me, if I to speak to him. <lb/>
            But I desired others' souls to see. <lb/>
            Then Minos there, the son of Jove, I saw, <lb/>
            With golden sceptre, dealing equity <lb n="555"/>
            To souls that stood and sat to hear the law. <lb/>
            Next after him, I saw the great Orion ; <lb/>
            A mighty club he carried in his hand; <lb/>
            And hunted the wild boar, and bear, and lion, <lb/>
            Which when he lived he had kill'd on land. <lb n="560"/>
            There also saw I Titius. He lay <lb/>
            Upon his back, stretch'd out full acres nine. <lb/>
            He the fair Leto had, upon the way <lb/>
            To Pytho, injur'd ; Leto, Jove's concubine. <lb/>
            Two vultures on his breast, on each side one, <lb n="565"/>
            Sate dipping of their beaks into his liver. <lb/>
            He stirreth not, but lets them still alone ; <lb/>
            And thus devouring it, they stay for ever. <lb/>
            And Tantalus I saw up to the chin <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            In water clear, and longing sore to drink ; <note type="margin"> LIB. XI. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' de. <lb/>

            But as he bow d himself to take it in, <lb/>
            Some devil always made the water sink. <lb/>
            Close o'er his head hung pleasant fruit, and ripe <lb/>
            Pears and pomegranates, olives, apples, figs, <lb/>
            Which ever when he ready was to gripe, <lb n="575"/>
            A sudden wind still whisk'd away the twigs. <lb/>
            And Sisyphus I saw, who 'gainst the hill, <lb/>
            With hands and feet, a heavy stone doth roll; <lb/>
            But when unto the top he brings it, still <lb/>
            The naughty stone falls back into the hole. <lb n="580"/>
            Then to't he goes afresh, with no less pain <lb/>
            He heaves and sweats, and dusty is all o'er; <lb/>
            And when 'tis up, he labour'd has in vain, <lb/>
            For still it serves him as it did before. <lb/>
            Then Hercules I saw,—I mean his sprite, <lb n="585"/>
            For he is with th' immortal Gods above, <lb/>
            And taken has to wife Hebe the bright, <lb/>
            Daughter of Juno, and of mighty Jove. <lb/>
            The dead about him made a fearful cry, <lb/>
            Like frighted fowl. A golden belt he wore, <lb n="590"/>
            With wild beasts wrought, and slaughters cunningly, <lb/>
            The like shall never be, nor was before. <lb/>
            He saw, and knew me presently, and spake: <lb/>
            Renown'd Ulysses, why left you the light ? <lb/>
            Alas, were you constrain'd to undertake <lb n="595"/>
            This task as I was, by a meaner wight ? <lb/>
            Who, though Jove's son I was, did me constrain <lb/>
            Full many other labours t'undergo. <lb/>
            But he thought this would put me to most pain, <lb/>
            Th' infernal dog upon the earth to show. <lb n="600"/>
            I did it though, and dragg'd him up to th' light, <lb/>
            By Mercury's and by Athena's aid. <lb/>
            Having thus said, he vanish'd out of sight <lb/>
            'Mongst other phantoms. But I still there stay'd, <lb/>
            Hoping more heroes of th' old time to see ; <lb n="605"/>
            And more had surely seen of heavenly race, <lb/>
            Theseus, Pirythous, whom t' had pleased me, <lb/>
            If longer I had dar'd to keep my place. <lb/>
            For then, from out of Hell, with hideous cry, <lb/>
            Thousands of souls about me gathered, <lb n="610"/>
            And frighted me; but most afraid was I, <lb/>
            Lest Proserpine should send out Gorgon's head. <lb/>
            Then went I to my ship and company, <lb/>
            And for a while our oars at sea we plied: <lb/>
            But after we were on the main, then we <lb n="615"/>
            A fair gale had, and pass'd the ocean wide. <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> E E </note></p><pb n="418"/>

            When day was come, my fellows I command <lb/>
            To fetch Elpenor's body dead away. <lb/>
            With wood from off a promontory near, <lb/>
            Weeping, his body we to ashes burn, <lb n="10"/>
            Together with his arms, and th' earth we rear, <lb/>
            To be a monument upon his urn ; <lb/>
            And on the same we fix his oar upright. <lb/>
            These ceremonies done, came the divine <lb/>
            Circe, that knew we landed were that night. <lb n="15"/>
            Her maids brought to us bread, and meat, and wine; <lb/>
            And standing in the midst, Poor men, said she, <lb/>
            That come from Hell, and thither must again ; <lb/>
            Twice-mortals, take your food, and merry be <lb/>

            This pleas'd us well, and all day long we sate <lb n="25"/>
            Eating and drinking wine, until 'twas dark. <lb/>
            And somewhat e'er we saw it evening late, <lb/>
            My mates lay down to sleep beside the bark. <lb/>
            Then Circe led me by the hand aside, <lb/>
            And ask'd me all that I had seen in Hell; <lb n="30"/>
            Nor anything at all from her I hide. <lb/>
            'Tis well, said she. Now hear what I you tell: <lb/>
            First, you must pass the Sirens, who invite <lb/>
            All passengers that sail before the place <lb/>
            To land. But whosoever lands, that wight <lb n="35"/>
            Of's wife and children ne'er more sees the face. <lb/>

            Rotting, and rivel'd skins lie scattering. <lb/>
            Pass on, and their enchanting music fly. <lb n="40"/>
            Command your mates to tie you to the mast; <lb/>
            And that, if you make signs to be set free, <lb/>
            They heed you not, but bind you still more fast. <lb/>

            When you are gotten out of hearing quite, <lb/>
            And have the Sirens far off at your backs, <lb/>
            Another danger soon will come in sight. <lb/>
            Two ways there are ; but which of them to take <lb/>
            111 not advise you, both of them are naught. <lb n="50"/>
            Yourself upon the place your judgment make, <lb/>
            Of which I'll give you only a short draught. <lb/>
            Two rocks there be, that, with inclining brow, <lb/>
            Hang o'er the sea, which roaring runs between; <lb/>
            By th' name of Wanderers the Gods them know, <lb n="55"/>
            Because in changed posture they are seen. <lb/>
            Whereof the one does to such height ascend, <lb/>
            That never any birds that way take wing, <lb/>
            Nor fearful doves when they to Heaven tend, <lb/>
            Ambrosia to th' immortal Gods to bring. <lb n="60"/>
            One of these rocks doth vanish now and then, <lb/>
            But Jove still sets another in its stead. <lb/>
            This way, ne'er ship did safely carry men, <lb/>
            But dash'd was 'gainst the rocks, and perished. <lb/>
            The good ship Argo only passed that way <lb n="65"/>

            The other rock unmov'd, with pointed head, <lb/>
            Pierceth the clouds, and reaches to the sky <lb n="70"/>
            In winter, and in summer's covered <lb/>
            And wrapped up in mists perpetually. <lb/>
            Nor could a mortal man climb up unto't, <lb/>
            Although he were indued with twenty hands, <lb/>
            And with as many nimble feet to boot, <lb n="75"/>
            So smooth it is, and so upright it stands. <lb/>
            I' th' midst o' th' rock you '11 see a cavern dark <lb/>
            That looketh westward. That way you must row. <lb/>
            The mouth o' th' cave is more above your bark <lb/>
            Than th' youngest man can shoot to with a bow. <lb n="80"/>
            There 'tis that Scylla dwells and barks : her voice <lb/>
            Like to a lion's whelp's voice is ; but she <lb/>
            A mighty monster is ; 'twould not rejoice <lb/>
            A God, much less a man, her shape to see. <lb/>
            Twelve feet she has in all, and ugly ones. <lb n="85"/>
            Six huge long necks; and to each neck a head; <lb/>
            And in each head for teeth sh' has rows of bones, <lb/>
            And every row of them envenomed. <lb/>
            Half of her body in the cave she hides ; <lb/>
            But all her heads she putteth out, and watches <lb n="90"/>
            For dog-fish, dolphins, and what fish besides <lb/>
            The sea affords, and whales she sometimes catches. <lb/>
            Ne'er did bold sailor boast, that pass'd that way, <lb/>
            That he had 'scaped safely by her den; <note type="footnote"> E E 2 </note> <pb n="420"/>

            'Gainst such a monster, remedy there's none, <lb/>

            For if you stay to put your armour on, <lb/>
            She'll stoop again, and take another prey. <lb n="120"/>
            Row swiftly on, and to Cratais cry, <lb/>
            That in her belly the foul monster bore, <lb/>
            And she will keep her in as you go by, <lb/>

            The keeping of their father's cattle there. <lb/>
            These if you suffer quietly to feed, <lb/>
            You shall get home again, though with some pain; <lb/>

            And though yourself you save, your ship you'll lose, <lb/>

            This said, the rosy-finger'd Morning rose, <lb/>

            As when we were gone off, and sails had spread, <lb/>
            To fill them with a favourable wind. <lb/>
            So sate we while the steersman governed. <lb/>
            Then to my mates with heavy heart I spake : <lb/>
            Not one or two of you alone must hear <lb n="150"/>
            What Circe said, but all, that you may take <lb/>
            Your own advice, since 'tis a common fear. <lb/>
            You must not hear the Sirens' melody, <lb/>
            But row with all your might till we be pass'd. <lb/>
            To me alone, she gives that liberty, <lb n="155"/>
            But so as first you bind me to the mast. <lb/>
            Bind me you must upright both hand and foot, <lb/>

            And if I wink upon you to undo't, <lb/>
            Then take more cord and bind me faster yet. <lb n="160"/>
            Whilst I my fellows thus informing stood, <lb/>
            The island of the Sirens came in sight: <lb/>
            For nimble was our ship, and the wind good. <lb/>
            But suddenly we were becalmed quite; <lb/>
            Some demon sure had laid the waves asleep. <lb n="165"/>
            Then took we in our sails, and laid them by, <lb/>
            And with our oars in hand provok'd the deep, <lb/>
            And in a milky path we forward ply. <lb/>
            Then from a ball of wax I pinch a bit, <lb/>

            And so to all in order as they sit. <lb/>
            Which soon was done, the weather being hot. <lb/>
            Then straight they rise and bind me to the mast <lb/>
            At th' arms and feet: the knot behind they tie; <lb/>
            And then upon their seats themselves they plac'd, <lb n="175"/>

            When to the island we were come so nigh, <lb/>

            But 'twould not be. My mates regard my words, <lb/>

            An angry sea before us all in smoke ; <lb/>
            And thumping of the mighty waves we heard <lb/>
            Upon the stubborn rocks at every stroke. <lb/>
            Besides, the sea so mighty loud did roar, <lb/>
            As with one dismal hum it fill'd the ear, <lb n="210"/>
            And made my mates each one let fall his oar, <lb/>
            So much their senses were benumb'd with fear. <lb/>
            Still stood the bark. Then I among them go <lb/>
            With gentle words, new courage to convey <lb/>
            Into their failing hearts, to make them row; <lb n="215"/>
            And passing by, to every one I say : <lb/>
            My friends, we all have many dangers passed, <lb/>
            And greater much than what we now do fear. <lb/>
            Remember how from Polyphemus vast, <lb/>
            By my good conduct, we deliver'd were. <lb n="220"/>
            I do not doubt but you remember it: <lb/>
            My counsel, therefore, also now obey. <lb/>
            Row close along the shore, the Gods may yet <lb/>
            Deliver us, but by no other way. <lb/>
            But you that have the guiding of the ship, <lb n="225"/>
            Steersman, to you I speak, mark what I say; <lb/>
            Steer her without the smoke ; for if she slip <lb/>
            Aside, though little, we are cast away. <lb/>
            This said, my fellows speedily obey'd. <lb/>
            Of th' monster Scylla not a word I told ; <lb n="230"/>
            Lest they should throw away their oars, dismayed, <lb/>
            And for their shelter run into the hold. <lb/>
            But Circe's counsel I had quite forgot. <lb/>
            I arm'd myself, and took into my hand <lb/>
            Two spears, though she expressly had said not; <lb n="235"/>
            And looking upwards, at the head I stand. <lb/>
            But she appeared not. I look'd so high <lb/>
            And long upon the hideous rock, my sight <lb/>
            Began to fail, and now we were close by <lb/>
            That dismal straight, which doth us all affright. <lb n="240"/>
            Here Scylla stands, and there Charybdis dire <lb/>

            And we could see the bottom very plain; <lb/>
            Sandy it was, and black to look upon. <lb/>
            Whilst we our eyes upon Charybdis fix, <lb/>
            And stand amazed at the horrid sight, <lb n="250"/>
            Suddenly Scylla stoop'd, and snatch'd up six <lb/>
            Of the best men I had to row or fight. <lb/>
            I from the ship that never stirr'd my eye, <lb/>
            Soon saw their sprawling arms and legs i' th' air, <lb/>
            And heard them lamentably to me cry, <lb n="255"/>
            And name me in their uttermost despair. <lb/>
            As fishers in a horn mix fraud and food, <lb/>
            And from the bank at th' end of a long wand, <lb/>
            To catch the fry cast it into the flood, <lb/>
            Then pluck them up, and throw them on the land: <lb n="260"/>
            So lifted were my mates. Of my mishaps <lb/>
            This was the saddest I did ever see, <lb/>
            When she my men cham'd in her ugly chaps, <lb/>
            Roaring and holding out their hands to me. <lb/>
            From Scylla we unto the island row, <lb n="265"/>
            Where feeding were Sol's sacred sheep and kine. <lb/>
            Before we landed I could hear them low ; <lb/>
            Which brought into my mind the prophesy <lb/>
            Of old Tiresias the Theban bard, <lb/>
            That counsel'd me this island for to shun. <lb n="270"/>
            Of Circe also I like counsel heard, <lb/>
            And not to land i' th' Island of the Sun. <lb/>
            Then speaking to my fellows, Friends, said I, <lb/>
            This island sacred is to Sol; this place <lb/>
            Tiresias and Circe both bid fly, <lb n="275"/>
            And not to disembark in any case. <lb/>
            For if we do, for certain they declare <lb/>
            The greatest mischief that e'er men betel: <lb/>
            Therefore keep out to seaward, and beware <lb/>
            Of landing here, and then we shall be well. <lb n="280"/>
            But then Eurylochus to me began : <lb/>
            You have, Ulysses, a hard heart, quoth he ; <lb/>
            There is no labour but you bear it can ; <lb/>
            Your limbs of stubborn steel composed be. <lb/>

            With their continual tugging at the oar, <lb/>
            And that refreshment is and sleep requir'd, <lb/>
            Which is not to be had but on the shore. <lb/>
            But you would have us wander in the night, <lb/>
            When in the night the greatest winds arise, <lb n="290"/>
            The bane of ships ; and when deprived of light, <lb/>
            To save ourselves we can no way devise. <lb/>
            What if great winds should blow from south or west, <lb/>

            Or not consent ? Therefore I think it best <lb n="295"/>
            To-night to sup ashore,-to-morrow row. <lb/>
            So said Eurylochus, and was commended <lb/>
            By all my mates : and presently I knew <lb/>
            One demon or another had intended <lb/>
            To ruin me, together with my crew. <lb n="300"/>
            Then said I to Eurylochus, 'Twere vain <lb/>
            To strive against so many men alone. <lb/>
            But you shall take an oath that you 'll abstain <lb/>
            From hurting of the cattle of the Sun. <lb/>
            Of Circe's meat there's left us yet good store. <lb n="305"/>
            This said, they took the oath ; which having done, <lb/>
            They put into the harbour, and ashore <lb/>
            They sup. And when their hunger now was gone, <lb/>
            Their mates remembering, that in th' hollow rock <lb/>
            By th' monster Scylla were devoured, they weep <lb n="310"/>
            And wail, and with their hands they knock <lb/>
            Their breasts, and in that posture fell asleep. <lb/>
            The stars had climb'd a third part of the sky, <lb/>
            When with a whirlwind Jove together fetched <lb/>
            The clouds from ev'ry part, and suddenly <lb n="315"/>
            On sea and land a dismal night was stretched. <lb/>
            And when the rosy-finger'd Morning came, <lb/>
            Our ship we to a hollow cave advance, <lb/>
            Wherein the sea-nymphs seats and couches have, <lb/>
            And where they are accustomed to dance. <lb n="320"/>
            Thither I call'd my mates, and said again: <lb/>
            Friends, we have meat and drink aboard, be wise, <lb/>
            And from the herds and flocks of Sol abstain, <lb/>
            Who heareth all we say, and all espies. <lb/>
            To this did my companions all assent. <lb n="325"/>
            But for a month there blew no other wind <lb/>
            Than south and east; so that we there were pent <lb/>
            I' th' island longer than we had designed. <lb/>
            My mates, whilst they had bread and meat aboard, <lb/>
            Forbore to meddle with the sacred kine, <lb n="330"/>
            And fetch'd in what the island did afford <lb/>
            Of fish and fowl, to have wherewith to dine. <lb/>
            Up I into the island went aside, <lb/>
            The conduct of th' immortal Gods t' implore, <lb/>
            That some of them t' would please to be my guide, <lb n="335"/>
            And me unto my country to restore. <lb/>
            And in a place defended from the wind <lb/>
            I wash'd my hands; and then with tears and sighs <lb/>
            Before the Gods I poured out my mind, <lb/>
            And they a sweet sleep poured on my eyes. <lb n="340"/>
            Meantime Eurylochus bad counsel gives <lb/>
            To his companions. All deaths, quoth he, <lb/>
            Are hateful to what thing soever lives; <lb/>

            committed in the <lb/>

            And sacrifice unto the Gods on high; <lb/>
            And to appease the Sun, let's all make vows <lb/>
            To build a temple to his Deity, <lb/>
            Enrich'd with gifts. If not content with this, <lb/>
            For a few cows displeas'd, he seek our death, <lb n="350"/>
            For once to gape and die, far better 'tis <lb/>
            Than strive with hunger till we lose our breath. <lb/>
            This said, my fellows all his counsel take, <lb/>
            And chase Sol's sacred herds, that graz'd hard by; <lb/>
            And then for recompense their vows they make <lb n="355"/>
            To build a temple to his Deity. <lb/>
            But when they made their vows, chaplets they wear <lb/>
            Of tender leaves pluck'd from the spreading oak. <lb/>
            White barley they had none, the which men bear, <lb/>
            When in their danger they the Gods invoke. <lb n="360"/>
            After the vow performed, the kine they flay, <lb/>
            And take their thighs and cover them with fat, <lb/>
            And one of them upon the other lay, <lb/>
            To burn upon the altar. After that, <lb/>
            Their offering of drink they pour'd upon <lb n="365"/>
            The altar, as the sacrifice they burn; <lb/>
            It ought t' have been of wine, but having none, <lb/>
            They pour'd on water fair, which serv'd the turn. <lb/>
            When th' entrails by my fellows eaten were, <lb/>
            And fire consumed had the sacrifice, <lb n="370"/>
            The rest they roast on spits and made good cheer. <lb/>
            Just then it was that sleep forsook my eyes, <lb/>
            And back again I walk'd down towards the shore; <lb/>
            But coming near, perceiv'd the vapour rise <lb/>
            Of roasted meat. Then to the Gods I roar: <lb n="375"/>
            You give me sleep, and take away my life; <lb/>
            So strange a thing my mates the while have done. <lb/>
            Swiftly Lampetio to heav'n flies, <lb/>
            And carries up the news unto the Sun. <lb/>
            The Sun in choler all the Gods defies, <lb n="380"/>
            Unless they right him of his injury. <lb/>
            Jove, father, and you other powers divine, <lb/>
            Revenge me of Ulysses' company, <lb/>
            That have so insolently slain my kine. <lb/>
            It was my joy to see them in the morn, <lb n="385"/>
            And in the evening e'er I went to bed. <lb/>
            Revenge me, oh ye Gods! of this their scorn, <lb/>
            Or I'll go down to Hell and light the dead. <lb/>
            No, Phœbus, answered Jove, hold up your light, <lb/>
            For Gods and mortal men to see their way. <lb n="390"/>
            As for the men that did you this despite, <lb/>
            Their ship at sea with lightning I'll destroy. <lb/>
            At this discourse in heaven was Hermes by, <lb/>
            And heard his father make this sad decree; <pb n="426"/>

            And he again told all this history <lb n="395"/>
            To the fair Calypso, and she told it me. <lb/>
            When to my fellows I was come, I rate <lb/>
            Them all full bitterly, and one by one; <lb/>
            But all in vain, for now it was too late: <lb/>
            The Gods by signs detested what was done. <lb n="400"/>
            The skins did creep, the flesh o' th' spits did low, <lb/>
            Both raw and roast. Six days in th' isle we staid, <lb/>
            Feasting on Phœbus' kine, the seventh we row; <lb/>
            For then the fury of the wind was laid. <lb/>
            When we were out at sea we fix our mast, <lb n="405"/>
            And up into the wind our sails we draw, <lb/>
            And had the isle so far behind us cast, <lb/>
            That nothing else but sky and sea we saw. <lb/>
            Then Jove, when far from land he saw our ship, <lb/>
            Just over it a dismal black cloud hung, <lb n="410"/>
            Which made it dark as night upon the deep, <lb/>
            And then our good ship run not very long. <lb/>
            For presently from west a sudden blast <lb/>
            Came roaring in, and vehemently strains <lb/>
            And breaks the cordage that upheld the mast, <lb n="415"/>
            Which falling down, beats out the steerer's brains: <lb/>
            He drops into the sea. The mast hangs o'er <lb/>
            At stern. The yards lie cross the sink: <lb/>
            And all the while both heaven and sea did roar <lb/>
            With thunder loud, which made our hearts to shrink. <lb n="420"/>
            And by and by into the ship Jove threw <lb/>
            His thunder-bolt, which whirl'd it round about. <lb/>
            It smelt of sulphur rank; and all my crew <lb/>
            Into the sea it suddenly threw out. <lb/>
            They like to gulls from wave to wave were borne, <lb n="425"/>
            But I kept still aboard, till at the last <lb/>
            The rudder from astern the ship was torn, <lb/>
            And fell into the sea, and with't the mast. <lb/>
            The mast had hanging on it broken ropes, <lb/>
            Wherewith I bound them both together fast, <lb n="430"/>
            And sate upon them as my latest hopes, <lb/>
            Until the fury of the storm was past. <lb/>
            The storm now laid, th' wind came about to th* south, <lb/>
            And carried me before it, till the sun <lb/>
            Next morning rose; and then we were i'th'mouth <lb n="435"/>
            Of dire Charybdis, just when she begun <lb/>
            To swallow up the sea. Then up leap'd I, <lb/>
            And on a spreading sycamore laid hold, <lb/>
            But to't I could not climb; the boughs so high <lb/>
            I could not reach, and far off was the root. <lb n="440"/>
            There by the hands I hung, expecting when <lb/>
            Charybdis should cast up the sea, and bring <lb/>
            The rudder and the mast to th' top agen. <lb/>
            Meanwhile, in th' air I patiently swing. <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>

            Ending the brabbles of contentious men, <lb/>
            And all come weary home to take their meat, <lb/>
            Then came my mast and rudder up agen; <lb/>
            And I into the sea close by them drop. <lb/>
            Then having soon recovered them, again <lb n="450"/>
            I place myself astride, once more, a-top, <lb/>
            And with my hands I rowed on the main. <lb/>
            If Scylla this had seen, undoubtedly <lb/>
            I had been lost. But 'twas the grace of Jove, <lb/>
            That all this while she did not me espy, <lb n="455"/>
            But kept herself retir'd i' th' rock above. <lb/>
            Thus wander'd I at sea nine days outright; <lb/>
            0' th' tenth at night the Gods brought me to land <lb/>
            In th' isle Ogygia, where Calypso bright <lb/>
            Receiv'd me with a charitable hand. <lb n="460"/>
            But how she treated me, I need not say; <lb/>
            You and the queen already know it well, <lb/>
            From the relation I made yesterday; <lb/>
            Nor do I love the same tale twice to tell.</p>

            waking knows it <lb/>
            not. Pallas in <lb/>
            form of a shep­ <lb/>
            herd helps to <lb/>
            hide his treasure. <lb/>
            The ship that <lb/>

            turned into a <lb/>

            formed into an <lb/>
            old beggar. </note> <lb/>
            Alcinous then said, Ulysses, since <lb/>
            You safely to me are arrived here, <lb/>
            You shall not lose your way in going hence. <lb/>
            But, princes, you that daily with me sit, <lb n="5"/>
            Drinking good wine and hearing music sweet, <lb/>
            And given to the stranger have what's fit, <lb/>
            I'll tell you what yet farther I think meet. <lb/>
            Garments he has a chest full, and good store <lb/>
            Of gold, plate, and of other gifts he has. <lb n="10"/>
            Take my advice. Let each man give him more, <lb/>
            A cauldron, or a three-foot pot of brass. <lb/>
            I know to each man 'twill be too great largess, <lb/>
            But by the people's contribution <lb/>
            We'll make amends; the town shall bear the charges. <lb n="15"/>
            The motion pleas'd, and 'twas agreed upon. <lb/>
            Then went they every man to his repose. <lb/>
            And soon as morning did again appear, <lb/>
            Aboard the ship the vessels they dispose, <pb n="428"/>

            Alcinous himself directed where. <lb n="20"/>
            And then into the palace they return, <lb/>
            And sacrifice to Jove a well-fed beast; <lb/>
            The thighs upon the altar there they burn, <lb/>
            And with the rest they make themselves a feast. <lb/>
            Demodocus before them sung and play'd, <lb n="25"/>
            Who for his art was famous in the town. <lb/>
            Ulysses to the sun look'd up, and stayed <lb/>
            Longing and wishing that it would go down ; <lb/>
            As one that hath at plough been all the day, <lb/>
            Hungry his belly, feeble is his knee, <lb n="30"/>
            Beholds the setting of the sun with joy; <lb/>
            So glad Ulysses was sunset to see. <lb/>
            Then to Alcinous and all the rest, <lb/>
            Offer, said he, unto the Gods their wine. <lb/>
            I have already all that I request, <lb n="35"/>
            And many gifts, which may the pow'rs divine <lb/>
            Make happy to me. Let me now depart, <lb/>
            That I may see my dear wife and my friends. <lb/>
            And blest may you stay here with joy at heart, <lb/>
            Comfort your wives, and obtain all your ends; <lb n="40"/>
            And strong and worthy children may you have, <lb/>
            Nor 'mongst the people trouble or disease- <lb/>
            This said, they prais'd him all, and counsel gave <lb/>
            The stranger to conduct safe o'er the seas. <lb/>
            Alcinous then call'd for wine, and bad <lb n="45"/>
            Pontonous present it to each one, <lb/>
            Until unto the Gods all offer'd had, <lb/>
            That so Ulysses the sooner might be gone. <lb/>
            Pontonous brought wine, and carried it <lb/>
            From man to man, and each man drank his cup, <lb n="50"/>
            Blessing the Gods in order as they sit. <lb/>
            When all had drunk, Ulysses standeth up, <lb/>
            And speaking to queen Arete, he said: <lb/>
            Happy for ever may you be, 0 queen. <lb/>
            I take my leave. Be you for ever joy'd <lb n="55"/>
            In king Alcinous as you have been, <lb/>
            And in your children and your people all. <lb/>
            And when he this had said, away he went. <lb/>
            Alcinous did then a squire call, <lb/>
            Whom with Ulysses to the ship he sent. <lb n="60"/>
            Arete to her women sent. One brought <lb/>
            Fine bread and store of black wine of the best; <lb/>
            Another brought with her a cloak and coat; <lb/>
            Another brought, to lay them in, a chest, <lb/>
            Which by the mariners were quickly stow'd <lb n="65"/>
            Aboard the good ship, with the wine and bread. <lb/>
            And for Ulysses many rugs they strew'd <lb/>
            0' th' deck, astern, with linen at his head. <lb/>
            And then aboard lie went. When he was lain, <lb/>

            Their seats they take, and parted from the strand, <note type="margin"> LID. XIII. <lb/>

            Reclining dash d with oars the liquid plain, <lb/>
            While sleep Ulysses bound had foot and hand. <lb/>
            As when four horses gallop o'er a plain, <lb/>
            The way runs swiftly by the coach's side; <lb/>
            So did the good ship mount upon the main, <lb n="75"/>
            And to the stem the water swiftly glide, <lb/>
            A hawk could hardly with it have kept pace, <lb/>
            A hawk that of all fowl the swiftest flies; <lb/>
            So swiftly ran the ship on th' ocean's face, <lb/>
            And with her breast the rising water slice; <lb n="80"/>
            Bearing a man for wisdom like a God, <lb/>
            That pass'd had fearful billows on the deep, <lb/>
            And many bloody paths of war had trod, <lb/>
            The thought whereof was now removed by sleep. <lb/>
            Above the earth now risen was the star, <lb n="85"/>
            Day's messenger, and brightest of the sky. <lb/>
            The ship was then from Ithaca not far. <lb/>
            A port there is, which from a deity <lb/>
            Is called Phorcys, a sea-deity. <lb/>
            Two jetting rocks defend it from the wind; <lb n="90"/>
            When once within, a ship will safely lie, <lb/>
            . There needs no cord a floating ship to bind. <lb/>
            At the port's head grows a large olive-tree, <lb/>
            And near it an obscure and pleasant cave, <lb/>
            Where the Nereiades delight to be, <lb n="95"/>
            And there they bowls of stone and beakers have; <lb/>
            The bees make honey there. Besides, there be <lb/>
            Long beams of stone, whereon the nymphs do weave <lb/>
            Rich purple garments, wonderful to see, <lb/>
            And fountains which their running never leave. <lb n="100"/>
            Two doors there are, one north, men go that way; <lb/>
            The other to the south more sacred is, <lb/>
            Th' immortals here go in, and none but they; <lb/>
            The Gods have to themselves reserved this. <lb/>
            All this Ulysses' convoy knew before; <lb n="105"/>
            And here the ship arrived, safely lands, <lb/>
            And half her length lay dry upon the shore, <lb/>
            Such was the strength of those Phæacian hands. <lb/>
            The lusty seamen, when they landed were, <lb/>
            First took Ulysses, sleeping as he lay, <lb n="110"/>
            Bedding and all, and to the land him bear, <lb/>
            And lay him from the sea a little way: <lb/>
            Then they unship his goods, gold, vestures, brass, <lb/>
            Gifts given him by the Phæacians; <lb/>
            Which at the foot of the olive-tree they place, <lb n="115"/>
            Out of the way, lest passengers should chance <lb/>
            To steal them while Ulysses was asleep. <lb/>
            When this was done, the convoy stayed not, <lb/>
            But rowed out the ship into the deep. <pb n="430"/>

            Nor Neptune had Ulysses yet forgot, <lb n="120"/>
            But said to Jupiter, complaining then: <lb/>
            What honour from the Gods can I expect, <lb/>
            When the Phæacians, that are but men, <lb/>
            (Although descended from me), me neglect ? <lb/>
            For though Ulysses I destroyed not, <lb n="125"/>
            Because his coming home you had decreed; <lb/>
            Yet that he should be brought home thus, ne'er thought, <lb/>
            Asleep, and painless, and with so much speed, <lb/>
            Enriched with gold, and brass, and vestures store, <lb/>
            As much as had come to his share at Troy. <lb n="130"/>
            This the Phæacians have done, and more, <lb/>
            In this licentiousness they take a joy. <lb/>
            Then answered Jove: Neptune, what's this you say? <lb/>
            The Gods neglect you not. It cannot be, <lb/>
            That are the eldest and of greatest sway <lb n="135"/>
            Of any of them. If man injure thee, <lb/>
            To take revenge enough your own pow'r is. <lb/>
            I will not hinder you, do what you please. <lb/>
            To Jupiter then Neptune answer'd this; <lb/>
            I could, 0 Jove, have been reveng'd with ease, <lb n="140"/>
            But that I fear'd you would offended be. <lb/>
            And now 111 tell you what I mean to do. <lb/>
            As soon as I the ship returning see, <lb/>
            I'll fix it, that they may no more do so; <lb/>
            Besides, their city with a hill 111 hide. <lb n="145"/>
            O but, said Jupiter, were it my case, <lb/>
            When from the city people all espied <lb/>
            The ship hard by, I would a rock there place <lb/>
            In likeness of a ship not far from land, <lb/>
            To make men wonder, and then round about <lb n="150"/>
            The city make a mighty mountain stand. <lb/>
            This said by Jove, the God of Seas went out <lb/>
            To Scheria, where the Phæacians <lb/>
            First planted were. The ship came swiftly on, <lb/>
            And on it Neptune laid his mighty hands. <lb n="155"/>
            And roots it in the sea, turn'd into stone. <lb/>
            The rowers t' one another say, What's this? <lb/>
            Who hath our good ship fixed in the water? <lb/>
            And yet above the water still it is. <lb/>
            Thus said they, but knew nothing of the matter. <lb n="160"/>
            Then spake Alcinous. Performed, said he, <lb/>
            Is what long since I heard my father say, <lb/>
            That Neptune angry was that strangers we, <lb/>
            Whoe'er they were, do to their homes convey, <lb/>
            And threatened had with a great hill to hide <lb n="165"/>
            The city, and destroy the passage-boat. <lb/>
            This by my father then was prophecied, <lb/>
            And now, you see, at last about 'tis brought. <lb/>
            Therefore be rul'd by me. Convoy no more; <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            But let us unto Neptune sacrifice <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses by Pal. <lb/>

            what to do. </note> <lb n="170"/>
            Twelve chosen bullocks, and his grace implore <lb/>
            To set no hill there. So did he advise. <lb/>
            And then to Neptune they their prayers make <lb/>
            Standing at th' altar, king and princes all. <lb/>
            And now Ulysses lying was awake, <lb n="175"/>
            But to his mind the place could not recal; <lb/>
            For Pallas had about him cast a mist, <lb/>
            That at his coming he might not be known; <lb/>
            But she herself instruct him as she list, <lb/>
            Till he the suitors all had overthrown. <lb n="180"/>
            All things seem'd to him other than they were, <lb/>
            Paths, highways, creeks, havens, trees, and rocks; <lb/>
            And rising up he was he knew not where, <lb/>
            And with his open hand his thigh he knocks. <lb/>
            Ay me, said he, whither am I come now? <lb n="185"/>
            To civil, or to wild and lawless men? <lb/>
            Where shall I hide my treasure? Whither go? <lb/>
            Would I were at Phaeacia agen. <lb/>
            To other friends I might have gone from thence, <lb/>
            And t' Ithaca obtained a convoy, <lb n="190"/>
            Here for my treasure I see no defence. <lb/>
            Left here to others they will be a prey. <lb/>
            I see the princes of Phæacia <lb/>
            Are not so just as I take them to be. <lb/>
            They promised to set me at Ithaca, <lb n="195"/>
            But have to some place else transported me. <lb/>
            Jove, that sees all, and punisheth the ill, <lb/>
            Will be revenged also of these men. <lb/>
            But come, my presents number now I will, <lb/>
            The seamen may have ta'en some back agen. <lb n="200"/>
            His garments and his plate then number'd he, <lb/>
            And nothing missing was of all his pelf. <lb/>
            Then walk'd he softly along by the sea, <lb/>
            Lamenting and bewailing of himself. <lb/>
            And then came Pallas to him. She had on <lb n="205"/>
            The body of a shepherd young and tender, <lb/>
            As if she had of some prince been the son; <lb/>
            Lin'd was his coat, the thread was fine and slender, <lb/>
            With dart in hand, and fine shoes on his feet. <lb/>
            Ulysses, who beheld her, was much joy'd, <lb n="210"/>
            And forth himself advanced, her to meet. <lb/>
            And first he to her spake, and thus he said: <lb/>
            Joy to you be, and good-will towards me ; <lb/>
            Save for me these my goods, and save me too. <lb/>
            You are the first I meet here ; at your knee <lb n="215"/>
            I bow myself, as men bow Gods unto. <lb/>
            Tell me, I pray you, true: What land is this ? <lb/>
            What town ? Th' inhabitants what men ? <lb/>
            An isle, or of the continent a piece ? <pb n="432"/>

            To this the Goddess answered agen. <lb n="220"/>
            Simple you are, or very far hence dwell, <lb/>
            To ask what country this is. For 'tis not <lb/>
            A place obscure; for known 'tis very well <lb/>
            Both east and west, though but a little spot, <lb/>
            And rugged ground, not fit for galloping ; <lb n="225"/>
            Yet corn it bears abundantly and wine ; <lb/>
            And is well watered both with dew and spring, <lb/>
            And nourisheth great herds of goats and kine. <lb/>
            Of wood of ev'ry sort there is good store. <lb/>
            Though from Achaea far men say is Troy, <lb n="230"/>
            Yet Ithaca is talk'd of on that shore. <lb/>
            These words unto Ulysses were great joy. <lb/>
            And to the Goddess then he answered: <lb/>
            (Falsely; on fables keeping still his hold, <lb/>
            As one that always plots hath in his head): <lb n="235"/>
            I have, said he, of Ithaca been told, <lb/>
            Far hence in Crete, and now am thither come <lb/>
            With these my goods; but leaving to my child <lb/>
            About as much as I brought out from home; <lb/>
            And here I am alone, a man exil'd. <lb n="240"/>
            For of Idomeneus I kill'd the son, <lb/>
            Orsilochus, for swiftness of his feet <lb/>
            So excellent, there was not any one <lb/>
            That could out-run him in the isle of Crete. <lb/>
            Because I had refused a command <lb n="245"/>
            Under his father at the siege of Troy, <lb/>
            And would command ray own, he took in hand <lb/>
            To have depriv'd me of my share o' th' prey, <lb/>
            Which to my dangers and my deeds was due. <lb/>
            For which, by night, with one companion, <lb n="250"/>
            Near the highway, I with my spear him slew, <lb/>
            And in the dark escaped when I had done. <lb/>
            And to Phœnicia by sea I went; <lb/>
            And hired with a good part of my prey <lb/>
            To Pylus or to Elis to be sent. <lb n="255"/>
            But adverse winds forc'd us another way. <lb/>
            And wandering, there arrived in the night. <lb/>
            And straight into this port we brought the bark, <lb/>
            Ne'er thought of food, though very well we might, <lb/>
            But went ashore, and lay down in the dark, <lb n="260"/>
            And there I slept. The mariners meanwhile <lb/>
            Take out my goods and lay them on the shore, <lb/>
            And back unto Sidonia they sail, <lb/>
            And after that I never saw them more. <lb/>
            At this the goddess smil'd, and strok'd his head, <lb n="265"/>
            And in a woman's shape before him stood, <lb/>
            Of stature tall and like to one well bred. <lb/>
            The craft that catches you had need be good. <lb/>
            You cannot, though at home, your wiles forego, <lb/>

            So close they stick to you from top to toe. <lb/>
            But now no more of that; for 'tis agreed, <lb/>
            'Mongst mortals you, amongst immortals I, <lb/>
            For counsel and invention excel. <lb/>
            Did you not know me, that perpetually <lb n="275"/>

            Then said Ulysses, Difficult it is <lb/>
            For any mortal man, though very wise, <lb/>
            To know a God, that can their form dismiss, <lb/>
            And, when they will, put on a new disguise. <lb/>
            When th' Argive army was besieging Troy, <lb n="285"/>
            Goddess, I know how gracious you were then; <lb/>
            But after (the town sack'd) we came away, <lb/>
            And scatter'd had the Gods our ships and men, <lb/>
            And I was wand'ring on the ocean wide, <lb/>
            I never saw you, never had your aid, <lb n="290"/>
            Save at Phæacia you were pleased to guide <lb/>
            Me to the town, and hasten me dismayed. <lb/>
            But I beseech you (for still do I doubt <lb/>
            This is not Ithaca that I am at, <lb/>
            But some place else, and that you go about <lb n="295"/>
            With comforts feign'd my sorrows to abate) <lb/>
            Tell me if this my country be indeed ? <lb/>
            Pallas said then, Suspicious still you are; <lb/>
            I cannot, therefore, leave you in your need, <lb/>
            Since wise you be, and willing to beware. <lb n="300"/>
            Another man that had been long away, <lb/>
            Had straight gone home to see his wife and son; <lb/>
            But that for you is not the safest way, <lb/>
            Nor had it yet been opportunely done. <lb/>
            Know how she'll take it first. She keeps within, <lb n="305"/>
            And spends in weeping both the night and day. <lb/>
            I know full well the Fates his coming spin, <lb/>
            But that his mates shall first be cast away. <lb/>
            But with my uncle Neptune had no mind <lb/>
            To be at odds, that in such choler is, <lb n="310"/>
            For making of his son the Cyclops blind. <lb/>
            But come, I'll shew you Ithaca. First, this <lb/>
            The port of Phorcys is ; this th' olive-tree, <lb/>
            There near it is the gloomy cavern, where <lb/>
            The nymphs Naiades invoked be, <lb n="315"/>
            And by you in that cave much worshipp'd were. <lb/>
            The hill so cloth'd with wood is Neriton. <lb/>
            This said, the mist dissolves, and then Ulysses <lb/>
            His native country joyful looks upon, <note type="footnote"> VOL. x. </note> <note type="footnote"> F F </note> <pb n="434"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XIII. </note><note type="margin"> Pallas helps to <lb/>

            And falling on his knees, the soil he kisses. <lb n="320"/>
            And then to the Naiades he pray'd, <lb/>
            Hail ! Daughters of high Jove, Naiades, <lb/>
            Ne'er to have seen you more I was afraid; <lb/>
            But oft we shall again, if Pallas please <lb/>
            To give me life, and prosper my dear son, <lb n="325"/>
            Your altar fill with gifts as heretofore. <lb/>
            The Goddess Pallas, when his pray'r was done, <lb/>
            Answer'd, Let that thought trouble you no more. <lb/>
            But come, let's now see how your goods to save, <lb/>
            Now presently. 'Twere well that they were laid <lb n="330"/>
            Within some rock at bottom of the cave. <lb/>
            Then went she in, and caves in cave survey'd. <lb/>
            Ulysses brought into the grot his store, <lb/>
            Garments, and heavy brass, and golden plate ; <lb/>
            Which Pallas plac'd, and laid a rock o' th' door, <lb n="335"/>
            And then in counsel both together sate <lb/>
            The suitors to destroy. Pallas first spake. <lb/>
            Ulysses, said she, think on how you may <lb/>
            Your just revenge of the proud suitors take, <lb/>
            That use your house and substance as their prey; <lb n="340"/>
            That marry would your wife by force. But she <lb/>
            Still keeps them off with hopes and promises, <lb/>
            Expecting your return continually, <lb/>
            But than of marriage thinks of nothing less. <lb/>
            Oh ! said Ulysses, but for your advice, <lb n="345"/>
            I died had as Agamemnon did. <lb/>
            But now, 0 Pallas, find out some device, <lb/>
            How of the suitors best I may be rid, <lb/>
            And by me stand, inspiring courage stout, <lb/>
            As when we pull'd Troy's head-gear off her head. <lb n="350"/>
            For then to master them I should not doubt, <lb/>
            Three hundred though they were. Then answered <lb/>
            The Goddess Pallas : By you I will stand ; <lb/>
            You cannot fight, but I shall of it know, <lb/>
            And bring unto you such a lucky hand, <lb n="355"/>
            That with their blood and brains the ground shall flow. <lb/>
            Come, first I'll make you to men pass unknown: <lb/>
            I'll shrink your skin, that's now so fair and fresh, <lb/>
            And from your head take off that hair so brown, <lb/>
            And cover will with such array your flesh, <lb n="360"/>
            As men shall hate the sight of; then your eyes <lb/>
            I'll shrivel up, that were so full and bright, <lb/>
            That in this habit th' woo'rs may you despise, <lb/>
            Nor your wife know you standing in her sight. <lb/>
            Then go you to the master of your swine, <lb n="365"/>
            That loves you, and your son, and your consort; <lb/>
            And to direct you to him take this sign : <lb/>
            He's at Crow-rock, thither the swine resort, <lb/>
            And t' Arethusa's well; for why, the oaken <lb/>

            Stay there till to him you your mind have spoken, <lb/>
            And well inform'd yourself of your estate. <lb/>
            To Lacedæmon I the while will go, <lb/>
            To call your son Telemachus away, <lb/>

            What Menelaus there of you could say. <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses, Goddess, since you could <lb/>
            Have told him all yourself, why did you not ? <lb/>
            Meant you that also he be wand'ring should, <lb/>
            While other men stay feeding on his lot ? <lb n="380"/>
            Trouble not you yourself with him, said she : <lb/>
            I sent him, and went with him with intent <lb/>
            To show him to the world abroad. And he <lb/>
            At Sparta treated is to his content. <lb/>
            'Tis true, the suitors with a ship are gone <lb n="385"/>
            To wait for, and to kill him by the way; <lb/>
            But I believe, before that that be done, <lb/>
            Some will lie low that now your goods destroy. <lb/>
            And as she spake, she strok'd him with her wand, <lb/>
            And rivel'd seem'd his skin (which was before <lb n="390"/>
            So sleek and fair) as if it had been tann'd; <lb/>
            And gray his hair, rivel'd his eyes all o'er. <lb/>
            And then she gave him an ill-favoured rag, <lb/>
            Torn, foul, and smutted filthily with soot, <lb/>
            And over that the pill'd skin of a stag, <lb n="395"/>
            And satchel full of holes then added to 't <lb/>
            With twisted-string. And up their counsel brake. <lb/>
            The Goddess Pallas then to Sparta past, <lb/>
            To bid Telemachus his leave to take <lb/>

            Of his good lord, Ulysses, that was gone, <lb n="10"/>
            With stone that hewn was from the rocky mine, <lb/>
            Besides those of Laertes and his son; <lb/>
            And with a quickset-hedge enclosed round, <lb/>
            And pales of heart of oak; the hedge without <lb/>
            Set close together, and stuck deep i' th' ground. <lb n="15"/>
            And thus the house was fenced round about; <lb/>
            Within the court twelve lodgings were for swine, <lb/>
            And ev'ry one of them held five times ten ; <lb/>
            And there the female and the teeming lyen. <lb/>
            The males lay out, but much diminisht then; <lb n="20"/>
            For the proud suitors eaten had the rest, <lb/>
            Eumseus having sent in every day <lb/>
            One of the fattest of the herd and best, <lb/>
            And yet three hundred and threescore were they. <lb/>
            Near to the swine, four dogs were ever lying, <lb n="25"/>
            Like to wild beasts, and by Eumaeus fed. <lb/>
            Himself was leather to his foot applying, <lb/>
            Made of a good cow-hide well coloured; <lb/>
            Three dogs attending were the herd; the fourth <lb/>
            Convoying was a swine unto the woo'rs; <lb n="30"/>
            The other three ran fiercely bawling forth, <lb/>
            When they Ulysses saw come near the doors; <lb/>
            Ulysses wisely then his staff lets fall, <lb/>
            And presently sits down upon the ground; <lb/>
            But had Eumæus not come in withal, <lb n="35"/>
            An unbeseeming fortune he had found; <lb/>
            Who letting fall the leather for his shoe, <lb/>
            Running and rating came in to his aid: <lb/>
            And snatch'd-up stones abundance at them threw, <lb/>
            And then he to Ulysses spake, and said, <lb n="40"/>
            Old man, yourself almost to death you brought, <lb/>
            By those accursed dogs, and me to shame; <lb/>
            As if my sorrow great enough were not, <lb/>
            But that there must be added to it blame. <lb/>
            While sitting here, I for my master weep, <lb n="45"/>
            And feed his swine for other men to eat; <lb/>
            He somewhere swallow'd up is in the deep, <lb/>
            Or wanders up and down for want of meat. <lb/>
            But come, old man, into the lodge let's go, <lb/>
            That when of meat and wine you have your fill, <lb n="50"/>
            You may then tell me whence you are, and who, <lb/>
            And how much you have suffered of ill. <lb/>
            This said, he led him in and made him sit, <lb/>
            And under him he store of rushes laid; <lb/>
            O'er that a goatskin, thick with hair was it, <lb n="55"/>
            Of which a speckled wild goat had been flay'd. <lb/>
            Ulysses, glad to see the man so kind <lb/>
            And very hearty, answered and said, <lb/>
            May all your pray'rs like entertainment find <lb/>

            Stranger, then said Eumæus, it was never <lb/>
            My custom any stranger to neglect; <lb/>
            The poor and stranger are in God's hand ever. <lb/>
            Few are my gifts, and but of small effect, <lb/>
            For servants of young masters stand in fear; <lb n="65"/>
            And by the Gods my old one fast is bound <lb/>
            From coming home. 'Twas he that gave me here <lb/>
            A house and fair possession of ground, <lb/>
            As much as fits a master to his swain, <lb/>
            And help'd me too contentedly to wive, <lb n="70"/>
            Which taketh off a great part of my pain; <lb/>
            Also the Gods have made my labour thrive. <lb/>
            How happy had I been if he had stayed ! <lb/>
            Accursed be that Helen and her kin; <lb/>
            For, for Atrides' sake he anchors weigh'd, <lb n="75"/>
            Himself much misery engaging in. <lb/>
            Having thus said, he girded on his coat, <lb/>
            And fetch'd in two young pigs; not long he staid, <lb/>
            But kill'd, singed, jointed, roasted, piping hot <lb/>
            Before Ulysses with the spits be laid, <lb n="80"/>
            Then strews them over with the flour of wheat, <lb/>
            And in an ivy bowl he tempers wine, <lb/>
            And sitting o'er against him bids him eat. <lb/>
            Eat, says he, servant's food, the lesser swine; <lb/>
            The great ones are the pamper'd suitors' fare; <lb n="85"/>
            The blessed Gods hate evil works, and love <lb/>
            Them that do well; but these men little care <lb/>
            For mercy or for vengeance from above; <lb/>
            Yet enemies and lawless men, when they <lb/>
            Disbark upon another's land, and there <lb n="90"/>
            With prey their ship have laden, come away, <lb/>
            And of revenge stand always in great fear. <lb/>
            But these men know not, nor by voice divine <lb/>
            Assured are, Ulysses now is dead; <lb/>
            Yet neither will go hence, nor have design <lb n="95"/>
            To seek by lawful ways his wife to wed; <lb/>
            But stay and waste his substance without hoe. <lb/>
            For not a day went o'er their heads that they <lb/>
            Did sacrifice one only beast or two; <lb/>
            And wine abundance drink and cast away. <lb n="100"/>
            Ulysses his estate and wealth was such, <lb/>
            In Greece nor Argos, no prince in Epire, <lb/>
            Nor twenty had in Ithaca so much; <lb/>
            And if to have it reckon'd you desire, <lb/>
            Upon the Continent twelve herds of kine, <lb n="105"/>
            Twelve herds of goats, as many flocks of sheep, <lb/>
            As many swine-houses replete with swine, <lb/>
            Which herdsmen of the country there did keep; <lb/>
            And here, upon the island's farthest end <pb n="438"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XIV. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' enter­ <lb/>
            tainment by <lb/>

            There be eleven herds of goats; of these <lb n="110"/>
            The goat-keeper does ev'ry day one send, <lb/>
            The best of all, the suitors proud to please; <lb/>
            And daily I the best of all my swine. <lb/>
            Thus said he: but Ulysses silent sate, <lb/>
            Eating his meat, and drinking of his wine, <lb n="115"/>
            And plotting in his head the suitors' fate. <lb/>
            When he had supp'd, Eumæus to the brim <lb/>
            Fill'd up his cup with wine; Ulysses then, <lb/>
            Glad that Eumæus so well treated him, <lb/>
            Drank, and the cup deliv'ring back again, <lb n="120"/>
            Friend, says he, that so rich and valiant man, <lb/>
            Your master, that was for Atrides lost, <lb/>
            If I have seen him, do you think you can <lb/>
            Know him ? God knows I have seen many a coast. <lb/>
            Then answer'd he: There is no stranger able <lb n="125"/>
            Nor with his wife nor son to get belief; <lb/>
            The news they tell both take but for a fable, <lb/>
            Invented by their want to get relief; <lb/>
            Many poor men come to Penelope, <lb/>
            And make her weep in vain with tales untrue: <lb n="130"/>
            And where you think you shall rewarded be <lb/>
            With coat or other garment, so can you. <lb/>
            But he's devoured by beasts or fowls at land; <lb/>
            Or fish at sea have on his body fed; <lb/>
            And on the shore his bones lie clad in sand. <lb n="135"/>
            But howsoe'er it be, the man is dead; <lb/>
            And to his friends has sorrow left behind, <lb/>
            But to me chiefly, who, go where I please, <lb/>
            Shall never such another master find, <lb/>
            Nor ever be again at so much ease; <lb n="140"/>
            No, though I should unto my country go, <lb/>
            And parents, that have got and nourished me; <lb/>
            To see them though I wish, I long not so <lb/>
            As I Ulysses long again to see; <lb/>
            Whom, though now absent, I call by his name, <lb n="145"/>
            He was so kind, and took such care of me, <lb/>
            That of such small respect I feel some shame; <lb/>
            A second father he should called be. <lb/>
            Friend, said Ulysses, since so hard it is <lb/>
            To make you hope he will so soon be here, <lb n="150"/>
            Know that I have not rashly told you this, <lb/>
            What I have spoken I will also swear; <lb/>
            If true, with coat and vest my news requite; <lb/>
            If not, then not, although ill rayed am I: <lb/>
            Of him as of hell-gate I hate the sight <lb n="155"/>
            That can by want be made to tell a lie. <lb/>
            Know Jove, the chief of Gods, and then the host <lb/>
            That hath provided for us this good cheer, <lb/>
            And in Ulysses' house doth rule the roast, <lb/>

            That have dishonoured his wife and son. <lb/>
            Then said Eumæus, leave this argument; <lb/>
            For your good news nothing will be to pay, <lb n="165"/>
            Nor will Ulysses ever come again; <lb/>
            Drink wine, and no more on this subject say, <lb/>
            I cannot think upon him without pain: <lb/>
            And swear no more; true be it all you say. <lb/>
            To me, Laertes, and Penelope, <lb n="170"/>
            And to Telemachus 'twill be great joy, <lb/>
            For whom my sorrows much augmented be. <lb/>
            He sprang up like a branch to man's estate; <lb/>
            I thought he would in prowess prove no less <lb/>
            Than's father was, whom he did imitate <lb n="175"/>
            In wit and figure and in comeliness: <lb/>
            But now the Gods bereav'd him have of wit, <lb/>
            He's gone to Pyle, to hear what men there say <lb/>
            About his father, whilst the suitors sit <lb/>
            Waiting at sea to kill him by the way. <lb n="180"/>
            But him let's leave a while with pow'rs above, <lb/>
            Whether to let him die, or bring him back, <lb/>
            Waiting upon the pleasure of high Jove. <lb/>
            And now of your own woes untie the sack, <lb/>
            That I may know them: tell me truly now <lb n="185"/>
            Your own, your father's, and your country's name; <lb/>
            And further I desire you, let me know <lb/>
            Whence are the mariners that with you came <lb/>
            Unto this town ? and tell me this likewise, <lb/>
            Where rideth the good ship that brought you to't ? <lb n="190"/>
            For verily I can no way devise <lb/>
            How you should come on horseback or on foot. <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses, Were we here alone, <lb/>
            And meat and drink for so long us attend, <lb/>
            And all the rest about their work were gone, <lb n="195"/>
            The year would sooner than my story end. <lb/>
            Of Crete I am, and rich my father was, <lb/>
            And many children more he had, but they <lb/>
            Begotten were according to the laws; <lb/>
            But of a concubine the son was I. <lb n="200"/>
            My father was Castor Hylacides, <lb/>
            That was for wealth in Crete much honoured, <lb/>
            And for his children, but lov'd me no less <lb/>
            Than those he had begot in lawful bed. <lb/>
            When he was dead and gone, my brothers proud <lb n="205"/>
            Divide his state amongst themselves by lot, <lb/>
            And little of it they to me allow'd: <lb/>
            But for all that a good rich wife I got; <lb/>
            My virtue won her; I no shun-field was, <pb n="440"/>

            Nor from my stock degenerate she saw; <lb n="210"/>
            (Though from me now my strength be gone, alas! <lb/>
            But you I think can know wheat by the straw ; <lb/>
            For now with hardship I am much decayed. <lb/>
            Mars gave me courage, and Athena skill <lb/>
            To beat up quarters, and by ambush laid <lb n="215"/>
            With stratagems my enemies to kill: <lb/>
            Of being slain I never had a thought, <lb/>
            But foremost still I leap'd out with my spear; <lb/>
            And of the foes to death I still one brought, <lb/>
            Unless his feet than my feet swifter were. <lb n="220"/>
            And such I was in war. But husbandry, <lb/>
            And keeping home, though that bred children store, <lb/>
            I car'd not for. But ships I lov'd to see, <lb/>
            And war, darts, bows, and shafts, I loved more; <lb/>
            Yet horrible they be to other wights; <lb n="225"/>
            For, for such things the Gods have temper'd me. <lb/>
            Many things are there wherein one delights, <lb/>
            Which to another man unpleasant be. <lb/>
            Before the Greeks went to the siege of Troy, <lb/>
            Nine times had I commanded on the seas, <lb n="230"/>
            And always our success was good that way, <lb/>
            And of the prey I chose what did me please <lb/>
            Beside my share. And wealth came in apace. <lb/>
            Wise I was thought, and honour'd much in Crete. <lb/>
            And when Jove had decreed Troy to deface, <lb n="235"/>
            Idomeneus and I went with the fleet, <lb/>
            Or else we must our credit quite have lost. <lb/>
            Nine years we fought, the tenth we took the town. <lb/>
            And setting up our sails we left the coast, <lb/>
            And by the Gods were tossed up and down. <lb n="240"/>
            But Jove determined me more trouble yet: <lb/>
            For needs I would to Egypt go and trade. <lb/>
            A month I stayed at home, then forth I set <lb/>
            With nine good ships, and an ill voyage made. <lb/>
            For when six days I feasted had my crew, <lb n="245"/>
            And to the Gods devoutly offer'd part; <lb/>
            A good strong wind from the north heaven blew, <lb/>
            And from the coast of Crete we then depart; <lb/>
            Smoothly we sail'd, safe our arrival was, <lb/>
            Nor man nor ship had any harm at all; <lb n="250"/>
            From shore to shore we did in five days pass, <lb/>
            And in the Nile we let our anchors fall. <lb/>
            Then I my fellows bad aboard to stay, <lb/>
            And guard the ships, and some to places high <lb/>
            I sent to watch; but mov'd by lucre, they <lb n="255"/>
            On plunder and on rapine had their eye; <lb/>
            The fields they waste, and kill the men, and make <lb/>
            Women and children captives. Then the cry <lb/>
            Arriving at the city, arms they take, <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            And next day early to the field they hie; <note type="margin"> LID. XIV. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' enter­ <lb/>

            With horse and foot then thundered the field. <lb/>
            Their armour light'ned. My men frighted were: <lb/>
            Some taken and made slaves; some flying kill'd ; <lb/>
            And all the rest ran scattered here and there. <lb/>
            Then I (though 't had been better there t' have died, <lb n="265"/>
            So many woes have since befallen me) <lb/>
            Pull'd off my helmet, laid my spear aside, <lb/>
            And buckler too, and kneel'd at the king's knee. <lb/>
            He rescued me, and home with him me brought, <lb/>
            Sitting by him that did his chariot drive: <lb n="270"/>
            Though in their heat many to kill me sought, <lb/>
            Yet the king brought me to the town alive. <lb/>
            Seven years I there remained and riches got, <lb/>
            For every man almost me somewhat gave. <lb/>
            Then thither came a merchant, that had not <lb n="275"/>
            His fellow in all Egypt for a knave. <lb/>
            His house and riches in Phoenicia were, <lb/>
            And he with lies entic'd me to his home. <lb/>
            With him I went: and there I stay'd a year; <lb/>
            And when the months and days about were come, <lb n="280"/>
            He set me in a ship for Libya; <lb/>
            And there together with our goods we sate, <lb/>
            He cracking of the profit he foresaw, <lb/>
            And I suspecting, though it were too late. <lb/>
            With him I went. And when the ship was forth, <lb n="285"/>
            We steer'd our course without the isle of Crete; <lb/>
            For by good luck we had a wind full north, <lb/>
            But Jove determine! had we should not see't: <lb/>
            For when the island we had left behind, <lb/>
            And nothing else appeared but sea and sky, <lb n="290"/>
            Jove fetched the clouds together with a wind, <lb/>
            Just o'er the ship, and dark 'twas presently; <lb/>
            And therewithal into the ship he threw <lb/>
            His thunderbolt, which whirl'd it round about: <lb/>
            It smelt of brimstone rank. And all the crew <lb n="295"/>
            Into the sea it suddenly cast out; <lb/>
            And they like gulls from wave to wave were toss'd. <lb/>
            But Jove, to save me, put into my hand <lb/>
            The ship's tall mast, which with my arms I cross'd, <lb/>
            And after nine days came at last to land. <lb n="300"/>
            And in Thesprotia was cast on land; <lb/>
            And the king's son, who chanc'd that way to pass, <lb/>
            Lifted me up as I lay on the sand; <lb/>
            And by king Phædon well receiv'd I was. <lb/>
            He cloth'd me with good garments, coat and vest. <lb n="305"/>
            I ask'd him of Ulysses what he knew? <lb/>
            As he went home, said he, he was my guest, <lb/>
            And what he then had gotten did me shew; <lb/>
            Of brass, and iron, and gold, there was so much, <pb n="442"/>

            As might ten ages feed a man alone, <lb n="310"/>
            The treasure that he showed me there was such. <lb/>
            But he, he said, was to Dodona gone, <lb/>
            There at the holy oak to be advis'd <lb/>
            (Since he from Ithaca so long has been), <lb/>
            Whether 'twere better to go home disguis'd, <lb n="315"/>
            Or so as to be known when he is seen. <lb/>
            The king to me in holy form did swear, <lb/>
            That for the conduct of Ulysses home, <lb/>
            Both ship and mariners then ready were. <lb/>
            But when I went from thence he was not come. <lb n="320"/>
            A ship of that place in the harbour lay <lb/>
            Ready to part. The king bad land me there. <lb/>
            But they resolv'd were of another way; <lb/>
            Which made me yet more misery to bear. <lb/>
            When of that land they were got out of sight, <lb n="325"/>
            To sell me for a slave they did agree; <lb/>
            My coat and vest they take from me there right, <lb/>
            And gave me the torn coat and rags you see. <lb/>
            Late in the ev'ning they were at the land <lb/>
            Of Ithaca, and bound me fast i' th' ship. <lb n="330"/>
            But they to sup thought fit upon the sand, <lb/>
            And leaving me, out of the bark they skip; <lb/>
            But from my bonds some God sure set me free. <lb/>
            Then down I went and to the sea applied <lb/>
            My breast, and round the ship swam speedily, <lb n="335"/>
            And in a great thick wood myself I hide. <lb/>
            Sorry they were, and put to sea again, <lb/>
            To stay and seek me they lost labour thought. <lb/>
            Thus by Jove's favour I alive remain, <lb/>
            And to the house of a good friend am brought. <lb n="340"/>
            Then said Eumaeus : I confess the story, <lb/>
            Poor man, of this your wand'ring and your pain, <lb/>
            Has had the pow'r to make me very sorry. <lb/>
            But of Ulysses what you say is vain. <lb/>
            I not believe a word. What needed you, <lb n="345"/>
            So wise a man as you appear to me, <lb/>
            In vain to tell me anything not true; <lb/>
            When I myself am sure 'twill never be ? <lb/>
            For all the Gods have shown themselves his foes, <lb/>
            That neither suffer'd him to fall at Troy, <lb n="350"/>
            Nor, the war done, his best friends to compose <lb/>
            His body for the grave. For either way <lb/>
            He honourably buried had been <lb/>
            To th' honour of his son. But he is dead, <lb/>
            Unspoken of, devour'd by harpies keen ; <lb n="355"/>
            And I despis'd sit here to see swine fed; <lb/>
            And never to the city come, but when <lb/>
            Some news is brought unto Penelope, <lb/>
            And she send one to call me. I come then, <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            And many listening to the news I see. <note type="margin"> LIB. XIV. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' enter­ <lb/>

            Some griev'd, and wishing for his coming home; <lb/>
            Some that seek nothing but shot-free to feed, <lb/>
            And these men wish that he may never come. <lb/>
            But I of what they say take little heed; <lb/>
            Especially, since an Ætolian, <lb n="365"/>
            As he from place to place for murder fled, <lb/>
            Came to my house, and I relieved the man, <lb/>
            And after found that I was cozened. <lb/>
            He said he saw him with Idomeneus, <lb/>
            In Crete, and that for certain he would come, <lb n="370"/>
            (His fleet much hurt repaired) to his house, <lb/>
            Rich, at the next spring, or the next autumn. <lb/>
            Therefore, old man, since you are come to me, <lb/>
            Think not your story anything avails, <lb/>
            Nor that false hopes provoke my charity; <lb n="375"/>
            My bounty looks on want and not on tales. <lb/>
            Pity, and fear of Jove, my favours guide. <lb/>
            Ulysses to this answers him, and saith, <lb/>
            Since you trust not my word, nor oath beside, <lb/>
            And in your breast resideth little faith, <lb n="380"/>
            Let's make a bargain. If Ulysses come, <lb/>
            Then a good coat and vest shall be my due, <lb/>
            And a safe conduct to Dulichium. <lb/>
            If not, and that I told you prove untrue, <lb/>
            Then make your servants throw me from a cliff, <lb n="385"/>
            High and upright, that others may beware <lb/>
            To cozen men into a false belief <lb/>
            Of things they know not, but uncertain are. <lb/>
            Then said Eumæus : Yes, 'twere a fine deed, <lb/>
            And noble, t' entertain a man with love, <lb n="390"/>
            And with good cheer relieve him in his need, <lb/>
            Then kill him, and beg pardon then of Jove. <lb/>
            But now I wish the swine from field were come, <lb/>
            For time it is of supper to advise. <lb/>
            And while they talk, the swains the swine bring home, <lb n="395"/>
            And with great noise they pent are in the sties. <lb/>
            Then did Eummæus to his servants call, <lb/>
            From out the herd to choose one of the best <lb/>
            His far-come friend to entertain withal, <lb/>
            And mend their own fare also with the rest. <lb n="400"/>
            'Tis long since others the work to us leave <lb/>
            To feed the swine they eat. Having said that, <lb/>
            Out went he, for the altar wood to cleave ; <lb/>
            And they brought in a five-year-old pig fat, <lb/>
            And laid it on the hearth. Eumæus there, <lb n="405"/>
            Rememb'ring well the Gods, for he was wise, <lb/>
            First from the forehead clippeth off the hair, <lb/>
            And in the fire the same did sacrifice. <lb/>
            Then did he all the Gods above invoke, <pb n="444"/>

            That soon and safe Ulysses might arrive; <lb n="410"/>
            Next that, he takes a piece of the cleft oak, <lb/>
            And at a stroke did him of life deprive. <lb/>
            Then others take the work into their hands, <lb/>
            And with keen steel they quickly cut his throat. <lb/>
            That being done, with many flaming brands <lb n="415"/>
            They singe from head to tail his hairy coat, <lb/>
            And lay him open. Then Eumæus came, <lb/>
            And folded up the fleshy thighs in fat. <lb/>
            And then into the fire he threw the same. <lb/>
            The rest they cut in lesser parts ; and that <lb n="420"/>
            They roast on spits ; and being roasted well <lb/>
            And taken up, on chopping-boards they put it. <lb/>
            Eumæus then, who thereat did excel, <lb/>
            As he thought fit, did into messes cut it. <lb/>
            But one mess for the nymphs and Mercury <lb n="425"/>
            He set aside ; and over that he pray'd; <lb/>
            The rest he set to each one severally. <lb/>
            But to Ulysses the whole chine was laid. <lb/>
            Jove, said Ulysses, be to you as kind <lb/>
            As you to me, and grant all your request. <lb n="430"/>
            Friend, said Eumæus, now your supper mind, <lb/>
            Such as it is. Gods give what they think best. <lb/>
            Then to the Gods he offer'd the first cut, <lb/>
            And fill'd a bowl, and offer'd part of that. <lb/>
            The bowl then in Ulysses* hand he put; <lb n="435"/>
            Ulysses it receiv'd, and down he sat. <lb/>
            Mesaulius then sets before him bread, <lb/>
            Which thither brought from Taphos was to sell, <lb/>
            And had been by Eumaeus purchased. <lb/>
            Then heartily unto their meat they fell; <lb n="440"/>
            And when to eat they had no more delight, <lb/>
            Mesaulius took off the bread ; and all <lb/>
            Prepared were for sleep. But cold the night <lb/>
            And moonless was ; besides, much rain did falL <lb/>
            Ulysses to the company then spake, <lb n="445"/>
            Tempting Eumæus ; and to get a cloak <lb/>
            From him, or from some other for his sake. <lb/>
            Hear me, Eumæus, says he, and you folk, <lb/>
            I have a tale to tell. This foolish wine <lb/>
            To laugh and dance is able to provoke <lb n="450"/>
            Grave men sometimes that have no such design, <lb/>
            And to speak that which better were unspoke. <lb/>
            But out it shall, since I so much have said. <lb/>
            Oh ! that I were as young and strong as when <lb/>
            Before the town of Troy the watch we laid, <lb n="455"/>
            And lodged were amongst the reeds i' th' fen, <lb/>
            By Menelaus and Ulysses led, <lb/>
            And me the third ; the wind at north all night, <lb/>
            We lying with our bucklers covered. <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            With rain congeal'd, our armour all was white. <note type="margin"> LID. XIV. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses' enter. <lb/>

            And they slept well wrapp d up in cloak and coat, <lb/>
            Safe in their bucklers from the freezing wind; <lb/>
            But like a fool my cloak I had forgot, <lb/>
            I did not think I should such weather find. <lb/>
            And when a third part of the night was gone, <lb n="465"/>
            I nudg'd Ulysses, who did next me lie; <lb/>
            He felt me, and to him I made my moan: <lb/>
            Noble Ulysses, I am like to die, <lb/>
            The weather kills me, I have but a coat; <lb/>
            My cloak some demon made me leave behind, <lb n="470"/>
            And of such cold quite took away the thought; <lb/>
            I cannot tell what remedy to find. <lb/>
            No sooner said, but remedy he found, <lb/>
            For able was he both to shift and fight, <lb/>
            And said unto me, in a whisp'ring sound, <lb n="475"/>
            Peace, lest we heard be by some other wight. <lb/>
            And then with head on elbow, Friend, said he, <lb/>
            I dreamt we from the ships too far lie here. <lb/>
            Let some to Agamemnon go and see, <lb/>
            If he would have us rise and come more near. <lb n="480"/>
            Then up rose Thoas, son of Andræmon, <lb/>
            And down he laid his cloak, the which I kept, <lb/>
            And swiftly did to Agamemnon run; <lb/>
            I' th' cloak I wrapp'd myself and soundly slept. <lb/>
            Were I as young and strong as I was then, <lb n="485"/>
            Some one a cloak would lend me for respect, <lb/>
            Or else for kindness, 'mongst so many men; <lb/>
            But now my rags are cause they me neglect. <lb/>
            Old man, then said Eumæus, you have told <lb/>
            Your story well. Each word to purpose is. <lb n="490"/>
            To-morrow shake your rags against the cold, <lb/>
            Of what is needful now you shall not miss; <lb/>
            Of cloak or coat there's none of these has shift. <lb/>
            But when Telemachus from Pyle comes back, <lb/>
            From him you will have all you need, of gift; <lb n="495"/>
            And then you neither cloak nor coat will lack, <lb/>
            And be conveyed to what place you desire. <lb/>
            With that he rose, and woolly skins of sheep, <lb/>
            And shaggy goat-skins near laid to the fire; <lb/>
            And there Ulysses laid him down to sleep. <lb n="500"/>
            And over him a cloak Eumaeus laid, <lb/>
            Both thick and soft it was, which he had kept, <lb/>
            And with it in sharp cold himself arrayed; <lb/>
            And thus Ulysses warmly cover'd slept. <lb/>
            By him the young men lay. But to the sties <lb n="505"/>
            Eumæus went; for fit he thought it not <lb/>
            To lie far from his swine, and out he hies. <lb/>
            Meanwhile Ulysses of his kindness thought. <lb/>

            Who, though he keep your swine, is much your friend. <lb n="40"/>
            Then Pallas mounted to the sky, and he <lb/>
            Pisistratus awakens with his foot. <lb/>
            'Tis time, said he, that on our way were we; <lb/>
            Let's to the coach, and set the horses to't. <lb/>
            Then said Pisistratus: Too dark 'tis yet <lb n="45"/>
            To travel with a coach. Let's therefore stay; <lb/>
            'Twill soon be morning. Let's our presents get, <lb/>
            And by Atrides' self be sent away; <lb/>
            For guests use always to remember those <lb/>
            By whom they have been entertain'd with love. <lb n="50"/>
            This said, the morning by and by arose, <lb/>
            And Menelaus toward them did move. <lb/>
            Telemachus then puts on hastily <lb/>
            His coat and cloak to meet him on his way; <lb/>
            And when they were to one another nigh, <lb n="55"/>
            Telemachus first spake, and thus did say: <lb/>
            0 king, Atrides Menelaus, now, <lb/>
            Even now, dismiss me, let me go my way. <lb/>
            Then said Atrides: E'en now you shall go; <lb/>
            I purpose not to make you longer stay; <lb n="60"/>
            For I conceive 'tis not a good man's part, <lb/>
            To make too much or little of his guest, <lb/>
            To hold him when he gladly would depart, <lb/>
            Or press him to begone e'er he thinks best. <lb/>
            In hospitality this rule is true: <lb n="65"/>
            Love him that stays, help forth the going guest. <lb/>
            Stay then and take my gift along with you, <lb/>
            And your breakfast of what we have the best. <lb/>
            For he that will a great day's journey make, <lb/>
            Will find both joy and profit in his meat. <lb n="70"/>
            And if to visit Greece you pleasure take, <lb/>
            I'll with you go, and with you I'll retreat; <lb/>
            And to the Argive cities be your guide, <lb/>
            And be presented by each princely man, <lb/>
            With whomsoever we at night abide, <lb n="75"/>
            Two mules, a gold cup, a brave pot or pan. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus: I needs must go, <lb/>
            (My father seeking lest myself I lose), <lb/>
            I have left none my goods to look unto, <lb/>
            And robb'd my treasure may be by my foes. <lb n="80"/>
            When that was said, forth Menelaus goes, <lb/>
            To give unto his wife and maids command <lb/>
            For breakfast of what then was in the house. <lb/>
            Then Boetheides, who lodg'd near at hand, <pb n="448"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>
            sent home <lb/>
            with presents. </note> <lb/>
            Came in; and, bidden by Atrides, cleaves <lb n="85"/>
            The wood, makes fire, lays down the roast; <lb/>
            Him to his business then Atrides leaves, <lb/>
            And down came to his treasure of great cost, <lb/>
            He, and his son, and wife Helena. There <lb/>
            Within a room lin'd with sweet-smelling wood, <lb n="90"/>
            A temperer to his son he gave to bear, <lb/>
            Of silver pure, which 'mongst the vessels stood ; <lb/>
            And from a chest where robes for matrons were, <lb/>
            She took up one, with great variety <lb/>
            Wrought by herself, which she herself did bear, <lb n="95"/>
            Shining and bright as any star i' th' sky; <lb/>
            And forth unto Telemachus they come. <lb/>
            Then said Atrides, Jove grant your request, <lb/>
            And safely may you t' Ithaca come home; <lb/>
            See here my gift, of all I have the best: <lb n="100"/>
            'Tis massy silver, gilt about the brim, <lb/>
            By Vulcan made; but then it was possess'd <lb/>
            By th' king of Sidon: I had it of him <lb/>
            When by the way from Troy I was his guest. <lb/>
            Then Helen said, This gift too take from me, <lb n="105"/>
            Of Helen's handywork a monument, <lb/>
            To give to her that your dear wife shall be; <lb/>
            Think it meanwhile as to your mother sent; <lb/>
            Then gave it to Telemachus his hands. <lb/>
            I' th' coach Pisistratus then placed all, <lb n="110"/>
            And at the goodly gifts amazed stands; <lb/>
            Atrides then led them into the hall, <lb/>
            And made them sit; and while they sitting were, <lb/>
            A grave maid-servant from a golden ewer, <lb/>
            To wash their hands, pours on the water clear <lb n="115"/>
            Over a basin all of silver pure. <lb/>
            One tables sets, another lays on bread, <lb/>
            And from their store many good things brings out; <lb/>
            The messes Boetheides severed; <lb/>
            Atrides' son the wine delivered out. <lb n="120"/>
            When their desire of food was satisfied, <lb/>
            Up rose Telemachus and Nestor's son, <lb/>
            And to their coach they the swift horses tied, <lb/>
            And in the coach were ready to be gone; <lb/>
            And were already got the court without, <lb n="125"/>
            But after them Atrides followed, <lb/>
            And in his hand a gold cup he brought out <lb/>
            Of wine, and standing at the horses' head, <lb/>
            Brave youths, said he, to Nestor me commend, <lb/>
            That as a father was to me at Troy. <lb n="130"/>
            Farewell, and may you to your journey's end <lb/>
            With safety travel and arrive with joy. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus, all this I'll say, <lb/>
            I wish at home I may so treated be <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            Within my father's house at Ithaca, <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>
            sent home <lb/>
            with presents. </note> <lb n="135"/>
            Besides the presents you have given me. <lb/>
            As he said this, an eagle dexter flew, <lb/>
            And seiz'd a great white tame goose grazing near; <lb/>
            The standers-by shouted and cried, Shue, shue, <lb/>
            But yet away the eagle bore him clear; <lb n="140"/>
            And none but with the sight was well content. <lb/>
            Then to Atrides said Pisistratus, <lb/>
            This prodigy, unto you is it sent <lb/>
            From Jupiter ? Or is it sent to us ? <lb/>
            While what to answer he was taking care, <lb n="145"/>
            Helen prevented him. I will, said she, <lb/>
            First tell you what hereon my own thoughts are, <lb/>
            And to my mind by th' Gods infused be ; <lb/>
            You saw the eagle come down from the hill, <lb/>
            Where nature placed him to dwell and breed, <lb n="150"/>
            And kill that goose: so shall Ulysses kill <lb/>
            The suitors that upon his substance feed. <lb/>
            Or, it may be, already there he is <lb/>
            Devising for the suitors some ill end; <lb/>
            0 Gods, then said Telemachus, that this <lb n="155"/>
            Were so indeed! to you then should I send <lb/>
            As to a God my vows. This said, away <lb/>
            They whipp'd their willing horses through the town, <lb/>
            Which on the plain their harness shake all day, <lb/>
            And were at Pheres when the sun went down. <lb n="160"/>
            There Diocles, Orsilochus his son, <lb/>
            (Orsilochus by Alphæus begot), <lb/>
            Dwelt, and of entertainment want was none, <lb/>
            Nor acceptable presents were forgot; <lb/>
            And when the morning had herself array'd, <lb n="165"/>
            Again they put their horses to the coach, <lb/>
            Which when the whip they felt once, never stayed, <lb/>
            Till to the town of Pyle they did approach. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus to Nestor's son, <lb/>
            You promised, I your father should decline; <lb n="170"/>
            But since we here are, how can that be done ? <lb/>
            And therefore let us both our counsels join. <lb/>
            Friends you and I, and friends our fathers were; <lb/>
            One age we have; this voyage is some tie; <lb/>
            Draw me not from my ship, but leave me here, <lb n="175"/>
            Lest th' old man force me at his house to lie, <lb/>
            In kindness, when I have such need to go. <lb/>
            This said, Pisistratus considered <lb/>
            What to make good his promise he should do. <lb/>
            And then this counsel came into his head. <lb n="180"/>
            Turn off, said he, the coach to the sea-side, <lb/>
            And Menelaus' gifts a-shipboard stow, <lb/>
            And get aboard; your small stay here I'll hide. <lb/>
            So your departure shall my father know. <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> G G </note> <pb n="450"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>

            For sure I am, if he know you are here, <lb n="185"/>
            So violent he is, he'll hither come, <lb/>
            And call you to his house and stay you there, <lb/>
            And be a hindrance to your going home. <lb/>
            And though away you'll not be empty sent, <lb/>
            Yet will he doubtless very angry be. <lb n="190"/>
            This said, unto his father home he went. <lb/>
            Telemachus then bade his company <lb/>
            To see prepar'd all things for sailing fit, <lb/>
            And go aboard ; aboard went also he. <lb/>
            The rowers on their seats in order sit. <lb n="195"/>
            Thus they about their going busy be. <lb/>
            Then came a stranger, that a prophet was, <lb/>
            And fled from Argos then for homicide, <lb/>
            And by descent was of Melampus' race, <lb/>
            And stood near to Telemachus his side. <lb n="200"/>
            For this Melampus once had dwelt in Pyle, <lb/>
            And rich, but fled, by Neleus oppress'd, <lb/>
            And bound he lay in prison for awhile. <lb/>
            But afterward, he got himself released, <lb/>
            And brought to Neleus his herds again, <lb n="205"/>
            And had his daughter Pero for reward; <lb/>
            But left her with his brother to remain <lb/>
            For wife. And then did Pyle no more regard, <lb/>
            But went to Argos, where a wife he got, <lb/>
            And children twain had: first, Antiphates. <lb n="210"/>
            And he the valiant Oicleus begot, <lb/>
            And Oicleus begat Amphlareus, <lb/>
            That was belov'd by Pallas and by Jove, <lb/>
            And yet he lived not till he was old. <lb/>
            He died at Thebes, betrayed by his love, <lb n="215"/>
            That him discover'd for a chain of gold. <lb/>
            Alemæon and Amphilochus he got. <lb/>
            But Mantius, Melampus' second son, <lb/>
            Cleitus and Polyphides then begot. <lb/>
            Cleitus was fair, but children he had none ; <lb n="220"/>
            Aurora snatch'd him from the earth when young, <lb/>
            For mortals he in beauty did excel, <lb/>
            And placed him th' immortal Gods among. <lb/>
            And Polyphides, Phœbos loved well; <lb/>
            And to him gave the gift of prophecy. <lb n="225"/>
            And since Amphiraus was dead and gone, <lb/>
            To foretell anything with certainty <lb/>
            Upon the whole earth like him there was none. <lb/>
            Displeased by his father, Mantius, <lb/>
            At Hyperesia he prophecied. <lb n="230"/>
            His son it was, call'd Theoclymenus, <lb/>
            That then stood by Telemachus his side, <lb/>
            When he the blessed Gods was praying to. <lb/>
            And said, Since worshipping I find you here, <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            By him you worship, tell me truly who <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>

            You are, your father who, and dwelling where? <lb/>
            Stranger, then said Telemachus, I dwell <lb/>
            At Ithaca, born there ; my father's name <lb/>
            Ulysses, if he live; but who can tell ? <lb/>
            And to hear news of that, I hither came. <lb n="240"/>
            Then answer'd Theoclymenus, And I, <lb/>
            From Argos town, for killing of a man, <lb/>
            Pursued by his kin, am forc'd to fly; <lb/>
            Take me aboard that only save me can. <lb/>
            Welcome you are, then said Telemachus; <lb n="245"/>
            Aboard let's go, where you shall have such cheer <lb/>
            As we can make, and hath contented us. <lb/>
            Then took and on the deck he laid his spear ; <lb/>
            And up into the ship he went, and at <hi rend="intraline"><lb/>
            250 </hi>The stem he placed himself, and close by him <lb/>
            The stranger Theoclymenus down sat. <lb/>
            Then bids Telemachus, the ship to trim. <lb/>
            And straight the mast upright they set and bind, <lb/>
            And hoist their sails with ropes of good cow-hide; <lb/>
            And Pallas sent them a good strong forewind, <lb n="255"/>
            And swiftly did the ship the sea divide. <lb/>
            The sun was down, and doubtful was the light, <lb/>
            When he to Pheræ came and passed by; <lb/>
            And then by Elis coasted he all night, <lb/>
            And came unto the Thoæ Islands nigh; <lb n="260"/>
            And thought upon the suitors in his way. <lb/>
            Ulysses and Eumæus supping sat, <lb/>
            And when their hunger they had put away, <lb/>
            The tables gone, they leisure had to chat. <lb/>
            And then Ulysses had a mind to know, <lb n="265"/>
            Whether Eumæus rather had he stayed <lb/>
            I' th' lodge with him, or to the city go; <lb/>
            And to the company he spake, and said: <lb/>
            Hear me, Eumæus, and you all, his friends; <lb/>
            I stay here helping to consume your meat, <lb n="270"/>
            My mind me to the city rather bends; <lb/>
            For bread and wine there begging I shall get. <lb/>
            But I must then entreat you to provide <lb/>
            Some good man to go with me. Being there, <lb/>
            Necessity itself will be my guide <lb n="275"/>
            To find the houses where there is good cheer. <lb/>
            And if I go unto Ulysses' doors, <lb/>
            Unto Penelope I can tell news, <lb/>
            And make myself well known unto the woo'rs, <lb/>
            And they to give me meat will not refuse. <lb n="280"/>
            I can do any service that they will, <lb/>
            (Thank Mercury, to whom I owe that good), <lb/>
            Few be they can compare with me for skill <lb/>

            To roast and carve meat, or wine to give out, <lb n="285"/>
            Or anything that great men's servants do. <lb/>
            Ay me, Eumæus said, poor man, what thought <lb/>
            Is this of yours ? D' ye long to perish so ? <lb/>
            As you must do, if you among them stay; <lb/>
            Their insolence is known up to the sky. <lb n="290"/>
            You are not like their serving men ; for they <lb/>
            Are young, and are apparell'd handsomely <lb/>
            With coat and vest; their heads and faces shine <lb/>
            With unguents sweet. Stay therefore here with me; <lb/>
            There's none that at your staying doth repine, <lb n="295"/>
            Nor I, nor any of my company. <lb/>
            Telemachus, when he comes home again, <lb/>
            Shall give you garments, a fair coat and vest, <lb/>
            And good shoes also to your feet, and then <lb/>
            See you convoy'd to what place you think best. <lb n="300"/>
            To this, Ulysses answered, and said, <lb/>
            Oh ! that Jove lov'd you but as well as I. <lb/>
            You have me from a wretched wand'ring stayed. <lb/>
            The belly brings to men such misery. <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses, Since I am to stay, <lb n="305"/>
            Say, of Ulysses' parents, if you know <lb/>
            His father and his mother, whether they <lb/>
            Be both remaining yet alive or no. <lb/>
            To this, Eumæus said : Laertes lives, <lb/>
            But woefully and weary of his life; <lb n="310"/>
            Still for the absence of his son he grieves ; <lb/>
            But more lamenteth the death of his wife. <lb/>
            The loss of her was that first made him old. <lb/>
            She died for grief, thinking her son was dead; <lb/>
            As sad a death it was as can be told. <lb n="315"/>
            May we from such death be delivered. <lb/>
            While she was living, though she grieved were, <lb/>
            When cause there was, I could have asked her mind <lb/>
            Freely. For why, with her own daughter dear <lb/>
            She brought me up, and never was but kind. <lb n="320"/>
            This daughter Ctimene, when come of age <lb/>
            (For she the youngest was) to Same went, <lb/>
            To a rich man given in marriage. <lb/>
            But I, well clad in coat and vest, was sent <lb/>
            (And shoes upon my feet) into the field; <lb n="325"/>
            For she a purpose had to do me good. <lb/>
            But now the time does no such kindness yield, <lb/>
            And yet the blessed Gods provide me food; <lb/>
            For they so well have multiplied my swine, <lb/>
            That we have still enough of meat and drink, <lb n="330"/>
            And wherewithal to make a poor man dine, <lb/>
            Although the suitors' riot make them shrink ; <lb/>
            But since this woe Penelope betel, <lb/>
            'Tis harsh to her to hear of business: <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            Yet servants need her both to ask and tell <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>
            sent home <lb/>
            with presents. </note> <lb n="335"/>
            All that belongeth to their offices, <lb/>
            And also sometimes, maybe, need they had <lb/>
            I' th' house to eat, and carry somewhat home, <lb/>
            Of that whereof servants are most part glad, <lb/>
            And which unto their lodges never come. <lb n="340"/>
            Ho, said Ulysses, since it doth appear <lb/>
            You were a traveller when but a boy, <lb/>
            Tell me, I pray you, what your adventures were, <lb/>
            And what your sufferings were upon the way. <lb/>
            Was your town plunder'd by the enemies, <lb n="345"/>
            And you brought hither as a part o' th' prey ? <lb/>
            Or been by thieves (for you were no ill prize), <lb/>
            As you kept sheep or cattle, brought away ? <lb/>
            Then said Eumæus, Since to hear the story <lb/>
            Of how I hither came it is your pleasure, <lb n="350"/>
            Sit patiently, the wine there stands before ye; <lb/>
            For sleep and joy the long nights give us leisure, <lb/>
            It is not good too soon to go to bed; <lb/>
            For too much sleep is but a weariness; <lb/>
            The rest that will may go, and, morning spread, <lb n="355"/>
            Drive forth the swine, which is their business. <lb/>
            Meanwhile let us sit here, and drink and chat, <lb/>
            And stories of our sad adventures tell; <lb/>
            For much contentment there is ev'n in that, <lb/>
            To them that suffer'd have and come off well. <lb n="360"/>
            But to my story now. An isle there is <lb/>
            Under the tropic of the sun, not great, <lb/>
            Call'd Syria, but very fertile 'tis, <lb/>
            Well stor'd with kine, and sheep, and wine and wheat, <lb/>
            Where famine never enter'd, nor disease <lb n="365"/>
            Amongst the people. When a man was aged, <lb/>
            Dian' and Phœbus made him die with ease, <lb/>
            And gentle shafts the pain of death assuaged. <lb/>
            Two towns it had; their laws were not the same; <lb/>
            But of them both my father was the king. <lb n="370"/>
            Phœnician merchants, rats, then thither came, <lb/>
            And in their ships did many baubles bring. <lb/>
            There then was in my father's house a maid, <lb/>
            Phœnician born, that well could sow and spin; <lb/>
            As washing clothes she at the sea-side stayed, <lb n="375"/>
            One of these merchants sooth'd her into sin, <lb/>
            (For good workwomen may be made to do that, <lb/>
            If flatter'd well), and then he ask'd her name, <lb/>
            And whence she was. And truth she told the rat. <lb/>
            From Sidon, said she, a rich town, I came, <lb n="380"/>
            And daughter am of wealthy Arybas; <lb/>
            But Taphian thieves took me by force away, <lb/>
            As homewards from the field I going was, <lb/>
            And sold me to this man with whom I stay. <pb n="454"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>
            sent home <lb/>
            with presents. </note> <lb/>
            Then said the merchantman that did her wive, <lb n="385"/>
            Will you to Sidon home return with me, <lb/>
            And see your parents ? They are still alive, <lb/>
            And rich as heretofore. I will, said she, <lb/>
            If you and all your company will swear, <lb/>
            At Sidon you will set me safe ashore. <lb n="390"/>
            And when all sworn, and agreed on it were, <lb/>
            The woman spake again, and this said more: <lb/>
            If any of you see me in the street, <lb/>
            Or at the well, speak not at all to me, <lb/>
            Lest any of the house should chance to see't, <lb n="395"/>
            And tell my master. Jealous he will be, <lb/>
            Put me in bonds, and seek you to destroy; <lb/>
            Buy quickly what you buy, and ready be, <lb/>
            And secret. When you mean to go away, <lb/>
            Then send a privy messenger to me; <lb n="400"/>
            For all the gold I can lay hand upon <lb/>
            I'll bring, and somewhat else boat-hire to pay; <lb/>
            For I the charge have of my master's son; <lb/>
            Much profit he will yield if brought away. <lb/>
            Playing without, I'll take him by the hand <lb n="405"/>
            And lead him to the ship; much worth he'll be, <lb/>
            Transported into whatsoever land. <lb/>
            And home again, this said, returned she. <lb/>
            A year it was before these merchants went. <lb/>
            Meanwhile they buy and lade the ship; and when <lb n="410"/>
            They had their freight, straightway a man they sent <lb/>
            To bid the maid make haste away. And then <lb/>
            A man unto my father's house they sent; <lb/>
            A crafty merchant, with a chain of gold <lb/>
            And shining amber, on which were intent <lb n="415"/>
            My mother and her maids; they much behold, <lb/>
            And take into their hands, and for it bid. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the man a nod gave with his head, <lb/>
            The woman quickly understand him did, <lb/>
            And by the hand me out a-door she lead. <lb n="420"/>
            Aboard went he. The woman look'd about, <lb/>
            Saw standing on the tables many a cup, <lb/>
            Left by my father and his guests gone out, <lb/>
            And presently she three of them took up; <lb/>
            Out went she, leading me, that simple was. <lb n="425"/>
            The sun went down, and dusky was the way, <lb/>
            And to the ship we unpursued pass, <lb/>
            To th' haven where the merchants' vessel lay. <lb/>
            And then go they, and with them we aboard, <lb/>
            And sail'd before the wind six days and nights, <lb n="430"/>
            And to us Jove a fair gale did afford, <lb/>
            Diana on the seventh the woman smites, <lb/>
            And suddenly into the sink she fell; <lb/>
            And her they throw into the sea for cheer <lb/>
             <pb n="455"/>
            To fishes; but the rest arrived well <note type="margin"> LIB. XV. </note><note type="margin"> Telemachus <lb/>

            At Ithaca. Laertes bought me there. <lb/>
            You see now how I hither came. Then said <lb/>
            Ulysses, Truly you have pass'd much woe; <lb/>
            But Jove in part your sorrows bath allay'd, <lb/>
            That in a good man's house at ease are now, <lb n="440"/>
            That gives you meat and drink with a good will; <lb/>
            With him you live a happy life. But I <lb/>
            Have longer wand'ring been, and must be still. <lb/>
            Thus 'twixt themselves did they say and reply, <lb/>
            Then went to sleep. The night was almost past, <lb n="445"/>
            And with the morn Telemachus was nigh; <lb/>
            Quickly his mates take down the sails and mast, <lb/>
            And row the ship to land, and there her tie; <lb/>
            Then on the beach they quickly break their fast, <lb/>
            And with fresh water temper their old wine. <lb n="450"/>
            And when desire of meat and drink was past, <lb/>
            I'll, said Telemachus, go to my swine, <lb/>
            But to the city will return at night, <lb/>
            Next morn I'll feast you with good flesh and wine, <lb/>
            Your labour in my passage to requite. <lb n="455"/>
            And then said Theoclymenus divine, <lb/>
            What will you do meanwhile, I pray, with me ? <lb/>
            Unto your mother's house must I go too, <lb/>
            Or to some other man commended be ? <lb/>
            Then answered Telemachus: No, no, <lb n="460"/>
            To bring you to my house in vain it were. <lb/>
            My mother in my absence you'll not see, <lb/>
            She seldom to the suitors doth appear, <lb/>
            At top o' th' house at work still sitteth she. <lb/>
            But I will recommend you to another, <lb n="465"/>
            In Ithaca of best repute; his name <lb/>
            Eurylochus, and best he loves my mother, <lb/>
            And what my father did would do the same; <lb/>
            But folded up it lies yet in Jove's lap, <lb/>
            Whether he first shall married be or dead. <lb n="470"/>
            As he this said, there did a falcon hap <lb/>
            (Apollo's bird) to fly above his head <lb/>
            Dexter, and in his pounces held a dove; <lb/>
            And as he plumed her the feathers fell <lb/>
            Scatter'd as they descended from above <lb n="475"/>
            (Which Theoclymenus observed well) <lb/>
            Betwixt Telemachus and the ship's side; <lb/>
            And to Telemachus said secretly: <lb/>
            This from the Gods is, and doth good betide <lb/>
            Both to yourself and your posterity. <lb n="480"/>
            I knew that it portended at first sight, <lb/>
            No family but yours was here to reign. <lb/>
            0, said Telemachus, that that were right, <lb/>
            Such love, such gifts, you then should from me gain, <pb n="456"/>

            As men that saw you should your fortune bless. <lb n="485"/>
            Pyræus then his friend was standing by, <lb/>
            To him he then his stranger did address: <lb/>
            You are my best friend of the company; <lb/>
            Unto your care this stranger I commend, <lb/>
            To be well treated till I come again. <lb n="490"/>
            Though long you stay, said he, I do intend <lb/>
            The best I can your friend to entertain, <lb/>
            And with some gift. Then to the ship he goes, <lb/>
            He and his mates. They on their benches sit. <lb/>
            Telemachus then putteth on his shoes, <lb n="495"/>
            And takes a spear that for his hand was fit; <lb/>
            The ship about they to the city row. <lb/>
            Telemachus pursuing his design, <lb/>
            On foot unto Eumæus forth did go, <lb/>
            His faithful servant, master of the swine.</p>

            And men, for dinner, sent out to fetch hogs, <lb/>
            And fire was made. Ulysses chanc'd to hear <lb/>
            One tread without, and whining of the dogs <lb/>

            To see you, and to ask about my mother; <lb/>
            Whether she still remaining be at home, <lb/>
            Or gone be with a suitor one or other, <lb/>
            Leaving her husband's chamber and his bed <lb/>
            With cobwebs hung for want of furniture ? <lb n="30"/>
            No, she yet stays, Eumæus answered, <lb/>
            And great the grief is which she doth endure; <lb/>
            And day and night the tears fall from her eyes. <lb/>
            Telemachus went in. His father there <lb/>
            To give him place did from his chair arise. <lb n="35"/>
            Sit still, said he, I'll find a seat elsewhere <lb/>
            In my own house. This man will one provide. <lb/>
            This said, he past unto another seat, <lb/>
            To which Eumæus a wool-fell applied <lb/>
            With rushes under it. Then brought in meat, <lb n="40"/>
            Trenchers of meat roasted the day before, <lb/>
            And in a basket sets on bread of wheat, <lb/>
            And in an ivy-tankard wine good store, <lb/>
            And o'er against Ulysses takes his seat. <lb/>
            Then on the meat prepar'd their hands they laid. <lb n="45"/>
            When thirst and hunger nothing more requir'd, <lb/>
            Telemachus unto Eumaeus said, <lb/>
            And thus about his new-come guest inquired: <lb/>
            Father, said he, I pray you tell me now, <lb/>
            His own, his father's, and his country's name; <lb n="50"/>
            And farther I desire you let me know <lb/>
            Where are the mariners that with him came <lb/>
            Unto this place? And tell me this likewise, <lb/>
            Where rideth the good ship that brought him to't ? <lb/>
            For verily I can no way devise, <lb n="55"/>
            How he should come on horseback or on foot. <lb/>
            To this Eumæus answered agen: <lb/>
            He says himself that he was born in Creet, <lb/>
            And seen the cities has of many men, <lb/>
            Wand'ring about, for Jove so thought it meet. <lb n="60"/>
            Thesprotian rats got him aboard their ship, <lb/>
            And forced were in Ithaca to land; <lb/>
            There he found means to give them all the slip; <lb/>
            So came to mine, and from mine to your hand. <lb/>
            I give him you, as you think best to use. <lb n="65"/>
            To this again Telemachus replies: <lb/>
            That which you say, Eumæus, is bad news. <lb/>
            How to receive him I cannot devise. <lb/>
            I am too young to save him with my hands, <lb/>
            If injury be done him by the wooers. <lb n="70"/>
            And at this time my mother doubtful stands, <lb/>
            Whether to stay within my father's doors, <lb/>
            And with the people her good name maintain, <lb/>
            Or with that suitor wed and go away, <pb n="458"/>

            Oh! friend, said he, it bites my heart to hear <lb/>
            What of the suitors in your house you say, <lb n="90"/>
            How 'gainst your mind they proudly domineer. <lb/>
            It is because you willingly give way ? <lb/>
            Or that your people by divinity <lb/>
            Adverse are to you or your government ? <lb/>
            Or are your kindred, that should stand you by <lb n="95"/>
            In quarrel and in battle, discontent ? <lb/>
            Oh, were I young, and of the mind I am, <lb/>
            Or that I were the great Ulysses' son, <lb/>
            Or he himself, and wand'ring hither came, <lb/>
            I'd have my head cut off by any one, <lb n="100"/>
            If I were not reveng'd upon them all. <lb/>
            And though they were too hard for me alone, <lb/>
            I'd rather in my own house fighting fall, <lb/>
            Than daily see such ugly things there done. <lb/>
            Strangers abus'd, maids tous'd ill favour'dly, <lb n="105"/>
            And corn and wine consumed without end, <lb/>
            And to no purpose foolishly; for why, <lb/>
            They never shall arrive where they intend. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus : No word o' th' Gods <lb/>
            Hath me deprived of the people's love, <lb n="110"/>
            Nor any brother is with me at odds, <lb/>
            Nor any other cause I know but Jove. <lb/>
            How many lords within these isles do sway, <lb/>
            Same, Dulichium, Ithaca, and Zant, <lb/>
            So many suitors duly every day <lb n="115"/>
            For marriage with my mother my house haunt. <lb/>
            Whilst she can none put off, and will none marry, <lb/>
            They spend my corn and wine, and cattle kill, <lb/>
            And eating here, and drinking still they tarry, <lb/>
            And me perhaps, at last, they murther wilL <lb n="120"/>
            But what they shall do none but God can telL <lb/>
            But, father, go you to Penelope, <lb/>
            And let her know I am arrived well. <lb/>
            And let no other person know but she. <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            And after you have told her, tarry not. <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. <lb/>

            Make haste. At your return, I shall be here, <lb/>
            For many are they that my death do plot. <lb/>
            True, said Eumaeus, but not ill it were <lb/>
            To let Laertes know it by the way, <lb/>
            Who when his grief but for Ulysses was, <lb n="130"/>
            Did oversee his workmen all the day, <lb/>
            But since by sea to Pylus you did pass, <lb/>
            He neither oversees his husbandry, <lb/>
            Nor eats his meat, as still he did before; <lb/>
            But groaning and lamenting woefully <lb n="135"/>
            Liveth. Telemachus did thus reply: <lb/>
            The case is hard. But grieved though he be, <lb/>
            Let him alone ; go not out of your way. <lb/>
            For first I wish my father here to see, <lb/>
            If in my choice to have my wishes lay. <lb n="140"/>
            But pray my mother thither send a maid, <lb/>
            To tell Laertes secretly the news. <lb/>
            When to him thus Telemachus had said, <lb/>
            Eumæus on his feet tied on his shoes. <lb/>
            Ulysses and his son now left alone, <lb n="145"/>
            Came Pallas to them. At the door she stood; <lb/>
            But by Telemachus she was not known. <lb/>
            Gods are not known but by whom they think good. <lb/>
            Ulysses knew her. Fair she was and tall, <lb/>
            And of a grave wise matron had the look; <lb n="150"/>
            And by the dogs perceiv'd was. For they all <lb/>
            Whining and terrified the place forsook. <lb/>
            A sign t' Ulysses she made with her brow. <lb/>
            Then he went forth, and she unto him spake. <lb/>
            Son of Laertes, wise Ulysses, now <lb n="155"/>
            Your son with your design acquainted make; <lb/>
            And when you have the suitors' fate contrived, <lb/>
            Go to the city both. 'Twill not be long <lb/>
            Before I at your combat be arrived, <lb/>
            And give you my assistance in the throng. <lb n="160"/>
            And stroak'd him over with a wand of gold, <lb/>
            And presently his rags were cloak and coat; <lb/>
            His cheeks were plump; his beard black to behold, <lb/>
            To which his goodly locks unlike were not. <lb/>
            This done, the Goddess mounted to the skies. <lb n="165"/>
            Ulysses to the house again retir'd; <lb/>
            But from him then his son turned off his eyes. <lb/>
            So much this alteration he admir'd ; <lb/>
            He thought it was some God, and to him said, <lb/>
            You are some God descended from the sky; <lb n="170"/>
            Your colour's better, better you arrayed. <lb/>
            Save us. Our gifts shall on your altar lie. <lb/>
            And then Ulysses said, God I am none. <lb/>
            What ails you with the Gods me to compare ? <pb n="460"/>

            For I your father am, whom you bemoan, <lb n="175"/>
            And for whom you have had such pain and care; <lb/>
            And then embrac'd and kiss'd his son, and wept, <lb/>
            So that the ground he stood upon was wet, <lb/>
            Though hitherto his eyes he dry had kept; <lb/>
            But by his son believ'd he was not yet. <lb n="180"/>
            You're not, says he, my father, but some spright <lb/>
            That flatters me into more misery. <lb/>
            Of mortal men there's none that has the might <lb/>
            To do such things without a deity. <lb/>
            A God indeed can man'is decay redeem; <lb n="185"/>
            You were but now an old man ill arrayed; <lb/>
            And now like one new come from heaven seem; <lb/>
            To this Ulysses answered and said, <lb/>
            Telemachus, be not amaz'd too much; <lb/>
            Other Ulysses you shall never see. <lb n="190"/>
            I am the man, although my luck be such, <lb/>
            As after twenty year not known to be; <lb/>
            The change you see was by Athena wrought, <lb/>
            That made me what she list, for she can do't. <lb/>
            A beggar old, or youth in a fine coat, <lb n="195"/>
            And handsome cloak, and other garment to't; <lb/>
            For easy 'tis for Gods on mortal men <lb/>
            To lay on glory, and the same displace. <lb/>
            This said, Ulysses sat him down. And then <lb/>
            Telemachus his father did embrace, <lb n="200"/>
            And then they both together wept and sobb'd, <lb/>
            As eagles or as vultures, when they see <lb/>
            Their nests by country-people spoil'd and robb'd, <lb/>
            And young ones kill'd before they fledged be; <lb/>
            So wept these two, and weeping there had staid <lb n="205"/>
            Perhaps until the closing of the day, <lb/>
            But that Telemachus t' Ulysses said, <lb/>
            Father, how came you t' Ithaca, I pray ? <lb/>
            Where are the seamen that set you ashore ? <lb/>
            For sure I am you could not come by land. <lb n="210"/>
            In a good ship, said he, I was brought o'er <lb/>
            From th' Isle Phœacia, and left o' th' sand; <lb/>
            That people, strangers all that thither come, <lb/>
            Convoy unto the place where they would be; <lb/>
            And when I was desirous to go home, <lb n="215"/>
            At Ithaca asleep they landed me, <lb/>
            Enrich'd with presents, garments, gold and brass; <lb/>
            And in a cave I hidden have the same; <lb/>
            And, as I by Athena counsell'd was, <lb/>
            The suitors' fate to weave I hither came. <lb n="220"/>
            Tell me how many now they are, that we <lb/>
            Consider may if we two and no more <lb/>
            Shall be enough to get the victory, <lb/>
            Or must we of some else the aid implore ? <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            0 father, said his son, you are renown'd <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses dis­ <lb/>

            For a good councillor, a man of might; <lb/>
            But very hard the thing is you propound, <lb/>
            That two men should against so many fight. <lb/>
            They are not only ten, or two times ten, <lb/>
            But many more. Their number, let me see, <lb n="230"/>
            From out Dulichium two-and-fifty men; <lb/>
            And with them lusty serving men twice three. <lb/>
            From Same chosen men come twenty-four; <lb/>
            Twenty from Zant, and twelve of Ithaca. <lb/>
            Medon, the squire, a fiddler, and what more ? <lb n="235"/>
            Two cooks that of a feast had learnt the law. <lb/>
            'Twill be but ill revenge to fight them all; <lb/>
            Therefore I think it best to look for aid, <lb/>
            And some good neighbour to assist you call. <lb/>
            To this Ulysses answered and said, <lb n="240"/>
            Consider then, and cast it in your mind, <lb/>
            Whether we two, Pallas and Jove to boot, <lb/>
            Will serve, or must we other succours find ? <lb/>
            Then said his son, 0 father, that will do't. <lb/>
            Those friends indeed will serve us very much. <lb n="245"/>
            Immortals against mortals have great odds; <lb/>
            Higher they stand, and of themselves are such, <lb/>
            As would too hard be for all th' other Gods. <lb/>
            Yes, said Ulysses, if the woo'rs and I <lb/>
            Come but to battle once, 'twill not be long <lb n="250"/>
            Ere such good aids will have the victory, <lb/>
            And make an end of this unruly throng. <lb/>
            But you, Telemachus, go early home <lb/>
            To-morrow morning; mingle with the rabble; <lb/>
            I after you will with Eumaeus come, <lb n="255"/>
            Like to a beggar old and miserable; <lb/>
            Where if you see me us'd ill-favour'dly, <lb/>
            Thrown at, or pull'd about the house by th' heels, <lb/>
            As unconcem'd, endure it patiently, <lb/>
            What pain soever thereby your heart feels; <lb n="260"/>
            But yet with gentle words you may persuade them; <lb/>
            For sure I am they will not you obey, <lb/>
            The Gods immortal have so stupid made them, <lb/>
            As on themselves to bring their fatal day. <lb/>
            But now to what I say attentive be. <lb n="265"/>
            When Pallas shall me prompt, I'll with my head <lb/>
            Make you a sign. As soon as that you see, <lb/>
            Let th' arms in th' hall away be carried, <lb/>
            And say, if any suitor ask wherefore, <lb/>
            The fire hath hurt them, and they are not now <lb n="270"/>
            Such as Ulysses left them heretofore, <lb/>
            When with the Greeks t' Ilium he did go. <lb/>
            Or say, for fear some quarrel should arise, <lb/>
            By th' indiscretion of one or other, <pb n="462"/>

            You thought the council would not be unwise, <lb n="275"/>
            To take them thence. One drawn sword draws another. <lb/>
            But two spears, two swords, and two shields keep stilL <lb/>
            To take in hand when we onset make. <lb/>
            Jove from mistrust and Pallas keep them will: <lb/>
            And farther from me this instruction take. <lb n="280"/>
            As I your father am, and you my son, <lb/>
            Of my return a word let no man hear, <lb/>
            Father, or wife, or servant any one; <lb/>
            To speak of it in company forbear. <lb/>
            But let's of the maid-servants you and I <lb n="285"/>
            Endeavour what we can to know the mind; <lb/>
            And your men-servants also I would try, <lb/>
            From whom you honour or dishonour find. <lb/>
            Father, then said Telemachus, you'll see, <lb/>
            I am not loose of tongue. But 'tis not good <lb n="290"/>
            The men to question. 'Twill lost labour be, <lb/>
            Because without the house they have their food, <lb/>
            Though there they havoc of your substance make. <lb/>
            Do as you please. 'Tis a long business <lb/>
            Of ev'ry one of them account to take. <lb n="295"/>
            Inform yourself of th' women's wickedness, <lb/>
            I would not willingly go up and down <lb/>
            To ev'ry lodge, what there is done to see. <lb/>
            For our work done, theirs will be better known, <lb/>
            If you with signs from Jove acquainted be. <lb n="300"/>
            Thus they discours'd. The mariners meanwhile <lb/>
            Had brought into the haven of the town <lb/>
            The ship that brought Telemachus from Pyle; <lb/>
            Then drew it up to land, the sails pull'd down. <lb/>
            The presents unto Clytius they bear, <lb n="305"/>
            And to Penelope a man they sent, <lb/>
            That of her son's arrival she might hear, <lb/>
            And how unto Eumæus' lodge he went, <lb/>
            And sent the ship to put her out of fear, <lb/>
            Lest she should for his absence longer weep. <lb n="310"/>
            Eumæus was for the same business there; <lb/>
            He from his lodge, the other from the deep. <lb/>
            He told the queen th' arrival of her son; <lb/>
            And to her maids the other told the same. <lb/>
            And when they both their messages had done, <lb n="315"/>
            Back to Telemachus Eumæus came; <lb/>
            At this the suitors vex'd, look'd down and sad, <lb/>
            And out o' th'gates together went, where they <lb/>
            Amongst themselves a consultation had, <lb/>
            And to them thus Eurylochus 'gan say. <lb n="320"/>
            'Tis very strange, Telemachus is come, <lb/>
            We thought he never should return agen; <lb/>
            But since 'tis so, to call our fellows home, <lb/>
            Let's hire and man a boat with fishermen. <lb/>

            And turning towards the haven them espied <lb/>
            Furling their sails, and laughing said, Th'are here, <lb/>
            You need not any messenger provide. <lb/>
            Some God sure told him of them, or else they <lb/>
            Saw the ship coming by, but were too slow <lb n="330"/>
            To overtake her. This said, they away <lb/>
            Down to the waters-side together go; <lb/>
            And up unto the land the ship they hale; <lb/>
            Their servants what was in her bear away. <lb/>
            And then to consultation they fall, <lb n="335"/>
            Nor with them suffer'd any else to stay. <lb/>
            To them Antinous began and said, <lb/>
            The Gods Telemachus have strangely kept. <lb/>
            Our scouts from morn to night o' th' mountains stayed, <lb/>
            Nor on the land by night we ever slept, <lb n="340"/>
            But rowed up and down until 'twas day. <lb/>
            We thought he could not 'scape in any wise; <lb/>
            And yet some daemon brought him has away. <lb/>
            Come, let us how to kill him here devise: <lb/>
            For whilst he lives our work will not be done; <lb n="345"/>
            Crafty he is, and can his purpose hide; <lb/>
            Nor have we yet sufficiently won <lb/>
            The people of the town with us to side. <lb/>
            The multitude to council he will call, <lb/>
            And ranting tell them that we go about <lb n="350"/>
            To murther him, and so enflame them all, <lb/>
            That from our country they will cast us out, <lb/>
            And make us beg our bread. Which to eschew <lb/>
            Let's kill him in the fields, or in the way; <lb/>
            Divide his goods amongst us, as is due. <lb n="355"/>
            His houses to his mother leave we may, <lb/>
            To give to him with whom she means to marry. <lb/>
            If this you like not, but that he shall stay, <lb/>
            And have his father's state, then let's not tarry, <lb/>
            But each man to his own house go his way, <lb n="360"/>
            And there contend who shall the best endow her, <lb/>
            And in her favour the superior be; <lb/>
            Or let the fates dispose the happy hour <lb/>
            To whom she has a mind to. So said he. <lb/>
            Then spake Amphinomus, the noble son <lb n="365"/>
            Of the rich Nisus Aretiades, <lb/>
            Amongst the wooers inferior to none, <lb/>
            And best of all Penelope did please. <lb/>
            Telemachus, said he, I would not kill; <lb/>
            'Tis dangerous to slay the royal blood; <lb n="370"/>
            But let us first of Jove inquire the will; <lb/>
            If he command, I'll do't, and say 'tis good; <lb/>
            If he forbid, I wish you to desist. <lb/>
            So said Amphinomus, and 'twas thought fit; <pb n="464"/>

            And presently the council was dismissed: <lb n="375"/>
            And then into the house they go and sit. <lb/>
            And now Penelope resolved t' appear <lb/>
            Before her suitors sitting in the hall. <lb/>
            For to her son she knew they traitors were; <lb/>
            Medon, that with them was, had told her all. <lb n="380"/>
            Down to the hall she went, and in the door <lb/>
            Having a woman at each hand, she staid, <lb/>
            And proud Antinous rebuked sore. <lb/>
            Antinous, you traitor impudent, she said, <lb/>
            In Ithaca the glory you have got <lb n="385"/>
            Of wit and eloquence. You are belied. <lb/>
            Madman, what ails you, my son's death to plot, <lb/>
            And to his strangers here to show such pride? <lb/>
            Poor strangers have their passport from the Gods. <lb/>
            To do them wrong is great impiety; <lb n="390"/>
            And worse between themselves to be at odds. <lb/>
            You know your father hither once did fly, <lb/>
            Fearing the people whom he had offended, <lb/>
            Joining with Tophian thieves to make a prey <lb/>
            Of Thesprote cattle, and were here defended <lb n="395"/>
            Against the Thesprotes, though our friends were they. <lb/>
            They slain him had, and seized his estate, <lb/>
            But that Ulysses saved him; and now, <lb/>
            For to requite him, what dye, 0 ingrate? <lb/>
            You eat his cattle; and his wife you woo, <lb n="400"/>
            And kill my son, and daily me molest. <lb/>
            Desist, I tell you, and the rest persuade <lb/>
            To leave these evil courses, you were best. <lb/>
            To this Eurylochus then answer made. <lb/>
            Icarius' daughter, wise Penelope, <lb n="405"/>
            Fear not. None shall lay hands upon your son, <lb/>
            As long as I am living and can see; <lb/>
            Who does, his blood shall on my spear down run. <lb/>
            His father oft has set me on his knee, <lb/>
            And given me good wine, and good meat roast. <lb n="410"/>
            Afraid of any wooer you need not be; <lb/>
            Telemachus of all men I love most. <lb/>
            Of death from God's hand none can warrant you; <lb/>
            But as for us you may securely sleep. <lb/>
            So said he, and yet then his death did brew. <lb n="415"/>
            Away went then Penelope to weep, <lb/>
            And wept till Pallas came and clos'd her eyes; <lb/>
            And to Ulysses and his son at night <lb/>
            Eumasus came. A swine they sacrifice; <lb/>
            And then did Pallas from the sky alight, <lb n="420"/>
            And with her rod return'd Ulysses old, <lb/>
            And ill array'd, for fear he should be known <lb/>
            T' Eumæus or Penelope, and told <lb/>
            By them to others, and abroad be blown. <lb/>
             <pb n="465"/>
            Telemachus then to Eumæus said: <note type="margin"> LIB. XVI. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses dis­ <lb/>

            Eumaeus, are you come? what news from town? <lb/>
            The suitors, are they come, that me way-laid? <lb/>
            Or do they for me still look up and down? <lb/>
            Then said Eumæus, I did not inquire, <lb/>
            Upon my message only was my mind; <lb n="430"/>
            That done, to make haste back was my desire. <lb/>
            But there I chanc'd a messenger to find, <lb/>
            Sent by your mates to tell Penelope, <lb/>
            And he the news t' your mother first did tell. <lb/>
            I saw a ship that new came in from sea, <lb n="435"/>
            But whether that were it, I know not well. <lb/>
            Aboard were many arms and many men; <lb/>
            And though I were not sure, I thought 'twas it. <lb/>
            Telemachus on's father smiled then, <lb/>
            But so as that Eumæus could not see't. <lb n="440"/>
            Then came their supper in, which they fell to. <lb/>
            A supper good they had, and were well pleased; <lb/>
            And when their hunger had no more to do, <lb/>
            With gentle sleep their fear and care disseised.</p>

            And said unto Eumæus, Father, I <lb n="5"/>
            Am going to the city, there to see <lb/>
            My mother, that will never cease to cry <lb/>

            I cannot maintain all men that have need. <lb/>
            Tak't how he will. For I love to speak plain. <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses: Sweet friend, nor would I <lb/>
            Here in the country willingly remain, <lb n="15"/>
            For beggars' wants great cities best supply. <lb/>
            Here at the lodge no service I can do; <lb/>
            And now to learn of others am too old. <lb/>
            With this man to the city I would go, <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> H If </note> <pb n="466"/>

            This morning is; I fear this hoary frost. <lb/>
            Far hence the town is, and my garments thin; <lb/>
            And which I reason have to fear the most, <lb/>
            My rags will to the air betray my skin. <lb/>
            Telemachus then speedily went home, <lb n="25"/>
            With mischief to the suitors in his head; <lb/>
            And when he to the palace gate was come, <lb/>
            T* a pillar sets his spear, and entered. <lb/>
            Euryclea was cov'ring chairs i' th' hall, <lb/>
            And saw him first, and straight unto him went; <lb n="30"/>
            And then the other woman-servants all <lb/>
            Declared with much kissing their content; <lb/>
            Then, like Diana or fair Aphrodite, <lb/>
            Penelope came shedding tears of joy, <lb/>
            And on his shoulders laid her arms milk-white, <lb n="35"/>
            And kiss'd his head and eyes, and thus did say: <lb/>
            Telemachus, my dear child, are you here? <lb/>
            I never thought again your face to see, <lb/>
            Since of your father news you went to hear <lb/>
            At Pyle, by sea, without acquainting me. <lb n="40"/>
            But tell me, what at Pyle they of him say? <lb/>
            Mother, said he, pray let me take my breath, <lb/>
            My thoughts in great disorder are to-day; <lb/>
            I come but now from out the jaws of death; <lb/>
            But with your maids go to your chamber now, <lb n="45"/>
            And in your fairest garments you array, <lb/>
            And to th' immortal Gods all make a vow <lb/>
            A perfect hecatomb to them you'll pay, <lb/>
            If Jove be pleased our losses to restore. <lb/>
            But I unto the market-place must haste, <lb n="50"/>
            To treat a stranger whom I sent before, <lb/>
            And till my coming with Piraeus plac'd. <lb/>
            Penelope then to her chamber went, <lb/>
            And put herself into her best array. <lb/>
            Her vows to all th' immortal Gods she sent <lb n="55"/>
            A perfect hecatomb to them to pay, <lb/>
            If Jove be pleas'd her losses to restore. <lb/>
            Telemachus in hand then takes his spear, <lb/>
            And with two dogs at's heels went out a door, <lb/>
            And Pallas made him like a God appear. <lb n="60"/>
            The people all admired him as he came; <lb/>
            The suitors all about him gathered, <lb/>
            And spake him fair, while in their hearts they frame <lb/>
            Plots and devices how his blood to shed. <lb/>
            But he his seat amongst them quickly quits, <lb n="65"/>
            To Mentor and his father's ancient friends, <lb/>
            Altherses, Antephus, with them he sits, <lb/>
            And there the time discoursing with them spends. <lb/>
            Piræus not long after cometh in, <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>

            Then, said Piræus to Telemachus, <lb/>

            No, said Telemachus, let them yet stay, <lb/>

            If th' wooers kill me and my goods divide, <lb/>

            Then send them, and I'll take them joyfully. <lb/>
            And brought away the stranger with him home. <lb/>
            And by-and-bye the suitors thither hie; <lb/>
            And when they all into the house were come, <lb/>
            On couches and on chairs their cloaks they lay, <lb n="85"/>
            And presently into their baths they go; <lb/>
            And bath'd and oil'd, again themselves array, <lb/>
            And sat them down. And supper ready now, <lb/>
            A maid then water in a golden ewer <lb/>
            To wash their hands over a basin brings; <lb n="90"/>
            The basin also was of silver pure. <lb/>
            Another on the tables lays good things, <lb/>
            That in her keeping were, and sets on bread. <lb/>
            Penelope sat spinning in the door. <lb/>
            And then they heartily fell to and fed; <lb n="95"/>
            And when desire of meat and drink was o'er, <lb/>
            Unto her son Penelope then spake: <lb/>
            I will, said she, upon my bed lie down, <lb/>
            Though there I ever weeping lie awake, <lb/>
            Since he went with Atrides to Troy town, <lb n="100"/>
            Since you would not vouchsafe to let me know <lb/>
            The news you heard, before these men came in. <lb/>
            Mother, said he, the truth I'll tell you now; <lb/>
            We went to Pyle; and Nestor we have seen; <lb/>
            And lovingly we entertained were. <lb n="105"/>
            For as a father entertains his son <lb/>
            Come home from far, so were we treated there, <lb/>
            And welcome to his children every one. <lb/>
            But that Ulysses was alive or dead, <lb/>
            He met with no man that could tell him true. <lb n="110"/>
            But us to go to Sparta counselled, <lb/>
            And said, if any, Menelaus knew; <lb/>
            And us with coach and horses did provide, <lb/>
            (Where we saw Helen, bane of Greece and Troy.) <lb/>
            He also sent his son with us for guide, <lb n="115"/>
            And thither come, receiv'd we were with joy. <lb/>
            Atrides of my coming ask'd the reason. <lb/>
            I told him all the truth. He answer'd then, <lb/>

            Oh ! that the Gods Apollo, Pallas, Jove, <lb/>

            Such as when with Philomelide he strove, <lb/>
            And threw him flat, and made the Argives glad. <lb/>
            If such, Ulysses once amongst them were, <lb n="130"/>
            Short would their lives be, and their wedding bed. <lb/>
            But of the matter whereof you inquire, <lb/>
            On my knowledge I can nothing say, <lb/>
            Nor will with rash conjectures you beguile. <lb/>
            I told was, with Calypso he doth stay, <lb n="135"/>
            (By Proteus, an old sea-God,) in an isle, <lb/>
            And would come home, but wants both ship and men <lb/>
            To pass him o'er the broad back of the main. <lb/>
            This said, we took our leaves; a fair gale then <lb/>
            Quickly convey'd us o'er the liquid plain. <lb n="140"/>
            After Telemachus had spoken thus, <lb/>
            Penelope her heart was ill at ease. <lb/>
            And then spake to her Theoclymenus: <lb/>
            Wife of Ulysses Laertiades, <lb/>
            This man, said he, knows not; hear met for I <lb n="145"/>
            Jove's mind foresee. Jove first, and then the ghost <lb/>
            That takes the care of this bless'd family, <lb/>
            And dwelling in it doth maintain the roast, <lb/>
            You know Ulysses is now in this isle, <lb/>
            Sitting or creeping, and observes these wooers, <lb n="150"/>
            What evil deeds they do; and he the while <lb/>
            The destiny contriveth of the doers. <lb/>
            I saw the same at sea by augury, <lb/>
            And said unto Telemachus no less. <lb/>
            Oh ! that the Gods would make it true, said she, <lb n="155"/>
            I'd so reward you that men should you bless. <lb/>
            While they together thus within discourse, <lb/>
            The suitors were gone out to throw the stone <lb/>
            And darts upon the green before the doors, <lb/>
            As they at other times before had done. <lb n="160"/>
            Now supper-time drew near. Sheep home were brought <lb/>
            From ev'ry field. Then Medon to them spake, <lb/>
            Who 'mongst the suitors had most favours got; <lb/>
            Come in, says he, and care of supper take, <lb/>
            For of these games, I see you have your fill. <lb n="165"/>
            In supping early damage there is none. <lb/>
            Agreed they were; none thought the motion ill. <lb/>
            They then into the hall went every one. <lb/>
            On couches and on chairs their cloaks they throw. <lb/>

            Meanwhile, Eumæus to the city hies, <lb/>
            Ulysses with him, to whom thus he said: <lb/>
            Come, father, let us to the city go, <lb/>
            Since 'tis my master's will. You should have staid, <lb n="175"/>
            If my advice you would have harkened to. <lb/>
            But the commands of masters are severe; <lb/>
            The time o' th' day already is much spent, <lb/>

            I fear, ere it be night you will repent. <lb n="180"/>

            Only of rugged way I am afraid; <lb/>
            Give me a good strong staff to lean upon. <lb/>

            Given he had a great staff to his mind, <lb/>
            And they two to the town together go, <lb/>
            Leaving the swincherds and the dogs behind. <lb/>
            Ulysses like a beggar old and lame, <lb/>
            And all his raiment ragged was and wretched. <lb n="190"/>
            But when they near unto the fountain came <lb/>
            From which the citizens their water fetched, <lb/>
            The fountain sweetly streaming and well made <lb/>
            B' Ithacus Neritus, Polector, kings, <lb/>
            That flieth from a high and chilling shade, <lb n="195"/>
            Where in a poplar grove arise the springs, <lb/>
            And there an altar is, and on the same <lb/>
            The passengers to th' nymphs pay offerings. <lb/>
            When we were there, Melanthus to us came, <lb/>
            And goats, the fattest of his herds, he brings. <lb n="200"/>
            Whither now goest thou with this beggar here? <lb/>
            This trouble-feast, who begging scraps and snuffs, <lb/>
            Not swords and kettles, many blows shall bear <lb/>
            Of flying footstools, and get many cuffs. <lb/>
            Would thou wouldst give him me, my lodge to keep, <lb n="205"/>
            And lead my goats afield with a green bough, <lb/>
            And live on whey, and my goat houses sweep, <lb/>
            And his great knee unto to such service bow. <lb/>
            But hang him, he has such a custom got <lb/>
            Of idleness, with begging of his food, <lb n="210"/>
            That labour for his living he will not. <lb/>
            But this I tell you, and'twill be made good: <lb/>
            When he within Ulysses' house appears, <lb/>
            Many a footstool in the hall will fly <lb/>
            From out the suitors' hands about his ears. <lb n="215"/>
            This said, he pass'd, and kick'd him going by; <lb/>
            Ulysses still stood firm upon the path, <lb/>
            Thinking to strike him with his great staff dead, <lb/>
            Or otherwise to kill him in his wrath. <pb n="470"/>

            But in the end his wrath he conquered. <lb n="220"/>
            Eumæus then held up his hands and prayed: <lb/>

            If the fat gifts here by Ulysses laid <lb/>
            Upon your altars were receiv'd with love, <lb/>
            Grant that he may come safely home again, <lb n="225"/>
            By some good spirit to his house conveyed. <lb/>
            Then, (to Melantheus said he,) all in vain <lb/>
            Will be your triumph, and your pride allay'd, <lb/>
            Wherewith you to the suitors daily go; <lb/>
            And knaves remain the cattle to abate. <lb n="230"/>
            Then said Melantheus again, 0 ho! <lb/>
            How boldly does this dog, this rascal prate! <lb/>
            Whom one day I shall from hence ship away, <lb/>
            And make of him somewhere abroad good gain. <lb/>
            Would th' wooers, or Phœbus, but as surely slay <lb n="235"/>
            The son, as 'tis t' expect his father vain. <lb/>
            When this was said, away he went apace, <lb/>
            And coming to the suitors in the hall, <lb/>
            Against Eurymachus he took his place, <lb/>
            Whom best he loved of the suitors all. <lb n="240"/>
            And there the waiters set before him meat; <lb/>
            The women of the pantry brought him bread. <lb/>
            Ulysses and Eumæus were not yet <lb/>
            Arriv'd, but near, for close they followed, <lb/>
            And of the fiddle they could hear the din. <lb n="245"/>
            Ulysses said unto Eumæus then: <lb/>
            'Tis a fine house Ulysses dwelled in, <lb/>
            And easly known from those of other men; <lb/>
            The court with wall and hedge is fenced strong, <lb/>
            Having strong gates with two locks, great and fast. <lb n="250"/>
            Some feast here is; I hear the sound of song, <lb/>
            And fiddle, which with feast the Gods have plac'd. <lb/>
            Then answered Eumæus, 'Tis well guess'd, <lb/>
            And other things you mark as well as this. <lb/>
            But let us now consider what is best, <lb n="255"/>
            In that which at this time our business is. <lb/>
            Go you in first, and put yourself among <lb/>
            The suitors; or if you think better so, <lb/>
            I'll first go in, but do not you stay long, <lb/>
            Lest you of one or other take a blow. <lb n="260"/>
            I hear, I understand; go you in first; <lb/>
            The seas and wars have taught me patience. <lb/>
            Of all my suff'rings this is not the worst. <lb/>
            Of blows and throws I have experience; <lb/>
            And may the suitors henceforth have the same. <lb n="265"/>
            The belly forceth mortals to much woe; <lb/>
            But there is no force can the belly tame. <lb/>
            It sets the good ship on the sea to go, <lb/>
            Which t' one another evil fortune bears. <lb/>

            Ulysses dog held up his head and ears, <lb/>
            Argus by name, that had been long before <lb/>
            Well look'd to, ere Ulysses went to Troy. <lb/>
            They with him cours'd the wild goat, deer, and hare; <lb/>
            But all the while his master was away, <lb n="275"/>
            The servants of his keeping took no care, <lb/>
            But on the dung before the door he lay, <lb/>
            Which there was heap'd to manure fields and leas, <lb/>
            From many mules and cattle fal'n away. <lb/>
            There lay the old dog Argus, full of fleas; <lb n="280"/>

            And fawned with his tail, but could not rise; <lb/>
            And which Eumæus did not see, the tears <lb/>
            Ready to fall were from Ulysses' eyes. <lb/>
            And then Ulysses to Eumaeus said: <lb n="285"/>
            This is a very well-shap'd dog I see, <lb/>
            'Tis strange to see him on a dunghill laid. <lb/>
            I know not whether also swift he be, <lb/>
            Or for his beauty only was he fed, <lb/>
            As lords make much of dogs for being fine, <lb n="290"/>
            And at their tables see them cherished. <lb/>
            Then answered the master of the swine: <lb/>
            The master of him is of life bereft. <lb/>
            If now he were the same for shape and deed <lb/>
            He then was when Ulysses here him left, <lb n="295"/>
            You'd quickly see he had both strength and speed. <lb/>
            There was no beast he once saw in the wood <lb/>
            That could escape him; for not only swift, <lb/>
            But also at a scent was very good: <lb/>
            But now himself scarce able is to lift; <lb n="300"/>
            For why, his master being dead and gone, <lb/>
            He was not left unto the woman's care; <lb/>
            And when the master is not looking on, <lb/>
            Men-servants of their duty careless are. <lb/>
            For half the virtue taken is away <lb n="305"/>
            Of whosoever is to service tied. <lb/>
            This said, into the house he went his way; <lb/>
            And Argus, having seen his master, died. <lb/>
            Telemachus, the first that saw him enter, <lb/>
            Unto him nodded to come to his seat. <lb n="310"/>
            A chopping-board was near him by adventure; <lb/>
            He took up that, whereon to eat his meat; <lb/>
            And near Telemachus he placed the same. <lb/>
            A waiter sets before him flesh and bread. <lb/>
            And after him Ulysses also came, <lb n="315"/>
            Like an old beggar, torn and tattered; <lb/>
            And said to Eumæus, Give the beggar this, <lb/>

            For modesty to beggars hurtful is. <lb/>
            And then Ulysses to Eumaeus says: <lb n="325"/>

            But still amongst the woo'rs the noise was great. <lb/>
            Then Pallas comes and stands Ulysses by, <lb/>

            Which of them had, which wanted charity, <lb n="335"/>
            Though they the same men would be for all that. <lb/>
            Then rising up, before the first he stands, <lb/>
            And to the right hand onward still he goes <lb/>
            To every one, and holds up both his hands, <lb/>
            Like one that well the art of begging knows. <lb n="340"/>
            They gave him meat, and wonder'd at the man'; <lb/>
            And one another ask'd, Who is't? and whence? <lb/>
            And then Melantheus to speak began: <lb/>
            I saw him, said he, but a little since <lb/>
            Brought hither by the master of the swine. <lb n="345"/>
            But who he is, his kindred, and his place, <lb/>
            It is not in my power to divine. <lb/>
            This said, Antinous in choler was. <lb/>
            Oh, noble master of the swine, said he, <lb/>
            What made you here to introduce this guest ? <lb n="350"/>
            Think you that yet too few the beggars be, <lb/>
            That you must needs invite this trouble-feast, <lb/>
            Your lord's estate the sooner to eat up ? <lb/>
            Good as you are, says he, you say not right: <lb/>
            No man a stranger e'er call'd in to sup, <lb n="355"/>
            And him on no acquaintance did invite, <lb/>
            Unless he were a man that most men need, <lb/>
            Prophet, physician, or armourer, <lb/>
            Or fiddler at a feast; for when men feed <lb/>
            A song doth add delight unto the cheer. <lb n="360"/>
            These use to be invited ev*ry where. <lb/>
            Whoever call'd a beggar in to eat ? <lb/>
            But to the servants you still cruel were, <lb/>
            And of them all you me the worst did treat. <lb/>
            But I care little whilst Penelope <lb n="365"/>
            Alive is, and Telemachus, her son. <lb/>
            Telemachus then bad him silent be. <lb/>
            Eumæus, said he, let him now alone; <lb/>
            He loves to quarrel, and set others on. <lb/>

            Is this as from a father to his son, <lb/>

            I'll never do't. Give him what alms you will, <lb/>

            If thus we all go on to give him meat, <lb/>

            Ulysses with his scrip went to the sill, <lb/>

            And first he tries Antinous his will. <lb/>

            Amongst th' Achæans here to be the best; <lb/>
            For like a king you look, and reason 'twere <lb/>
            You should in bounty exceed all the rest, <lb/>
            And I abroad your goodness will make known. <lb/>
            I could for riches once with most compare, <lb n="390"/>
            And kept a great and free house of my own, <lb/>
            And ask'd what want you, man, not what you are. <lb/>
            And many servants had, and things that pass <lb/>
            For happiness amongst us mortals all, <lb/>
            Till t' Egypt I by knaves persuaded was <lb n="395"/>
            To sail. I' th' Nile we let our anchors fall. <lb/>
            There I my fellows bid aboard to stay <lb/>
            And guard the ships ; and some to places high <lb/>
            I sent to watch. But mov'd by lucre, they <lb/>
            On plunder and on rapine had their eye. <lb n="400"/>
            The fields they waste, and kill the men, and make <lb/>
            Women and children captives. Then the cry <lb/>
            Arriving at the city, arms they take, <lb/>
            And next day early to the fields they hie, <lb/>
            With horse and foot. Then thundered the field, <lb n="405"/>
            Their armour lighten'd. My men frighted were. <lb/>
            Some taken and made slaves, some flying kill'd, <lb/>
            And all the rest ran scatter'd here and there. <lb/>
            To th' king of Cyprus I was made a gift, <lb/>
            Demetor by name, the king of Egypt's guest. <lb n="410"/>
            And to come hither thence, I made hard shift. <lb/>
            Then said Antinous : Stand off you're best. <lb/>
            What devil to molest us sent this rogue <lb/>
            Unmannerly, that with such impudence <lb/>
            To be,, presurneth here, and to eclogue ? <lb n="415"/>
            Stand off. Or ill at ease I'll send you hence. <lb/>
            They that have given have done foolishly, <lb/>

            Shaking his head with vengeance in his thought. <lb/>

            A man, said he, not much is griev'd, a blow <lb/>
            In fighting for his kine or sheep to take; <lb n="435"/>

            If any care the Gods of poor men have, <lb/>
            Antinous, before he married be, <lb/>
            Is like enough to go into his grave. <lb/>

            The servants bawl and drag you out o' th' gate, <lb/>

            At this the rest all discontented sate, <lb/>
            And one among the rest unto him said, <lb n="445"/>
            Antinous, it was unjustly done <lb/>
            To use a stranger so. The Gods, array'd <lb/>
            In poor men's habits, men's deeds look upon, <lb/>
            And notice take, who well does, and who ill. <lb/>

            For what was done, but did no tear distil, <lb/>
            But shook his head, and hoped to make them smart. <lb/>

            Apollo strike him to the heart, said she. <lb/>
            If I my wish had, said Eurynome, <lb n="455"/>
            No suitor of them all the morn should see. <lb/>
            Then said Penelope again, 'Tis true, <lb/>
            They all be enemies, and mean us evil; <lb/>
            But he the fiercest is of all the crew, <lb/>
            And rageth in the house like any devil. <lb n="460"/>

            But he a footstool throweth at his head. <lb/>
            While she thus and her women talking were, <lb n="465"/>
            Ulysses supping sat upon the sill. <lb/>
            I fain, said she, would have the beggar here. <lb/>
            Fetch him, Eumæus, talk with him I will; <lb/>
            I'll ask him if Ulysses he has seen, <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            For many men and cities knoweth he. <note type="margin"> LIB. XVII. </note><note type="margin"> Telemacho. <lb/>

            Pyle and Sparta. </note> <lb n="470"/>
            Eumæus then made answer to the queen ; <lb/>
            If once the suitors would but silent be, <lb/>
            You would be pleas'd his history to hear. <lb/>
            Three days and nights he staid with me an end; <lb/>
            And of his suff'rings much he told me there, <lb n="475"/>
            When new arriv'd; but came not to the end. <lb/>
            As when a man that knows the art of song, <lb/>
            Sings lovely words, with sweet and well-tun'd voice, <lb/>
            The man that hears him thinks not the time long; <lb/>
            So I, in his strange story did rejoice. <lb n="480"/>
            He said Ulysses was his father's guest, <lb/>
            In th' isle of Crete, where reigneth Minos' race. <lb/>
            Himself, he said, with many woes oppressed, <lb/>
            The fates, at last, him tumbled to this place. <lb/>
            And that he heard Ulysses is hard by, <lb n="485"/>
            And that into Thesprotia he's come, <lb/>
            Alive and well; enriched mightily <lb/>
            With treasure which he now is bringing home. <lb/>
            Then said Penelope: Go, call me hither <lb/>
            The beggar. I myself will ask him all: <lb n="490"/>
            And meanwhile let the suitors chat together <lb/>
            Where they think best, without or in the hall; <lb/>
            For merry they must be, since they feed here, <lb/>
            And their own corn and wine and cattle save, <lb/>
            And with our cattle make themselves good cheer, <lb n="495"/>
            And on our corn and wine no mercy have; <lb/>
            For such as was Ulysses here is none, <lb/>
            That should defend us from their injuries; <lb/>
            But were he hither come, he, and his son, <lb/>
            Would bring destruction on these enemies. <lb n="500"/>
            This said, it chanced Telemachus to sneeze. <lb/>
            She laugh'd, and for the beggar calls agen. <lb/>
            You see, Eumæus, Jove with me agrees, <lb/>
            And certainly slain shall be all these men. <lb/>
            Go call the beggar, and say this from me, <lb n="505"/>
            If I find true what he shall to me say, <lb/>
            He shall with coat and vest rewarded be. <lb/>
            Eumseus to the beggar went his way; <lb/>
            And when he near him was, Father, said he, <lb/>
            Penelope desires to speak with you; <lb n="510"/>
            About Ulysses she inform'd would be, <lb/>
            And said, if she find all you say be true, <lb/>
            She clothe you will with a fair coat and vest, <lb/>
            Which you stand most in need of. But for food, <lb/>
            By begging in the town you'll get it best, <lb n="515"/>
            Where they relieve you will that shall think good. <lb/>
            Ulysses to Eumæus answered: <lb/>
            Penelope I quickly can inform, <lb/>
            For he and I have jointly suffered. <pb n="476"/>

            But from the suitors I much fear a storm; <lb n="520"/>
            Their insolence is known up to the sky; <lb/>
            Just now a footstool one threw at my head, <lb/>
            When given him no cause at all had I, <lb/>
            Nor could I by her son be succoured. <lb/>
            Therefore entreat Penelope to stay <lb n="525"/>
            Until the sun be set and suitors gone, <lb/>

            And came without him to Penelope. <lb n="530"/>
            How now, said she, does he to come refuse ? <lb/>
            They that are bashful but ill beggars be. <lb/>

            Fearing some danger from the wooers to meet; <lb n="535"/>
            And for you also then 'twill best be done. <lb/>
            I see, quoth she, the stranger wants not wit, <lb/>
            For in the world never so many men <lb/>
            Contriving mischief did together sit. <lb/>
            So said Penelope. Eumæus then <lb n="540"/>
            Went down and put himself into the throng, <lb/>
            And to Telemachus said in his ear: <lb/>
            I have been absent from my swine too long; <lb/>
            I go, and to your care leave all things here, <lb/>
            And chiefly of your life to have a care ; <lb n="545"/>
            Many there are that bear you evil mind, <lb/>
            And how to take your life contriving are, <lb/>
            But may they first their own destruction find. <lb/>
            Then said Telemachus, And so 'twill be. <lb/>
            Farewell. But I advise you first to dine; <lb n="550"/>
            The bus'ness here leave to the Gods and me. <lb/>
            Then din'd he, and went back unto his swine, <lb/>
            Next morning with more victims to return. <lb/>
            And full he left the hall and court with men, <lb/>
            Who there themselves to song and dancing turn, <lb n="555"/>
            For less than half the day remained then.</p>

            The man to see to was both great and tall, <lb/>
            Though but a lither fellow. Down he sate <lb/>
            Boldly within the porch before the hall. <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            He had a greedy gut, and named was <note type="margin"> LIB. XVIII. </note><note type="margin"> Amphinomus. <lb/>

            and draws pre. <lb/>
            sents from them. </note> <lb n="5"/>
            At first Arnæus, then Irus; for he went <lb/>
            On errands oft, whenever there was cause. <lb/>
            The wooers' favour made him insolent; <lb/>
            This beggar thought to drive Ulysses thence. <lb/>
            Dost see those princes how they wink at me, <lb n="10"/>
            And by the heels would have me pluck thee hence? <lb/>
            Though to do that I should ashamed be. <lb/>
            Go from the door, old man, lest I should do it. <lb/>
            Up therefore quickly, and be gone; arise, <lb/>
            Before that with my fists I force you to it. <lb n="15"/>
            Ulysses frowning, nnswer'd in this wise: <lb/>
            Strange man, I neither do thee harm, nor say <lb/>
            Thee any ill. Here's room for thee and me. <lb/>
            I do not envy you the meat which they <lb/>
            Shall give you here, how much soe'er it be. <lb n="20"/>
            Envy not other men; I think you are <lb/>
            As well as I, a beggar; but forbear <lb/>
            To threaten me too much. You're best beware, <lb/>
            Old as I am, lest I your lips besmear <lb/>
            And breast with blood, and so have better room. <lb n="25"/>
            . For to Ulysses' house rm confident <lb/>
            Thou never wilt be able more to come. <lb/>
            This made the beggar more impatient; <lb/>
            0, says he, how the rascal prates! Twere well <lb/>
            To beat the rascal's teeth out, while his tongue <lb n="30"/>
            Thus runs on wheels, till to the ground they fell. <lb/>
            Let these see fight the old man with the young. <lb/>
            Whilst in great heat they quarrell'd at the door, <lb/>
            They by Antinous observed were, <lb/>
            Who, laughing, said: There never came before <lb n="35"/>
            Such sport to th' house. The beggars standing there <lb/>
            Will go to cuffs; I pray let's hold them to it. <lb/>
            Then up they start, and round about them stand. <lb/>
            There are o' th' fire good puddings full of suet, <lb/>
            Of these, let him that conquers lay his hand <lb n="40"/>
            On which he will; (so said Antinous); <lb/>
            And have the privilege, and none but he, <lb/>
            To beg within the porch before the house, <lb/>
            And of our talk at meat a hearer be. <lb/>
            The motion pleased; and then Ulysses spoke: <lb n="45"/>
            The match is hard, an old man 'gainst a younger; <lb/>
            Yet this my belly bids me undertake. <lb/>
            And I'm acquainted more with blows than hunger. <lb/>
            But I must first entreat you all to swear <lb/>
            Not to help Irus, nor a heavy hand <lb n="50"/>
            To lay on me, but both of us forbear, <lb/>
            And justly 'twixt us both as neuters stand. <lb/>
            When all had sworn, then said Telemachus, <lb/>
            Stranger, if thou dare combat with this man <pb n="478"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XVIII. </note><note type="margin"> The fighting at <lb/>

            None else shall do thee hurt. Antinous, <lb n="55"/>
            Eurymachus, and I, defend you can. <lb/>
            This said, Ulysses cover'd kept his gear, <lb/>
            But shew'd his shoulders wide, and his strong thighs. <lb/>
            His large breast and his brawny arms appear; <lb/>
            And Pallas standing by, enlarg'd his size. <lb n="60"/>
            At which the suitors greatly wondered, <lb/>
            And one unto another softly said, <lb/>
            Irus has pull'd an old house on his head. <lb/>
            And Irus then was mightily afraid; <lb/>
            But yet by force the servants brought him out, <lb n="65"/>
            His flesh still trembling on his limbs with fear. <lb/>
            Show not thyself a coward and a lout, <lb/>
            Nor fear a man worn out with many a year; <lb/>
            For if he get the better, thou shalt go <lb/>
            Unto king Takim, and there by his law <lb n="70"/>
            Thy nose and ears, and privy parts also, <lb/>
            Shall be cut off, and dogs shall eat them raw. <lb/>
            This made him quake more yet. Into the lists <lb/>
            They brought him so. Both ready were to fight. <lb/>
            Ulysses then thought how to use his fists, <lb n="75"/>
            Whether to beat him down or kill him quite; <lb/>
            But not t'offend the suitors, thought it best <lb/>
            To strike him gently. And when they were near <lb/>
            Irus did hit Ulysses on the breast; <lb/>
            Ulysses Irus struck just under th'ear. <lb n="80"/>
            He broke the bones, at's mouth the blood gush'd out. <lb/>
            He fell, squeak'd, shed his teeth. The suitors were <lb/>
            With laughter almost dead, that stood about. <lb/>
            Ulysses dragg'd him to the utter gate, <lb/>
            And set him to the hedge, as 'twere a sign, <lb n="85"/>
            And put a staff in's hand. As there he sate, <lb/>
            Ulysses bade him keep out dogs and swine. <lb/>
            Think not thyself, quoth he, of beggars king <lb/>
            (That art a very wretch) and wandering souls. <lb/>
            This said, o’er’s head he threw the twisted string <lb n="90"/>
            By which his scrip hung, ragg'd and full of holes. <lb/>
            Then sat him down i' th' porch. The suitors enter <lb/>
            All laughing in, and as they passed by <lb/>
            Greatly congratulated his adventure. <lb/>
            Stranger, said they, Jove and the Gods on high, <lb n="95"/>
            Grant thee whatever thou shalt most desire, <lb/>
            That hast relieved us from the rascal there. <lb/>
            We'll send him to king Takim in Epire. <lb/>
            And glad Ulysses was his praise to hear. <lb/>
            Antinous a haggas brought, filled up <lb n="100"/>
            With fat and blood, and to't Ampbinomus <lb/>
            Two loaves of bread, and with't a gilded cup <lb/>
            Of lusty wine, and said unto him thus: <lb/>
            Hail, father, stranger, rich and happy be <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            As ere you were; though many miseries <note type="margin"> LIB. XVIII. </note><note type="margin"> His admonition <lb/>
            to Amphinomua. </note> <lb n="105"/>
            Oppress you now. He answer d him: I see <lb/>
            Amphinomus, you prudent are and wise; <lb/>
            So was your father. Nisus was his name, <lb/>
            Prince of Dulichium, both rich and wise. <lb/>
            You are his son, as I am told by fame; <lb n="110"/>
            Therefore I will a little you advise. <lb/>
            There's not a weaker creature lives o'th' ground, <lb/>
            Or goes, or creeps upon it, than a man; <lb/>
            Who whilst he's strong, and all his limbs are sound, <lb/>
            He makes account that fail he never can ; <lb n="115"/>
            But when the Gods shall have decreed him woe, <lb/>
            He less endures it than another can. <lb/>
            Such is the nature Jove has assigned to <lb/>
            This weak and short-liv'd creature called man. <lb/>
            For I myself was rich, and lived in <lb n="120"/>
            Great plenty, and was very insolent; <lb/>
            Bold on my strength, my father, and my kin, <lb/>
            Therefore let no man be too confident, <lb/>
            But rather quietly God's gifts enjoy. <lb/>
            These suitors here bring this into my mind, <lb n="125"/>
            Who of an absent man the goods destroy, <lb/>
            And that at last unto their cost they'll find. <lb/>
            For this I tell you (mark well what I say), <lb/>
            That he will soon, nay, very quickly come; <lb/>
            And that will be to some a heavy day. <lb n="130"/>
            Pray God that at his coming you keep home. <lb/>
            This said, he drank, and to Amphinomus <lb/>
            Returned the cup, who shook his head in vain; <lb/>
            For not long after by Telemachus <lb/>
            Amongst the rest of the wooers he was slain. <lb n="135"/>
            Then Pallas puts Penelope in mind <lb/>
            T' appear unto the wooers, that she might <lb/>
            Before her son and husband honour find, <lb/>
            And further bring the suitors' thoughts to light. <lb/>
            Penelope then laugh'd, not knowing why. <lb n="140"/>
            Eurynome, said she, my mind says, go <lb/>
            And show yourself before the company; <lb/>
            Which heretofore I never thought to do. <lb/>
            I hate them, yet I mean to go to th' door, <lb/>
            And bid my son their company to shun, <lb n="145"/>
            And mix himself with those ill men no more. <lb/>
            Dear child, said the old woman, 'tis well done. <lb/>
            Go tell him whatsoever you think fit, <lb/>
            But wash away the tears first from your eyes, <lb/>
            And 'noint your cheeks; they must sometimes remit <lb n="150"/>
            And hide their grief, that will be counted wise. <lb/>
            You have your wish, your son now is a man. <lb/>
            Penelope then answered her again; <lb/>
            Restored be my beauty never can: <pb n="480"/>

            'Nointing and washing now are all in vain. <lb n="155"/>
            The Gods, Eurynome, then took away <lb/>
            All beauty from me when Ulysses went <lb/>
            With Agamemnon to the siege of Troy; <lb/>
            Such words afford me now but small content. <lb/>
            Call Hippodamia and Autonoe; <lb n="160"/>
            For why, I am asham'd myself alone <lb/>
            Amongst so many men in sight to be: <lb/>
            They shall go with me, on each side me one. <lb/>
            But when th' old woman was gone out, and staid, <lb/>
            Then Pallas pour'd sweet sleep upon her eyes, <lb n="165"/>
            And on her face a greater beauty laid, <lb/>
            And also made her limbs of larger size, <lb/>
            And whiter than the purest ivory. <lb/>
            Having so done, the Goddess rose to th' skies. <lb/>
            Her maidens coming made a noise, and she <lb n="170"/>
            Awak'd, and with her hand she strok'd her eyes. <lb/>
            I've had, said she, a very gentle sleep; <lb/>
            0 that Diana such a gentle death <lb/>

            Sorrow for my dear husband, best of all <lb/>

            She goes to th' porch before the door of th' hall <lb/>
            With her two maids; she would not go alone; <lb/>
            And so stood at the door within their sight, <lb n="180"/>
            But with her scarf her cheeks a little shaded. <lb/>
            A maid stood at her left hand and her right. <lb/>
            When she appeared Love all their hearts invaded. <lb/>
            Her speech then to Telemachus she addressed: <lb/>
            Telemachus, said she, your wit's less now <lb n="185"/>
            Than when you were a boy. 'Twas then at best; <lb/>
            And backward more and more it seems to grow. <lb/>
            You now are tall, and come to man's estate, <lb/>
            And counted are the best men's sons among. <lb/>
            Of your discretion you begin t' abate; <lb n="190"/>
            Why else dye let your stranger suffer wrong ? <lb/>
            If you your guests thus treat, what think you, can <lb/>
            Men say of you that's good or honourable ? <lb/>
            You'll be reproach'd and scorn'd of every man, <lb/>
            And taken for a man unhospitable. <lb n="195"/>
            Mother, said he, you well may angry be; <lb/>
            And yet I better know what's good and ill <lb/>
            Than heretofore. But these men hinder me; <lb/>
            I cannot without help do all I will. <lb/>
            The quarrel 'twixt my guest and Irus was <lb n="200"/>
            None of the suitors' act; by chance it rose, <lb/>
            As they sate begging, from some other cause, <lb/>
            And Irus only bare away the blows. <lb/>
            O Jupiter, I wish, and all the Gods, <lb/>

            Should see you now, more suitors you'd have here <lb/>

            No, no, said she; for when Ulysses went <lb/>
            With th' Argive princes to the war of Troy, <lb/>
            The immortal Gods took from me my content, <lb/>

            I should more honour have and beauty so. <lb/>
            But now I lead my life in misery; <lb/>
            The Gods some evil on me daily throw. <lb/>
            My husband, when he parted hence to fight <lb/>
            For Agamemnon 'gainst the Trojans, laid <lb n="225"/>
            At taking leave on my left hand his right, <lb/>

            Over the sea unto the siege of Troy <lb/>
            Shall all come safe away. The Trojans know <lb n="230"/>
            How t' use the dart and bow too, as men say, <lb/>
            And are good horsemen also, and can see <lb/>

            Therefore I know not what my luck will be, <lb/>
            Either to come again, or to be kill'd. <lb n="235"/>
            My father and my mother I therefore <lb/>
            To you commend, to see them cherished, <lb/>
            As they are now, or (in my absence) more; <lb/>

            Take whom yourself like best, and leave this house. <lb n="240"/>
            This said, he parts. Ay me, the time is come <lb/>
            I must embrace a marriage odious, <lb/>
            And I must leave this my most blessed home. <lb/>
            Suitors were wont, when they a woman woo’d <lb/>

            And with Antinous they all agree, <lb n="260"/>
            Who her presented with a fair, large, rich <lb/>
            And divers coloured robe, with four times three <lb/>
            Buckles of pure and beaten gold, and which <lb/>
            As many clasps of gold had joined fit. <lb/>
            Eurymachus his present was a chain <lb n="265"/>
            Of gold and amber-beads alternate ; it <lb/>
            Shin'd bright as is the sun-shine after rain. <lb/>
            Eurydamas two pendants gave, of which <lb/>
            Each had three gems, and polished very bright, <lb/>
            And both for art and workmanship were rich, <lb n="270"/>
            Reflecting to the eye a lovely light. <lb/>
            Pysandrus, son of Polycterides, <lb/>
            Gave her a costly necklace. All the rest <lb/>
            With some good gift endeavoured to please <lb/>
            The fair and wise Penelope the best. <lb n="275"/>
            This done, unto her chamber up she went <lb/>
            With her two maids, that did her presents carry. <lb/>
            Th' woo'rs with dancing and with merriment, <lb/>
            (Their wonted pastime) for the ev'ning tarry. <lb/>
            The ev'ning came, and then the lamps were lighted, <lb n="280"/>
            And torches, and the fir-staves long lain dry, <lb/>
            Which to that purpose had with tools been fitted, <lb/>
            And ready lay to light the company. <lb/>
            The lights the maids took up by turns and bore them. <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses, Maidens, if you please, <lb n="285"/>
            To save your pains, I'll bear the light before them; <lb/>
            I'm us'd to labour, and can do't with ease, <lb/>
            Though they should stay and sit up till to-morrow: <lb/>
            You may go up unto the queen, and there <lb/>
            Sit and spin with her, and divert her sorrow. <lb n="290"/>
            At this the wenches 'gan to laugh and jeer; <lb/>
            And one of them, Melantho, him revil'd <lb/>
            With bitter words. Her father Dolius hight. <lb/>
            Penelope did treat her as her child, <lb/>
            And in her company did take delight; <lb n="295"/>
            But yet she could not put away her grief. <lb/>
            The wench was fair, and too familiar was <lb/>
            With prince Eurymachus, one of the chief <lb/>
            Of all her suitors. And this woman 'twas. <lb/>
            And thus she said: Sure, stranger, thou art mad, <lb n="300"/>
            That wilt not here nor elsewhere go to bed; <lb/>
            Is it because thou too much wine hast had ? <lb/>
            Or is't a humour in thy nature bred, <lb/>

            Have made thee wild; a better man than he <lb/>
            May chance to send thee hence with bloody chaps. <lb/>
            Ulysses, looking sourly, answered, <lb/>
            You bitch, Telemachus shall straightway know <lb/>
            These words; he'll cause thee to be tortured. <lb n="310"/>
            They, fearing he would do't, away they go. <lb/>
            Ulysses ready stood to take in hand <lb/>
            A torch when bidden ; casting in his mind <lb/>
            How he might safely carry on the grand <lb/>
            Mischief against the woo'rs he had design'd. <lb n="315"/>
            And Pallas yet not suffered them to keep <lb/>
            Themselves in any bounds of modesty, <lb/>
            But fix Ulysses' anger yet more deep. <lb/>
            Eurymachus then said to th' standers by, <lb/>
            To make them laugh, Ulysses to disgrace, <lb n="320"/>
            Hear, sirs, I pray, what now comes in my thought. <lb/>
            The man comes opportunely to this place; <lb/>
            'Tis sure some God that him has hither brought <lb/>
            To give us greater light; for from his head <lb/>
            Methinks I see arise another flame <lb n="325"/>
            Besides the flame the torch gives, and so spread <lb/>
            Upon his bald pate doubled has the same. <lb/>
            Then says t' Ulysses, Man, wilt thou serve me, <lb/>
            To pluck up thorns and briars, and trees to plant ? <lb/>
            Thou shalt have meat enough, and clothes, and fee, <lb n="330"/>
            And shoes, and whatsoever thou shalt want. <lb/>
            But, since thou hast been us'd to idleness, <lb/>
            I doubt thou ne'er wilt labour any more, <lb/>
            But rather feed thy carcass labourless, <lb/>
            And wand'ring choose to beg from door to door. <lb n="335"/>
            This said, Ulysses answer'd him again: <lb/>
            Eurymachus, if we two were to try <lb/>
            Our labour, in a large green meadow, when <lb/>
            The days are long, the weather hot and dry, <lb/>
            With equal scythes from morning unto night; <lb n="340"/>
            Or with two equal oxen fed and strong <lb/>
            Were fasting put to plough, to try our might <lb/>
            Which of us labour could endure most long; <lb/>
            Or if an enemy to-day should land, <lb/>
            And I a helmet had fit for my head, <lb n="345"/>
            And target, and two fit spears for my hand, <lb/>
            Then you should see whether I fought or fled, <lb/>
            And not reproach m' of sloth or poverty. <lb/>
            You are too cruel, and you do me wrong, <lb/>
            And think yourself a man of might to be, <lb n="350"/>
            Because they weaker are you live among. <lb/>
            But should Ulysses come and find you here, <lb/>
            You'd think the door, though it be very wide, <lb/>
            As you are running out, too narrow were, <note type="footnote"> II 2 </note> <pb n="484"/>

            So glad you'ld be your heads to save or hide. <lb n="355"/>
            To this Eurymachus with bended brow, <lb/>
            And furious eye, answer'd, Wretch that thou art, <lb/>
            And dar'st so saucily to prate. How now ! <lb/>
            'Twill not be long before I make thee smart. <lb/>
            Is it because thou too much wine hast had ? <lb n="360"/>
            Or is't thy nature always to be bold ? <lb/>
            Or is't t' have beaten Irus makes thee mad ? <lb/>
            This said, upon a footstool he laid hold, <lb/>
            And threw it at him, but it hit him not. <lb/>
            Ulysses sunk on's knees, the stool flew o'er <lb n="365"/>
            His head, and a cup-bearer next him smote <lb/>
            On the right hand, and down he falls o' th' floor. <lb/>
            Much the disorder then was in the room. <lb/>
            And one unto another next him said, <lb/>
            I would this beggar hither had not come, <lb n="370"/>
            But somewhere else before had perished. <lb/>
            For what ado about a beggar's here ! <lb/>
            The pleasure of our dinner all is lost. <lb/>
            Then, said Telemachus, Can you not bear, <lb/>
            Madmen, your wine and cheer both boil'd and roast ? <lb n="375"/>
            When fill'd, why do you not go home and sleep ? <lb/>
            Go when you will, I drive you not away. <lb/>
            The suitors at this boldness bit the lip, <lb/>
            And thought it strange, but yet did nothing say. <lb/>
            Then, said Amphinomus, Let's not fall out <lb n="380"/>
            With any man for speaking truth, nor be <lb/>
            Rude and unkind. Cup-bearers, bear about <lb/>
            To every man the cup of charity; <lb/>
            And so go each man home, for now 'tis late <lb/>
            (Leaving the stranger with Telemachus, <lb n="385"/>
            Whose guest he is), and ourselves recreate <lb/>
            With gentle sleep, each one in his own house. <lb/>
            Then Meleus to each man presents a cup, <lb/>
            Whereof unto the Gods they offer'd part. <lb/>
            When this was done each one his wine drank up, <lb n="390"/>
            And then unto their houses they depart.</p>

            You thought the counsel would not be unwise <lb/>
            To take them thence. One drawn sword draws another. <lb/>
            Telemachus then calls his nurse, and said, <lb/>
            Euryclea, shut all the rooms up fast. <lb/>
            Be sure to keep within door every maid, <lb n="15"/>

            To see your husbandry. But I would know <lb/>
            Who 'tis shall light you when the maids are fast? <lb n="20"/>
            My guest, says he, this stranger whom you see. <lb/>
            For here he feeds, and nothing has to do; <lb/>
            How far soever hence his dwelling be, <lb/>
            I think 'tis reason he should help me too. <lb/>
            The nurse did what commanded she had been. <lb n="25"/>
            They laid up helmets, bucklers, swords, and spears; <lb/>
            And Pallas with a lamp came in unseen, <lb/>
            And up and down the light before them bears. <lb/>
            Then, Father, said Telemachus, I see <lb/>
            The walls, beams, roof, and all the pillars shine, <lb n="30"/>
            Like any fire; and certainly there be <lb/>

            Peace, said Ulysses, be not curious, <lb/>
            The purpose of the Gods you cannot find. <lb/>
            Go you to bed. I must go through the house, <lb n="35"/>
            To find the women's and your mother's mind. <lb/>
            Telemachus then to his chamber went, <lb/>
            In which before he wonted was to lie, <lb/>
            Leaving his father in the house, intent <lb/>

            Forth comes Penelope into the hall, <lb/>
            More than Diana, more than Venus fair; <lb/>
            Her maids upon her were attending all, <lb/>

            What they are doing ? an't, may be, hast the will <lb/>
            To stay all night. Go quickly; get thee gone; <lb/>
            T'hast supp'd; lest thou be driven out of door <lb/>
            With brands of fire. To this new insolence, <lb/>
            Ulysses answered gentlier than before: <lb n="60"/>
            Why d' ye pursue me thus ? Is it because <lb/>
            I am not fine, but have ill raiment on ? <lb/>
            The time has been I rich and wealthy was, <lb/>
            And beggars I did much bestow upon; <lb/>
            Not looking on the men, but on their want: <lb n="65"/>
            And many servants had. Of that which makes <lb/>
            Men called rich, I knew not any scant. <lb/>
            But Jove not only riches gives, but takes; <lb/>
            Think, therefore, that your beauty will decay; <lb/>
            Or of your mistress you may lose the grace; <lb n="70"/>
            Or that Ulysses may come back one day: <lb/>
            And though he ne'er return unto his place, <lb/>
            His son, Telemachus, knows all you do, <lb/>
            Knows better now what 's good, and what is worse. <lb/>
            Then be hereafter modester: go to. <lb n="75"/>
            Penelope o'erheard all this discourse. <lb/>
            Bold bitch, said she, I know what deeds you* ve done, <lb/>
            Which thou shalt one day pay for with thy head: <lb/>
            Did not I tell thee when the woo'rs were gone, <lb/>
            That I to speak with him had ordered ? <lb n="80"/>
            Eurynome, I've much to say, said she, <lb/>
            Unto this man; set here a chair, that so, <lb/>
            Sitting, I may hear him, and he hear me; <lb/>
            For there are many things I'd from him know. <lb/>
            Ulysses sat. Penelope began: <lb n="85"/>
            The question I will ask you first, is this; <lb/>
            What is your name, and who your parents be; <lb/>
            And, further, tell me where your country is? <lb/>
            When she had said, Ulysses thus replies: <lb/>
            0 queen, through all the world your praises ring, <lb n="90"/>
            Your virtues known are up unto the skies; <lb/>
            No less than of some great and happy king, <lb/>
            That maintains justice, and whose fertile ground <lb/>
            Bears store of wheat and barley, and whose trees <lb/>
            Are charg'd with fruit, and all his sheep stand sound, <lb n="95"/>
            And under him a valiant people sees. <lb/>
            And, therefore, ask me what you will beside, <lb/>
            My kin and country to myself I'd keep. <lb/>
            For then my grief I can no longer hide, <lb/>
            Or think thereon, but ready am to weep; <lb n="100"/>
            Which here would be no seemly thing to do, <lb/>
            For why, your maids might, peradventure, think, <lb/>
            And you yourself, it may be, think so too, <lb/>
            My tears came not from sorrow, but from drink. <lb/>
             <pb n="487"/>
            Stranger, said she, my beauty, form, and worth, <note type="margin"> LIB. XIX. </note><note type="margin"> Ulvses dis. <lb/>

            Penelope. </note> <lb n="105"/>
            Th immortal Gods took from me then away, <lb/>
            When first Ulysses with the Greeks went forth <lb/>
            To that abominable town of Troy; <lb/>
            But were he here that had the care of me, <lb/>
            I should more honour have, and beauty so. <lb n="110"/>
            But now I lead my life in misery; <lb/>
            The Gods upon me troubles daily throw. <lb/>
            For all the lords that in these islands be, <lb/>
            Same, Dulichium, and woody Zant, <lb/>
            And Ithaca itself, suitors to me, <lb n="115"/>
            My house continually together haunt, <lb/>
            And there devour my cattle, corn, and wine; <lb/>
            So that of strangers I can take no care, <lb/>
            Nor can myself dispose of what is mine, <lb/>
            Nor messengers receive that public are; <lb n="120"/>
            But, longing for my husband, sit and pine. <lb/>
            They press for marriage, I, to put it by. <lb/>
            Then came into my thought (some power divine. <lb/>
            Sure prompt'd me) to set up a beam;<lb/>
            A beam set up, and then began to weave. <lb n="125"/>
            Suitors, said I, since dead Ulysses is, <lb/>
            Stay yet a little while, and give me leave <lb/>
            To make an end but of one business. <lb/>
            I must for old Laertes make a cloth, <lb/>
            Which in his sepulchre he is to wear. <lb n="130"/>
            T'offend the wives of Greece I should be loath ; <lb/>
            For, to accuse me they will not forbear. <lb/>
            They'll say I very hasty was to wed, <lb/>
            If I go hence and not provide a shroud <lb/>
            Wherein Laertes must be buried, <lb n="135"/>
            Out of his wealth; that might have been allowed. <lb/>
            My suitors all were well content. And then, <lb/>
            All day I wove; but ere I went to bed, <lb/>
            What I had wov'n I ravel'd out agen. <lb/>
            Three years my suitors I thus frustrated. <lb n="140"/>
            In the fourth year my women me betray'd; <lb/>
            And in they came while I the web undid. <lb/>
            I could the wedding now no more avoid, <lb/>
            But I was rated by them much and chid. <lb/>
            What I am next to do, I cannot tell: <lb n="145"/>
            My father and my mother bid me marry; <lb/>
            My son is weary, and takes not very well <lb/>
            That th' woo'rs devouring him should longer tarry. <lb/>
            But for all this, I long to know your stock, <lb/>
            For sure you come not of the fabled oak, <lb n="150"/>
            Nor are, I think, descended from a rock. <lb/>
            To this Ulysses answering thus spoke: <lb/>
            Wife of Ulysses, since you so much press <lb/>
            To know my kindred, and from whence I come, <pb n="488"/>

            Although the telling grieve me, I'll confess, <lb n="155"/>
            For I have now long absent been from home. <lb/>
            In the wide sea a fertile island lies, <lb/>
            Innumerable therein are the men, <lb/>
            Creta by name. Many diversities <lb/>
            There are of tongues; and cities nine times ten. <lb n="160"/>
            There dwell Achaeans and Cydonians, <lb/>
            And ancient true Creatans, Tribachichs, <lb/>
            And also Dorichs and Pelasgians, <lb/>
            Who divers dialects together mix. <lb/>
            And Cnossus the prime city was of these, <lb n="165"/>
            Where Minos reigned; the great Minos that, <lb/>
            Who often used with great Chronides <lb/>
            Familiarly of old to sit and chat; <lb/>
            Minos my father's father was, and he <lb/>
            Deucalion begot; Deucalion <lb n="170"/>
            First got Idomeneus, and then got me. <lb/>
            He went to Troy. My name is Aithon. <lb/>
            There 'twas I saw Ulysses. He came in <lb/>
            As he went homeward, and with much ado <lb/>
            T' Amphisus; for by winds he forced had been <lb n="175"/>
            This place, though no good port, to put into. <lb/>
            Then straight went up, Idomeneus to see, <lb/>
            With whom he had acquaintanace, as he said. <lb/>
            'Twas ten days after that, or more, that he <lb/>
            For Troy, with th' other Greeks, his anchors weigh'd. <lb n="180"/>
            I entertained him kindly with my own; <lb/>
            Gave him a handsome present too, and then <lb/>
            I made him to be feasted by the town, <lb/>
            Upon the public charge, himself and men. <lb/>
            Twelve days the wind continued at north, <lb n="185"/>
            Which kept the fleet perforce within the bay; <lb/>
            On the thirteenth th' wind changed, and came south, <lb/>
            And then they set up sail and steer'd for Troy. <lb/>
            'Twas so like truth, she wept. As when the sun <lb/>
            Dissolving is the snow upon a hill, <lb n="190"/>
            Innumerable streams of water run, <lb/>
            And the low rivers of the valley fill: <lb/>
            So wept she for her husband sitting by; <lb/>
            Who grieved and pitied her, but never wept; <lb/>
            As hard us horn or iron was his eye, <lb n="195"/>
            And by design himself from tears he kept. <lb/>
            After with weeping she was satisfied, <lb/>
            Stranger, said she, I'll ask you somewhat now, <lb/>
            By which most certainly it will be tried, <lb/>
            If you my husband, as you say, did know, <lb n="200"/>
            Or entertain'd him and his company. <lb/>
            What kind of person was he, and how clad ? <lb/>
            How serv'd? To this Ulysses made reply: <lb/>
            Though twenty year ago it be, and bad <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            My memory; yet, what I can recall <note type="margin">LIB. XIX. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses dis­ <lb/>
            courseth with <lb/>
            Penelope. </note> <lb n="205"/>
            I will relate; he wore a purple vest, <lb/>
            Unshorn and lin'd. Before, embroider'd all, <lb/>
            Two clasps of gold; and in it was exprest <lb/>
            A hound, that did between his forefeet hold <lb/>
            A fawn, that sprall'd and labour'd to get free; <lb n="210"/>
            Which was so lively done, and all in gold <lb/>
            Performed was, that wonder 'twas to see. <lb/>
            His coat I mark'd, so soft it was and fine, <lb/>
            As is the fold of a dry onion; <lb/>
            And as the sun, did gloriously shine, <lb n="215"/>
            And women gaz'd upon him many a one. <lb/>
            Such were his garments, but I know not whence <lb/>
            lIe had them. You know better that than I; <lb/>
            Whether he so apparell'd went from hence, <lb/>
            Presented by some of his company, <lb n="220"/>
            Or given to him somewhere by some guest; <lb/>
            For he was much beloved far and near, <lb/>
            And of the Achæans all esteemed the best; <lb/>
            Amongst the Greeks he hardly had his peer. <lb/>
            And I him gave a purple double vest, <lb n="225"/>
            A sword, and coat edged with fringes trim, <lb/>
            And brought him to his ship. Amongst the rest <lb/>
            A herald was; and I'll describe you him. <lb/>
            Round shoulder'd was he, curled was his hair, <lb/>
            Swarthy his face, Eurybates his name. <lb n="230"/>
            Ulysses to him much respect did bear, <lb/>
            Because their thoughts for most part were the same. <lb/>
            When he had done, she could no longer hold, <lb/>
            But wept again, and sorer than before; <lb/>
            For she found true the tokens he had told. <lb n="235"/>
            But when this show'r of tears was passed o'er, <lb/>
            Stranger, said she, I pitied you before; <lb/>
            Now as a friend you shall respected be; <lb/>
            'Twas I gave him th' apparel he then wore, <lb/>
            And the gold buckles to remember me; <lb n="240"/>
            But I shall never see him more at home; <lb/>
            In an unlucky hour he cross'd the main <lb/>
            To that accursed town of Ilium. <lb/>
            Then thus Ulysses answered her again: <lb/>
            0 noble wife of Laertiades, <lb n="245"/>
            Blemish no more those your fair eyes with tears <lb/>
            For your Ulysses; set your heart at ease. <lb/>
            Not that your sorrow as a fault appears. <lb/>
            What woman that her husband of her youth, <lb/>
            And to whom children she had borne, had lost, <lb n="250"/>
            Could choose but grieve and weep, although in truth <lb/>
            .Sie could not of his virtue greatly boast? <lb/>
            But that you would give ear to what I say; <lb/>
            I say Ulysses is not far from home; <pb n="490"/>

            He's in Thesprotia, hence a little way, <lb n="255"/>
            Alive, enrich'd with presents he is come; <lb/>
            His ship and men all perish'd in the main, <lb/>
            Then when he left the isle Thrinacie; <lb/>
            Because Sol's sacred kine his men had slain, <lb/>
            Hurled they were by Jove into the sea; <lb n="260"/>
            Ulysses only scap'd; for sitting fast <lb/>
            Upon the torn-off rudder by the waves, <lb/>
            After much labour came to land at last <lb/>
            In th' isle Phœacia; there his life he saves. <lb/>
            Much honour there and precious gifts he got. <lb n="265"/>
            They ready were to have convey'd him home <lb/>
            Safely to Ithaca, but he would not; <lb/>
            Else long ago he might have hither come. <lb/>
            But he thought best to travel longer yet, <lb/>
            And pick up presents which way e'er he went, <lb n="270"/>
            Before his going home much wealth to get; <lb/>
            For at designing he was excellent. <lb/>
            Phidon himself, king of Thesprotia, <lb/>
            Swore to me this; and that both ship and men <lb/>
            Were ready to convey him t' Ithaca, <lb n="275"/>
            His country; but he could not stay till then; <lb/>
            For now a vessel ready to set forth <lb/>
            Stood for Dulichium. But he show'd me all <lb/>
            Ulysses' treasure, which might serve, for worth, <lb/>
            Ten ages to maintain a man withal. <lb n="280"/>
            But he, he said, was gone o'er to the main, <lb/>
            There at Dodona with Jove's oak t' advise <lb/>
            How to return to Ithaca again; <lb/>
            As he was openly, or in disguise; <lb/>
            So then he's safe, and soon he will be here; <lb n="285"/>
            He cannot from his house be long away. <lb/>
            And, which is more, I will not doubt to swear, <lb/>
            And witness call the Gods to what I say. <lb/>
            Hear, Jove, of Gods the best and high'st, and thou <lb/>
            The guardian of the house that we are in: <lb n="290"/>
            Ulysses shall come to this place you know, <lb/>
            Ere this month end, or when the next comes in. <lb/>
            Penelope then answer'd : Stranger, oh <lb/>
            That this would so fall out, you then should see <lb/>
            Such friendship from me, and such gifts also, <lb n="295"/>
            That men should bless, and say you happy be. <lb/>
            But, maids, go wash his feet, and make his bed, <lb/>
            Lay on warm rugs, and handsome covering, <lb/>
            His limbs to cherish till the day be spread. <lb/>
            Then wash and 'noint him that my son may bring <lb n="300"/>
            And set him in the hall at dinner by him; <lb/>
            For he that wrongs him shall not be allow'd <lb/>

            Far from his home, and in vile garments dress'd. <lb/>
            To this Ulysses answered her again, <lb/>
            0 noble wife of Laertiades, <lb n="310"/>
            Since I left Crete, on ship-board I have lain, <lb/>
            Soft and fine bedding give me little ease; <lb/>
            Many a night have I passed without sleep, <lb/>
            And often slept have on a homely couch. <lb/>
            The custom I have so long kept I'll keep; <lb n="315"/>
            Nor shall your maidens my feet wash or touch, <lb/>
            Such as wait on you; but if there be any <lb/>
            Old women here that hath endured much, <lb/>
            As I have done, and years have lived many, <lb/>
            I am content my feet be wash'd by such. <lb n="320"/>
            Then said Penelope, Ne'er man came here <lb/>
            Within my house from foreign country yet <lb/>
            So prudent as you are, whose answers were <lb/>
            To every thing so wise and so discreet. <lb/>
            There is a woman such as you desire, <lb n="325"/>
            That nurs'd and brought up that afflicted man; <lb/>
            Though she be very weak, she'll make a fire, <lb/>
            And wash your feet, but nothing else do can. <lb/>
            Rise, Euryclea, wash the feet of one <lb/>
            That's like your lord. Such feet and hands were his, <lb n="330"/>
            Woe makes men old, as well as years that run. <lb/>
            So said Penelope; and th' old woman ris, <lb/>
            And weeping held her hand before her eyes. <lb/>
            O my dear child, 0 Jupiter unkind! <lb/>
            Who more devout, who burnt to him more thighs, <lb n="335"/>
            Or fatter, or doth lesser favour find? <lb/>
            He pray'd to live so long that he might see, <lb/>
            Painless, the education of his child <lb/>
            Telemachus, but granted 'twill not be. <lb/>
            He now perhaps is where he is revil'd <lb n="340"/>
            And mock'd by women in some great man's hall, <lb/>
            As thou, 0 stranger, hast been scorned here; <lb/>
            And wilt not suffer any of them all <lb/>
            Either thy feet to wash or to come near. <lb/>
            I'll wash your feet, as I am bidden by <lb n="345"/>
            Penelope, and for your own sake too. <lb/>
            It is not her command alone. There lie <lb/>
            Thoughts on my heart that urge me thereunto. <lb/>
            Poor passengers come hither very many, <lb/>
            But one so like Ulysses never came; <lb n="350"/>
            For person, voice, and feet, I never saw any <lb/>
            Come to this house that had so near the same. <lb/>
            Ulysses answered, Woman, so they say <lb/>
            All that have seen us both. It may be so. <pb n="492"/>

            She with her kettle bright then went her way <lb n="355"/>
            For water, wherewithal her work to do. <lb/>
            Cold water she brings in, and pours on't hot. <lb/>
            Ulysses sat by the fire, but turned that thigh <lb/>
            That had the scar, to the dark, that she mightn ot <lb/>
            Find it, and force him to appear openly. <lb n="360"/>
            She was not long about him when she spied <lb/>
            The scar a boar had made above his knee <lb/>
            When he was hunting on Parnassus' side, <lb/>
            At's grandsires, in his uncle's company. <lb/>
            His grandsire was Autolycus, that was <lb n="365"/>
            His mother's father, named Anticlia; <lb/>
            He in hermetic arts did most suppass; <lb/>
            And to his daughter came to Ithaca, <lb/>
            That newly of a son was brought to bed. <lb/>
            Euryclea laid the child upon his knee. <lb n="370"/>
            Autolycus, you are to give, she said, <lb/>
            Thename; how shall it named be? <lb/>
            Then said Autolycus, Since I of many, <lb/>
            Both men and women, have incurr'd the blame, <lb/>
            A fitter name I cannot think on any; <lb n="375"/>
            Therefore, I say, Ulysses be his name; <lb/>
            And when he's grown a man send him to me, <lb/>
            To Mount Parnassus; whither if he come, <lb/>
            He shall of what I have partaker be, <lb/>
            And from me go not ill-contented home. <lb n="380"/>
            And this the cause was that he thither went. <lb/>
            Autolycus and's sons there take Ulysses <lb/>
            By th' hand, expressing very great content. <lb/>
            Antithea, his grannam, his head kisses, <lb/>
            And both his eyes. Autolycus appoints <lb n="385"/>
            His sons to have the supper very good. <lb/>
            A bullock fat they kill, slay, cut in joints, <lb/>
            Roast, and in messes distribute the food; <lb/>
            And so they feasted till the day was done; <lb/>
            And when 'twas dark parted and went to sleep. <lb n="390"/>
            But when Aurora had proclaimed the sun, <lb/>
            Which ready was above the hill to peep, <lb/>
            Then to Parnassus up the hunters go, <lb/>
            The hounds before went searching out the see <lb/>
            Autolycus his sons were there also, <lb n="395"/>
            Ulysses with them; next the dogs he went, <lb/>
            And in his hand shook a long-shaded spear; <lb/>
            The dogs drew toward a wood; so close it was <lb/>
            That neither rain nor wind e'er enter'd there, <lb/>
            Nor yet the beams o'th' sun could through it pass, <lb n="400"/>
            And heaps of witber'd leaves there lay therein. <lb/>
            Within this thicket lay a mighty boar; <lb/>
            Only the noise of hounds and men came in. <lb/>
            When they were very near, and not before, <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            The boar rush'd out, and fire was in his eye; <note type="margin"> LIB. XIX. </note><note type="margin"> The hunting of <lb/>

            Bristled his neck. Ulysses ready was. <lb/>
            The boar first wounded had Ulysses' thigh; <lb/>
            The spear did through the boar's right shoulder pass. <lb/>
            Slain was the boar. And of Ulysses' wound <lb/>
            His uncles took the care, and skilfully <lb n="410"/>
            They caus'd it to be closed up and bound, <lb/>
            And with a charm the blood stopp'd presently. <lb/>
            His wound soon cured, very glad they were, <lb/>
            And him with many gifts sent glad away. <lb/>
            At home they ask, and he relateth there <lb n="415"/>
            The story of the hunting of that day. <lb/>
            Euryclea on the wound had laid her hand, <lb/>
            And well assured was 'twas none but he, <lb/>
            Which made the water in her eyes to stand; <lb/>
            And now her joy and grief one passion be. <lb n="420"/>
            Her speech stuck in her throat; her hand lets fall <lb/>
            Her master's foot; that down the kettle threw; <lb/>
            The water runneth out about the hall; <lb/>
            And knowing now what she but thought was true: <lb/>
            You are Ulysses, said she, 0 my dear, <lb n="425"/>
            And tow'rd Penelope she look'd aside, <lb/>
            As if she meant to say, Your husband's here. <lb/>
            But Pallas, that did mean the truth to hide, <lb/>
            Still made the queen to look another way, <lb/>
            And he with one hand stopp'd the nurse's breath, <lb n="430"/>
            With th' other held her fast to make her stay. <lb/>
            Why, nurse, said he, mean you to be my death? <lb/>
            Since at your breast I nourished have been, <lb/>
            And none but you knows me in this disguise; <lb/>
            These twenty years I here was never seen. <lb n="435"/>
            Let none else know it in the house. Be wise; <lb/>
            For this I tell you, and will make it true, <lb/>
            That of the women some I mean to slay, <lb/>
            When by my hand the Gods the woo'rs subdue; <lb/>
            If you bewray me, you shall fare as they. <lb n="440"/>
            Then said Euryclea, What needeth this? <lb/>
            You know my heart can hold like stone or brass; <lb/>
            And who is honest, who dishonest is, <lb/>
            I'll tell you, if your purpose come to pass. <lb/>
            No, nurse, then said Ulysses, tell not me; <lb n="445"/>
            You need not; I shall know them every one. <lb/>
            Permit all to the Gods, and silent be; <lb/>
            For they best know what best is to be done. <lb/>
            Then out she went more water to fetch in, <lb/>
            The first being spilt. He wash'd and 'nointed was. <lb n="450"/>
            And covered the place where th' wound had been. <lb/>
            And nearer to the fire his chair he draws. <lb/>
            Then to them came Penelope, and said, <lb/>

            Our grief in gentle sleep is passed o'er. <lb/>
            But all the day my tears are my delight, <lb/>

            And after I am gone to bed at night <lb/>
            A thousand dismal thoughts keep me awake; <lb n="460"/>
            As Philomela, sitting in a tree, <lb/>
            Mourns with a lamentable voice and shrill, <lb/>
            For Itylus, and turneth restlessly, <lb/>
            (Whom Zethus' son did by misfortune kill): <lb/>
            Just so my mind divided is in twain: <lb n="465"/>
            Whether to keep my servants with my son, <lb/>
            And my dear husband's bed, and here remain, <lb/>
            Or marry one o' th' suitors and be gone. <lb/>
            To marry and be gone I could not yet; <lb/>
            My son too young was yet to rule th'estate; <lb n="470"/>
            And now, grown up, it makes him vex and fret <lb/>
            To see them daily feast within his gate. <lb/>
            I'll tell you now a dream; expound it you : <lb/>
            I've twenty geese feeding i'th' yard without; <lb/>
            A mighty eagle from the hills down flew <lb n="475"/>
            And break their necks; dead they lay all about. <lb/>
            The eagle straightway mounted out of sight. <lb/>
            I dreaming wept; to see them at the trough, <lb/>
            Feeding on steeped wheat, I took delight; <lb/>
            And to bemoan me ladies came enough. <lb n="480"/>
            And then methought the eagle came again, <lb/>
            And on a beam which through the wall did start, <lb/>
            He sat; and said, in human language plain, <lb/>
            Child of Icarius, trouble not your heart; <lb/>
            The thing you see is real, not a dream; <lb n="485"/>
            The geese the wooers, I the eagle was, <lb/>
            And now returned and sitting on the beam; <lb/>
            I am your husband, and will bring to pass <lb/>
            The death of all your suitors. Then wak'd I, <lb/>
            And went into the court my geese to see, <lb n="490"/>
            And found them all there feeding heartily, <lb/>
            Unhurt, and well as they were wont to be. <lb/>
            Woman, then said Ulysses, no man can <lb/>
            Expound this dream but as himself has done, <lb/>
            That says and does. Ulysses is the man. <lb n="495"/>
            The suitors will be killed every one. <lb/>
            Then said Penelope, Dreams are without <lb/>
            Such order as to make a judgment by; <lb/>
            And at two gates, men say, they issue out, <lb/>
            The one of horn, th' other of ivory; <lb n="500"/>
            Those that pass through the horn, to men of skill, <lb/>

            That must determine who shall gain my grace. <lb/>
            Twelve axes here Ulysses set arow, <lb/>
            Like twelve boats laid along upon their sides, <lb n="510"/>
            And at a distance standing with his bow, <lb/>
            Through ev'ry one of them his arrow glides. <lb/>
            And this shall to my suitors be the prize. <lb/>
            He that most easily shall bend the bow, <lb/>
            And through the axes all his arrow flies, <lb n="515"/>
            Leaving this blessed house with him I'll go. <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses, Let the suitors try <lb/>
            If they can bend the bow, and thorough shoot <lb/>
            Through th' axes if they can, for sure am I, <lb/>
            Ulysses will be here before they do't. <lb n="520"/>
            Stranger, said she, whilst you discourse, my eyes <lb/>
            To sleep will never be inclined; but since <lb/>
            The force of nature on all mortals lies, <lb/>
            I up into my chamber will go hence; <lb/>
            There is my bed, wash'd nightly with my tears, <lb n="525"/>

            This said, unto her chamber up she went, <lb/>
            And with her all her maids. And there she lies. <lb n="530"/>
            And for her husband did afresh lament, <lb/>

            The house is yours, your wife and son here be. <lb/>

            And if I kill them, then again invent <lb/>
            How to escape and save myself by flight. <lb/>
            To this the Goddess answered, and said, <lb/>
            Another man would trust a meaner wight, <lb n="35"/>
            Though mortal, and rely upon his aid: <lb/>

            With closed eyes, and thought she certainly <lb n="75"/>
            Knew who he was, and stood at his bed's head. <lb/>
            Then rose he, and his sheep skins bare away, <lb/>
            And rug into the house; but the cow-hide <lb/>
            He carried out, and then to Jove did pray: <lb/>
            Hear, Jupiter, with lifted hands he cried; <lb n="80"/>
            0 Jove and Gods, if by your will divine, <lb/>
            Toss'd both at sea and land, I hither came; <lb/>
            By fatal word within, without by sign, <lb/>
            To me now presently confirm the same. <lb/>
            Jove heard his pray'r, and straight it thundered. <lb n="85"/>
            This made Ulysses glad. Then spake a maid <lb/>
            The fatal word. Twelve maids, to furnish bread, <lb/>
            Were to grind wheat continually employ'd: <lb/>
            Eleven their work had done and went to bed; <lb/>
            The weakest still staid grinding, and thus pray'd: <lb n="90"/>
            Jove, who without a cloud hast thundered, <lb/>
            Grant me poor maid my wish, and then she said, <lb/>
            O Jove, that father art of Gods and men, <lb/>
            Let never more these wicked suitors taste <lb/>
            Meat in this house, nor ever come agen, <lb n="95"/>
            That pain me thus. This supper be their last. <lb/>
            Ulysses with this word, and with the thunder, <lb/>
            Well pleased was, and thought assuredly <lb/>
            With Pallas' help the suitors to bring under, <lb/>
            And many though they were, to make them die. <lb n="100"/>
            Then th' other maids came in and made a fire <lb/>
            Within the hall. And then too from his bed <lb/>
            Telemachus rose, puts on his attire, <lb/>
            And sword and shoes; his spear with brazen head <lb/>
            He took into his hand, and stood i'tli' door, <lb n="105"/>
            And to the nurse, Euryclea, he spake: <lb/>
            What meat, what lodging, had this stranger poor? <lb/>
            Or was there none that care of him did take? <lb/>
            My mother's nature, wise as she is, is such <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> K K </note> <pb n="498"/>

            Highly to honour men of less desert; <lb n="110"/>
            But for this stranger perhaps cares not much. <lb/>
            Then said Euryclea, She has done her part; <lb/>
            Wine he has had as much as he thought fit, <lb/>
            She ask'd him if he had a mind to eat; <lb/>
            He answered that he had no appetite <lb n="115"/>
            To bread at present, nor to any meat. <lb/>
            She bade her maids set up a standing bed; <lb/>
            But he, as one in love with misery, <lb/>
            Would none of that, nor bed, nor coverled, <lb/>
            But on the ground resolved was to lie, <lb n="120"/>
            And make his scrip the bolster for his head, <lb/>
            And for a bed to take a raw cow-hide, <lb/>
            And sheep skins with the wool for coverled <lb/>
            Without the door; and we the rug applied. <lb/>
            This said, Telemachus with spear in hand <lb n="125"/>
            To council goes, and his dogs followed him. <lb/>
            Then Euryclea gives the maids command <lb/>
            The rooms of th'house to dress up and make trim. <lb/>
            Rise, maids, said she, sprinkle and sweep the hall, <lb/>
            Lay cushions on the chairs, with sponges mak e <lb n="130"/>
            The tables clean, the temp'rer and cups all; <lb/>
            And see of water that there be no lack. <lb/>
            Go to the spring and fetch fair water thence <lb/>
            Quickly. You know to-day is holiday; <lb/>
            The suitors will not now be long from hence. <lb n="135"/>
            So said the nurse. The women her obey; <lb/>
            For water to the fountain went twice ten; <lb/>
            The rest did diligently work within. <lb/>
            The maids that went for water came agen; <lb/>
            And the proud woo'rs by that time were come in. <lb n="140"/>
            nd then came in the master of the swine, <lb/>
            Eumaeus: three swine frank'd and fat he brought, <lb/>
            There to be ready ’gainst the suitors dine; <lb/>
            In all his swine-sties better there were not. <lb/>
            And he unto Ulysses kindly spake: <lb n="145"/>
            Stranger, how fare you ’mongst the wooers here? <lb/>
            Do they more pity now upon you take <lb/>
            Than formerly; or still deride you there? <lb/>
            0, said Ulysses, that the Gods would give <lb/>
            These men what to their insolence is due, <lb n="150"/>
            Who in a house not theirs so lewdly live, <lb/>
            As if no modesty at all they knew. <lb/>
            Then came Melanthus from a place hard by; <lb/>
            He had the charge o' th' goats, and brought the best, <lb/>
            And spake unto Ulysses spitefully: <lb n="155"/>
            Art thou here still, to beg and to molest <lb/>
            The company? Dye mean before you go <lb/>
            To taste my fingers ? Is there no good cheer <lb/>
            In other places ’mongst the Greeks, and so <lb/>

            Then came a third, that charge had of the kme; <lb/>
            Philœtius by name, with him he brought <lb/>
            A heifer and more goats, on which to dine, <lb/>
            Over the water, in the ferry-boat. <lb/>
            Philœtius ask'd Eumæus in his ear, <lb n="165"/>
            Who's this, that's new come hither, and from whence ? <lb/>
            What countryman, and what his parents were ? <lb/>
            For, for his person he may be a prince; <lb/>
            God can make princes go from land to land <lb/>
            And beg, when he will give them misery. <lb n="170"/>
            This said, he took Ulysses by the hand, <lb/>
            And spake unto him kind and lovingly: <lb/>
            Father, I wish you as much happiness <lb/>
            As ever you enjoyed before; but now <lb/>
            I see you are in very great distress. <lb n="175"/>
            0 Jove! what God so cruel is as thou ? <lb/>
            Though born thou wert, yet pitiest not to see <lb/>
            The torments of mankind. To think upon <lb/>
            Ulysses makes me weep. It may be he <lb/>
            Thus begs somewhere, with such apparel on, <lb n="180"/>
            Or else he's dead. 0 then I am undone. <lb/>
            He set me o'er his herds when but a boy; <lb/>
            But infinite they're grown since he is gone, <lb/>
            Or man would quickly all cow-kind destroy; <lb/>
            But mine the suitors force me to bring in <lb n="185"/>
            For them to eat, and ne'er regard his son ; <lb/>
            The goods to share already they begin <lb/>
            Of th' owner, that so long now has been gone. <lb/>
            And I devising was what I should do, <lb/>
            To take my cattle with me and be gone, <lb n="190"/>
            And one or other prince to give them to; <lb/>
            But that, I thought, would be unjustly done, <lb/>
            For they Telemachus his cattle were. <lb/>
            Again, I thought it labour very sour <lb/>
            To stay and keep my master's cattle here, <lb n="195"/>
            For others in his absence to devour. <lb/>
            So here abide I, and myself I flatter <lb/>
            With hope to see Ulysses one day come <lb/>
            Back to his house, and the proud suitors scatter. <lb/>
            Thus said the master of the kine. To whom <lb n="200"/>
            Ulysses said: Honest you seem, and wise; <lb/>
            I therefore will a secret to you swear, <lb/>
            By Jove on high, you shall see with your eyes <lb/>
            Ulysses, if you wish to see him, here, <lb/>
            And all these domineering suitors slay. <lb n="205"/>
            Then, 0, said he, that Jove would have it so; <lb/>
            For I should let you see in such a fray <lb/>
            Quickly how much these hands of mine can do. <lb/>
            Eumacus also did like prayer make <note type="footnote"> K K 2 </note> <pb n="500"/>

            To see Ulysses there. So ended they. <lb n="210"/>
            While they discourse the suitors counsel take <lb/>
            How they might make Telemachus away. <lb/>
            Then o'er their heads an eagle flew on high, <lb/>
            Sinister, with a fearful dove in's foot. <lb/>
            Then said Amphinomus, Let's lay this by, <lb n="215"/>
            And think of supper, for we cannot do't. <lb/>
            The suitors all approved of what he said, <lb/>
            And in they went, and there on bench and seat <lb/>
            Within Ulysses' house their coats they laid, <lb/>
            And set themselves to kill and dress their meat. <lb n="220"/>
            Then from the herd they sacrificed a cow, <lb/>
            And many well-grown sheep, and goats well fed, <lb/>
            And many a very fat and pamper'd sow; <lb/>
            Th' entrails they roasted and distributed. <lb/>
            Eumæus gave out cups, Philcetius bread, <lb n="225"/>
            Melanthus from the temp'rer fill'd out wine; <lb/>
            The suitors on the meat before them fed <lb/>
            With stomachs good, and drank the blood o' th' vine. <lb/>
            Telemachus Ulysses in the hall <lb/>
            Hard by the threshold sets, (and there he sat <lb n="230"/>
            On an ill-favour'd stool at table small), <lb/>
            And gave him his just share of th' entrails fat, <lb/>
            And for him fill'd a great gold cup with wine. <lb/>
            Sit here, said he, and fare like other men; <lb/>
            Fear neither blows nor scoffs; the house is mine ; <lb n="235"/>
            Ulysses is the owner of it. When <lb/>
            He first possessed it, he gave it me. <lb/>
            And you, my mother's suitors, mock no more, <lb/>
            But keep the peace as long as here you be; <lb/>
            For else perhaps arise may trouble sore. <lb n="240"/>
            At first the suitors knew not how to take <lb/>
            Telemachus his words, and silent were, <lb/>
            Admiring that such threatening words he spake, <lb/>
            So many men provoking without fear. <lb/>
            But by and by Antinous said thus: <lb n="245"/>
            Since Jove appeared has in his defence, <lb/>
            Let's put these threats up of Telemachus, <lb/>
            Else we should quickly spoil his eloquence. <lb/>
            So said Antinous. But Telemachus <lb/>
            Car'd not at all for anything he said. <lb n="250"/>
            When peace within doors was concluded thus, <lb/>
            In other rites o' th' feast they were employ'd; <lb/>
            The hecatomb they bear throughout the town <lb/>
            Into Apollo's shady grove divine. <lb/>
            The upper joints in messes they divide, <lb n="255"/>
            So fill'd their tables and sat down to dine. <lb/>
            The portion of Ulysses was no less <lb/>
            Than other suitors had, nor more; for why, <lb/>
            Telemachus had order'd every mess <lb/>
             <pb n="501"/>
            Should equal be, and men serv'd equally. <note type="margin"> LIB. XX. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>

            Amongst the suitors was a very knave, <lb/>
            Ctesippus was his name, a rich man's son, <lb/>
            And therefore hop'd Penelope to have. <lb/>
            This man to th' wooers made a motion: <lb/>
            Hear me, you suitors of Penelope, <lb n="265"/>
            This stranger here is equal made to us, <lb/>
            And therefore reason 'tis that also we <lb/>
            Should love the strangers of Telemachus. <lb/>
            Lo, here's a gift I'll give him, that he may <lb/>
            Bestow it, ift please him, on him or her <lb n="270"/>
            That empts the chamber-pots, or giv't away <lb/>
            To any of Ulysses' bondmen here. <lb/>
            With that he hurled at Ulysses' head <lb/>
            A cow's foot, but he turn'd his head the while, <lb/>
            And from the stroke himself delivered. <lb n="275"/>
            Then smil'd Ulysses a sardonic smile; <lb/>
            Telemachus his anger could not hide. <lb/>
            'Tis well, said he, you did not hurt him here, <lb/>
            For else, believe it, you had surely died <lb/>
            0' th' place, run through the body with my spear, <lb n="280"/>
            And never found a wife here, but a grave. <lb/>
            Therefore give over this behaviour wild; <lb/>
            Of good and bad I now some knowledge have, <lb/>
            And do not always take me for a child. <lb/>
            What's past I bear, the havoc of my cattle, <lb n="285"/>
            My corn and wine consumed lavishly; <lb/>
            'Tis hard for one with many t' enter battle. <lb/>
            Use me no longer as an enemy; <lb/>
            For fighting to be slain I'd rather chuse, <lb/>
            Than see my guests or servants harshly used; <lb n="290"/>
            My women, as they pass about the house, <lb/>
            To be so basely tugg'd, touz'd, and abus'd. <lb/>
            This said, awhile the suitors silent were; <lb/>
            But not long after, Agelaus spake. <lb/>
            Let's not, said he, against a truth so clear <lb n="295"/>
            Struggle, and what is said in ill part take; <lb/>
            Nor harshly use the stranger any more, <lb/>
            Nor any servant of Telemachus; <lb/>
            But yet I have a silly word in store <lb/>
            For him, and for his mother, and for us. <lb n="300"/>
            Whilst there was hope Ulysses might come home, <lb/>
            The suitors had done best at home to stay, <lb/>
            Expecting him, and not have hither come; <lb/>
            But since there's none, to's mother he should say, <lb/>
            Take one of them for husband, which you please, <lb n="305"/>
            And most shall give you; so shall he enjoy <lb/>
            His father's means, and eat and drink at ease, <lb/>
            And she with her new husband go her way. <lb/>
            To this Telemachus replying says, <pb n="502"/>

            That do my mother keep from marrying <lb/>
            Whom she thinks good. I do advise her still <lb/>

            But I'll not make her do't against her will. <lb/>
            So ended he. Then on the suitors' faces <lb/>
            Pallas sets up a laughter not their own, <lb/>
            Nor to be stopp'd; their senses she displaces, <lb/>
            Their meat was bloody, and their hearts were down. <lb n="320"/>
            What is't, poor men, said Theoclymenus, <lb/>
            Your heads and faces are wrapt up in night; <lb/>
            You weep and groan; the walls and beams of th' house <lb/>
            To me seem bloody; and left there is no light; <lb/>
            The hall and porch, methinks are full of sprites <lb n="325"/>
            Ready to go to hell; the sun has lost <lb/>
            His place in heaven, nor are there any lights; <lb/>
            And dismal darkness bath the house engross'd : <lb/>
            At this they laugh'd. Then, said Eurymachus, <lb/>
            This stranger is not very well, let him <lb n="330"/>
            By those that wait be guided from the house <lb/>
            To th' market-place; for all within is dim. <lb/>
            I am, said Theoclymenus, not blind, <lb/>
            I can go the market-place alone. <lb/>
            I have both eyes and ears, and feet and mind: <lb n="335"/>
            With these I can go hence. Guide need I none, <lb/>
            And go I will; for evil is hard by, <lb/>
            Which none of you the suitors shall escape <lb/>
            That have so much abused the family. <lb/>
            This said, he parts, and left the woo'rs to gape <lb n="340"/>
            On one another, and with insipid jests <lb/>
            To vex Telemachus, and themselves please, <lb/>
            And all upon Telemachus his guests. <lb/>
            The words that one of them then said were these: <lb/>
            Telemachus, of all men you're least able <lb n="345"/>
            To make an entertainment or a feast. <lb/>
            For first you for this beggar set a table, <lb/>
            Who eats and drinks as stoutly as the best, <lb/>
            But can no work do, nor has any force; <lb/>
            A very burthen to the earth. And this <lb n="350"/>
            A prophet would be, and loves to discourse <lb/>
            Of ill to come. My counsel therefore is, <lb/>
            That you would put these strangers both aboard <lb/>
            Some ship, and send them into Sicily. <lb/>
            They that way may some profit you afford. <lb n="355"/>
            Thus said the woo'rs, but little cared he, <lb/>
            But silently the sign expecting stood <lb/>
            His father should have giv'n of falling on. <lb/>
            Penelope meanwhile sat where site could <lb/>
             <pb n="503"/>
            Hear plainly what was said by every one. <note type="margin">LIB. XXI. </note> <lb n="360"/>
            And now the suitors merry supper made, <lb/>
            And laughing sat, and fed on much good cheer: <lb/>
            But after supper worse none ever had, <lb/>
            For of the wrongs themselves beginners were. <lb n="5"/>

            Who soon st could bend her noble husband s bow, <lb/>
            And through the axes make his arrow fly, <lb/>
            And whom she was to marry now to know, <lb/>
            To a high chamber up the stairs she went, <lb n="5"/>
            Wherein Ulysses' precious goods did stand. <lb/>
            There hung upon a pin the bow unbent; <lb/>
            The well-made key she carried in her hand. <lb/>
            This bow was given him by Iphitus <lb/>
            At Sparta. But Ulysses with him met <lb n="10"/>
            First at Messena; for it fell out thus. <lb/>
            Ulysses then was there about a debt. <lb/>
            Messena men their ships had put ashore <lb/>
            At Ithaca, and thence had ta'en a prey <lb/>
            Of sheep, which was in number fifteen score, <lb n="15"/>
            And, with the shepherds, carried them away. <lb/>
            This was the cause Ulysses thither went. <lb/>
            'Twas a long way, and he scarce past a boy; <lb/>
            But by his father and the lords was sent <lb/>
            T' ask reparation for this annoy. <lb n="20"/>
            But Iphitus twelve mares had lost; each one <lb/>
            A young mule had that followed her behind, <lb/>
            (Which of his death were the occasion), <lb/>
            And at Messena these he thought to find. <lb/>
            But as he was returning back again, <lb n="25"/>
            And came unto the house of Hercules, <lb/>
            That mighty man first did him entertain, <lb/>
            And after, killing him, his mares did seize. <lb/>
            This was the man that to Ulysses gave <lb/>
            The bow; and from him had a sword and spear. <lb n="30"/>
            But Hercules had sent him to his grave, <lb/>
            Ere they had tasted one another's cheer. <lb/>
            This bow he carried not to Ilium, <lb/>
            Nor ever had made use of it in fray; <pb n="504"/>

            which the sui. <lb/>
            tors could not <lb/>
            bend. </note> <lb/>
            But often had it in his hand at home; <lb n="35"/>
            For only as a monument it lay. <lb/>
            Penelope now standing at the door, <lb/>
            Quickly the bolt strook back with her great key, <lb/>
            The valves fly open suddenly and roar; <lb/>
            As when a great bull roars, so roared they. <lb n="40"/>
            Penelope went in, and up she stepp'd <lb/>
            Upon a board whereon were standing chests, <lb/>
            In which, ’mongst odours sweet, the clothes were kept, <lb/>
            The costly garments, robes, and coats, and vests. <lb/>
            Thence to the bow she reach'd, and from the pin <lb n="45"/>
            She took it as it hung there in the case; <lb/>
            And sitting down, her lap she laid it in. <lb/>
            Aloud she wept, and tears ran down apace: <lb/>
            And when she long enough had weeping been, <lb/>
            The bow she did unto the suitors bear, <lb n="50"/>
            And quiver with it full of arrows keen: <lb/>
            The axes by her women carried were. <lb/>
            Then with her scarf she shaded both her cheeks, <lb/>
            Having a waiting-woman on each hand; <lb/>
            Unto her gallant suitors thus she speaks: <lb n="55"/>
            Hear me, you lusty suitors that here stand, <lb/>
            Using this house, not yours, continually, <lb/>
            To eat and drink in at another's cost; <lb/>
            And for it do pretend no reason why, <lb/>
            But as contenders who shall love me most. <lb n="60"/>
            Lo here; to him I make myself a prize, <lb/>
            Who this good bow with greatest ease shall bend, <lb/>
            And whose aim'd arrow through these axes flies, <lb/>
            With him from this most blessed house I’ll wend. <lb/>
            This said, Eumseus th' axes and the bow <lb n="65"/>
            By her command unto the suitors bears; <lb/>
            And as he went, his eyes for grief o'erflow, <lb/>
            Nor could Philœtius abstain from tears; <lb/>
            For which Antinous gave them this reproof: <lb/>
            You foolish clowns, what ails you to shed tears ? <lb n="70"/>
            Has she not for her husband grief enough? <lb/>
            That you must add your sorrow unto hers. <lb/>
            Sit silently, eat and drink quietly; <lb/>
            Or if you needs must weep, go weep without. <lb/>
            Leave the bow here, the suitors' strength to try, <lb n="75"/>
            And that it may be carried round about. <lb/>
            Not that I think there's any man among <lb/>
            Us all can bend it as Ulysses could: <lb/>
            For I remember him though I were young. <lb/>
            So said he; though he thought he bend it should, <lb n="80"/>
            And also shoot through th' axes every one, <lb/>
            Though he were only the first to be shot. <lb/>
            For he the other suitors had set on, <lb/>
            And was the first contriver of the plot. <lb/>
             <pb n="505"/>
            Telemachus then to the suitors spake: <note type="margin"> LIB. XXI. </note><note type="margin"> Penelope bring. <lb/>
            eth forth her <lb/>
            husband's bow, <lb/>
            which the sui­ <lb/>
            tors could not <lb/>
            bend. </note> <lb n="85"/>
            Sure Jove, said he, bereav d me has of sense; <lb/>
            My mother tells me she'll a husband take, <lb/>
            And, leaving me, depart with him from hence; <lb/>
            And I here merry am that should be sad. <lb/>
            But be't as ’t will, the game must now begin, <lb n="90"/>
            For such a wife as ne'er Achaia had, <lb/>
            Nor in Mysen or Argos was e'er seen, <lb/>
            Nor Pyle, nor Ithaca, nor in Epire. <lb/>
            But what need I set forth my mother's praise ? <lb/>
            You know't yourselves. Therefore I you desire <lb n="95"/>
            To put off all excuses and delays. <lb/>
            And I myself will be the first to try <lb/>
            This mighty bow, whether I can or no, <lb/>
            And through the axes make the arrow fly. <lb/>
            'Twill grieve me less to let my mother go ; <lb n="100"/>
            Since I have strength to bend my father's bow, <lb/>
            Why should I doubt of governing his state ? <lb/>
            And from him presently his coat did throw <lb/>
            And sword, and then fell to delineate <lb/>
            The ground whereon the axes were to stand. <lb n="105"/>
            On one long line he set them all upright. <lb/>
            The wooers admir'd the justness of his hand ; <lb/>
            For why the like was ne'er done in his sight. <lb/>
            Then went he to the sill to try the bow. <lb/>
            Thrice he essay'd it, and was near it still. <lb n="110"/>
            And thrice again relenting let it go. <lb/>
            Once more had done it. But 'twas not his will; <lb/>
            For then his father check'd him with a wink. <lb/>
            Alas ! then, said Telemachus, must this <lb/>
            Be all my strength ? Too young I am, I think. <lb n="115"/>
            Come, let one take the bow that elder is. <lb/>
            This said, the bow and arrow he laid by, <lb/>
            And to the seat went where he sat before. <lb/>
            Then, said Antinous, The bow let's try, <lb/>
            In order as we sit. Let him therefore <lb n="120"/>
            Try first, whose table next the cupboard is, <lb/>
            And so to the right hand up, one by one. <lb/>
            The other suitors all approved this. <lb/>
            Leiodes was the first; so he begun; <lb/>
            His place was low'st. He to the threshold went <lb n="125"/>
            To try his force ; but to his tender hand <lb/>
            And feeble arms the bow would not relent. <lb/>
            Then down he laid it there, and lets it stand; <lb/>
            And to the suitors spake: This bow, says he, <lb/>
            I cannot bend, some other take't in hand. <lb n="130"/>
            It's like of many lords the death to be. <lb/>
            When by the strongest it comes to be mann'd. <lb/>
            For better 'tis to die than live and miss <lb/>
            The hopes you hither come for ev'ry day. <pb n="506"/>

            And what is 't any of you hope but this, <lb n="135"/>
            That you Ulysses' consort marry may ? <lb/>
            But when he shall this bow have understood, <lb/>
            Let him some other lady woo at ease <lb/>
            Amongst th' Achæans whom he shall think good, <lb/>
            And let Penelope take whom she please. <lb n="140"/>
            This said, the bow and arrow he set by, <lb/>
            And to the seat went where he sat before, <lb/>
            And by Antinous was angrily, <lb/>
            As soon as he had spoke, rebuk'd therefore. <lb/>
            What say you ? That this bow the death shall be <lb n="145"/>
            Of many lords ? Why so ? ’Cause you have not <lb/>
            The strength to bend it. Others have, you'll see; <lb/>
            But you for bending bows were not begot. <lb/>
            Then to Melantheus he turn'd and said, <lb/>
            Let fire be made, and a great chair set by 't, <lb n="150"/>
            And let upon it cushions be laid, <lb/>
            And let us have good store of tallow white, <lb/>
            T' anoint and warm, and supple make the bow, <lb/>
            And try if we perhaps may bend it then. <lb/>
            Fire, chair, and cushions came, and grease enough, <lb n="155"/>
            But to no purpose; too weak were the men. <lb/>
            Antinous yet and Eurymachus <lb/>
            Gave it not over; these two were the best <lb/>
            Of all the suitors that came to the house: <lb/>
            No hope at all remained for the rest. <lb n="160"/>
            Eumæus and Philoetius then went out <lb/>
            Together ; after them Ulysses went, <lb/>
            And when they were the gate and court without, <lb/>
            Himself unto them to discover meant. <lb/>
            And fair he spake them : Master of the kine, <lb n="165"/>
            And you Eumæus, master of the swine, <lb/>
            Shall I keep in, or speak a thought of mine ? <lb/>
            To speak it out my heart does me incline. <lb/>
            What if Ulysses should come suddenly, <lb/>
            Brought by some God, and stand before this rout, <lb n="170"/>
            On whose side, his or theirs, would you then be? <lb/>
            What your mind prompts you to, speak freely out. <lb/>
            Then answer'd him the master of the kine, <lb/>
            O that the Gods above would have it so, <lb/>
            You'ld see the virtue of these hands of mine. <lb n="175"/>
            The master of the swine then said so too. <lb/>
            When now the hearts of both of them he knew, <lb/>
            He spake again and said, 'Tis I am he, <lb/>
            That after twenty years return to you; <lb/>
            And know you longed have this day to see. <lb n="180"/>

            Then when upon Parnassus' mountain high <lb/>

            And then they fling their arms about Ulysses, <lb/>
            And kiss his hand and shoulders, weeping sore ; <lb/>
            And he again embraced them with kisses, <lb n="195"/>
            Nor had till sunset weeping given o'er, <lb/>
            But that Ulysses hindered it. Give o'er, said he, <lb/>

            That to the house there may be no access. <lb/>
            This said, into the hall again he pass'd, <lb/>
            And after him his servants. Now the bow <lb/>
            Was in Eurymachus his hand by th' fire. <lb/>
            He warm'd and rubb'd, and did what he could do, <lb n="215"/>
            But for to bend it he was ne'er the nigher. <lb/>
            At this he vex'd, and took it heinously, <lb/>

            'Tis chiefly that I take so much to heart. <lb n="220"/>
            Nor is it for a wife that I complain; <lb/>

            And what I could before now cannot do; <lb n="250"/>
            Whether I still be firm or do relent <lb/>
            With hardship, and with want of looking to. <lb/>
            These words of his made all the suitors mad <lb/>
            With fear that he indeed would bend the bow. <lb/>
            Antinous gave him language very bad. <lb n="255"/>
            Thou wretched stranger, is it not enough <lb/>
            That of our feast thou hast an equal part, <lb/>
            And that of our discourse (and none but thou, <lb/>
            Stranger and beggar) made a bearer art ? <lb/>
            'Tis wine that makes thee not thyself to know ; <lb n="260"/>
            For wine serves all men so that drink too much. <lb/>
            Wine hurt Eurytion, the centaur great; <lb/>
            His carriage in Perithous' house was such, <lb/>
            Among the Lapithæ sitting at meat, <lb/>
            That angry with 't they were, and all arose, <lb n="265"/>
            And with sharp iron cut off both his ears, <lb/>
            And with the same they pared off his nose. <lb/>
            Away the cause of his own harm he bears. <lb/>
            From that day on, centaurs and men are foes. <lb/>
            Themselves men hurt by wine immoderate. <lb n="270"/>
            So if you bend the bow, your ears you’ll lose ; <lb/>
            For you'll find here no prating advocate ; <lb/>
            But to king Takim forthwith you shall go, <lb/>
            And he will of you make a cruel end. <lb/>
            Therefore sit still, and let alone the bow; <lb n="275"/>
            Nor with men younger than yourself contend. <lb/>
            Then, said Penelope, I'd have you know, <lb/>
            Antinous, that you did very ill <lb/>
            To wrong Telemachus his guest. What though <lb/>
            He bend the bow, d'ye think I take him will <lb n="280"/>
            For husband ? I am sure you think not so. <lb/>
            Let none of you be sad with fear of that. <lb/>
            Then to her said Eurymachus, No, no; <lb/>
            That's not the thing that we be troubled at. <lb/>
             <pb n="509"/>
            'Tis of our honour that we jealous be : <note type="margin"> LIB. XXI. </note><note type="margin"> The suitors un­ <lb/>

            For how will men and women, think you, prate; <lb/>
            But that such suitors woo Penelope <lb/>
            As could not bend Ulysses' bow, but that <lb/>
            A beggar that pass'd by by chance could bend it ? <lb/>
            Which unto us will be no little shame. <lb n="290"/>
            Who, said site, live on others' means and spend it, <lb/>
            Should not stand much on honour and on fame; <lb/>
            Besides, this stranger is well made and tall, <lb/>
            And of a great man says he is the son. <lb/>
            Give him the bow to try his strength withal; <lb n="295"/>
            For this I’ll promise him, and see it done: <lb/>
            If he do bend it, I'll on him bestow <lb/>
            Good clothing, and a handsome coat and vest, <lb/>
            Shoes to his feet, dart, sword with edges two, <lb/>
            And send him to such place as he thinks best. <lb n="300"/>
            Then spake to her Telemachus her son: <lb/>
            Mother, to give the bow, or to deny't, <lb/>
            Is in my power, and hinder me can none <lb/>
            In Elis, or Achaia, or here right from <lb/>
            From giving it unto this stranger here, <lb n="305"/>
            If I think fit. But mother, pray go now <lb/>
            Up to your chamber, and look to your work, <lb/>
            And leave to us to dispute of the bow. <lb/>
            She mused on, and thought his counsel wise ; <lb/>
            And being in her chamber sore did weep <lb n="310"/>
            For the absence of her husband, till her eyes <lb/>
            By th' Goddess Pallas closed were with sleep. <lb/>
            Eumæus now had brought the bow about, <lb/>
            And come it was to where Ulysses sat. <lb/>
            The suitors all at once then cried out, <lb n="315"/>
            Swineherd, rogue, lout, what meanest thou by that ? <lb/>
            If the Gods please to favour our design, <lb/>
            Thou shalt be slain and carried out of sight, <lb/>
            And there devoured be by thy own swine. <lb/>
            This put Eumæus into a great fright. <lb n="320"/>
            Telemachus then roar'd on th' other part, <lb/>
            Bear on the bow (t' obey all is not best), <lb/>
            I'll pelt thee, though that thou my elder art, <lb/>
            With stones home to thy hogsties, like a beast; <lb/>
            For I the stronger am. 0 that I were <lb n="325"/>
            But so much stronger than these suitors all, <lb/>
            I soon of some of them the house should clear. <lb/>
            They laugh'd at this, and bated of their gall. <lb/>
            Eumæus then took up the bow agen, <lb/>
            And gave it to Ulysses in his hand. <lb n="330"/>
            This done, Euryclea he called then. <lb/>
            It is, said he, Telemachus' command <lb/>
            To lock the doors all; and that if you hear <lb/>
            Noise in the house of blows, or groaning men, <pb n="510"/>

            Let none go forth, but at their work stay there. <lb n="335"/>
            This said, Euryclea went in agen, <lb/>
            And locked the doors. Philcetius likewise <lb/>
            Went silently and shut the utter gate, <lb/>
            And with a ship-rope that lay by, it ties, <lb/>
            And coming back sits where before he sate; <lb n="340"/>
            And look'd upon Ulysses, who, to know <lb/>
            What work the worms had in his absence made; <lb/>
            This way and that way turning was the bow. <lb/>
            At this the suitors one t' another said, <lb/>
            This beggar surely has no little skill <lb n="345"/>
            In bows or in bow-stealing, or of's own <lb/>
            He has one like 't, or make one like it will, <lb/>
            He doth examine it so up and down. <lb/>
            Another said, As he shall bend the bow, <lb/>
            So let him find, as he is begging alms. <lb n="350"/>
            So mock'd they. When he view'd it had enough, <lb/>
            And holden it awhile had in his palms, <lb/>
            He bent it. As a fiddler does not spend <lb/>
            Very much labour the sheep's gut to strain, <lb/>
            So he, Ulysses his strong bow to bend <lb n="355"/>
            Did put himself to very little pain. <lb/>
            Then with his left hand he the string essay'd; <lb/>
            It sounded like the singing of a swallow. <lb/>
            The suitors then began to be afraid, <lb/>
            And mighty claps of thunder straightway follow. <lb n="360"/>
            Jove's token very welcome was t' Ulysses. <lb/>
            Then to the bow he set a shaft, and there <lb/>
            Sitting, shot through the axes, not one misses. <lb/>
            The rest of th' arrows in the quiver were. <lb/>
            Then turning to Telemachus he said, <lb n="365"/>
            I have not sham'd you, nor have miss'd one axe, <lb/>
            Nor long a bending of the bow I staid: <lb/>
            You see then that the woo'rs me falsely tax. <lb/>
            But now His time for after suppering, <lb/>

            As cups, discourse, and pleasant music bring; <lb/>
            For these of feasting are the common rites. <lb/>
            Then to his son with's eye he beckoned. <lb/>
            Telemachus that well him understood, <lb/>
            With spear in hand and helmet on his head, <lb n="375"/>
            Came unto him, and close by his chair stood.</p><pb n="511"/>

            And spake to th' wooers boasting of his skill. <lb/>
            Suitors, said he, this match is at an end; <lb n="5"/>
            Jove speed me now. Another mark have at, <lb/>
            Which none ere shot at yet. Apollo send <lb/>
            Me luck to hit. As he was saying that, <lb/>
            T' Antinous the shaft he did address, <lb/>
            Who had the cup in's hand about to drink; <lb n="10"/>
            Than of his death he thought of nothing less. <lb/>
            For one amongst so many who would think, <lb/>
            How strong soever, durst do such a thing? <lb/>
            The arrow pierc'd his neck from throat to poll. <lb/>
            The wound received, he turns round staggering; <lb n="15"/>
            The blood stream'd out; away he threw the bowl; <lb/>
            And overturned the table with his feet; <lb/>
            Both bread and meat lay scatter'd in the hall. <lb/>
            The suitors bustle and in clusters meet, <lb/>
            Of this great man amazed at the fall. <lb n="20"/>
            Then one of them unto Ulysses said: <lb/>
            Stranger, this was ill shot; thou killed hast <lb/>
            The greatest man in Ithaca. Thou'st plaid <lb/>
            Thy last prize. To the crows thou shalt be cast. <lb/>
            But yet they held their hands; for why, they thought <lb n="25"/>
            'Twas done by misadventure, not contriv'd; <lb/>
            For, proud and foolish, they perceived not <lb/>
            The fatal hour was to them all arriv'd. <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses, with a sullen eye, <lb/>
            Dogs, dead you thought me, and spent my estate; <lb n="30"/>
            With you my woman you compell’d to lie; <lb/>
            And would have wedded, whilst I liv'd, my mate. <lb/>
            No fear you had neither of Gods on high, <lb/>
            Nor of revenge from any mortal man; <lb/>
            But now a vengeance to you all is nigh. <lb n="35"/>
            At this they frighted were, and looked wan; <lb/>
            And each one peep'd about what way to take <lb/>
            To save his own life, if he could, by flight. <lb/>
            None but Eurymachus t' Ulysses spake: <lb/>
            If you Ulysses be, you say but right; <lb n="40"/>
            Much harm is done you both in house and field; <lb/>
            But this Antinous author was of't all; <lb/>
            He set us on, and here lies justly killed. <lb/>
            For wedding of your wife his care was small. <pb n="512"/>

            His care was how to make himself here king <lb n="45"/>
            (Which Jove not suffer'd him to bring to pass); <lb/>
            And to destruction how your son to bring, <lb/>
            He chiefly thinking and designing was. <lb/>
            And since that he deservedly is slain, <lb/>
            Spare your own people; we'll repair what's done, <lb n="50"/>
            And what is spent we will make up again, <lb/>
            And recompense with twenty cows each one; <lb/>
            And brass and gold till you be satisfied; <lb/>
            If not, there's no man can your anger blame. <lb/>
            To this Ulysses with a sour look replied: <lb n="55"/>
            Your whole estates, and added to the same <lb/>
            How much soever you can elsewhere get, <lb/>
            Too little is to bind me to desist, <lb/>
            Until the suitors shall have paid their debt. <lb/>
            Two ways before you lie, take which you list, <lb n="60"/>
            To fight or fly, if you will death avoid ; <lb/>
            But fly, I think you cannot. So said he. <lb/>
            Eurymachus then to the suitors said: <lb/>
            The man will not lay down his bow you see; <lb/>
            But since 'tis in his hand, and arrows by, <lb n="65"/>
            And stands upon the threshold of the door, <lb/>
            His shafts will fly at us continually, <lb/>
            And till we are all slain will not give o'er: <lb/>
            Let's therefore take up tables for defence <lb/>
            Against his shafts, and, sword, in hand, run all <lb n="70"/>
            Unto the door at once and drive him thence, <lb/>
            And people of the town together call. <lb/>
            This said, his sword with double edge he drew, <lb/>
            And thundered him with words; but howsoever, <lb/>
            A deadly shaft first from Ulysses flew <lb n="75"/>
            That enter'd at his breast and stuck in's liver. <lb/>
            Down fell his sword, he turns himself quite round, <lb/>
            And throws his blood about him every way; <lb/>
            Kicks down the table, meat and cup, to th' ground, <lb/>
            And with his brow beating the floor he lay; <lb n="80"/>
            And sprawling made the seat shake with his feet, <lb/>
            And endless darkness lay upon his eye. <lb/>
            Then rose Amphinomus and death did meet, <lb/>
            He thought from thence to make Ulysses fly, <lb/>
            But by Telemachus prevented was, <lb n="85"/>
            That slew him with his spear upon the place. <lb/>
            From back to breast the well-thrown spear did pass; <lb/>
            Down with a thump he falls upon his face. <lb/>
            Telemachus i' th' body left the spear. <lb/>
            For why, he had good reason to mistrust <lb n="90"/>
            Amongst so many swords, if he staid there, <lb/>
            He might be killed by some blow or thrust. <lb/>
            Then to his father, as he by him stood, <lb/>
            To fetch down arms, said he, 'Twill do no harm, <lb/>
             <pb n="513"/>
            Two spears, a buckler, and a helmet good, <note type="margin"> LID. XXII. </note><note type="margin"> The killing <lb/>

            And both Philœtius and Eumæus arm. <lb/>
            Run quickly, said Ulysses, while there be <lb/>
            Arrows remaining, lest they force me should <lb/>
            To quit the door. Then quickly up ran he <lb/>
            Unto the room wherein the armour stood. <lb n="100"/>
            Eight spears, four bucklers, and four helmets good <lb/>
            He took, and to his father came again. <lb/>
            And first he arm'd himself, and ready stood; <lb/>
            The two good servants themselves armed then. <lb/>
            Ulysses' arrows, till they all were gone, <lb n="105"/>
            Kill'd each his man, and one by one they fall; <lb/>
            But when they all were spent and left was none, <lb/>
            He sets his bow to lean against the wall. <lb/>
            Over his shoulder he his buckler cast, <lb/>
            And puts his well-made helmet on his head. <lb n="110"/>
            The two spears with his hand he griped fast, <lb/>
            And then his posture he considered. <lb/>
            There was i' th' wall a certain window high, <lb/>
            By th' sill whereof a way lay to the street, <lb/>
            To which he bade Eumæus have an eye, <lb n="115"/>
            And near it stand. But one way was to it. <lb/>
            Then Angelaus to the suitors said, <lb/>
            Why does not some man to that window haste, <lb/>
            And to the people cry aloud for aid, <lb/>
            That so this shooter may have shot his last ? <lb n="120"/>
            Then, said Melantheus, No, no, 'tis in vain; <lb/>
            The street-door and the court-gate stand so close, <lb/>
            That one good man the place may well maintain <lb/>
            Against how many s' ever them oppose. <lb/>
            But well, I'll fetch you armour to put on, <lb n="125"/>
            And weapons I will bring you out of hand; <lb/>
            For where they by Ulysses and his son <lb/>
            Were laid, I know the room and where they stand. <lb/>
            Then up he went; twelve bucklers he brings thence, <lb/>
            As many spears, as many helmets too. <lb n="130"/>
            The suitors then prepared for their defence. <lb/>
            And now Ulysses knew not what to do; <lb/>
            But to Telemachus he turn'd and said, <lb/>
            Th'ill women sure, or else Melantheus has <lb/>
            For th' wooers gotten arms, and us betray'd. <lb n="135"/>
            No, father, answered he, my fault it was; <lb/>
            The door I left unlock'd, and but put to, <lb/>
            Which somebody observ'd. Eumaeus, now <lb/>
            Go lock it fast. Withal consider who, <lb/>
            The women or Melantheus serv'd us so. <lb n="140"/>
            Whilst thus they talk, Melantheus went once more <lb/>
            To fetch down arms ; Eumæus saw him then, <lb/>
            And told Ulysses: Him we thought before <lb/>
            To be the man, is thither gone agen. <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> L L </note> <pb n="514"/>

            What you think fit for all his villainy? <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses, We two will be sure, <lb/>
            Telemachus and I, to keep these men <lb/>
            From going out, and therefore, go you two <lb n="150"/>
            And bind his hands and feet together ; then <lb/>
            Betwixt his body and his legs put through <lb/>
            A rope, and at his back tie boards, and so <lb/>
            Close to a pillar hoise him up on high <lb/>
            Unto the beams of th' house, that he may know <lb n="155"/>
            His fault, and feel his pain before he die. <lb/>
            Then up they went, and stood without the door, <lb/>
            On each side one. Melantheus was within, <lb/>
            At the far end, looking for armour more; <lb/>
            And after there he long enough had been, <lb n="160"/>
            Out with an helmet in one hand he came, <lb/>
            A buckler in the other, great, but torn; <lb/>
            Laertes in his youth had borne the same, <lb/>
            But now with lying it was mouldy worn. <lb/>
            As he came out, they seiz'd him suddenly, <lb n="165"/>
            And in again they dragg'd him by the hair, <lb/>
            And then his hands unto his feet they tie, <lb/>
            And up they hoise him, as they bidden were. <lb/>
            This done, Eumæus said unto him jeering, <lb/>
            In that soft bed, Melantheus, easily <lb n="170"/>
            You will observe the morning's first appearing, <lb/>
            That for the woo'rs your goats may ready be. <lb/>
            Then armed both, and locking up the door, <lb/>
            And breathing courage, to Ulysses come; <lb/>
            So that on the threshold there were four; <lb n="175"/>
            But many were the suitors in the room. <lb/>
            Then down unto Ulysses Pallas came, <lb/>
            In Mentor's shape, to whom Ulysses said, <lb/>
            You are my friend, and our age is the same; <lb/>
            For old acquaintance let me have your aid. <lb n="180"/>
            Though thus he said, he thought it Pallas still. <lb/>
            The suitors clamour'd; Agelaus spake: <lb/>
            Mentor, beware, the course you take is ill, <lb/>
            Against us all Ulysses' part to take; <lb/>
            For 'tis our purpose when these two are slain, <lb n="185"/>
            Father and son, that you the next shall be, <lb/>
            And of your rashness suffer shall the pain, <lb/>
            And with his substance your own mix will we; <lb/>
            Nor shall your sons, daughters, or wife live here. <lb/>
            Pallas was angry at these words of his, <lb n="190"/>
            And chid Ulysses then, and ask'd him where <lb/>
            His courage was. And what, said she, is this <lb/>
            The man that bravely fought nine years at Troy, <lb/>
            And kill'd in fight so many gallant men, <lb/>
             <pb n="515"/>
            And he whose prudence did the town destroy, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXII. </note><note type="margin"> The killing <lb/>
            of the wooers. </note> <lb n="195"/>
            And whines so at his coming home again? <lb/>
            Come hither, milksop, says she, stand by me, <lb/>
            And how your old friend Mentor shall requite <lb/>
            The kindness you have shown him, you shall see. <lb/>
            Yet presently she would not end the fight; <lb n="200"/>
            For further yet she would the courage try <lb/>
            Both of Ulysses and Telemachus, <lb/>
            And in a swallow's shape she up did fly, <lb/>
            And sat upon a black beam of the house. <lb/>
            Meanwhile the suitors by Agelaus, <lb n="205"/>
            Amphimedon and Demoptolemus, <lb/>
            Eurynomus, Pisandrus, Polybus, <lb/>
            The best bf all the suitors in the house, <lb/>
            (For many had been killed with the bow) <lb/>
            Encourag'd were: Friends, said he, let's be bold, <lb n="210"/>
            And at them all our good spears let us throw ; <lb/>
            So shall we make the man his hands to hold; <lb/>
            Mentor with theirs his fortune will not mix, <lb/>
            He and those hopes are gone; upon the sill <lb/>
            There are but four; Let's throw at once but six, <lb n="215"/>
            That if Jove please, we may Ulysses kill. <lb/>
            When he is gone, the rest we need not fear. <lb/>
            The suitors all approved this advice, <lb/>
            And then they lanced ev'ry man his spear; <lb/>
            But Pallas made it fall out otherwise; <lb n="220"/>
            For from the beam she soon blew here and there <lb/>
            The flying staves, whereof one hit the door; <lb/>
            The two side-posts and the walls wounded were. <lb/>
            When of the spears the danger was past o'er, <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses, Now our turn it is <lb n="225"/>
            To cast our spears at this unruly rout, <lb/>
            That, not content with former injuries, <lb/>
            Do what they can to take our lives to boot. <lb/>
            This said, and taking aim, their spears they threw. <lb/>
            Ulysses killed Demoptolemus. <lb n="230"/>
            Telemachus Euryades then slew; <lb/>
            Eumæus with his spear kill'd Elatus; <lb/>
            Pisandrus by Philœtius was slain. <lb/>
            The suitors then to the room's end retreat, <lb/>
            And to the four gave time to take again <lb n="235"/>
            The spears that in the wounds were sticking yet. <lb/>
            Again they lanced ev'ry man his spear. <lb/>
            The swallow on the beam still puts them by, <lb/>
            And by the door, walls, posts, received they were. <lb/>
            Telemachus and Eumæus only <lb n="240"/>
            Had little scratches; one upon his wrist; <lb/>
            Eumseus on the shoulder: but the skin <lb/>
            Scarce broken was; and both the other mist. <lb/>
            And then the four amongst the throng threw in <note type="footnote"> L L 2 </note> <pb n="516"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XXII. </note><note type="margin"> The killing <lb/>

            Their spears again; and then Ulysses slew <lb n="245"/>
            Eurydamus; and by Telemachus <lb/>
            Was slain Amphimedon; Eumæus threw, <lb/>
            And killed Poly bus; Philœtius <lb/>
            Then smote Cressipus, and through pierc'd his breast, <lb/>
            And over him insulting thus he said: <lb n="250"/>
            Bold Prætor, that in love art with thy jest, <lb/>
            And to say anything art not afraid, <lb/>
            For the cow's-foot t' Ulysses thrown, take that. <lb/>
            Ulysses kill'd too Damastorides; <lb/>
            Telemachus Leiocrates laid flat <lb n="255"/>
            With spear in hand. When they had killed these, <lb/>
            Pallas aloft held forth her frightful shield; <lb/>
            And then, as cattle, stung with a gad-fly, <lb/>
            In heat of summer run about the field, <lb/>
            So round about the hall the suitors fly; <lb n="260"/>
            As when the vultures stoop down from the hill <lb/>
            Upon the fowl, these couch close to the plain, <lb/>
            Threatened with heavy clouds, they slay and kill, <lb/>
            These cannot fly away, nor turn again, <lb/>
            So they upon the suitors fiercely fall, <lb n="265"/>
            And winding with them, as they shift their ground. <lb/>
            They killing went; all gore-blood was the hall, <lb/>
            And made with thumps and groans a dismal sound. <lb/>
            Leiodes then kneel'd at Ulysses' feet <lb/>
            To be- his life. I came, said he, as priest, <lb n="270"/>
            And told them their behaviour was unmeet, <lb/>
            And always gave them counsel to desist; <lb/>
            But nothing that I said would they obey, <lb/>
            And of their own destruction authors are. <lb/>
            There's not a woman in the house can say <lb n="275"/>
            I did amiss. Must I like these men fare? <lb/>
            To this Ulysses with a sour look said, <lb/>
            Did you come with the suitors as their priest? <lb/>
            Then surely for them you have also pray'd, <lb/>
            That of my coming home I should have miss'd, <lb n="280"/>
            That with these men you daily might here board <lb/>
            Yourself, your wife, and children. Therefore die. <lb/>
            With that he took up Agelaus' sword, <lb/>
            Which, when he died, fell from him and lay by. <lb/>
            And with it at a stroke cut off his head. <lb n="285"/>
            But Phemius, the minstrel, 'scaped free, <lb/>
            For thither he came not for meat or bread: <lb/>
            The suitors forced him of necessity. <lb/>
            He had his fiddle in his hand, and stood <lb/>
            Within the door, and studied what to do, <lb n="290"/>
            Whether unto Ulysses go he should, <lb/>
            Or out a door unto the altar go <lb/>
            I'th' court, whereon with many a fat beast <lb/>
            Ulysses oft devoutly had serv'd Jove; <lb/>
             <pb n="517"/>
            And having paus'd, at last he thought it best <note type="margin"> LIB. XXII. </note><note type="margin"> The killing <lb/>
            of the wooers. </note> <lb n="295"/>
            To go t' Ulysses and his mercy prove. <lb/>
            Then down he laid his fiddle on the floor, <lb/>
            Between the temp'rer and a studded chair, <lb/>
            Then went and fell upon his knees before <lb/>
            Ulysses, and thus to him made his prayer: <lb n="300"/>
            Save me, Ulysses, and consider that <lb/>
            If you me slay, it after you will grieve. <lb/>
            I am a singer, but was never taught; <lb/>
            For song to me the Gods did freely give. <lb/>
            I sing to Gods and men, and have the skill <lb n="305"/>
            To sing to you as to a God; therefore, <lb/>
            Of cutting off my head lay by the will. <lb/>
            Besides, Telemachus can tell you more; <lb/>
            I was not hither drawn with smell of roast, <lb/>
            But many men and strong brought me by force. <lb n="310"/>
            Telemachus, that knew this was no boast, <lb/>
            Cried out, Hold father, 'tis not our best course <lb/>
            To slay the innocent, and I would fain <lb/>
            Save Medon too, that lov'd me from a boy, <lb/>
            And took care of me, if he be not slain <lb n="315"/>
            By coming in your or your servants' way. <lb/>
            Under a seat Medon himself had laid, <lb/>
            And wrapp'd himself up in a raw cow-hide, <lb/>
            And hearing what Telemachus had said, <lb/>
            Skipp'd nimbly out, his cow-skin cast aside, <lb n="320"/>
            And falling at Telemachus his knee, <lb/>
            lie to him said, 0 friend, lo here I stand; <lb/>
            Forbear, I pray, and to your father be <lb/>
            A means that also he may hold his hand; <lb/>
            For whilst his anger 'gainst the suitors staid, <lb n="325"/>
            That wasted have his goods, and him despis'd, <lb/>
            Killing each way about him, I'm afraid <lb/>
            He might perhaps kill me too unadvis'd. <lb/>
            Ulysses hearing, answered thus agen: <lb/>
            Take courage, man, there is no danger nigh, <lb n="330"/>
            And this remember, and tell other men, <lb/>
            That justice better thrives than knavery. <lb/>
            Go now into the court, and stay without, <lb/>
            Both you and Phemius, that I may do <lb/>
            The bus'ness in the house I am about. <lb n="335"/>
            Then out into the court away they go, <lb/>
            And on the altar of the God they sat, <lb/>
            Looking about, still fearing to be slain. <lb/>
            Ulysses, to be sure that none remain <lb/>
            Alive, and under seats or tables squat, <lb n="340"/>
            Search'd well the hall, and found they all were dead, <lb/>
            As fishes on the shore lie out, and by <lb/>
            The heat of Phaethon be murdered, <lb/>
            So did the woo'rs one on another lie. <pb n="518"/>
            <note type="margin"> LID. XXII. </note><note type="margin"> The killing <lb/>

            Then to Telemachus Ulysses said, <lb n="345"/>
            Tell Euryclea I would speak with her. <lb/>
            Telemachus his father straight obeyed, <lb/>
            And scraped at the door that she might hear. <lb/>
            Nurse, says he, mother of the maids, come out, <lb/>
            My father to you somewhat has to say. <lb n="350"/>
            She heard him well, and presently, without <lb/>
            More words, the door she open'd with her key; <lb/>
            And found Ulysses standing ’mongst the dead, <lb/>
            Besmeared with blood, as when a lion has <lb/>
            Upon a cow at pasture newly fed, <lb n="355"/>
            With goary breast and chaps, so dight he was. <lb/>
            Th' old woman there beholding so much blood, <lb/>
            And carcases so many lying dead, <lb/>
            At such a mighty work amazed stood, <lb/>
            And was about to whoop, but hindered <lb n="360"/>
            Was by Ulysses. Hold, said he, within <lb/>
            Your joy, and let it not appear in vain; <lb/>
            To glory over dead men is a sin. <lb/>
            These men the Gods and their own sins have slain. <lb/>
            For neither from above they fear'd the Gods, <lb n="365"/>
            Nor men respected good or bad beneath, <lb/>
            And therefore now have felt the heavenly rods, <lb/>
            And brought upon themselves untimely death. <lb/>
            But tell me, nurse, how many women be <lb/>
            That me dishonour and do wickedness. <lb n="370"/>
            Fifty, says she, do serve Penelope, <lb/>
            And learn to work and wait, no more nor less; <lb/>
            Of these there twelve be that are impudent, <lb/>
            And care not for me, nor Penelope; <lb/>
            Telemachus was young: the government <lb n="375"/>
            To him of maids might not well trusted be. <lb/>
            But now I'll to my lady's chamber go, <lb/>
            Where she's asleep, some God has closed her eyes, <lb/>
            To tell her you are here. But he said, No; <lb/>
            First call those women who do me despise, <lb n="380"/>
            And have behaved themselves dishonestly. <lb/>
            Euryclea obeys, and goes her way, <lb/>
            And call'd those women. Come away, said she, <lb/>
            Telemachus i' th' hall does for you stay. <lb/>
            Meanwhile Ulysses call'd Telemachus <lb n="385"/>
            Unto him, and his faithful servants two, <lb/>
            Trusty Eumæus and Philœtius. <lb/>
            Hear me, said he, what I would have you do, <lb/>
            Make these lewd woman carry hence the dead, <lb/>
            The chairs and tables in the hall make clean, <lb n="390"/>
            And when that bus'ness they have finished, <lb/>
            Into the court make them go forth again, <lb/>
            Into that narrow place'twixt th'house and hedge; <lb/>
            Till they forget the suitors' venery, <lb/>
             <pb n="519"/>
            Make them of your sharp swords to feel the edge, <note type="margin"> LID. XXII. </note><note type="margin"> The killing <lb/>

            And for their stol'n unclean delight to die. <lb/>
            Then came the women down into the hall <lb/>
            Wailing, and tears abundantly they shed, <lb/>
            And presently unto their work they fall. <lb/>
            Into the porch they carry out the dead. <lb n="400"/>
            Ulysses giving order standeth by. <lb/>
            Telemachus then and Philœtius, <lb/>
            Also Eumæus, do with shovels ply <lb/>
            The pavement daub'dwith blood,and cleanse the house <lb/>
            Scraping together dust and blood; and that <lb n="405"/>
            The women also carry out a door. <lb/>
            But when this bus'ness now an end was at, <lb/>
            There rested for them yet one bus'ness more. <lb/>
            They brought them thence into the narrow place, <lb/>
            From whence there was no hope at all to fly. <lb n="410"/>
            You, said Telemachus, for the disgrace <lb/>
            Done to me and my mother, must not die <lb/>
            An honest death. This having said, he streteh'd <lb/>
            Between two pillars high a great strong rope, <lb/>
            That with their feet the ground could not be reach'd; <lb n="415"/>
            Hung there, they sprawl'd awhile, but could not drop. <lb/>
            Then down they dragged Melantheus, and his nose <lb/>
            And ears with cruel steel from's head they tear, <lb/>
            And brake his arms and legs with many blows, <lb/>
            And to the dogs to eat they throw his gear. <lb n="420"/>
            Their work now done, they washed their hands and feet, <lb/>
            And to Ulysses in the hall they went, <lb/>
            Who having found the place not very sweet, <lb/>
            For brimstone called to take away the scent. <lb/>
            Euryclea, said he, fetch brimstone hither, <lb n="425"/>
            And fire, and also wake Penelope, <lb/>
            And bid her maids come to me altogether, <lb/>
            But hasten them to come. Then answer'd she, <lb/>
            Dear child, 'tis well said. But first let me go <lb/>

            These rags become you not. Then said he, No. <lb/>
            Bring me fire first, and after do the rest. <lb/>
            The fire she brought and brimstone presently, <lb/>
            Wherewith he aired both the court and hall, <lb/>
            The nurse then up goes to the rooms on high <lb n="435"/>
            To call the maids. T' Ulysses they came all. <lb/>
            They weep and sob, and all embrace Ulysses, <lb/>
            And kiss his head and shoulders, shake his hand; <lb/>
            And he again saluteth them with kisses. <lb/>
            Weeping for joy, they all about him stand. <lb n="440"/>

            To wake Penelope, and let her know <lb/>
            Her husband was returned. Her joy amended <lb/>
            Much had her pace, and well she ambled now; <lb/>
            And standing at her head, Rise, child, said she; <lb n="5"/>
            The Gods at last have granted you your wishes. <lb/>
            Come down into the hall, where you shall see <lb/>
            The so long by you wish'd-for man, Ulysses. <lb/>
            The suitors he has killed ev'ry one, <lb/>
            Who needs the stewards of his house would be, <lb n="10"/>
            In despite of Telemachus, his son; <lb/>
            And live upon his substance lavishly. <lb/>
            To her again Penelope thus spake: <lb/>
            The Gods, Euryclea, sure have made you mad. <lb/>
            The Gods can wise men fools, and fools wise make. <lb n="15"/>
            The Gods have done you hurt, more wit you had. <lb/>
            You do me wrong, that know how little sleep <lb/>
            I have enjoyed since he went to Troy. <lb/>
            I never so well slept since, but still weep, <lb/>
            And now you come and wake me with a toy. <lb n="20"/>
            Be gone, ift had been any maid but you, <lb/>
            I should have sent her not well pleas'd away, <lb/>
            But to your age some more respect is due; <lb/>
            Go down again into the house you may. <lb/>
            Dear child, said she, I mock not, for His true. <lb n="25"/>
            Ulysses is i' th* house. That stranger's he. <lb/>
            Telemachus and no man else him knew; <lb/>
            And known to others would not let him be, <lb/>
            Till they these proud and naughty men had kill'd. <lb/>
            Penelope then starting from the bed <lb n="30"/>
            Embraced the nurse; her eyes with tears were fill'd. <lb/>
            And, as yet doubtful, still she questioned. <lb/>
            Euryclea, is all this true you say? <lb/>
            Is he indeed come home? Be serious. <lb/>
            How could he the proud suitors all destroy, <lb n="35"/>
            He being but one, they many in the house? <lb/>
            Nor saw, nor ask'd I, but I heard the groans <lb/>
            Of dying men; for up we were all shut <lb/>
            Within our doors, and locked up all at once, <lb/>
            And of our lives into a fear were put, <lb n="40"/>
            Till me, your son, Telemachus, call'd out <lb/>
            To come t' Ulysses. In the hall he stood, <lb/>
            And there in heaps the slain lay him about, <lb/>
            That like a lion stood besmear'd with blood; <lb/>
             <pb n="521"/>
            You would have joy'd to see him. Now they lie <note type="margin"> LID. XXIII </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses makes <lb/>

            In th court all in one heap. But busy he <lb/>
            Is airing of the house, a great fire by, <lb/>
            And for to call you hither has sent me. <lb/>
            But come, that in each other you may joy, <lb/>
            For now at last your wishes granted be. <lb n="50"/>
            Ulysses come, your son is past a boy, <lb/>
            And their revenge upon the woo'rs they see. <lb/>
            Nurse, answered she, triumph not out of season. <lb/>
            For to be glad to see him in the house, <lb/>
            You know there none is that have so much reason <lb n="55"/>
            As I have, and our son, Telemachus. <lb/>
            But 'tis not truth you tell me. What you say <lb/>
            Will come at last to nothing else but this, <lb/>
            It was some God that did the suitors slay, <lb/>
            Hating the sight of what they did amiss. <lb n="60"/>
            There never man came to them that can boast <lb/>
            He parted from them without injuries; <lb/>
            So by their wickedness their lives they lost; <lb/>
            Ulysses may have perish'd for all this. <lb/>
            Euryclea to this again replied, <lb n="65"/>
            Dear child, what words are these that from you come ? <lb/>
            Ulysses stands i'th' hall at the fire's side, <lb/>
            And yet you say he never will come home. <lb/>
            But well, I'll tell you now a surer sign: <lb/>
            When I was washing of his legs and feet, <lb n="70"/>
            I saw where th' wound was giv'n him by the swine; <lb/>
            And had then told you had he thought it meet; <lb/>
            But with his hand, for that cause, stopp'd my breath. <lb/>
            Come, I will lay my life on't willingly; <lb/>
            If it be false, put me to cruel death. <lb n="75"/>
            To this Penelope did then reply: <lb/>
            The purpose of the Gods, wise though you be, <lb/>
            You know not, nurse; but I'll go to my son, <lb/>
            And there upon the place with him I'll see <lb/>
            What men are slain, and who the deed has done. <lb n="80"/>
            Then down she went, consulting in her breast, <lb/>
            Whether at distance it were best to try, <lb/>
            Or else directly go unto the guest, <lb/>
            And there receive and kiss him presently. <lb/>
            But when into the hall she enter'd was, <lb n="85"/>
            Where sitting was Ulysses, in the light <lb/>
            Of a good fire, she went and took a place <lb/>
            That was to where he sat just opposite. <lb/>
            Ulysses look'd o' th' ground, expecting what <lb/>
            His wife would say, but long time she spake not; <lb n="90"/>
            But gazing on her husband, mute she sate, <lb/>
            As one that's in a trance, and has no thought: <lb/>
            But by-and-bye, surveying him, she thought <lb/>
            'Twas he; but seeing him so ill-array'd, <pb n="522"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIII. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses makes <lb/>
            himself known <lb/>
            to Penelope. </note> <lb/>
            Her mind was chang'd; she thought that he 'twas not. <lb n="95"/>
            Telemachus his mother chid, and said, <lb/>
            Mother, hard-hearted mother, and unkind, <lb/>
            Why sit you at such distance from my father, <lb/>
            And have so little care to know his mind? <lb/>
            When many questions you should ask him rather. <lb n="100"/>
            Another woman would not keep off so <lb/>
            From her own husband that away had staid <lb/>
            Twenty years long, and suffer'd so much woe, <lb/>
            But at their meeting somewhat would hare said. <lb/>
            Son, said she then, I am astonish'd so, <lb n="105"/>
            I cannot speak, nor look him in the face; <lb/>
            But whether he Ulysses be or no, <lb/>
            I shall be certain in a little space, <lb/>
            For we have signs between us of our own, <lb/>
            Which we shall soon know one another by, <lb n="110"/>
            That to none living but ourselves are known. <lb/>
            Ulysses to his son then smilingly <lb/>
            Said, Let, Telemachus, your mother try me, <lb/>
            Perhaps she know me better will anon. <lb/>
            The cause why now so little she sets by me, <lb n="115"/>
            Is that I have ill-favour'd garments on. <lb/>
            But now let you and I look well about. <lb/>
            Who kills one man, unless great friends he have, <lb/>
            Must leave his kin and country, and go out; <lb/>
            But we have kill'd both many men and brave, <lb n="120"/>
            Therefore, consider what is to be done. <lb/>
            Father, said he, let that be your own care; <lb/>
            So wise as you are, men say there is none. <lb/>
            Our hands to do your pleasure ready are. <lb/>
            Why then, I'll tell you what is best to do: <lb n="125"/>
            Put on your coats, and let the women all <lb/>
            Into the hall in their best garments go; <lb/>
            The minstrel play; and they to dancing fall; <lb/>
            That he that stands without, or dwelleth nigh <lb/>
            Unto the house, or travelleth that way, <lb n="130"/>
            When he shall hear such mirth and melody, <lb/>
            May think, This surely is the wedding-day. <lb/>
            That so before this slaughter Fame have spread, <lb/>
            Depart we may from hence into the field, <lb/>
            And 'gainst the people of the town make head, <lb n="135"/>
            And take such counsel more as Jove shall yield. <lb/>
            When this was said, the men their coats put on; <lb/>
            The damsels dress themselves, the minstrel sung <lb/>
            And played upon his fiddle, and each one <lb/>
            To dancing fell, with it the palace rung. <lb n="140"/>
            And one that heard this as he stood without, <lb/>
            Said to another by him, She is married. <lb/>
            Fie, fie, she could no longer now hold out. <lb/>
            So, said he, ignorant how things were carried. <lb/>
             <pb n="523"/>
            Meanwhile Ulysses bath'd and ointed is <note type="margin"> LIB. LXIII. </note><note type="margin"> Ulysses makes <lb/>
            himself known <lb/>

            B' Eurynome, and also richly clad <lb/>
            With a fair robe and coat; and beside this, <lb/>
            Taller and greater Pallas made him had, <lb/>
            And varnished with black his curled head. <lb/>
            As one by Vulcan and Athena taught, <lb n="150"/>
            Gold upon silver skilfully had spread, <lb/>
            So Pallas on Ulysses' beauty wrought. <lb/>
            Then from the bath he like a God came in, <lb/>
            And sat him down before his wife again; <lb/>
            And with her to discourse did thus begin: <lb n="155"/>
            Woman, said he, to speak to you is vain; <lb/>
            Above all women hardened is your heart. <lb/>
            What woman else that had her husband seen <lb/>
            After twice ten years' absence, thus apart <lb/>
            From him to sit, contented would have been ? <lb n="160"/>
            Make me a bed, nurse; what should I do here ? <lb/>
            Man, said Penelope, nor mightily <lb/>
            I magnify nor scorn you ; what you were <lb/>
            When you went hence, full well remember I: <lb/>
            But go, nurse, make for him the bed that he <lb n="165"/>
            Himself fram'd, by the chamber-door without. <lb/>
            Thus said she, but to try if that were he, <lb/>
            Yet griev'd him to the heart, and made him doubt. <lb/>
            Woman, said he, who has remov'd my bed ? <lb/>
            It cannot be but by a force divine. <lb n="170"/>
            With my own hands 'twas wrought and finished, <lb/>
            To th' end thereby it might be known for mine. <lb/>
            I' th' court an olive-tree stood great and tall, <lb/>
            Thick as a pillar. I about it made <lb/>
            A chamber. Of good stone I made the wall; <lb n="175"/>
            And cutting off the boughs the roof I laid; <lb/>
            And in the wall a good strong door I form. <lb/>
            When this was done, I cut up by the root, <lb/>
            And smooth'd with iron tools a lusty corm, <lb/>
            And setting it upright, fix'd the bed to't, <lb n="180"/>
            And pierc'd the wood with wimbles where 'twas meet; <lb/>
            And laid on silver, gold, and ivory. <lb/>
            A purple thong unto the door I fit. <lb/>
            This is the sign for you to know me by. <lb/>
            Whether it still remain I cannot tell, <lb n="185"/>
            Or ta'en away and down be cut the tree. <lb/>
            This said, and she the sign rememb'ring well, <lb/>
            The tears roll'd from her eyes. Thus weeping, she <lb/>
            Acknowledgeth and runneth to Ulysses ; <lb/>
            About his neck her milk-white arms she lays, <lb n="190"/>
            And both his shoulders and his head she kisses, <lb/>
            And, 0 Ulysses, be not angry, says, <lb/>
            The Gods have giv'n you wisdom, but denied <lb/>

            Take it not ill I have you thus far tried; <lb n="195"/>
            Since horror hath possessed my mind alway, <lb/>
            Lest some deceitful man (for such there be <lb/>
            Too many in the world) should hither come, <lb/>
            And flatt'ring, bring me into infamy. <lb/>
            Helen of Argos would have staid at home, <lb n="200"/>
            And not gone with th' adulterer of Troy, <lb/>
            Had she consider'd that th' Achæan lords <lb/>
            Might chance to come and fetch her thence away <lb/>
            Again into her country with their swords. <lb/>
            This speech inflam'd his love, and wet his eyes. <lb n="205"/>
            As a man shipwrecked swimming for his life, <lb/>
            Rejoiceth when the land he near him spies; <lb/>
            So welcome was Ulysses to his wife. <lb/>
            She hung upon him still, nor had let go <lb/>
            Till morning, but for Pallas, who would not <lb n="210"/>
            Let Phaeton and Iampus, th' horses two <lb/>
            That draw the Morn, be set to the chariot. <lb/>
            Then said Ulysses to Penelope, <lb/>
            O wife ! my troubles ended are not yet; <lb/>
            For still there many more remaining be; <lb n="215"/>
            Long time 'twill be ere to the end I get. <lb/>
            Tiresius did tell me this in hell, <lb/>
            When I went thither of his ghost to know, <lb/>
            Whether I with my mates should come home well, <lb/>
            Or not to Ithaca again, and how. <lb n="220"/>
            But come, 'tis bedtime, let us satisfy <lb/>
            Ourselves with sleep. Then said Penelope, <lb/>
            Your bed made ready shall be presently: <lb/>
            But since you mention'd have the prophecy, <lb/>
            Tell me what said Tiresias. I know <lb n="225"/>
            You'll tell it me one time or other, why, <lb/>
            If you will, may you not tell me it now? <lb/>
            To this Ulysses did again reply: <lb/>
            Because you long to know 't, I tell you then ; <lb/>
            Tiresias advised me to go <lb n="230"/>
            With oar on shoulder to a place where men <lb/>
            Inhabit, that the briny sea not know, <lb/>
            Nor ever mingle salt with what they eat, <lb/>
            Nor ever saw the ship with crimson face, <lb/>
            Nor yet those wings which do the water beat <lb n="235"/>
            (Called oars), to make the good ship go apace. <lb/>
            Now mark me well. When you shall meet a man, <lb/>
            Just at the end of Neptune's utmost bound, <lb/>
            Bearing upon his shoulder a corn-fan, <lb/>
            Stick down your lusty oar upon the ground; <lb n="240"/>
            There sacrifice to the world's admiral, <lb/>
            For new admittance, a ram, boar, and bull; <lb/>
            Then home again, and offer unto all <lb/>
            The Gods by name a hundred oxen full. <lb/>

            Then, said Penelope. If this be all, <lb/>

            The sorrow yet to come can be but small. <lb/>

            Ulysses and Penelope their joy <lb/>
            Converted had into a new content; <lb/>
            She to Ulysses telleth the annoy <lb/>
            She suffer'd from her suitors impudent; <lb/>
            What havoc they had made of cows and sheep, <lb n="265"/>
            And many barrels of her wine had wasted. <lb/>
            And he to her, what hurt o' th' land and deep <lb/>
            He done and suffer'd had. While his tale lasted <lb/>
            Well pleas'd she was, and had no list to sleep. <lb/>
            He told her how the Cicons he had beaten; <lb n="270"/>
            How Late from love of home his men did keep; <lb/>
            How Cyclops his companions had eaten; <lb/>
            And in revenge how he had made him blind; <lb/>
            How, to convey him home he did obtain <lb/>
            Of Æolus a leather-bag of wind, <lb n="275"/>
            Which breaking prison blew him back again ; <lb/>
            And how in Læstrigonia he lost <lb/>
            His good ships all but one, in which he was; <lb/>
            Told her the wiles of Circe; what the Ghost <lb/>
            In Hell said to him of Tiresias, <lb n="280"/>
            To whom he went his fortune for to know, <lb/>
            In a black ship ; and with his mother there <lb/>
            Discoursed; and saw many a one laid low <lb/>
            That in the Argive host had been his peer; <lb/>
            And how he heard the tempting Sirens sing <lb n="285"/>
            In concert, and scap'd safely by; and how <lb/>
            By th' shifting rocks, Charybdis vomiting, <lb/>
            And Scylla's clutches he did safely row; <lb/>
            How to Ogygia he came, and how <lb/>
            Calypso kept him in a cave, where she <lb n="290"/>
            To be his wife did promise to bestow <lb/>
            Upon him youth and immortality. <lb/>
            How to Phaeacia he came, where he <lb/>
            Much honour'd was, and thence by sea did come <pb n="526"/>

            And day from mortals now no longer hide. <lb n="300"/>
            Ulysses rose, and speaking to his wife, <lb/>
            We have, said he, both of us had much woe; <lb/>
            You for my absence weeping out your life, <lb/>
            And I, because the Gods would have it so. <lb/>
            But since we now again united be, <lb n="305"/>
            Look to the goods within. My folds I'll fill <lb/>
            Partly with booty from the enemy, <lb/>
            And many also my friends give me will. <lb/>
            Now to my grieved father I must go, <lb/>

            For ere the sun be up, the town will know <lb/>
            That in my house the suitors all are slain. <lb/>
            Do not so much as look out, or inquire. <lb/>
            This said, he put on arms. To arm also <lb/>
            His son and his two men he did require. <lb n="315"/>
            Then they got up, and there stood armed too. <lb/>
            Then open'd they the door and forth they went. <lb/>
            Ulysses led the way. Daylight was spread. <lb/>
            But Pallas out of town them safely sent <lb/>

            And then they passed through the town of dreams, <lb/>
            And in a trice to th' mead of Asphodel, <lb/>
            And saw the soul there of Peleiades, <lb/>
            For there the souls of wretched mortals dwell, <lb/>
            And of Patroclus and Nestorides. <lb n="20"/>
            The soul of Ajax son of Telamon <lb/>
            Was also there, who 'mongst those warriors tall, <lb/>
            The goodliest person was, except the son <lb/>
            Of Peleus, who did much excel them all. <lb/>
            To these Atrides' soul came from hard by, <lb n="25"/>
            And theirs whose death had joined been with his, <lb/>
            And by Ægistus' hand were made to die. <lb/>
            Then to Atrides said Achilles this: <lb/>
            Atrides, we thought you of all the host <lb/>
            That came to fight against the town of Troy, <lb n="30"/>
            Had been by the high Gods beloved most; <lb/>
            For in the army you bore greatest sway. <lb/>
            Yet afterwards the first you were to fall. <lb/>
            T' had better been commanding t' have been slain. <lb/>
            Then had you had a noble funeral, <lb n="35"/>
            And tomb, whereby your glory might remain. <lb/>
            But now you died a miserable death. <lb/>
            To this Atrides* soul thus answered: <lb/>
            Happy were you at Troy to lose your breath, <lb/>
            With other Argives; that there perished <lb n="40"/>
            Fighting about you, in your dusty bed <lb/>
            Stretch'd out, your feats of horsemanship forgot, <lb/>
            But fighting we all day continued, <lb/>
            And till we gain'd your body ceased not. <lb/>
            Nor had we ceased then, but for the storm. <lb n="45"/>
            And then we bare your body to the fleet, <lb/>
            And there the blemishes thereof reform <lb/>
            With water fair and warm, and unguents sweet. <lb/>
            The Greeks about you wept, and cut their hair; <lb/>
            Your mother and her nymphs then came and roared, <lb n="50"/>
            Th' Achæan army was in such a fear, <lb/>
            That they were ready all to run aboard. <lb/>
            But Nestor, whose advice most current was, <lb/>
            Cried, Stay you, Argives, this is not the noise <lb/>
            Of armed foes, but Thetis now doth pass <lb n="55"/>
            With all her nymphs; of them this is the voice. <lb/>
            Then they all fearless stayed. And the nymphs stood <lb/>

            The Muses nine, in turn with voices good, <lb/>
            Singing, made all the standers by to weep. <lb n="60"/>
            And seventeen days both Gods and men we mourn. <lb/>
            On the eighteenth we sheep and cattle slay. <lb/>

            Noble Achilles, your white bones we laid, <lb/>
            Mix'd with Patroclus you delighted in. <lb/>
            By yours, the ashes of Antilochus, <lb/>
            Whom next Patroclus was to you most dear, <lb/>
            We placed in an urn apart, and thus <lb n="75"/>
            Over you all one monument we rear, <lb/>
            High to be seen from sea by them that now, <lb/>
            Or shall hereafter sailing be that way. <lb/>
            Your mother also to the Gods did vow <lb/>
            T have noble prizes for the lords to play. <lb n="80"/>
            At princes' sepultures I oft have seen <lb/>
            Propos'd rich prizes to provoke the strife <lb/>
            Of noble minds, but that like these had been, <lb/>
            I never any saw in all my life. <lb/>
            So after death renowned your name will be; <lb n="85"/>
            But what am I the better, to whom Jove <lb/>
            Did for my pains a wretched death decree <lb/>

            B' Ægistus and my own wife's bloody hand? <lb/>
            Thus they to one another talk'd in hell. <lb n="90"/>
            Then Mercury came to them with his band <lb/>
            Of woo'rs that in Ulysses' palace fell. <lb/>
            Of these Atrides knew Amphimedon, <lb/>
            (For he in Itbaca had been his guest), <lb/>
            And speaking to him first, he thus begun: <lb n="95"/>
            Amphimedon, what ail'd you and the rest, <lb/>
            To come to this dark place so in a throng, <lb/>
            The flow'r of Ithaca, of equal years? <lb/>
            If purposely a man should seek among <lb/>
            Your people all, he should not find you peers. <lb n="100"/>
            Were you by Neptune drowned in the main, <lb/>
            And hither sent by fury of the weather? <lb/>
            Or landing to find booty were you slain? <lb/>
            Or fighting for fair women were sent hither? <lb/>
            Come, tell me freely; I have been your guest. <lb n="105"/>
            Know you not I t' your father's house did come <lb/>
            With Menelaus, Ulysses to request <lb/>
            That he would go with us to Ilium? <lb/>
            Then said Amphimedon: I know it all, <lb/>
            And how we all deprived were of life, <lb n="110"/>
            I'll tell you true, and manner of our fall. <lb/>
            Ulysses absent, we all woo'd his wife. <lb/>
            She none denied, nor any married, <lb/>
            But casting how of life us to bereave, <lb/>

            To set a loom up came into her head, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIV. </note><note type="margin"> <lb/>

            As if she somewhat did intend to weave. <lb/>
            She sets it up, and did begin to weave. <lb/>
            Suitors, said she, since dead Ulysses is, <lb/>
            Stay yet a little while, and give me leave <lb/>
            To make an end but of one business. <lb n="120"/>
            I must for old Laertes make a cloth, <lb/>
            Which in his sepulchre he is to wear. <lb/>
            T' offend the wives of Greece I should be loth. <lb/>
            For to accuse me they will not forbear. <lb/>
            They'll say I very hasty was to wed, <lb n="125"/>
            If I go hence, and not provide a shroud, <lb/>
            Wherein Laertes must be buried. <lb/>
            Out of his wealth, that might have been allowed. <lb/>
            The suitors then were all content. And then <lb/>
            All day ste wove, but ere she went to bed <lb n="130"/>
            What she had wov'n she ravell'd out agen. <lb/>
            Three years her suitors she thus frustrated; <lb/>
            In the fourth year her women her betray'd; <lb/>
            And in we came while she the web undid. <lb/>
            She could the wedding now no more avoid. <lb n="135"/>
            The robe when it was finished and done <lb/>
            She washed clean, and it before us laid: <lb/>
            As bright it shin'd as either moon or sun. <lb/>
            And then ill-fortune brought Ulysses home <lb/>
            To the house were dwelt the master of the swine; <lb n="140"/>
            And thither too Telemachus did come, <lb/>
            From sandy Pylus, safely through the brine; <lb/>
            And both together there our death contrive. <lb/>
            That done, they both into the city come. <lb/>
            Telemachus the first was to arrive. <lb n="145"/>
            The master of the swine brought th' other home, <lb/>
            Like an old beggar with his staff in's hand, <lb/>
            Apparell'd in such miserable gear, <lb/>
            That, that was he, we could not understand, <lb/>
            Nor no man else, although he elder were. <lb n="150"/>
            We mock, we rate him, throw things at his head; <lb/>
            He patiently endured all his harms, <lb/>
            Until, by Jupiter encouraged, <lb/>
            From out the hall he took away the arms, <lb/>
            And in an upper chamber lock'd them fast. <lb n="155"/>
            Then craftily he bids his wife to send <lb/>
            To us his mighty bow, our strength to taste. <lb/>
            This the beginning was of our ill end; <lb/>
            For much too weak to bend the bow were we. <lb/>
            But when it was unto Ulysses brought, <lb n="160"/>
            Fearing by him lest it should bended be, <lb/>
            We all at once cried out, Hold, give't him not. <lb/>
            Only Telemachus cried, Let him try. <lb/>
            And then 'twas put into Ulysses' hands. <note type="footnote"> VOL. X. </note> <note type="footnote"> M M </note> <pb n="530"/>

            Ulysses bent it very easily. <lb n="165"/>
            Then leap'd he to the sill, and there he stands; <lb/>
            And round about he look'd upon us grim. <lb/>
            And first of all he shot Antinous, <lb/>
            At whom he took his aim, and killed him, <lb/>
            And with his arrows, after, more of us. <lb n="170"/>
            And one upon another down we fall. <lb/>
            'Twas plain, some present God there gave him aid, <lb/>
            For then he follow'd us about the hall, <lb/>
            Till all on heaps at last he had us laid. <lb/>
            Of groans and blows it made a dismal sound. <lb n="175"/>
            And thus, King Agamemnon, died we. <lb/>
            Our bodies yet there lie upon the ground; <lb/>
            Our friends yet unacquainted with it be, <lb/>
            That else would wash our wounds and us lament, <lb/>
            Which to the dead are ceremonies due. <lb n="180"/>
            Then said Atrides, 0 virtue excellent <lb/>
            Of your fair wife, happy Ulysses, you, <lb/>
            That with great valour have her repossessed. <lb/>
            My wife, Tyndareus' daughter, was not such. <lb/>
            Your consort's fame will be hereafter dressed <lb n="185"/>
            In noble songs, and the sex honour much. <lb/>
            But my wife's name shall stand in ballads vile, <lb/>
            And, sung in filthy songs, the sex disgrace. <lb/>
            Thus they discoursing were in hell. Meanwhile <lb/>
            Ulysses cometh to Laertes' place: <lb n="190"/>
            About it many lodgings were, wherein <lb/>
            His necessary servants all were laid; <lb/>
            And there they fed, and sat, and slept. But in <lb/>
            The house itself one old Sicelian maid, <lb/>
            That of his person always had the care. <lb n="195"/>
            Ulysses then, lest supper they should lack, <lb/>
            Said to his two good servants, For our fare <lb/>
            You must again unto the town go back, <lb/>
            And fetch a swine, the fattest in the sties, <lb/>
            Meanwhile I'll to the vineyard go, and try <lb n="200"/>
            Whether my father know can with his eyes, <lb/>
            After so long an absence, that 'tis I. <lb/>
            This said, his servants armed homeward hie, <lb/>
            And to the vineyard goes Ulysses then. <lb/>
            But Dolius he there could not espy, <lb n="205"/>
            Nor any of his sons, or of his men. <lb/>
            His sons and servants all abroad were gone, <lb/>
            For thorns to mend the hedges of the ground. <lb/>
            Laertes in the vineyard all alone <lb/>

            On him he had a foul coat, full of patches, <lb/>
            And ugly leather boots, those patch'd also; <lb/>
            But good enough to save his legs from scratches: <lb/>
            Gloves of the same against the briars too. <lb/>

            A goat-skin head-piece he had on to boot. <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIV. </note><note type="margin"> The Ithacesians <lb/>

            Ulysses, when he saw him in this plight, <lb/>
            Worn out with age, and so much sorrow to it, <lb/>
            Under a tree stood weeping out of sight. <lb/>
            And then bethought him whether it were best <lb/>
            T' embrace and kiss him, and directly say, <lb n="220"/>
            I am Ulysses, or first talk in jest, <lb/>
            And give him time his person to survey. <lb/>
            Resolved at last, his father he goes nigh, <lb/>
            Who with his head down, digg'd about a plant. <lb/>
            Old man, said he, your skill is good. For why, <lb n="225"/>
            Your garden neither art nor care does want. <lb/>
            Nor plant, nor fig, nor vine, nor olive-tree, <lb/>
            Nor so much as a leek but prospers here. <lb/>
            One thing there wants (I pray not angry be); <lb/>
            You look not to yourself. III cloathes you wear, <lb n="230"/>
            And also pale and yellow is your hue, <lb/>
            Which cannot be imputed to being aged. <lb/>
            'Tis not because you do no work, that you <lb/>
            He little sets by that has you engaged; <lb/>
            There's nothing in your aspect of a slave. <lb n="235"/>
            The look and stature you have of a king, <lb/>
            And the appearance of a king would have, <lb/>
            If you, what's due to age had ev'ry thing. <lb/>
            Whose servant are you, and who owns the ground ? <lb/>
            And say if this be Ithaca or no; <lb n="240"/>
            For this man whom upon the way I found, <lb/>
            Is not so wise as certainly to know? <lb/>
            I ask'd him of a friend that I had here, <lb/>
            Whether alive he were or dead. But he; <lb/>
            Whether he dead, or living still he were, <lb n="245"/>
            Unable was at all to answer me. <lb/>
            My house a stranger on a time was at, <lb/>
            Which of all strangers I did love the best; <lb/>
            That said he came from Ithaca, and that <lb/>
            Laertes was his father's name. This guest <lb n="250"/>
            I entertained as kindly as I could, <lb/>
            With viands good, whereof I had good store; <lb/>
            And gave him talents ten of well-wrought gold, <lb/>
            And beside that I gave him these gifts more: <lb/>
            A pot for tempered wine of silver bright; <lb n="255"/>
            Twelve carpets fair; twelve robes; twelve coats that were <lb/>
            All lined through ; and twelve more that were light; <lb/>
            And four maid-servants, both well taught and fair, <lb/>
            Such as he from a greater number chose. <lb/>
            Then said Laertes, Ithaca this is, <lb n="260"/>
            Now held by wicked men. But you will lose <lb/>
            Your presents all, and of requital miss. <lb/>
            But had you found my son Ulysses here, <lb/>
            He would have kept of amity the law, <pb n="532"/>

            But say, how long it is since you last saw <lb/>
            And entertain'd my son, if yet he be; <lb/>
            But he at sea devoured is by fish <lb/>
            Far hence, or else to beasts and fowls is he <lb/>
            Somewhere, poor man, at land become a dish; <lb n="270"/>
            Neither his father nor his mother by, <lb/>
            To wind him and to shed tears o'er his bed; <lb/>
            Nor yet his wife weeping to close his eye, <lb/>
            Which are the honours due unto the dead. <lb/>
            Tell me also your dwelling and your name, <lb n="275"/>
            Your parents and your city what they be; <lb/>
            And where the good ship lies in which you came, <lb/>
            And what men with you came in company, <lb/>
            Or with some merchants in their ship, and they <lb/>
            Departing hence have left you here alone ? <lb n="280"/>
            To this Ulysses answering did say, <lb/>
            I'll answer to your questions each one. <lb/>
            My city's Alybas, and of the same <lb/>
            Apherdas is the king. His son am I, <lb/>
            And called am Eperitus by name. <lb n="285"/>
            Far hence at the land's end my ship doth lie. <lb/>
            And since Ulysses from me went away, <lb/>
            'Tis now five years, and with good augury <lb/>
            That we should meet again another day, <lb/>
            And joy in mutual hospitality. <lb n="290"/>
            This said, Laertes, overcome with woe, <lb/>
            Took up the scalding dust with both his hands, <lb/>
            And pour'd the same upon his head of snow, <lb/>
            And sobbing thick and weeping there he stands. <lb/>
            Ulysses' heart up to his nostrils swell'd <lb n="295"/>
            With pity to behold his father's woe, <lb/>
            And to him leapt; and's arms about him held, <lb/>
            And said, The man you weep and mourn for so <lb/>
            Am I, come after twenty years again. <lb/>
            Give over sobbing now ; for, though in haste, <lb n="300"/>
            I tell you must, the suitors I have slain, <lb/>
            And made them of their crimes the fruit to taste. <lb/>
            Then said Laertes, If indeed you be <lb/>
            My son Ulysses, let me see some sign <lb/>
            To know you by for certain. Then, said he, <lb n="305"/>
            Behold the wound received from the swine <lb/>
            On Mount Parnassus, when I thither went <lb/>
            T' Autolycus my mother's father, to <lb/>
            Receive the gifts he promis'd me. You sent <lb/>
            Me thither, and so did my mother too. <lb n="310"/>
            Ill tell you too what trees you gave me when <lb/>
            I walking once was with you there. And I <lb/>
            Ask'd you of all the trees the names (for then <lb/>
            'Twixt man and boy I was). And severally <lb/>
             <pb n="533"/>
            As I the trees' names ask'd, you told the same. <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIV. </note><note type="margin"> The Ithacesians <lb/>

            Pear-trees thirteen; apple-trees half a score ; <lb/>
            Rankles fifty (to the vines you gave that name); <lb/>
            All of them in their season berries bore; <lb/>
            And forty fig trees. Th' old man knew it all; <lb/>
            Embraced his son, and with abundant joy <lb n="320"/>
            Fainted, and sinking ready was to fall, <lb/>
            But that his son's embraces were his stay. <lb/>
            Then coming to himself again he said: <lb/>
            Jove, father, and you Gods (Gods there are yet!) <lb/>
            The suitors for their evil deeds have paid, <lb n="325"/>
            But now I fear the town will on us set, <lb/>
            And with themselves make all the city rise <lb/>
            In Cephalenia. Then said his son, <lb/>
            Fear not. Of that we'll by and by advise. <lb/>
            Eumaeus and Philœtius are gone <lb n="330"/>
            To get a supper ready at your house. <lb/>
            This said, into the house they come away, <lb/>
            And find Eumæus and Philœtius <lb/>
            At work to cut out meat, and wine allay. <lb/>
            Meanwhile Laertes oil'd and bathed is, <lb n="335"/>
            And by his maid in seemly garments clad, <lb/>
            And Pallas, standing by him, added this, <lb/>
            A larger stature than before he had. <lb/>
            As of a God his presence did appear. <lb/>
            Ulysses seeing him, admir'd, and said: <lb n="340"/>
            Father, you greater now are than you were, <lb/>
            Some God has beauty on your person laid. <lb/>
            Then said Laertes, 0 ye Gods on high, <lb/>
            Jove, Pallas, and Apollo, had I been <lb/>
            Such as I was at Neritus, when I <lb n="345"/>
            Stormed the town, and armed had come in <lb/>
            When you and the proud suitors were in fight, <lb/>
            I had made many of them bend the knee; <lb/>
            And you would have rejoic'd at the sight. <lb/>
            So to his son Ulysses talked he. <lb n="350"/>
            Supper brought in, they sit; and then came in <lb/>
            Old Dolius, sent for, from his husbandry, <lb/>
            And his sons, weary. Working they had been. <lb/>
            The nurse had bidden them come speedily. <lb/>
            They wondered to see Ulysses there; <lb n="355"/>
            But he to Dolius then gently said, <lb/>
            Pray for awhile your wond'ring to forbear; <lb/>
            We hungry are, and long have for you staid. <lb/>
            Then Dolius embraced him, and said, <lb/>
            Since long'd for you are come, and unexpected, <lb n="360"/>
            And to us by the Gods have been conveyed; <lb/>
            All hail, and by the Gods be still protected. <lb/>
            But tell me if Penelope yet have <lb/>
            The news received of your coming home, <pb n="534"/>

            Or shall we send her word? That labour save, <lb n="365"/>
            Replied Ulysses, for she knows I'm come. <lb/>
            This said, he sat him down. His sons also, <lb/>
            With decent words, Ulysses entertain, <lb/>
            And lay their hands in his. That done, they go, <lb/>
            And by their father sat them down again. <lb n="370"/>
            Now fame divulged had the suitors' fate; <lb/>
            And people howling, came in ev'ry way, <lb/>
            And gathered whereabout Ulysses' gate, <lb/>
            To fetch the bodies of the dead away. <lb/>
            And those that out of Ithaca had liv'd, <lb n="375"/>
            To fishermen they gave to carry home. <lb/>
            And staying on the place, though sorely griev'd, <lb/>
            Amongst themselves they into counsel come. <lb/>
            Eupeithes, father of Antinous, <lb/>
            That first of all slain by Ulysses was, <lb n="380"/>
            Spake first, and weeping for his son, said thus: <lb/>
            See how much mischief this man done us has. <lb/>
            He carried hence our ships, and ablest men; <lb/>
            And lost them all, as one that had designed <lb/>
            Our utter ruin. Coming back agen, <lb n="385"/>
            He killed bath those whom he left behind. <lb/>
            Come then, let's to him quickly, lest meanwhile <lb/>
            He should pass over the wide sea, and get <lb/>
            Protection at Elis, or at Pyle, <lb/>
            And we so sham'd as we were never yet. <lb n="390"/>
            'Twill be a scorn to our posterity <lb/>
            To let the murder of our children so <lb/>
            Stay unrevenged, and put up cowardly. <lb/>
            For my part, to my grave I'd rather go. <lb/>
            Come quickly then, lest we prevented be. <lb n="395"/>
            This said, the people for him pity had. <lb/>
            Then came in Medon, who had scaped free, <lb/>
            And Phemius that scap'd too, and was glad. <lb/>
            And Medon to th'assembly spake, and said, <lb/>
            Ulysses of himself could not have done <lb n="400"/>
            This mighty deed without th' Immortals' aid. <lb/>
            I saw, when present I was looking on, <lb/>
            A God stand by that him encouraged, <lb/>
            In Mentor's shape he plainly did appear; <lb/>
            And then about the room the suitors fled, <lb n="405"/>
            And fell before Ulysses in their fear. <lb/>
            Next him spake Alitherses, who alone <lb/>
            Saw fore and aft. Hear me, you men, said he; <lb/>
            Of this great slaughter I accuse can none, <lb/>
            But even yourselves that gave no ear to me, <lb n="410"/>
            Nor yet to Mentor. We you counselled <lb/>
            The licence of your children to take down, <lb/>
            That spent the substance, and dishonoured <lb/>
            The wife of him that was of such renown. <lb/>
             <pb n="535"/>
            My counsel, therefore, to you now is this, <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIV. </note><note type="margin"> The Ithacesians <lb/>
            in council re­ <lb/>
            solve on revenge. </note> <lb n="415"/>
            Not to proceed, lest on yourselves you bring <lb/>
            More mischief yet, and of your purpose miss. <lb/>
            So said he then, but little profiting; <lb/>
            For more than half with alalaes up start, <lb/>
            And cry aloud, To arms, go on, proceed! <lb n="420"/>
            But quietly sat still the lesser part, <lb/>
            That with Eupeithes'judgment disagreed.. <lb/>
            When they had clad themselves in glist'ning brass, <lb/>
            Without the town they came to rendezvous <lb/>
            In open field. Eupeithes leader was, <lb n="425"/>
            Seeking revenge where he his life shall lose. <lb/>
            Then Pallas to her father came, and said, <lb/>
            O father, king of kings, what do you mean, <lb/>
            The war shall last between them, or be staid? <lb/>
            To this her father answer'd her agen: <lb n="430"/>
            Child, why d'ye ask me that? 'twas your request <lb/>
            The suitors for their insolence should pay. <lb/>
            Do what you please, but yet I think it best, <lb/>
            When you have done, that peace for ever stay; <lb/>
            And ever reign Ulysses and his race. <lb n="435"/>
            Which to confirm, oblivion I'll send <lb/>
            Of former acts the image to deface. <lb/>
            Then gladly Pallas did from heaven descend. <lb/>
            When now Ulysses and his company <lb/>
            Removed had their hunger with good cheer, <lb n="440"/>
            Ulysses said, Some one go forth and see <lb/>
            Whether the Ithacesians be near. <lb/>
            And then one of the young men standing there, <lb/>
            Went forth and saw them as he pass'd the sill: <lb/>
            And turning back, Arm, said he, they are here! <lb n="445"/>
            And then they all put on their arms of steel. <lb/>
            Ulysses and his son, and servants four, <lb/>
            Six sons of Dolius. And the old men, <lb/>
            Laertes, and Dolius, were two more. <lb/>
            Aged they were, but necessary then. <lb n="450"/>
            Then arm'd, Ulysses leading, out they go. <lb/>
            And Pallas, both in person and in voice <lb/>
            Resembling Mentor, in came to them too. <lb/>
            Ulysses seeing her did much rejoice. <lb/>
            And looking on Telemachus, he said, <lb n="455"/>
            Telemachus, this battle will declare <lb/>
            Who courage has, who not. Be not afraid: <lb/>
            That you dishonour not your stock beware. <lb/>
            Father, said he, you shall see by-and-bye, <lb/>
            You need not be ashamed of your son. <lb n="460"/>
            Laertes this discourse heard joyfully, <lb/>
            And to the Gods cried out in passion, <lb/>
            O ye kind Gods, and happy day is this! <lb/>
            O joy! My son and grandson are at strife <pb n="536"/>
            <note type="margin"> LIB. XXIV. </note><note type="margin"> And coming <lb/>

            and Laertes,with <lb/>
            Telemachus and <lb/>

            And ready to buy honour with his life. <lb/>
            Then Pallas to Laertes said, My friend, <lb/>

            With all your force your spear now from you send. <lb/>
            But pray first unto Pallas and to Jove. <lb n="470"/>
            He pray'd, and threw his spear, which th'helmet smote <lb/>
            Of old Eupeithes, and went into's head. <lb/>
            Down dead he fell, the helmet sav'd him not. <lb/>
            His armour rattled, and his spirit fled. <lb/>
            And then fell on Ulysses and his son, <lb n="475"/>
            Upon the foremost, both with sword and spear, <lb/>
            And surely had destroyed them ev'ry one, <lb/>
            Had not Jove's daughter, Pallas, then been there. <lb/>
            She to the people call'd aloud, and said, <lb/>
            Hold Ithacesians; the quarrel may <lb n="480"/>
            Without more blood be ended. They, afra i <lb/>
            Of th' heavenly voice, began to run away. <lb/>
            Ulysses yet not ceased to pursue <lb/>
            The captains of his foes, till from above, <lb/>
            In thunder, Jove his sooty bolt down threw. <lb n="485"/>
            Then Pallas said, Beware; offend not Jove; <lb/>
