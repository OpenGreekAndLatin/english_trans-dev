            <title type="main">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</title>
          </head>
          <p>MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO, the greatest of Roman orators and <lb/>
            the chief master of Latin prose style, was born at Arpinum, Jan. <lb/>
            3, 106 B. C. His father, who was a man of property and belonged <lb/>
            to the class of the “Knights” moved to Rome when Cicero was <lb/>
            a child; and the future statesman received an elaborate education <lb/>
            in rhetoric, law, and philosophy, studying and practising under <lb/>
            some of the most noted teachers of the time. He began his <lb/>
            career as an advocate at the age of twenty-five, and almost <lb/>
            immediately came to be recognized not only as a man of brilliant <lb/>
            talents but also as a courageous upholder of justice in the face <lb/>
            of grave political danger. After two years of practice he left <lb/>
            Rome to travel in Greece and Asia, taking all the opportunities <lb/>
            that offered to study his art under distinguished masters. He <lb/>
            returned to Rome greatly improved in health and in professional <lb/>
            skill, and in 76 B. C. was elected to the office of quaestor. He <lb/>
            was assigned to the province of Lilybaeum in Sicily, and the <lb/>
            vigor and justice of his administration earned him the gratitude <lb/>
            of the inhabitants. It was at their request that he undertook in <lb/>
            70 B. C. the prosecution of Verres, who as praetor had subjected <lb/>
            the Sicilians to incredible extortion and oppression; and his suc­ <lb/>
            cessful conduct of this case, which ended in the conviction and <lb/>
            banishment of Verres, may be said to have launched hint on his <lb/>
            political career. He became aedile in the same year, in 67 B. C. <lb/>
            praetor, and in 64 B. C. was elected consul by a large majority. <lb/>
            The most important event of the year of his consulship was the <lb/>
            conspiracy of Catiline. This notorious criminal of patrician rank <lb/>
            had conspired with a number of others, many of them young <lb/>
            men of high birth but dissipated character, to seize the chief <lb/>
            offices of the state, and to extricate themselves from the pecu­ <lb/>
            niary and other difficulties that had resulted from their excesses, <lb/>
            by the wholesale plunder of the city. The plot was unmasked <lb/>
            by the vigilance of Cicero, five of the traitors were summarily <lb/>
            executed, and in the overthrow of the army that had been gath­ <lb/>
            ered in their support Catiline himself perished. Cicero regarded <lb/>
            himself as the savior of his country, and his country for the <lb/>
            moment seemed to give grateful assent.</p>
          <p>But reverses were at hand. During the existence of the politic <note type="footnote"> 3 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            cat combination of Pompey, Cesar, and Crassus, known as the <lb/>
            first triumvirate, P. Clodius, an enemy of Cicero's, proposed a <lb/>
            law banishing "any one who had put Roman citizens to death <lb/>
            without trial.” This was aimed at Cicero on account of his share <lb/>
            in the Catiline affair, and in March, 58 B. C., he left Rome. The <lb/>
            same day a law was passed by which he was banished by name, <lb/>
            and his property was plundered and destroyed, a temple to <lb/>
            Liberty being erected on the site of his house in the city. <lb/>
            During his exile Cicero's manliness to some extent deserted him. <lb/>
            He drifted from place to place, seeking the protection of officials <lb/>
            against assassination, writing letters urging his supporters to <lb/>
            agitate for his recall, sometimes accusing them of lukewarmness <lb/>
            and even treachery, bemoaning the ingratitude of his country <lb/>
            or regretting the course of action that had led to his outlawry, <lb/>
            and suffering from extreme depression over his separation from <lb/>
            his wife and children and the wreck of his political ambitions. <lb/>
            Finally in August, 57 B. C., the decree for his restoration was <lb/>
            passed, and he returned to Rome the next month, being received <lb/>
            with immense popular enthusiasm. During the next few years <lb/>
            the renewal of the understanding among the triumvirs shut. <lb/>
            Cicero out from any leading part in politics, and he resumed his <lb/>
            activity in the law-courts, his most important case being, perhaps, <lb/>
            the defence of Milo for the murder of Clodius, Cicero's most <lb/>
            troublesome enemy. This oration, in the revised form in which <lb/>
            it has come down to us, is ranked as among the finest specimens <lb/>
            of the art of the orator, though in its original form it failed <lb/>
            to secure Milo's acquittal. Meantime, Cicero was also devoting <lb/>
            much time to literary composition, and his letters show great <lb/>
            dejection over the political situation, and a somewhat wavering <lb/>
            attitude towards the various parties in the state. In 51 B. C. <lb/>
            he went to Cilicia in Asia Minor as proconsul, an office which he <lb/>
            administered with efficiency and integrity in civil affairs and <lb/>
            with success in military. He returned to Italy in the end of the <lb/>
            following year, and he was publicly thanked by the senate for <lb/>
            his services, but disappointed in his hopes for a triumph. The <lb/>
            war for supremacy between Cæsar and Pompey which had for <lb/>
            some time been gradually growing more certain, broke out in <lb/>
            49 B. C., when Cæsar led his army across the Rubicon, and <lb/>
            Cicero after much irresolution threw in his lot with Pompey, <lb/>
            who was overthrown the next year in the battle of Pharsalus and <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            later murdered in Egypt. Cicero returned to Italy, where Cæsar <lb/>
            treated him magnanimously, and for some time he devoted him­ <lb/>
            self to philosophical and rhetorical writing. In 46 B. C. he <lb/>
            divorced his wife Terentia, to whom he had been married for <lb/>
            thirty years and married the young and wealthy Publilia in <lb/>
            order to relieve himself from financial difficulties; but her also <lb/>
            he shortly divorced. Cæsar, who had now become supreme in <lb/>
            Rome, was assassinated in 44 B. C., and though Cicero was not <lb/>
            a sharer in the conspiracy, he seems to have approved the deed. <lb/>
            In the confusion which followed he supported the cause of the <lb/>
            conspirators against Antony; and when finally the triumvirate <lb/>
            of Antony, Octavius, and <unclear>Lepias</unclear> was established, Cicero was <lb/>
            included among the proscribed, and on December 7, 43 B. C., <lb/>
            he was killed by agents of Antony. His head and hand were cut <lb/>
            off and exhibited at Rome.</p>
          <p>The most important orations of the last months of his life <lb/>
            were the fourteen “Philippies” delivered against Antony, and <lb/>
            the price of this enmity he paid with his life.</p>
          <p>To his contemporaries Cicero was primarily the great forensic <lb/>
            and political orator of his time, and the fifty-eight speeches which <lb/>
            have come down to us bear testimony to the skill, wit, eloquence, <lb/>
            and passion which gave him <unclear>s</unclear> pre-eminence. But these <lb/>
            speeches of necessity deal with the minute details of the occasions <lb/>
            which called them forth, and so require for their appreciation a <lb/>
            full knowledge of the history, political and personal, of the time. <lb/>
            The letters, on the other hand, are less elaborate both in style <lb/>
            and in the handling of current events, while they serve to reveal <lb/>
            his personality, and to throw light upon Roman life in the last <lb/>
            days of the Republic in an extremely vivid fashion. Cicero as <lb/>
            a man, in spite of his self-importance, the vacillation of his <lb/>
            political conduct in desperate crises, and the whining despondency <lb/>
            of his times of adversity, stands out as at bottom a patriotic <lb/>
            Roman of substantial honesty, who gave his life to check the <lb/>
            inevitable fall of the commonwealth to which he was devoted. <lb/>
            The evils which were undermining the Republic bear so many <lb/>
            striking resemblances to those which threaten the civic and na­ <lb/>
            tional life of America to-day that the interest of the period is by <lb/>
            no means merely historical.</p>
          <p>As a philosopher, Cicero's most important function was to <lb/>
            make his countrymen familiar with the main schools of Greek <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            thought. Much of this writing is thus of secondary interest to <lb/>
            as in comparison with his originals, but in the fields of religious <lb/>
            theory and of the application of philosophy to life he made im­ <lb/>
            portant first-hand contributions. From these works have been <lb/>
            selected the two treatises, on Old Age and on Friendship, which <lb/>
            have proved of most permanent and widespread interest to pos­ <lb/>
            terity, and which give a clear impression of the way in which <lb/>
            a high-minded Roman thought about some of the main prob­ <lb/>
            lems of human life.</p>

            <title type="main">ON FRIENDSHIP MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO</title>
          </head>
          <p>T <lb/>
            HE augur Quintus Mucius Scaevola used to recount a <lb/>
            number of stories about his father-in-law Gaius <lb/>
            Laelius, accurately remembered and charmingly told; <lb/>
            and whenever he talked about him always gave him the <lb/>
            title of " the wise " without any hesitation. I had been in­ <lb/>
            troduced by my father to Scaevola as soon as I had as­ <lb/>
            sumed the toga virilis, and I took advantage of the intro­ <lb/>
            duction never to quit the venerable man's side as long as <lb/>
            I was able to stay and he was spared to us. The conse­ <lb/>
            quence was that I committed to memory many disquisitions <lb/>
            of his, as well as many short pointed apophthegms, and, in <lb/>
            short, took as much advantage of his wisdom as I could. <lb/>
            When he died, I attached myself to Scaevola the Pontifex, <lb/>
            whom I may venture to call quite the most distinguished of <lb/>
            our countrymen for ability and uprightness. But of this <lb/>
            latter I shall take other occasions to speak. To return to <lb/>
            Scaevola the augur. Among many other occasions I particu­ <lb/>
            larly remember one. He was sitting on a semicircular gar­ <lb/>
            den-bench, as was his custom, when I and a very few <lb/>
            intimate friends were there, and he chanced to turn the con­ <lb/>
            versation upon a subject which about that time was in <lb/>
            many people's mouths. You must remember, Atticus, for <lb/>
            you were very intimate with Publius Sulpicius, what ex­ <lb/>
            pressions of astonishment, or even indignation, were called <lb/>
            forth by his mortal quarrel, as tribune, with the consul Quin­ <lb/>
            tus Pompeius, with whom he had formerly lived on terms <lb/>
            of the closest intimacy and affection. Well, on this occasion, <lb/>
            happening to mention this particular circumstance, Scaevola <lb/>
            detailed to us a discourse of Laelius on friendship delivered <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            to himself and Laelius's other son-in-law Gaius Fannius, <lb/>
            son of Marcus Fannius, a few days after the death of Afri­ <lb/>
            canus. The points of that discussion I committed to mem­ <lb/>
            ory, and have arranged them in this book at my own <lb/>
            discretion. For I have brought the speakers, as it were, <lb/>
            personally on to my stage to prevent the constant "said I" <lb/>
            and "said he" of a narrative, and to give the discourse the <lb/>
            air of being orally delivered in our hearing.</p>
          <p>You have often urged me to write something on Friend­ <lb/>
            ship, and I quite acknowledged that the subject seemed one <lb/>
            worth everybody's investigation, and specially suited to the <lb/>
            close intimacy that has existed between you and me. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly I was quite ready to benefit the public at your <lb/>
            request.</p>
          <p>As to the dramatis persona. In the treatise on Old Age, <lb/>
            which I dedicated to you, I introduced Cato as chief speaker. <lb/>
            No one, I thought, could with greater propriety speak on <lb/>
            old age than one who had been an old man longer than any <lb/>
            one else, and had been exceptionally vigorous in his old age. <lb/>
            Similarly, having learnt from tradition that of all friend­ <lb/>
            ships that between Gaius Laelius and Publius Scipio was <lb/>
            the most remarkable, I thought Laelius was just the person <lb/>
            to support the chief part in a discussion on friendship which <lb/>
            Scaevola remembered him to have actually taken. Moreover, <lb/>
            a discussion of this sort gains somehow in weight from <lb/>
            the authority of men of ancient days, especially if they <lb/>
            happen to have been distinguished. So it comes about <lb/>
            that in reading over what I have myself written I have a <lb/>
            feeling at times that it is actually Cato that is speaking, <lb/>
            not I.</p>
          <p>Finally, as I sent the former essay to you as a gift from <lb/>
            one old man to another, so I have dedicated this On Friend­ <lb/>
            ship as a most affectionate friend to his friend. In the for­ <lb/>
            mer Cato spoke, who was the oldest and wisest man of his <lb/>
            day; in this Laelius speaks on friendship—Laelius, who was <lb/>
            at once a wise man (that was the title given him) and emi­ <lb/>
            nent for his famous friendship. Please forget me for a <lb/>
            while; imagine Laelius to be speaking.</p>
          <p>Gaius Fannius and Quintus Mucius come to call on their <lb/>
            father-in-law after the death of Africanus. They start the <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            subject; Laelius answers them. And the whole essay on <lb/>
            friendship is his. In reading it you will recognise a picture <lb/>
            of yourself.</p>
          <p>2. Fannius. You are quite right, Laelius! there never <lb/>
            was a better or more illustrious character than Africanus. <lb/>
            But you should consider that at the present moment all eyes <lb/>
            are on you. Everybody calls you "the wise" par excellence, <lb/>
            and thinks you so. The same mark of respect was lately paid <lb/>
            Cato, and we know that in the last generation Lucius Atilius <lb/>
            was called " the wise." But in both cases the word was <lb/>
            applied with a certain difference. Atilius was so called from <lb/>
            his reputation as a jurist; Cato got the name as a kind <lb/>
            of honorary title and in extreme old age because of his <lb/>
            varied experience of affairs, and his reputation for foresight <lb/>
            and firmness, and the sagacity of the opinions which he de­ <lb/>
            livered in senate and forum. You, however, are regarded <lb/>
            as " wise" in a somewhat different sense — not alone on <lb/>
            account of natural ability and character, but also from your <lb/>
            industry and learning; and not in the sense in which the <lb/>
            vulgar, but that in which scholars, give that title. In this <lb/>
            sense we do not read of any one being called wise in <lb/>
            Greece except one man at Athens; and he, to be sure, had <lb/>
            been declared by the oracle of Apollo also to be "the su­ <lb/>
            premely wise man." For those who commonly go by the <lb/>
            name of the Seven Sages are not admitted into the category <lb/>
            of the wise by fastidious critics. Your wisdom people be­ <lb/>
            lieve to consist in this, that you look upon yourself as self­ <lb/>
            sufficing and regard the changes and chances of mortal life <lb/>
            as powerless to affect your virtue. Accordingly they are <lb/>
            always asking me, and doubtless also our Scaevola here, how <lb/>
            you bear the death of Africanus. This curiosity has been <lb/>
            the more excited from the fact that on the Nones of this <lb/>
            month, when we augurs met as usual in the suburban villa <lb/>
            of Decimus Brutus for consultation, you were not present, <lb/>
            though it had always been your habit to keep that appoint­ <lb/>
            ment and perform that duty with the utmost punctuality.</p>
          <p>Scaevola. Yes, indeed, Laelius, I am often asked the <lb/>
            question mentioned by Fannius. But I answer in accord­ <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            ance with what I have observed: I say that you bear in a <lb/>
            reasonable manner the grief which you have sustained in <lb/>
            the death of one who was at once a man of the most illus­ <lb/>
            trious character and a very dear friend. That of course <lb/>
            you could not but be affected—anything else would have <lb/>
            been wholly unnatural in a man of your gentle nature--but <lb/>
            that the cause of your non-attendance at our college meet­ <lb/>
            ing was illness, not melancholy.</p>
          <p>Laelius. Thanks, Scaevola! You are quite right; you <lb/>
            spoke the exact truth. For in fact I had no right to allow <lb/>
            myself to be withdrawn from a duty which I had regularly <lb/>
            performed, as long as I was well, by any personal misfor­ <lb/>
            tune; nor do I think that anything that can happen will <lb/>
            cause a man of principle to intermit a duty. As for your <lb/>
            telling me, Fannius, of the honourable appellation given me <lb/>
            (an appellation to which I do not recognise my title, and <lb/>
            to which I make no claim), you doubtless act from feelings <lb/>
            of affection; but I must say that you seem to me to do less <lb/>
            than justice to Cato. If any one was ever " wise,”—of which <lb/>
            I have my doubts,-he was. Putting aside everything else, <lb/>
            consider how he bore his son's death! I had not forgotten <lb/>
            Paulus; I had seen with my own eyes Gallus. But they <lb/>
            lost their sons when mere children; Cato his when he was <lb/>
            a full-grown man with an assured reputation. Do not <lb/>
            therefore be in a hurry to reckon as Cato's superior even <lb/>
            that same famous personage whom Apollo, as you say, de­ <lb/>
            clared to be "the wisest." Remember the former's reputa­ <lb/>
            tion rests on deeds, the latter's on words.</p>
          <p>3. Now, as far as I am concerned (I speak to both of you <lb/>
            now), believe me the case stands thus. If I were to say that <lb/>
            I am not affected by regret for Scipio, I must leave the <lb/>
            philosophers to justify my conduct, but in point of fact I <lb/>
            should be telling a lie. Affected of course I am by the loss <lb/>
            of a friend as I think there will never be again, such as I <lb/>
            can fearlessly say there never was before. But I stand in <lb/>
            no need of medicine. I can find my own consolation, and it <lb/>
            consists chiefly in my being free from the mistaken notion <lb/>
            which generally causes pain at the departure of friends. <lb/>
            To Scipio I am convinced no evil has befallen: mine is <lb/>
            the disaster, if disaster there be; and to be severely dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            tressed at one's own misfortunes does not show that you love <lb/>
            your friend, but that you love yourself.</p>
          <p>As for him, who can say that all is not more than well? <lb/>
            For, unless he had taken the fancy to wish for immortality, <lb/>
            the last thing of which he ever thought, what is there for <lb/>
            which mortal man" may wish that he did not attain? In his <lb/>
            early manhood he more than justified by extraordinary <lb/>
            personal courage the hopes which his fellow-citizens had <lb/>
            conceived of him as a child. He never was a candidate for <lb/>
            the consulship, yet! was elected consul twice: the first time <lb/>
            before the legal age; the second at a time which, as far <lb/>
            as he was concerned, was soon enough, but was near being <lb/>
            too late for the interests of the State. By the overthrow of <lb/>
            two cities which were the most bitter enemies of our Em­ <lb/>
            pire, he put an end not only to the wars then raging, but <lb/>
            also to the possibility of others in the future. What need <lb/>
            to mention the exquisite grace of his manners, his dutiful <lb/>
            devotion to his mother, his generosity to his sisters, his <lb/>
            liberality to his relations, the integrity of his conduct to <lb/>
            every one? You know all this already. Finally, the esti­ <lb/>
            mation in which his fellow-citizens held him has been <lb/>
            shown by the signs of mourning which accompanied his <lb/>
            obsequies. What could such a man have gained by the <lb/>
            addition of a few years ? Though age need not be a burden, <lb/>
            -as I remember Cato arguing in the presence of myself and <lb/>
            Scipio two years before he died,-yet it cannot but take <lb/>
            away the vigour and freshness which Scipio was still en­ <lb/>
            joying. We may conclude therefore that his life, from the <lb/>
            good fortune which had attended him and the glory he had <lb/>
            obtained, was so circumstanced that it could not be bettered, <lb/>
            while the suddenness of his death saved him the sensation <lb/>
            of dying. As to the manner of his death it is difficult to <lb/>
            speak; you see what people suspect. Thus much, however, <lb/>
            I may say: Scipio in his lifetime saw many days of supreme <lb/>
            triumph and exultation, but none more magnificent than <lb/>
            his last, on which, upon the rising of the Senate, he was es­ <lb/>
            corted by the senators and the people of Rome, by the allies, <lb/>
            and by the Latins, to his own door. From such an elevation <lb/>
            of popular esteem the next step seems naturally to be an <lb/>
            ascent to the gods above, rather than a descent to Hades.</p><pb n="12"/>
            
          <p>4. For I am not one of these modern philosophers who <lb/>
            maintain that our souls perish with our bodies, and that <lb/>
            death ends all. With me ancient opinion has more weight: <lb/>
            whether it be that of our own ancestors, who attributed such <lb/>
            solemn observances to the dead, as they plainly would not <lb/>
            have done if they had believed them to be wholly anni­ <lb/>
            hilated; or that of the philosophers who once visited this <lb/>
            country, and who by their maxims and doctrines educated <lb/>
            Magna Graecia, which at that time was in a flourishing <lb/>
            condition, though it has now been ruined; or that of the <lb/>
            man who was declared by Apollo's oracle to be " most wise," <lb/>
            and who used to teach without the variation which is to be <lb/>
            found in most philosophers that the souls of men are <lb/>
            divine, and that when they have quitted the body a return <lb/>
            to heaven is open to them, least difficult to those who have <lb/>
            been most virtuous and just." This opinion was shared by <lb/>
            Scipio. Only a few days before his death-as though he <lb/>
            had a presentiment of what was coming-he discoursed for <lb/>
            three days on the state of the republic. The company con­ <lb/>
            sisted of Philus and Manlius and several others, and I had <lb/>
            brought you, Scaevola, along with me. The last part of <lb/>
            his discourse referred principally to the immortality of the <lb/>
            soul; for he told us what he had heard from the elder Afri­ <lb/>
            canus in a dream. Now if it be true that in proportion to <lb/>
            a man's goodness the escape from what may be called the <lb/>
            prison and bonds of the flesh is easiest, whom can we <lb/>
            imagine to have had an easier voyage to the gods than <lb/>
            Scipio? I am disposed to think, therefore, that in his case <lb/>
            mourning would be a sign of envy rather than of friendship. <lb/>
            If, however, the truth rather is that the body and soul perish <lb/>
            together, and that no sensation remains, then though there <lb/>
            is nothing good in death, at least there is nothing bad. Re­ <lb/>
            move sensation, and a man is exactly as though he had <lb/>
            never been born; and yet that this man was born is a joy <lb/>
            to me, and will be a subject of rejoicing to this State to <lb/>
            its last hour.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, as I said before, all is as well as possible with <lb/>
            him. Not so with me; for as I entered life before him, it <lb/>
            would have been fairer for me to leave it also before him. <lb/>
            Yet such is the pleasure I take in recalling our friendship, <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            that I look upon my life as having been a happy one because <lb/>
            I have spent it with Scipio. With him I was associated <lb/>
            in public and private business; with him I lived in Rome <lb/>
            and served abroad; and between us there was the most com­ <lb/>
            plete harmony in our tastes, our pursuits, and our senti­ <lb/>
            ments, which is the true secret of friendship. It is not there­ <lb/>
            fore in that reputation for wisdom mentioned just now by <lb/>
            Fannius—especially as it happens to be groundless-that I <lb/>
            find my happiness so much, as in the hope that the memory <lb/>
            of our friendship will be lasting. What makes me care the <lb/>
            more about this is the fact that in all history there are <lb/>
            scarcely three or four pairs of friends on record; and it is <lb/>
            classed with them that I cherish a hope of the friendship <lb/>
            of Scipio and Laelius being known to posterity.</p>
          <p>Fannius. Of course that must be so, Laelius. But since <lb/>
            you have mentioned the word friendship, and we are at <lb/>
            leisure, you would be doing me a great kindness, and I <lb/>
            expect Scaevola also, if you would do as it is your habit <lb/>
            to do when asked questions on other subjects, and tell us <lb/>
            your sentiments about friendship, its nature, and the rules <lb/>
            to be observed in regard to it.</p>
          <p>Scaevola. I shall of course be delighted. Fannius has <lb/>
            anticipated the very request I was about to make. So you <lb/>
            will be doing us both a great favour.</p>
          <p>5. Laelius. I should certainly have no objection if I felt <lb/>
            confidence in myself. For the theme is a noble one, and we <lb/>
            are (as Fannius has said) at leisure. But who am I? and <lb/>
            what ability have I ? What you propose is all very well for <lb/>
            professional philosophers, who are used, particularly if <lb/>
            Greeks, to have the subject for discussion proposed to them <lb/>
            on the spur of the moment. It is a task of considerable <lb/>
            difficulty, and requires no little practice. Therefore for a <lb/>
            set discourse on friendship you must go, I think, to pro- I <lb/>
            fessional lecturers. All I can do is to urge on you to regard <lb/>
            friendship as the greatest thing in the world; for there is <lb/>
            nothing which so fits in with our nature, or is so exactly <lb/>
            what we want in prosperity or adversity.</p>
          <p>But I must at the very beginning lay down this principle- <lb/>
            friendship can only exist between good men. I do not, <lb/>
            however, press this too closely, like the philosophers who <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            push their definitions to a superfluous accuracy. They have <lb/>
            truth on their side, perhaps, but it is of no practical ad­ <lb/>
            vantage. Those, I mean, who say that no one but the <lb/>
            " wise " is " good." Granted, by all means. But the " wis­ <lb/>
            dom " they mean is one to which no mortal ever yet attained. <lb/>
            We must concern ourselves with the facts of everyday life <lb/>
            as we find it-not imaginary and ideal perfections. Even <lb/>
            Gaius Fannius, Manius Curius, and Tiberius Coruncanius, <lb/>
            whom our ancestors decided to be "wise," I could never <lb/>
            declare to be so according to their standard. Let them, <lb/>
            then, keep this word " wisdom " to themselves. Everybody <lb/>
            is irritated by it; no one understands what it means. Let <lb/>
            them but grant that the men I mentioned were "good." <lb/>
            No, they won't do that either. No one but the " wise " can <lb/>
            be allowed that title, say they. Well, then, let us dismiss <lb/>
            them and manage as best we may with our own poor <lb/>
            mother wit, as the phrase is.</p>
          <p>We mean then by the " good" those whose actions and <lb/>
            lives leave no question as to their honour, purity, equity, <lb/>
            and liberality; who are free from greed, lust, and violence; <lb/>
            and who have the courage of their convictions. The men <lb/>
            I have just named may serve as examples. Such men as <lb/>
            these being generally accounted " good," let us agree to call <lb/>
            them so, on the ground that to the best of human ability <lb/>
            they follow nature as the most perfect guide to a good life.</p>
          <p>Now this truth seems clear to me, that nature has so <lb/>
            formed us that a certain tie unites us all, but that this tie <lb/>
            becomes stronger from proximity. So it is that fellow- <lb/>
            citizens are preferred in our affections to foreigners, re­ <lb/>
            lations to strangers; for in their case Nature herself has <lb/>
            caused a kind of friendship to exist, though it is one which <lb/>
            lacks some of the elements of permanence. Friendship <lb/>
            excels relationship in this, that whereas you may eliminate <lb/>
            affection from relationship, you cannot do so from friend­ <lb/>
            ship. Without it relationship still exists in name, friend­ <lb/>
            ship does not. You may best understand this friendship by <lb/>
            considering that, whereas the merely natural ties uniting <lb/>
            the human race are indefinite, this one is so concentrated, <lb/>
            and confined to so narrow a sphere, that affection is ever <lb/>
            shared by two persons only or at most by a few.</p><pb n="15"/>
            
          <p>6. Now friendship may be thus defined: a complete accord <lb/>
            on all subjects human and divine, joined with mutual good­ <lb/>
            will and affection. And with the exception of wisdom, I am <lb/>
            inclined to think nothing better than this has been given to <lb/>
            man by the immortal gods. There are people who give <lb/>
            the palm to riches or to good health, or to power and office, <lb/>
            many even to sensual pleasures. This last is the ideal of <lb/>
            brute beasts; and of the others we may say that they are <lb/>
            frail and uncertain, and depend less on our own prudence <lb/>
            than on the caprice of fortune. Then there are those who <lb/>
            find the chief good" in virtue. Well, that is a noble <lb/>
            doctrine. But the very virtue they talk of is the parent <lb/>
            and preserver of friendship, and without it friendship can­ <lb/>
            not possibly exist.</p>
          <p>Let us, I repeat, use the word virtue in the ordinary <lb/>
            acceptation and meaning of the term, and do not let us <lb/>
            define it in high-flown language. Let us account as good <lb/>
            the persons usually considered so, such as Paulus, Cato, <lb/>
            Gallus, Scipio, and Philus. Such men as these are good <lb/>
            enough for everyday life; and we need not trouble ourselves <lb/>
            about those ideal characters which are nowhere to be <lb/>
            met with.</p>
          <p>Well, between men like these the advantages of friendship <lb/>
            are almost more than I can say. To begin with, how can <lb/>
            life be worth living, to use the words of Ennius, which lacks <lb/>
            that repose which is to be found in the mutual good-will of <lb/>
            a friend? What can be more delightful than to have some <lb/>
            one to whom you can say everything with the same ab­ <lb/>
            solute confidence as to yourself? Is not prosperity robbed <lb/>
            of half its value if you have no one to share your joy? On <lb/>
            the other hand, misfortunes would be hard to bear if there <lb/>
            were not some one to feel them even more acutely than <lb/>
            yourself. In a word, other objects of ambition serve for <lb/>
            particular ends-riches for use, power for securing homage, <lb/>
            office for reputation, pleasure for enjoyment, health for <lb/>
            freedom from pain and the full use of the functions of the <lb/>
            body. But friendship embraces innumerable advantages. <lb/>
            Turn which way you please, you will find it at hand. It is <lb/>
            everywhere; and yet never out of place, never unwelcome. <lb/>
            Fire and water themselves, to use a common expression, are <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            not of more universal use than friendship. I am not now <lb/>
            speaking of the common or modified form of it, though even <lb/>
            that is a source of pleasure and profit, but of that true <lb/>
            and complete friendship which existed between the select <lb/>
            few who are known to fame. Such friendship enhances <lb/>
            prosperity, and relieves adversity of its burden by halving <lb/>
            and sharing it.</p>
          <p>7. And great and numerous as are the blessings of friend­ <lb/>
            ship, this certainly is the sovereign one, that it gives us <lb/>
            bright hopes for the future and forbids weakness and de­ <lb/>
            spair. In the face of a true friend a man sees as it were <lb/>
            a second self. So that where his friend is he is; if his <lb/>
            friend be rich, he is not poor; though he be weak, his <lb/>
            friend's strength is his; and in his friend's life he enjoys <lb/>
            a second life after his own is finished. This last is perhaps <lb/>
            the most difficult to conceive. But such is the effect of the <lb/>
            respect, the loving remembrance, and the regret of friends <lb/>
            which follow us to the grave. While they take the sting <lb/>
            out of death, they add a glory to the life of the survivors. <lb/>
            Nay, if you eliminate from nature the tie of affection, there <lb/>
            will be an end of house and city, nor will so much as the <lb/>
            cultivation of the soil be left. If you don't see the virtue <lb/>
            of friendship and harmony, you may learn it by observing <lb/>
            the effects of quarrels and feuds. Was any family ever so <lb/>
            well established, any State so firmly settled, as to be be­ <lb/>
            yond the reach of utter destruction from animosities and <lb/>
            factions? This may teach you the immense advantage of <lb/>
            friendship.</p>
          <p>They say that a certain philosopher of Agrigentum, in <lb/>
            a Greek poem, pronounced with the authority of an oracle <lb/>
            the doctrine that whatever in nature and the universe was <lb/>
            unchangeable was so in virtue of the binding force of friend­ <lb/>
            ship; whatever was changeable was so by the solvent power <lb/>
            of discord. And indeed this is a truth which everybody <lb/>
            understands and practically attests by experience. For if <lb/>
            any marked instance of loyal friendship in confronting or <lb/>
            sharing danger comes to light, every one applauds it to the <lb/>
            echo. What cheers there were, for instance, all over the <lb/>
            theatre at a passage in the new play of my friend and guest <lb/>
            Pacuvius; where the king, not knowing which of the two <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            was Orestes, Pylades declared himself to be Orestes, that <lb/>
            he might die in his stead, while the real Orestes kept on <lb/>
            asserting that it was he. The audience rose en masse and <lb/>
            clapped their hands. And this was at an incident in fiction: <lb/>
            what would they have done, must we suppose, if it had <lb/>
            been in real life? You can easily see what a natural feeling <lb/>
            it is, when men who would not have had the resolution to <lb/>
            act thus themselves, shewed how right they thought it in <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>I don't think I have any more to say about friendship. <lb/>
            If there is any more, and I have no doubt there is much, <lb/>
            you must, if you care to do so, consult those who profess <lb/>
            to discuss such matters.</p>
          <p>Fannius. We would rather apply to you. Yet I have <lb/>
            often consulted such persons, and have heard what they had <lb/>
            to say with a certain satisfaction. But in your discourse <lb/>
            one somehow feels that there is a different strain.</p>
          <p>Scaevola. You would have said that still more, Fannius, <lb/>
            if you had been present the other day in Scipio's pleasure- <lb/>
            grounds when we had the discussion about the State. How <lb/>
            splendidly he stood up for justice against Philus's elaborate <lb/>
            speech.</p>
          <p>Fannius. Ah! it was naturally easy for the justest of <lb/>
            men to stand up for justice.</p>
          <p>Scaevola. Well, then, what about friendship? Who could <lb/>
            discourse on it more easily than the man whose chief glory <lb/>
            is a friendship maintained with the most absolute fidelity, <lb/>
            constancy, and integrity?</p>
          <p>8. Laelius. Now you are really using force. It makes no <lb/>
            difference what kind of force you use: force it is. For it is <lb/>
            neither easy nor right to refuse a wish of my sons-in-law, <lb/>
            particularly when the wish is a creditable one in itself.</p>
          <p>Well, then, it has very often occurred to me when think­ <lb/>
            ing about friendship, that the chief point to be considered <lb/>
            was this: is it weakness and want of means that make <lb/>
            friendship desired? I mean, is its object an interchange of <lb/>
            good offices, so that each may give that in which he is <lb/>
            strong, and receive that in which he is weak? Or is it not <lb/>
            rather true that, although this is an advantage naturally be­ <lb/>
            longing to friendship, yet its original cause is quite other, <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            prior in time, more noble in character, and springing more <lb/>
            directly from our nature itself ? The Latin word for friend­ <lb/>
            ship—amicitia—is derived from that for love—amor; and <lb/>
            love is certainly the prime mover in contracting mutual af­ <lb/>
            fection. For as to material advantages, it often happens <lb/>
            that those are obtained even by men who are courted by a <lb/>
            mere show of friendship and treated with respect from in­ <lb/>
            terested motives. But friendship by its nature admits of <lb/>
            no feigning, no pretence: as far as it goes it is both genuine <lb/>
            and spontaneous. Therefore I gather that friendship springs <lb/>
            from a natural impulse rather than a wish for help: from <lb/>
            an inclination of the heart, combined with a certain in­ <lb/>
            stinctive feeling of love, rather than from a deliberate <lb/>
            calculation of the material advantage it was likely to confer. <lb/>
            The strength of this feeling you may notice in certain ani­ <lb/>
            mals. They show such love to their offspring for a certain <lb/>
            period, and are so beloved by them, that they clearly have <lb/>
            a share in this natural, instinctive affection. But of course <lb/>
            it is more evident in the case of man: first, in the natural <lb/>
            affection between children and their parents, an affection <lb/>
            which only shocking wickedness can sunder; and next, when <lb/>
            the passion of love has attained to a like strength—on our <lb/>
            finding, that is, some one person with whose character and <lb/>
            nature we are in full sympathy, because we think that we <lb/>
            perceive in him what I may call the beacon-light of virtue. <lb/>
            For nothing inspires love, nothing conciliates affection, like <lb/>
            virtue. Why, in a certain sense we may be said to feel <lb/>
            affection even for men we have never seen, owing to their <lb/>
            honesty and virtue. Who, for instance, fails to dwell on the <lb/>
            memory of Gaius Fabricius and Manius Curius with some <lb/>
            affection and warmth of feeling, though he has never seen <lb/>
            them? Or who but loathes Tarquinius Superbus, Spurius <lb/>
            Cassius, Spurius Maelius? We have fought for empire in <lb/>
            Italy with two great generals, Pyrrhus and Hannibal. For <lb/>
            the former, owing to his probity, we entertain no great <lb/>
            feelings of enmity: the latter, owing to his cruelty, our coun­ <lb/>
            try has detested and always will detest.</p>
          <p>9. Now, if the attraction of probity is so great that we <lb/>
            can love it not only in those whom we have never seen, but, <lb/>
            what is more, actually in an enemy, we need not be surprised <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            if men's affections are roused when they fancy that they <lb/>
            have seen virtue and goodness in those with whom a close <lb/>
            intimacy is possible. I do not deny that affection is strength­ <lb/>
            ened by the actual receipt of benefits, as well as by the <lb/>
            perception of a wish to render service, combined with a <lb/>
            closer intercourse. When these are added to the original <lb/>
            impulse of the heart, to which I have alluded, a quite sur­ <lb/>
            prising warmth of feeling springs up. And if any one thinks <lb/>
            that this comes from a sense of weakness, that each may <lb/>
            have some one to help him to his particular need, all I can <lb/>
            say is that, when he maintains it to be born of want and <lb/>
            poverty, he allows to friendship an origin very base, and a <lb/>
            pedigree, if I may be allowed the expression, far from noble. <lb/>
            If this had been the case, a man's inclination to friendship <lb/>
            would be exactly in proportion to his low opinion of his own <lb/>
            resources. Whereas the truth is quite the other way. For <lb/>
            when a man's confidence in himself is greatest, when he is <lb/>
            so fortified by virtue and wisdom as to want nothing and to <lb/>
            feel absolutely self-dependent, it is then that he is most <lb/>
            conspicuous for seeking out and keeping up friendships. Did <lb/>
            Africanus, for example, want anything of me? Not the <lb/>
            least in the world! Neither did I of him. In my case it <lb/>
            was an admiration of his virtue, in his an opinion, may be, <lb/>
            which he entertained of my character, that caused our affec­ <lb/>
            tion. Closer intimacy added to the warmth of our feelings. <lb/>
            But though many great material advantages did ensue, they <lb/>
            were not the source from which our affection proceeded. <lb/>
            For as we are not beneficent and liberal with any view of <lb/>
            extorting gratitude, and do not regard an act of kindness <lb/>
            as an investment, but follow a natural inclination to lib­ <lb/>
            erality ; so 'we look on friendship as worth trying for, not <lb/>
            because we are attracted to it by the expectation of ulterior <lb/>
            gain, but in the conviction that what it has to give us is <lb/>
            from first to last included in the feeling itself.</p>
          <p>Far different is the view of those who, like brute beasts, <lb/>
            refer everything to sensual pleasure. And no wonder. Men <lb/>
            who have degraded all their powers of thought to an object <lb/>
            so mean and contemptible can of course raise their eyes to <lb/>
            nothing lofty, to nothing grand and divine. Such persons <lb/>
            indeed let us leave out of the present question. And let us <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            accept the doctrine that the sensation of love and the <lb/>
            warmth of inclination have their origin in a spontaneous <lb/>
            feeling which arises directly the presence of probity is in­ <lb/>
            dicated. When once men have conceived the inclination, <lb/>
            they of course try to attach themselves to the object of it, <lb/>
            and move themselves nearer and nearer to him. Their aim <lb/>
            is that they may be on the same footing and the same level <lb/>
            in regard to affection, and be more inclined to do a good <lb/>
            service than to ask a return, and that there should be this <lb/>
            noble rivalry between them. Thus both truths will be es­ <lb/>
            tablished. We shall get the most important material ad­ <lb/>
            vantages from friendship; and its origin from a natural <lb/>
            impulse rather than from a sense of need will be at once <lb/>
            more dignified and more in accordance with fact. For if it <lb/>
            were true that its material advantages cemented friendship, <lb/>
            it would be equally true that any change in them would dis­ <lb/>
            solve it. But nature being incapable of change, it follows <lb/>
            that genuine friendships are eternal.</p>
          <p>So much for the origin of friendship. But perhaps you <lb/>
            would not care to hear any more.</p>
          <p>Fannius. Nay, pray go on; let us have the rest, Laelius. <lb/>
            I take on myself to speak for my friend here as his senior.</p>
          <p>Scaevola. Quite right! Therefore, pray let us hear.</p>
          <p>10. Laelius. Well, then, my good friends, listen to some <lb/>
            conversations about friendship which very frequently passed <lb/>
            between Scipio and myself. I must begin by telling you, <lb/>
            however, that he used to say that the most difficult thing in <lb/>
            the world was for a friendship to remain unimpaired to the <lb/>
            end of life. So many things might intervene: conflicting <lb/>
            interests; differences of opinion in politics; frequent changes <lb/>
            in character, owing sometimes to misfortunes, sometimes to <lb/>
            advancing years. He used to illustrate these facts from the <lb/>
            analogy of boyhood, since the warmest affections between <lb/>
            boys are often laid aside with the boyish toga; and even if <lb/>
            they did manage to keep them up to adolescence, they were <lb/>
            sometimes broken by a rivalry in courtship, or for some <lb/>
            other advantage to which their mutual claims were not com­ <lb/>
            patible. Even if the friendship was prolonged beyond that <lb/>
            time, yet it frequently received a rude shock should the two <lb/>
            happen to be competitors for office. For while the most <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            fatal blow to friendship in the majority of cases was the <lb/>
            lust of gold, in the case of the best men it was a rivalry for <lb/>
            office and reputation, by which it had often happened that <lb/>
            the most violent enmity had arisen between the closest <lb/>
            friends.</p>
          <p>Again, wide breaches and, for the most part, justifiable <lb/>
            ones were caused by an immoral request being made of <lb/>
            friends, to pander to a man's unholy desires or to assist him <lb/>
            in inflicting a wrong. A refusal, though perfectly right, is <lb/>
            attacked by those to whom they refuse compliance as a vio­ <lb/>
            lation of the laws of friendship. Now the people who have <lb/>
            no scruples as to the requests they make to their friends, <lb/>
            thereby allow that they are ready to have no scruples as to <lb/>
            what they will do for their friends; and it is the recrimina­ <lb/>
            tions of such people which commonly not only quench friend­ <lb/>
            ships, but give rise to lasting enmities. " In fact," he used <lb/>
            to say, " these fatalities overhang friendship in such num­ <lb/>
            bers that it requires not only wisdom but good luck also to <lb/>
            escape them all."</p>
          <p>11. With these premises, then, let us first, if you please, <lb/>
            examine the question-how far ought personal feeling to go <lb/>
            in friendship? For instance: suppose Coriolanus to have <lb/>
            had friends, ought they to have joined him in invading his <lb/>
            country? Again, in the case of Vecellinus or Spurius <lb/>
            Maelius, ought their friends to have assisted them in their <lb/>
            attempt to establish a tyranny? Take two instances of <lb/>
            either line of conduct. When Tiberius Gracchus attempted <lb/>
            his revolutionary measures he was deserted, as we saw, by <lb/>
            Quintus Tubero and the friends of his own standing. On <lb/>
            the other hand, a friend of your own family, Scaevola, Gaius <lb/>
            Blossius of Cumae, took a different course. I was acting as <lb/>
            assessor to the consuls Laenas and Rupilius to try the con­ <lb/>
            spirators, and Blossius pleaded for my pardon on the ground <lb/>
            that his regard for Tiberius Gracchus had been so high that <lb/>
            he looked upon his wishes as law. " Even if he had wished <lb/>
            you to set fire to the Capitol ? " said I. " That is a thing," <lb/>
            he replied, " that he never would have wished." " Ah, but <lb/>
            if he had wished it?" said I. "I would have obeyed." The <lb/>
            wickedness of such a speech needs no comment. And in <lb/>
            point of fact he was as good and better than his word; for <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            he did not wait for orders in the audacious proceedings of <lb/>
            Tiberius Gracchus, but was the head and front of them, <lb/>
            and was a leader rather than an abettor of his madness. <lb/>
            The result of his infatuation was that he fled to Asia, terri­ <lb/>
            fied by the special commission appointed to try him, joined <lb/>
            the enemies of his country, and paid a penalty to the republic <lb/>
            as heavy as it was deserved. I conclude, then, that the <lb/>
            plea of having acted in the interests of a friend is not a <lb/>
            valid excuse for a wrong action. For, seeing that a be­ <lb/>
            lief in a man's virtue is the original cause of friendship, <lb/>
            friendship can hardly remain if virtue be abandoned. But if <lb/>
            we decide it to be right to grant our friends whatever they <lb/>
            wish, and to ask them for whatever we wish, perfect wisdom <lb/>
            must be assumed on both sides if no mischief is to happen. <lb/>
            But we cannot assume this perfect wisdom; for we are <lb/>
            speaking only of such friends as are ordinarily to be met <lb/>
            with, whether we have actually seen them or have been told <lb/>
            about them-men, that is to say, of everyday life. I must <lb/>
            quote some examples of such persons, taking care to select <lb/>
            such as approach nearest to our standard of wisdom. We <lb/>
            read, for instance, that Papus Aemilius was a close friend <lb/>
            of Gaius Luscinus. History tells us that they were twice <lb/>
            consuls together, and colleagues in the censorship. Again, <lb/>
            it is on record that Manius Curius and Tiberius Coruncanius <lb/>
            were on the most intimate terms with them and with each <lb/>
            other. Now, we cannot even suspect that any one of these <lb/>
            men ever asked of his friend anything that militated against <lb/>
            his honour or his oath or the interests of the republic. In <lb/>
            the case of such men as these there is no point in saying <lb/>
            that one of them would not have obtained such a request if <lb/>
            he had made it; for they were men of the most scrupulous <lb/>
            piety, and the making of such a request would involve a <lb/>
            breach of religious obligation no less than the granting it. <lb/>
            However, it is quite true that Gaius Carbo and Gaius Cato <lb/>
            did follow Tiberius Gracchus; and though his brother Caius <lb/>
            Gracchus did not do so at the time, he is now the most eager <lb/>
            of them all.</p>
          <p>12. We may then lay down this rule of friendship— <lb/>
            neither ask nor consent to do what is wrong. For the plea <lb/>
            "for friendship’s sake" is a discreditable one, and not to <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            be admitted for a moment. This rule holds good for all <lb/>
            wrong-doing, but more especially in such as involves dis­ <lb/>
            loyalty to the republic. For things have come to such a <lb/>
            point with us, my dear Fannius and Scaevola, that we are <lb/>
            bound to look somewhat far ahead to what is likely to hap­ <lb/>
            pen to the republic. The constitution, as known to our <lb/>
            ancestors, has already swerved somewhat from the regular <lb/>
            course and the lines marked out for it. Tiberius Gracchus <lb/>
            made an attempt to obtain the power of a king, or, I might <lb/>
            rather say, enjoyed that power for a few months. Had the <lb/>
            Roman people ever heard or seen the like before ? What the <lb/>
            friends and connexions that followed him, even after his <lb/>
            death, have succeeded in doing in the case of Publius Scipio <lb/>
            I cannot describe without tears. As for Carbo, thanks to <lb/>
            the punishment recently inflicted on Tiberius Gracchus, we <lb/>
            have by hook or by crook managed to hold out against his <lb/>
            attacks. But what to expect of the tribuneship of Caius <lb/>
            Gracchus I do not like to forecast. One thing leads to an­ <lb/>
            other; and once set going, the downward course proceeds <lb/>
            with ever-increasing velocity. There is the case of the <lb/>
            ballot: what a blow was inflicted first by the lex Gabinia, <lb/>
            and two years afterwards by the lex Cassia! I seem already <lb/>
            to see the people estranged from the Senate, and the most <lb/>
            important affairs at the mercy of the multitude. For you <lb/>
            may be sure that more people will learn how to set such <lb/>
            things in motion than how to stop them. What is the point <lb/>
            of these remarks ? This: no one ever makes any attempt of <lb/>
            this sort without friends to help him. We must therefore <lb/>
            impress upon good men that, should they become inevitably <lb/>
            involved in friendships with men of this kind, they ought <lb/>
            not to consider themselves under any obligation to stand by <lb/>
            friends who are disloyal to the republic. Bad men must <lb/>
            have the fear of punishment before their eyes: a punish­ <lb/>
            ment not less severe for those who follow than for those <lb/>
            who lead others to crime. Who was more famous and pow­ <lb/>
            erful in Greece than Themistocles ? At the head of the army <lb/>
            in the Persian war he had freed Greece; he owed his exile <lb/>
            to personal envy: but he did not submit to the wrong done <lb/>
            him by his ungrateful country as he ought to have done. <lb/>
            He acted as Coriolanus had acted among us twenty years <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            before. But no one was found to help them in their attacks <lb/>
            upon their fatherland. Both of them accordingly committed <lb/>
            suicide.</p>
          <p>We conclude, then, not only that no such confederation of <lb/>
            evilly disposed men must be allowed to shelter itself under <lb/>
            the plea of friendship, but that, on the contrary, it must be <lb/>
            visited with the severest punishment, lest the idea should <lb/>
            prevail that fidelity to a friend justifies even making war <lb/>
            upon one's country. And this is a case which I am inclined <lb/>
            to think, considering how things are beginning to go, will <lb/>
            sooner or later arise. And I care quite as much what the <lb/>
            state of the constitution will be after my death as what it <lb/>
            is now.</p>
          <p>13. Let this, then, be laid down as the first law of friend­ <lb/>
            ship, that we should ask from friends, and do for friends, <lb/>
            only what is good. But do not let us wait to be asked <lb/>
            either: let there be ever an eager readiness, and an absence <lb/>
            of hesitation. Let us have the courage to give advice with <lb/>
            candour. In friendship, let the influence of friends who <lb/>
            give good advice be paramount; and let this influence be <lb/>
            used to enforce advice not only in plain-spoken terms, but <lb/>
            sometimes, if the case demands it, with sharpness; and when <lb/>
            so used, let it be obeyed.</p>
          <p>I give you these rules because I believe that some won­ <lb/>
            derful opinions are entertained by certain persons who have, <lb/>
            I am told, a reputation for wisdom in Greece. There is <lb/>
            nothing in the world, by the way, beyond the reach of their <lb/>
            sophistry. Well, some of them teach that we should avoid <lb/>
            very close friendships, for fear that one man should have <lb/>
            to endure the anxieties of several. Each man, say they, has <lb/>
            enough and to spare on his own hands; it is too bad to be <lb/>
            involved in the cares of other people. The wisest course is <lb/>
            to hold the reins of friendship as loose as possible; you can <lb/>
            then tighten or slacken them at your will. For the first con­ <lb/>
            dition of a happy life is freedom from care, which no one's <lb/>
            mind can enjoy if it has to travail, so to speak, for others <lb/>
            besides itself. Another sect, I am told, gives vent to opinions <lb/>
            still less generous. I briefly touched on this subject just <lb/>
            now. They affirm that friendships should be sought solely <lb/>
            for the sake of the assistance they give, and not at all from <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            motives of feeling and affection; and that therefore just in <lb/>
            proportion as a man's power and means of support are low­ <lb/>
            est, he is most eager to gain friendships: thence it comes <lb/>
            that weak women seek the support of friendship more than <lb/>
            men, the poor more than the rich, the unfortunate rather <lb/>
            than those esteemed prosperous. What noble philosophy! <lb/>
            You might just as well take the sun out of the sky as <lb/>
            friendship from life; for the immortal gods have given us <lb/>
            nothing better or more delightful.</p>
          <p>But let us examine the two doctrines. What is the value <lb/>
            of this " freedom from care " ? It is very tempting at first <lb/>
            sight, but in practice it has in many cases to be put on <lb/>
            one side. For there is no business and no course of action <lb/>
            demanded from us by our honour which you can consistently <lb/>
            decline, or lay aside when begun, from a mere wish to <lb/>
            escape from anxiety. Nay, if we wish to avoid anxiety we <lb/>
            must avoid virtue itself, which necessarily involves some <lb/>
            anxious thoughts in showing its loathing and abhorrence for <lb/>
            the qualities which are opposite to itself-as kindness for ill­ <lb/>
            nature, self-control for licentiousness, courage for coward­ <lb/>
            ice. Thus you may notice that it is the just who are most <lb/>
            pained at injustice, the brave at cowardly actions, the tem­ <lb/>
            perate at depravity. It is then characteristic of a rightly or­ <lb/>
            dered mind to be pleased at what is good and grieved at the <lb/>
            reverse. Seeing then that the wise are not exempt from the <lb/>
            heart-ache (which must be the case unless we suppose all <lb/>
            human nature rooted out of their hearts), why should we <lb/>
            banish friendship from our lives, for fear of being involved <lb/>
            by it in some amount of distress? If you take away emo­ <lb/>
            tion, what difference remains I don't say between a man and <lb/>
            a beast, but between a man and a stone or a log of wood, <lb/>
            or anything else of that kind ?</p>
          <p>Neither should we give any weight to the doctrine that <lb/>
            virtue is something rigid and unyielding as iron. In point <lb/>
            of fact it is in regard to friendship, as in so many other <lb/>
            things, so supple and sensitive that it expands, so to speak, at <lb/>
            a friend's good fortune, contracts at his misfortunes. We <lb/>
            conclude then that mental pain which we must often <lb/>
            encounter on a friend's account is not of sufficient conse­ <lb/>
            quence to banish friendship from our life, any more than it <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            is true that the cardinal virtues are to be dispensed With <lb/>
            because they involve certain anxieties and distresses.</p>
          <p>14. Let me repeat then, "the clear indication of virtue, <lb/>
            to which a mind of like character is naturally attracted, is <lb/>
            the beginning of friendship.” When that is the case the rise <lb/>
            of affection is a necessity. For what can be more irrational <lb/>
            than to take delight in many objects incapable of response, <lb/>
            such as office, fame, splendid buildings, and personal decora­ <lb/>
            tion, and yet to take little or none in a sentient being <lb/>
            endowed with virtue, which has the faculty of loving or, if <lb/>
            I may use the expression, loving back ? For nothing is really <lb/>
            more delightful than a return of affection, and the mutual <lb/>
            interchange of kind feeling and good offices. And if we add, <lb/>
            as we may fairly do, that nothing so powerfully attracts and <lb/>
            draws one thing to itself as likeness does to friendship, it <lb/>
            will at once be admitted to be true that the good love the <lb/>
            good and attach them to themselves as though they were <lb/>
            united by blood and nature. For nothing can be more eager, <lb/>
            or rather greedy, for what is like itself than nature. So, <lb/>
            my dear Fannius and Scaevola, we may look upon this as <lb/>
            an established fact, that between good men there is, as it <lb/>
            were of necessity, a kindly feeling, which is the source of <lb/>
            friendship ordained by nature. But this same kindliness <lb/>
            affects the many also. For that is no unsympathetic or <lb/>
            selfish or exclusive virtue, which protects even whole nations <lb/>
            and consults their best interests. And that certainly it would <lb/>
            not have done had it disdained all affection for the common <lb/>
            herd.</p>
          <p>Again, the believers in the "interest" theory appear to <lb/>
            me to destroy the most attractive link in the chain of friend­ <lb/>
            ship. For it is not so much what one gets by a friend that <lb/>
            gives one pleasure, as the warmth of his feeling; and we <lb/>
            only care for a friend's service if it has been prompted by <lb/>
            affection. And so far from its being true that lack of means <lb/>
            is a motive for seeking friendship, it is usually those who <lb/>
            being most richly endowed with wealth and means, and <lb/>
            above all with virtue (which, after all, is a man's best sup­ <lb/>
            port), are least in need of another, that are most open­ <lb/>
            handed and beneficent. Indeed I am inclined to think that <lb/>
            friends ought at times to be in want of something. For <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            instance, what scope would my affections have had if Scipio <lb/>
            had never wanted my advice or co-operation at home or <lb/>
            abroad? It is not friendship, then, that follows material ad­ <lb/>
            vantage, but material advantage friendship.</p>
          <p>IS. We must not therefore listen to these superfine gentle­ <lb/>
            men when they talk of friendship, which they know neither <lb/>
            in theory nor in practice. For who, in heaven's name, would <lb/>
            choose a life of the greatest wealth and abundance on con­ <lb/>
            dition of neither loving or being beloved by any creature? <lb/>
            That is the sort of life tyrants endure. They, of course, can <lb/>
            count on no fidelity, no affection, no security for the good­ <lb/>
            will of any one. For them all is suspicion and anxiety; for <lb/>
            them there is no possibility of friendship. Who can love one <lb/>
            whom he fears, or by whom he knows that he is feared? <lb/>
            Yet such men have a show of friendship offered them, but <lb/>
            it is only a fair-weather show. If it ever happen that they <lb/>
            fall, as it generally does, they will at once understand how <lb/>
            friendless they are. So they say Tarquin observed in his <lb/>
            exile that he never knew which of his friends were real <lb/>
            and which sham, until he had ceased to be able to repay <lb/>
            either. Though what surprises me is that a man of his <lb/>
            proud and overbearing character should have a friend at all. <lb/>
            And as it was his character that prevented his having genu­ <lb/>
            ine friends, so it often happens in the case of men of un­ <lb/>
            usually great means-their very wealth forbids faithful <lb/>
            friendships. For not only is Fortune blind herself; but she <lb/>
            generally makes those blind also who enjoy her favours. <lb/>
            They are carried, so to speak, beyond themselves with self- <lb/>
            conceit and self-will; nor can anything be more perfectly <lb/>
            intolerable than a successful fool. You may often see it. <lb/>
            Men who before had pleasant manners enough undergo a <lb/>
            complete change on attaining power of office. They despise <lb/>
            their old friends: devote themselves to new.</p>
          <p>Now, can anything be more foolish than that men who <lb/>
            have all the opportunities which prosperity, wealth, and <lb/>
            great means can bestow, should secure all else which money <lb/>
            can buy-horses, servants, splendid upholstering, and costly <lb/>
            plate-but do not secure friends, who are, if I may use the <lb/>
            expression, the most valuable and beautiful furniture of <lb/>
            life? And yet, when they acquire the former, they know <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            not who will enjoy them, nor for whom they may be taking <lb/>
            all this trouble; for they will one and all eventually belong <lb/>
            to the strongest: while each man has a stable and inalienable <lb/>
            ownership in his friendships. And even if those possessions, <lb/>
            which are, in a manner, the gifts of fortune, do prove per­ <lb/>
            manent, life can never be anything but joyless which is <lb/>
            without the consolations and companionship of friends.</p>
          <p>16. To turn to another branch of our subject. We must <lb/>
            now endeavour to ascertain what limits are to be observed <lb/>
            in friendship—what is the boundary-line, so to speak, beyond <lb/>
            which our affection is not to go. On this point I notice three <lb/>
            opinions, with none of which I agree. One is that we should <lb/>
            love our friend just as much as we love ourselves, and no <lb/>
            more; another, that our affection to them should exactly cor­ <lb/>
            respond and equal theirs to us; a third, that a man should be <lb/>
            valued at exactly the same rate as he values himself. To not <lb/>
            one of these opinions do I assent. The first, which holds <lb/>
            that our regard for ourselves is to be the measure of our <lb/>
            regard for our friend, is not true; for how many things there <lb/>
            are which we would never have done for our own sakes, but <lb/>
            do for the sake of a friend! We submit to make requests <lb/>
            from unworthy people, to descend even to supplication; to <lb/>
            be sharper in invective, more violent in attack. Such actions <lb/>
            are not creditable in our own interests, but highly so in <lb/>
            those of our friends. There are many advantages too which <lb/>
            men of upright character voluntarily forego, or of which <lb/>
            they are content to be deprived, that their friends may enjoy <lb/>
            them rather than themselves.</p>
          <p>The second doctrine is that which limits friendship to an <lb/>
            exact equality in mutual good offices and good feelings, <lb/>
            But such a view reduces friendship to a question of figures <lb/>
            in a spirit far too narrow and illiberal, as though the object <lb/>
            were to have an exact balance in a debtor and creditor <lb/>
            account. True friendship appears to me to be something <lb/>
            richer and more generous than that comes to; and not to be <lb/>
            so narrowly on its guard against giving more than it <lb/>
            receives. In such a matter we must not be always afraid of <lb/>
            something being wasted or running over in our measure, or <lb/>
            of more than is justly due being devoted to our friendship.</p>
          <p>But the last limit proposed is the worst, namely, that a <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            friend's estimate of himself is to be the measure of our esti­ <lb/>
            mate of him. It often happens that a man has too humble <lb/>
            an idea of himself, or takes too despairing a view of his <lb/>
            chance of bettering his fortune. In such a case a friend <lb/>
            ought not to take the view of him which he takes of him­ <lb/>
            self. Rather he should do all he can to raise his drooping <lb/>
            spirits, and lead him to more cheerful hopes and thoughts.</p>
          <p>We must then find some other limit. But I must first men­ <lb/>
            tion the sentiment which used to call forth Scipio's severest <lb/>
            criticism. He often said that no one ever gave utterance <lb/>
            to anything more diametrically opposed to the spirit of <lb/>
            friendship than the author of the dictum, " You should love <lb/>
            your friend with the consciousness that you may one day <lb/>
            hate him." He could not be induced to believe that it was <lb/>
            rightfully attributed to Bias, who was counted as one of the <lb/>
            Seven Sages. It was the sentiment of some person with <lb/>
            sinister motives or selfish ambition, or who regarded every­ <lb/>
            thing as it affected his own supremacy. How can a man be <lb/>
            friends with another, if he thinks it possible that he may be <lb/>
            his enemy? Why, it will follow that he must wish and <lb/>
            desire his friend to commit as many. mistakes as possible, <lb/>
            that he may have all the more handles against him; and, <lb/>
            conversely, that he must be annoyed, irritated, and jealous <lb/>
            at the right actions or good fortune of his friends. This <lb/>
            maxim, then, let it be whose it will, is the utter destruction <lb/>
            of friendship. The true rule is to take such care in the <lb/>
            selection of our friends as never to enter upon a friend­ <lb/>
            ship with a man whom we could under any circumstances <lb/>
            come to hate. And even if we are unlucky in our choice, <lb/>
            we must put up with it-according to Scipio—in preference <lb/>
            to making calculations as to a future breach.</p>
          <p>17. The real limit to be observed in friendship is this: the <lb/>
            characters of two friends must be stainless. There must be <lb/>
            complete harmony of interests, purpose, and aims, without <lb/>
            exception. Then if the case arises of a friend's wish (not <lb/>
            strictly right in itself) calling for support in a matter involv­ <lb/>
            ing his life or reputation, we must make some concession <lb/>
            from the straight path-on condition, that is to say, that <lb/>
            extreme disgrace is not the consequence. Something must <lb/>
            be conceded to friendship. And yet we must not be entirely <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            careless of our reputation, nor regard the good opinion of <lb/>
            our fellow-citizens as a weapon which we can afford to <lb/>
            despise in conducting the business of our life, however lower­ <lb/>
            ing it may be to tout for it by flattery and smooth words. <lb/>
            We must by no means abjure virtue, which secures us <lb/>
            affection.</p>
          <p>But to return again to Scipio, the sole author of the dis­ <lb/>
            course on friendship. He used to complain that there was <lb/>
            nothing on which men bestowed so little pains: that every <lb/>
            one could tell exactly how many goats or sheep he had, but <lb/>
            not how many friends; and while they took pains in pro­ <lb/>
            curing the former, they were utterly careless in selecting <lb/>
            friends, and possessed no particular marks, so to speak, or <lb/>
            tokens by which they might judge of their suitability for <lb/>
            friendship. Now the qualities we ought to look out for in <lb/>
            making our selection are firmness, stability, constancy. <lb/>
            There is a plentiful lack of men so endowed, and it is diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to form a judgment without testing. Now this testing <lb/>
            can only be made during the actual existence of the friend­ <lb/>
            ship; for friendship so often precedes the formation of a <lb/>
            judgment, and makes a previous test impossible. If we are <lb/>
            prudent then, we shall rein in our impulse to affection as <lb/>
            we do chariot horses. We make a preliminary trial of <lb/>
            horses. So we should of friendship; and should test our <lb/>
            friends' characters by a kind of tentative friendship. It <lb/>
            may often happen that the untrustworthiness of certain men <lb/>
            is completely displayed in a small money matter; others who <lb/>
            are proof against a small sum are detected if it be large. <lb/>
            But even if some are found who think it mean to prefer <lb/>
            money to friendship, where shall we look for those who put <lb/>
            friendship before office, civil or military promotions, and <lb/>
            political power, and who, when the choice lies between these <lb/>
            things on the one side and the claims of friendship on the <lb/>
            other, do not give a strong preference to the former? It is <lb/>
            not in human nature to be indifferent to political power; and <lb/>
            if the price men have to pay for it is the sacrifice of friend­ <lb/>
            ship, they think their treason will be thrown into the shade <lb/>
            by the magnitude of the reward. This is why true friend­ <lb/>
            ship is very difficult to find among those who engage in <lb/>
            politics and the contest for office. Where can you find the <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            man to prefer his friend's advancement to his own? And <lb/>
            to say nothing of that, think how grievous and almost <lb/>
            intolerable it is to most men to share political disaster. You <lb/>
            will scarcely find anyone who can bring himself to do that. <lb/>
            And though what Ennius says is quite true,-" the hour of <lb/>
            need shews the friend indeed,"-yet it is in these two ways <lb/>
            that most people betray their untrustworthiness and incon­ <lb/>
            stancy, by looking down on friends when they are themselves <lb/>
            prosperous, or deserting them in their distress. A man, <lb/>
            then, who has shewn a firm, unshaken, and unvarying <lb/>
            friendship in both these contingencies we must reckon as <lb/>
            one of a class the rarest in the world, and all but super­ <lb/>
            human.</p>
          <p>18. Now, what is the quality to look out for as a warrant <lb/>
            for the stability and permanence of friendship? It is <lb/>
            loyalty. Nothing that lacks this can be stable. We should <lb/>
            also in making our selection look out for simplicity, a <lb/>
            social disposition, and a sympathetic nature, moved by <lb/>
            what moves us. These all contribute to maintain loyalty. <lb/>
            You can never trust a character which is intricate and <lb/>
            tortuous. Nor, indeed, is it possible for one to be trust­ <lb/>
            worthy and firm who is unsympathetic by nature and <lb/>
            unmoved by what affects ourselves. We may add, that he <lb/>
            must neither take pleasure in bringing accusations against <lb/>
            us himself, nor believe them when they are brought. All <lb/>
            these contribute to form that constancy which I have been <lb/>
            endeavouring to describe. And the result is, what I started <lb/>
            by saying, that friendship is only possible between good <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>Now there are two characteristic features in his treat­ <lb/>
            ment of his friends that a good (which may be regarded <lb/>
            as equivalent to a wise) man will always display. First, he <lb/>
            will be entirely without any make-believe or pretence of <lb/>
            feeling; for the open display even of dislike is more becom­ <lb/>
            ing to an ingenuous character than a studied concealment of <lb/>
            sentiment. Secondly, he will not only reject all accusations <lb/>
            brought against his friend by another, but he will not be <lb/>
            suspicious himself either, nor be always thinking that his <lb/>
            friend has acted improperly. Besides this, there should be a <lb/>
            certain pleasantness in word and manner which adds no <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            little flavour to friendship. A gloomy temper and unvarying <lb/>
            gravity may be very impressive; but friendship should be a <lb/>
            little less unbending, more indulgent and gracious, and more <lb/>
            inclined to all kinds of good-fellowship and good-nature.</p>
          <p>19. But here arises a question of some little difficulty. <lb/>
            Are there any occasions on which, assuming their worthi­ <lb/>
            ness, we should prefer new to old friends, just as we prefer <lb/>
            young to aged horses? The answer admits of no doubt <lb/>
            whatever. For there should be no satiety in friendship, as <lb/>
            there is in other things. The older the sweeter, as in wines <lb/>
            that keep well. And the proverb is a true one, " You must <lb/>
            eat many a peck of salt with a man to be thorough friends <lb/>
            with him." Novelty, indeed, has its advantage, which we <lb/>
            must not despise. There is always hope of fruit, as there <lb/>
            is in healthy blades of corn. But age too must have its <lb/>
            proper position; and, in fact, the influence of time and habit <lb/>
            is very great. To recur to the illustration of the horse <lb/>
            which I have just now used. Every one likes ceteris paribus <lb/>
            to use the horse to which he has been accustomed, rather <lb/>
            than one that is untried and new. And it is not only in the <lb/>
            case of a living thing that this rule holds good, but in <lb/>
            inanimate things also; for we like places where we have <lb/>
            lived the longest, even though they are mountainous and <lb/>
            covered with forest. But here is another golden rule in <lb/>
            friendship: put yourself on a level with your friend. For it <lb/>
            often happens that there are certain superiorities, as for <lb/>
            example Scipio's in what I may call our set. Now he never <lb/>
            assumed any airs of superiority over Philus, or Rupilius, <lb/>
            or Mummius, or over friends of a lower rank still. For <lb/>
            instance, he always shewed a deference to his brother Quintus <lb/>
            Maximus because he was his senior, who, though a man no <lb/>
            doubt of eminent character, was by no means his equal. He <lb/>
            used also to wish that all his friends should be the better for <lb/>
            his support. This is an example we should all follow. If <lb/>
            any of us have any advantage in personal character, intel­ <lb/>
            lect, or fortune, we should be ready to make our friends <lb/>
            sharers and partners in it with ourselves. For instance, if <lb/>
            their parents are in humble circumstances, if their relations <lb/>
            are powerful neither in intellect nor means, we should sup­ <lb/>
            ply their deficiencies and promote their rank and dignity. <note type="footnote"> 1—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            You know the legends of children brought up as servants <lb/>
            in ignorance of their parentage and family. When they are <lb/>
            recognized and discovered to be the sons of gods or kings, <lb/>
            they still retain their affection for the shepherds whom they <lb/>
            have for many years looked upon as their parents. Much <lb/>
            more ought this to be so in the case of real and undoubted <lb/>
            parents. For the advantages of genius and virtue, and in <lb/>
            short of every kind of superiority, are never realized to their <lb/>
            fullest extent until they are bestowed upon our nearest and <lb/>
            dearest.</p>
          <p>20. But the converse must also be observed. For in <lb/>
            friendship and relationship, just as those who possess any <lb/>
            superiority must put themselves on an equal footing with <lb/>
            those who are less fortunate, so these latter must not be <lb/>
            annoyed at being surpassed in genius, fortune, or rank. But <lb/>
            most people of that sort are forever either grumbling at <lb/>
            something, or harping on their claims; and especially if they <lb/>
            consider that they have services of their own to allege <lb/>
            involving zeal and friendship and some trouble to themselves. <lb/>
            People who are always bringing up their services are a nui­ <lb/>
            sance. The recipient ought to remember them; the performer <lb/>
            should never mention them. In the case of friends, then, <lb/>
            as the superior are bound to descend, so are they bound in <lb/>
            a certain sense to raise those below them. For there are <lb/>
            people who make their friendship disagreeable by imagining <lb/>
            themselves undervalued. This generally happens only to <lb/>
            those who think that they deserve to be so; and they ought <lb/>
            to be shewn by deeds as well as by words the groundlessness <lb/>
            of their opinion. Now the measure of your benefits should <lb/>
            be in the first place your own power to bestow, and in the <lb/>
            second place the capacity to bear them on the part of him on <lb/>
            whom you are bestowing affection and help. For, however <lb/>
            great your personal prestige may be, you cannot raise all <lb/>
            your friends to the highest offices of the State. For instance, <lb/>
            Scipio was able to make Publius Rupilius consul, but not his <lb/>
            brother Lucius. But granting that you can give anyone <lb/>
            anything you choose, you must have a care that it does not <lb/>
            prove to be beyond his powers.</p>
          <p>As a general rule, we must wait to make up our mind <lb/>
            about friendships till men's characters and years have <note type="footnote"> 2—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            arrived at their full strength and development. People must <lb/>
            not, for instance, regard as fast friends all whom in their <lb/>
            youthful enthusiasm for hunting or football they liked for <lb/>
            having the same tastes. By that rule, if it were a mere <lb/>
            question of time, no one would have such claims on our <lb/>
            affections as nurses and slave-tutors. Not that they are to <lb/>
            be neglected, but they stand on a different ground. It is <lb/>
            only these mature friendships that can be permanent. For <lb/>
            difference of character leads to difference of aims, and the <lb/>
            result of such diversity is to estrange friends. The sole <lb/>
            reason, for instance, which prevents good men from making <lb/>
            friends with bad, or bad with good, is that the divergence of <lb/>
            their characters and aims is the greatest possible.</p>
          <p>Another good rule in friendship is this: do not let an <lb/>
            excessive affection hinder the highest interests of your <lb/>
            friends. This very often happens. I will go again to the <lb/>
            region of fable for an instance. Neoptolemus could never <lb/>
            have taken Troy if he had been willing to listen to Ly­ <lb/>
            comedes, who had brought him up, and with many tears <lb/>
            tried to prevent his going there. Again, it often happens <lb/>
            that important business makes it necessary to part from <lb/>
            friends: the man who tries to baulk it, because he thinks <lb/>
            that he cannot endure the separation, is of a weak and <lb/>
            effeminate nature, and on that very account makes but a poor <lb/>
            friend. There are, of course, limits to what you ought to <lb/>
            expect from a friend and to what you should allow him to <lb/>
            demand of you. And these you must take into calculation in <lb/>
            every case.</p>
          <p>21. Again, there is such a disaster, so to speak, as having <lb/>
            to break off friendship. And sometimes it is one we can­ <lb/>
            not avoid. For at this point the stream of our discourse is <lb/>
            leaving the intimacies of the wise and touching on the <lb/>
            friendship of ordinary people. It will happen at times that <lb/>
            an outbreak of vicious conduct affects either a man's friends <lb/>
            themselves or strangers, yet the discredit falls on the friends. <lb/>
            In such cases friendships should be allowed to die out <lb/>
            gradually by an intermission of intercourse. They should, <lb/>
            as I have been told that Cato used to say, rather be <lb/>
            unstitched than torn in twain; unless, indeed, the injurious <lb/>
            conduct be of so violent and outrageous a nature as to <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            make an instant breach and separation the only possible <lb/>
            course consistent with honour and rectitude. Again, if a <lb/>
            change in character and aim takes place, as often happens, <lb/>
            or if party politics produces an alienation of feeling (I am <lb/>
            now speaking, as I said a short time ago, of ordinary friend... <lb/>
            ships, not of those of the wise), we shall have to be on <lb/>
            our guard against appearing to embark upon active enmity <lb/>
            while we only mean to resign a friendship. For there can <lb/>
            be nothing more discreditable than to be at open war with <lb/>
            a man with whom you have been intimate. Scipio, as you <lb/>
            are aware, had abandoned his friendship for Quintus <lb/>
            Pompeius on my account; and again, from differences of <lb/>
            opinion in politics, he became estranged from my colleague <lb/>
            Metellus. In both cases he acted with dignity and modera­ <lb/>
            tion, shewing that he was offended indeed, but without <lb/>
            rancour.</p>
          <p>Our first object, then, should be to prevent a breach; our <lb/>
            second, to secure that, if it does occur, our friendship <lb/>
            should seem to have died a natural rather than a violent <lb/>
            death. Next, we should take care that friendship is not <lb/>
            converted into active hostility, from which flow personal <lb/>
            quarrels, abusive language, and angry recriminations. <lb/>
            These last, however, provided that they do not pass all <lb/>
            reasonable limits of forbearance, we ought to put up with, <lb/>
            and, in compliment to an old friendship, allow the party that <lb/>
            inflicts the injury, not the one that submits to it, to be in the <lb/>
            wrong. Generally speaking, there is but one way of securing <lb/>
            and providing oneself against faults and inconveniences of <lb/>
            this sort—not to be too hasty in bestowing our affection, and <lb/>
            not to bestow it at all on unworthy objects.</p>
          <p>Now, by "worthy of friendship” I mean those who have <lb/>
            in themselves the qualities which attract affection. This sort <lb/>
            of man is rare; and indeed all excellent things are rare; and <lb/>
            nothing in the world is so hard to find as a thing entirely <lb/>
            and completely perfect of its kind. But most people not only <lb/>
            recognize nothing as good in our life unless it is profitable, <lb/>
            but look upon friends as so much stock, caring most for those <lb/>
            by whom they hope to make most profit. Accordingly they <lb/>
            never possess that most beautiful and most spontaneous <lb/>
            friendship which must be sought solely for itself without any <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            ulterior object. They fail also to learn from their own feel­ <lb/>
            ings the nature and the strength of friendship. For every <lb/>
            one loves himself, not for any reward which such love may <lb/>
            bring, but because he is dear to himself independently of <lb/>
            anything else. But unless this feeling is transferred to <lb/>
            another, what a real friend is will never be revealed; for he <lb/>
            is, as it were, a second self. But if we find these two <lb/>
            instincts shewing themselves in animals,-whether of the air <lb/>
            or the sea or the land, whether wild or tame,—first, a love <lb/>
            of self, which in fact is born in everything that lives alike; <lb/>
            and, secondly, an eagerness to find and attach themselves to <lb/>
            other creatures of their own kind; and if this natural action <lb/>
            is accompanied by desire and by something resembling <lb/>
            human love, how much more must this be the case in man by <lb/>
            the law of his nature? For man not only loves himself, but <lb/>
            seeks another whose spirit he may so blend with his own as <lb/>
            almost to make one being of two.</p>
          <p>22. But most people unreasonably, not to speak of mod­ <lb/>
            esty, want such a friend as they are unable to be themselves, <lb/>
            and expect from their friends what they do not themselves <lb/>
            give. The fair course is first to be good yourself, and then <lb/>
            to look out for another of like character. It is between such <lb/>
            that the stability in friendship of which we have been talking <lb/>
            can be secured; when, that is to say, men who are united <lb/>
            by affection learn, first of all, to rule those passions which <lb/>
            enslave others, and in the next place to take delight in fair <lb/>
            and equitable conduct, to bear each other's burdens, never to <lb/>
            ask each other for anything inconsistent with virtue and rec­ <lb/>
            titude, and not only to serve and love but also to respect <lb/>
            each other. I say " respect"; for if respect is gone, friend­ <lb/>
            ship has lost its brightest jewel. And this shows the mis­ <lb/>
            take of those who imagine that friendship gives a privilege <lb/>
            to licentiousness and sin. Nature has given us friendship <lb/>
            as the handmaid of virtue, not as a partner in guilt: to the <lb/>
            end that virtue, being powerless when isolated to reach the <lb/>
            highest objects, might succeed in doing so in union and <lb/>
            partnership with another. Those who enjoy in the present, <lb/>
            or have enjoyed in the past, or are destined to enjoy in the <lb/>
            future such a partnership as this, must be considered to have <lb/>
            secured the most excellent and auspicious combination for <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            reaching nature's highest good. This is the partnership, I <lb/>
            say, which combines moral rectitude, fame, peace of mind, <lb/>
            serenity: all that men think desirable because with them life <lb/>
            is happy, but without them cannot be so. This being our <lb/>
            best and highest object, we must, if we desire to attain it, <lb/>
            devote ourselves to virtue; for without virtue we can obtain <lb/>
            neither friendship nor anything else desirable. In fact, if <lb/>
            virtue be neglected, those who imagine themselves to possess <lb/>
            friends will find out their error as soon as some grave dis­ <lb/>
            aster forces them to make trial of them. Wherefore, I must <lb/>
            again and again repeat, you must satisfy your judgment be­ <lb/>
            fore engaging your affections: not love first and judge after­ <lb/>
            wards. We suffer from carelessness in many of our under­ <lb/>
            takings: in none more than in selecting and cultivating our <lb/>
            friends. We put the cart before the horse, and shut the <lb/>
            stable door when the steed is stolen, in defiance of the old <lb/>
            proverb. For, having mutually involved ourselves in a <lb/>
            long-standing intimacy or by actual obligations, all on a <lb/>
            sudden some cause of offence arises and we break off our <lb/>
            friendships in full career.</p>
          <p>23. It is this that makes such carelessness in a matter of <lb/>
            supreme importance all the more worthy of blame. I say <lb/>
            “supreme importance," because friendship is the one thing <lb/>
            about the utility of which everybody with one accord is <lb/>
            agreed. That is not the case in regard even to virtue itself; <lb/>
            for many people speak slightingly of virtue as though it <lb/>
            were mere puffing and self-glorification. Nor is it the case <lb/>
            with riches. Many look down on riches, being content with <lb/>
            a little and taking pleasure in poor fare and dress. And as <lb/>
            to the political offices for which some have a burning desire <lb/>
            -how many entertain such a contempt for them as to think <lb/>
            nothing in the world more empty and trivial!</p>
          <p>And so on with the rest; things desirable in the eyes <lb/>
            of some are regarded by very many as worthless. But <lb/>
            of friendship all think alike to a man, whether those <lb/>
            have devoted themselves to politics, or those who delight <lb/>
            in science and philosophy, or those who follow a <lb/>
            private way of life and care for nothing but their own <lb/>
            business, or those lastly who have given themselves body <lb/>
            and soul to sensuality-they all think, I say, that with­ <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            out friendship life is no life, if they want some part <lb/>
            of it, at any rate, to be noble. For friendship, in one <lb/>
            way or another, penetrates into the lives of us all, and <lb/>
            suffers no career to be entirely free from its influence. <lb/>
            Though a man be of so churlish and unsociable a nature as <lb/>
            to loathe and shun the company of mankind, as we are told <lb/>
            was the case with a certain Timon at Athens, yet even he <lb/>
            cannot refrain from seeking some one in whose hearing he <lb/>
            may disgorge the venom of his bitter temper. We should see <lb/>
            this most clearly, if it were possible that some god should <lb/>
            carry us away from these haunts of men, and place us some­ <lb/>
            where in perfect solitude, and then should supply us in <lb/>
            abundance with everything necessary to our nature, and yet <lb/>
            take from us entirely the opportunity of looking upon a <lb/>
            human being. Who could steel himself to endure such <lb/>
            a life? Who would not lose in his loneliness the zest <lb/>
            for all pleasures? And indeed this is the point of the <lb/>
            observation of, I think, Archytas of Tarentum. I have it <lb/>
            third hand; men who were my seniors told me that their <lb/>
            seniors had told them. It was this: " If a man could ascend <lb/>
            to heaven and get a clear view of the natural order of the <lb/>
            universe, and the beauty of the heavenly bodies, that won­ <lb/>
            derful spectacle would give him small pleasure, though noth­ <lb/>
            ing could be conceived more delightful if he had but had <lb/>
            some one to whom to tell what he had seen." So true it <lb/>
            is that nature abhors isolation, and ever leans upon some­ <lb/>
            thing as a stay and support; and this is found in its most <lb/>
            pleasing form in our closest friend.</p>
          <p>24. But though Nature also declares by so many indica­ <lb/>
            tions what her wish and object and desire is, we yet in a <lb/>
            manner turn a deaf ear and will not hear her warnings. <lb/>
            The intercourse between friends is varied and complex, and <lb/>
            it must often happen that causes of suspicion and offence <lb/>
            arise, which a wise man will sometimes avoid, at other times <lb/>
            remove, at others treat with indulgence. The one possible <lb/>
            cause of offence that must be faced is when the interests of <lb/>
            your friend and your own sincerity are at stake. For in­ <lb/>
            stance, it often happens that friends need remonstrance and <lb/>
            even reproof. When these are administered in a kindly <lb/>
            spirit they ought to be taken in good part. But somehow or <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            other there is truth in what my friend Terence says in his <lb/>
            Andria: <lb/>
            Compliance gets us friends, plain speaking hate. <lb/>
            Plain speaking is a cause of trouble, if the result of it is <lb/>
            resentment, which is poison of friendship; but compliance is <lb/>
            really the cause of much more trouble, because by indulging <lb/>
            his faults it lets a friend plunge into headlong ruin. But <lb/>
            the man who is most to blame is he who resents plain speak­ <lb/>
            ing and allows flattery to egg him on to his ruin. On this <lb/>
            point, then, from first to last there is need of deliberation and <lb/>
            care. If we remonstrate, it should be without bitterness; if <lb/>
            we reprove, there should be no word of insult. In the matter <lb/>
            of compliance (for I am glad to adopt Terence's word), <lb/>
            though there should be every courtesy, yet that base kind <lb/>
            which assists a man in vice should be far from us, for it is <lb/>
            unworthy of a free-born man, to say nothing of a friend. <lb/>
            It is one thing to live with a tyrant, another with a friend. <lb/>
            But if a man's ears are so closed to plain speaking that he <lb/>
            cannot bear to hear the truth from a friend, we may give <lb/>
            him up in despair. This remark of Cato's, as so many of his <lb/>
            did, shews great acuteness: " There are people who owe more <lb/>
            to bitter enemies than to apparently pleasant friends: the <lb/>
            former often speak the truth, the latter never." Besides, it <lb/>
            is a strange paradox that the recipients of advice should feel <lb/>
            no annoyance where they ought to feel it, and yet feel so <lb/>
            much where they ought not. They are not at all vexed at <lb/>
            having committed a fault, but very angry at being reproved <lb/>
            for it. On the contrary, they ought to be grieved at the <lb/>
            crime and glad of the correction.</p>
          <p>25. Well, then, if it is true that to give and receive advice <lb/>
            -the former with freedom and yet without bitterness, the <lb/>
            latter with patience and without irritation—is peculiarly <lb/>
            appropriate to genuine friendship, it is no less true that there <lb/>
            can be nothing more utterly subversive of friendship than <lb/>
            flattery, adulation, and base compliance. I use as many <lb/>
            terms as possible to brand this vice of light-minded, untrust­ <lb/>
            worthy men, whose sole object in speaking is to please with­ <lb/>
            out any regard to truth. In everything false pretence is bad, <lb/>
            for it suspends and vitiates our power of discerning the <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            truth. But to nothing it is so hostile as to friendship; for it <lb/>
            destroys that frankness without which friendship is an <lb/>
            empty name. For the essence of friendship being that two <lb/>
            minds become as one, how can that ever take place if the <lb/>
            mind of each of the separate parties to it is not single and <lb/>
            uniform, but variable, changeable, and complex? Can any­ <lb/>
            thing be so pliable, so wavering, as the mind of a man whose <lb/>
            attitude depends not only on another's feeling and wish, but <lb/>
            on his very looks and nods? <lb/>
            If one says "No," I answer 11 No ” ; if “ Yes," I answer " Yes." <lb/>
            In fine, I've laid this task upon myself <lb/>
            To echo all that's said­ <lb/>
            to quote my old friend Terence again. But he puts these <lb/>
            words into the mouth of a Gnatho. To admit such a man <lb/>
            into one's intimacy at all is a sign of folly. But there are <lb/>
            many people like Gnatho, and it is when they are superior <lb/>
            either in position or fortune or reputation that their flat­ <lb/>
            teries become mischievous, the weight of their position <lb/>
            making up for the lightness of their character. But if we <lb/>
            only take reasonable care, it is as easy to separate and dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish a genuine from a specious friend as anything else <lb/>
            that is coloured and artificial from what is sincere and gen­ <lb/>
            uine. A public assembly, though composed of men of the <lb/>
            smallest possible culture, nevertheless will see clearly the <lb/>
            difference between a mere demagogue (that is, a flatterer <lb/>
            and untrustworthy citizen) and a man of principle, stand­ <lb/>
            ing, and solidity. It was by this kind of flattering language <lb/>
            that Gaius Papirius the other day endeavoured to tickle <lb/>
            the ears of the assembled people, when proposing his law <lb/>
            to make the tribunes re-eligible. I spoke against it. But <lb/>
            ^ I will leave the personal question. I prefer speaking of <lb/>
            Scipio. Good heavens! how impressive his speech was, <lb/>
            what a majesty there was in it! You would. have pro­ <lb/>
            nounced him, without hesitation, to be no mere henchman <lb/>
            of the Roman people, but their leader. However, you were <lb/>
            there, and moreover have the speech in your hands. The <lb/>
            result was that a law meant to please the people was by <lb/>
            the people's votes rejected. Once more to refer to myself, <lb/>
            you remember how apparently popular was the law pro­ <lb/>
            posed by Gaius Licinius Crassus "about the election to the <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            College of Priests" in the consulship of Quintus Maximus, <lb/>
            Scipio's brother, and Lucius Mancinus. For the power of <lb/>
            filling up their own vacancies on the part of the colleges <lb/>
            was by this proposal to be transferred to the people. It was <lb/>
            this man, by the way, who began the practice of turning <lb/>
            towards the forum when addressing the people. In spite <lb/>
            of this, however, upon my speaking on the conservative <lb/>
            side, religion gained an easy victory over his plausible <lb/>
            speech. This took place in my praetorship, five years before <lb/>
            I was elected consul, which shows that the cause was suc­ <lb/>
            cessfully maintained more by the merits of the case than <lb/>
            by the prestige of the highest office.</p>
          <p>26. Now, if on a stage, such as a public assembly essen­ <lb/>
            tially is, where there is the amplest room for fiction and <lb/>
            half-truths, truth nevertheless prevails if it be but fairly <lb/>
            laid open and brought into the light of day, what ought <lb/>
            to happen in the case of friendship, which rests entirely <lb/>
            on truthfulness? Friendship, in which, unless you both see <lb/>
            and show an open breast, to use a common expression, you <lb/>
            can neither trust nor be certain of anything-no, not even <lb/>
            of mutual affection, since you cannot be sure of its sin­ <lb/>
            cerity. However, this flattery, injurious as it is, can hurt <lb/>
            no one but the man who takes it in and likes it. And it fol­ <lb/>
            lows that the man to open his ears widest to flatterers is <lb/>
            he who first flatters himself and is fondest of himself. I <lb/>
            grant you that Virtue naturally loves herself; for she knows <lb/>
            herself and perceives how worthy of love she is. But I am <lb/>
            not now speaking of absolute virtue, but of the belief men <lb/>
            have that they possess virtue. The fact is that fewer peo­ <lb/>
            ple are endowed with virtue than wish to be thought to be <lb/>
            so. It is such people that take delight in flattery. When <lb/>
            they are addressed in language expressly adapted to flatter <lb/>
            their vanity, they look upon such empty persiflage as a tes­ <lb/>
            timony to the truth of their own praises. It is not then <lb/>
            properly friendship at all when the one will not listen to <lb/>
            the truth, and the other is prepared to lie. Nor would the <lb/>
            servility of parasites in comedy have seemed humorous to <lb/>
            us had there been no such things as braggart captains. " Is <lb/>
            Thäis really much obliged to me?" It would have been <lb/>
            quite enough to answer "Much," but he must needs say <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            "Immensely." Your servile flatterer always exaggerates <lb/>
            what his victim wishes to be put strongly. Wherefore, <lb/>
            though it is with those who catch at and invite it that this <lb/>
            flattering falsehood is especially powerful, yet men even of <lb/>
            solider and steadier character must be warned to be on <lb/>
            the watch against being taken in by cunningly disguised <lb/>
            flattery. An open flatterer any one can detect, unless he is <lb/>
            an absolute fool: the covert insinuation of the cunning and <lb/>
            the sly is what we have to be studiously on our guard <lb/>
            against. His detection is not by any means the easiest thing <lb/>
            in the world, for he often covers his servility under the <lb/>
            guise of contradiction, and flatters by pretending to dis­ <lb/>
            pute, and then at last giving in and allowing himself to be <lb/>
            beaten, that the person hoodwinked may think himself to <lb/>
            have been the clearer-sighted. Now what can be more de­ <lb/>
            grading than to be thus hoodwinked? You must be on your <lb/>
            guard against this happening to you, like the man in the <lb/>
            Heiress: <lb/>
            How have I been befooled ! no drivelling dotards <lb/>
            On any stage were e'er so played upon. <lb/>
            For even on the stage we have no grosser representation <lb/>
            of folly than that of short-sighted and credulous old men. <lb/>
            But somehow or other I have strayed away from the <lb/>
            friendship of the perfect, that is of the "wise" (meaning, <lb/>
            of course, such "wisdom" as human nature is capable of), <lb/>
            to the subject of vulgar, unsubstantial friendships. Let <lb/>
            us then return to our original theme, and at length bring <lb/>
            that, too, to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>27. Well, then, Fannius and Mucius, I repeat what I said <lb/>
            before. It is virtue, virtue, which both creates and pre­ <lb/>
            serves friendship. On it depends harmony of interest, per­ <lb/>
            manence, fidelity. When Virtue has reared her head and <lb/>
            shewn the light of her countenance, and seen and recog­ <lb/>
            nised the same light in another, she gravitates towards it, <lb/>
            and in her turn welcomes that which the other has to <lb/>
            shew; and from it springs up a flame which you may call <lb/>
            love or friendship as you please. Both words are from the <lb/>
            same root in Latin; and love is just the cleaving to him <lb/>
            whom you love without the prompting of need or any view <lb/>
            to advantage-though this latter blossoms spontaneously on <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            friendship, little as you may have looked for it. It is with <lb/>
            such warmth of feeling that I cherished Lucius Paulus, <lb/>
            Marcus Cato, Gaius Gallus, Publius Nasica, Tiberius <lb/>
            Gracchus, my dear Scipio's father-in-law. It shines with <lb/>
            even greater warmth when men are of the same age, as in <lb/>
            the case of Scipio and Lucius Furius, Publius Rupilius, <lb/>
            Spurius Mummius, and myself. En revanche, in my old age <lb/>
            I find comfort in the affection of young men, as in the case <lb/>
            of yourselves and Quintus Tubero: nay more, I delight in <lb/>
            the intimacy of such a very young man as Publius Rutilius <lb/>
            and Aulus Verginius. And since the law of our nature and <lb/>
            of our life is that a new generation is for ever springing <lb/>
            up, the most desirable thing is that along with your con­ <lb/>
            temporaries, with whom you started in the race, you may <lb/>
            also reach what is to us the goal. But in view of the in­ <lb/>
            stability and perishableness of mortal things, we should be <lb/>
            continually on the look-out for some to love and by whom <lb/>
            to be loved; for if we lose affection and kindliness from our <lb/>
            life, we lose all that gives it charm. For me, indeed, though <lb/>
            torn away by a sudden stroke, Scipio still lives and ever will <lb/>
            live. For it was the virtue of the man that I loved, and that <lb/>
            has not suffered death. And it is not my eyes only, because <lb/>
            I had all my life a personal experience of it, that never lose <lb/>
            sight of it: it will shine to posterity also with undimmed <lb/>
            glory. No one will ever cherish a nobler ambition or a <lb/>
            loftier hope without thinking his memory and his image <lb/>
            the best to put before his eyes. I declare that of all the <lb/>
            blessings which either fortune or nature has bestowed upon <lb/>
            me I know none to compare with Scipio's friendship. In it <lb/>
            I found sympathy in public, counsel in private business: in <lb/>
            it too a means of spending my leisure with unalloyed <lb/>
            delight. Never, to the best of my knowledge, did I offend <lb/>
            him even in the most trivial point; never did I hear a word <lb/>
            from him I could have wished unsaid. We had one house, <lb/>
            one table, one style of living; and not only were we <lb/>
            together on foreign service, but in our tours also and country <lb/>
            sojourns. Why speak of our eagerness to be ever gaining <lb/>
            some knowledge, to be ever learning something, on which <lb/>
            we spent all our leisure hours far from the gaze of the <lb/>
            world? If the recollection and memory of these things had <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            perished with the man, I could not possibly have endured <lb/>
            the regret for one so closely united with me in life and <lb/>
            affection. But these things have not perished; they are <lb/>
            rather fed and strengthened by reflexion and memory. Even <lb/>
            supposing me to have been entirely bereft of them, still my <lb/>
            time of life of itself brings me no small consolation: for I <lb/>
            cannot have much longer now to bear this regret; and every­ <lb/>
            thing that is brief ought to be endurable, however severe.</p>
          <p>This is all I had to say on friendship. One piece of advice <lb/>
            on parting. Make up your minds to this. Virtue (without <lb/>
            which friendship is impossible) is first; but next to it, and <lb/>
            to it alone, the greatest of all things is Friendship.</p>

            though I am well assured that you are not, as Flamininus <lb/>
            was, <lb/>
            kept on the rack of care by night and day. <lb/>
            For I know how well ordered and equable your mind is, <lb/>
            and am fully aware that it was not a surname alone which <lb/>
            you brought home with you from Athens, but its culture and <lb/>
            good sense. And yet I have an idea that you are at times <lb/>
            stirred to the heart by the same circumstances as myself. <lb/>
            To console you for these is a more serious matter, and must <lb/>
            be put off to another time. For the present I have resolved <lb/>
            to dedicate to you an essay on Old Age. For from the <lb/>
            burden of impending or at least advancing age, common <lb/>
            to us both, I would do something to relieve us both: though <lb/>
            as to yourself I am fully aware that you support and will <lb/>
            support it, as you do everything else, with calmness and <lb/>
            philosophy. But directly I resolved to write on old age, <lb/>
            you at once occurred to me as deserving a gift of which both <lb/>
            of us might take advantage. To myself, indeed, the com­ <lb/>
            position of this book has been so delightful, that it has not <lb/>
            only wiped away all the disagreeables of old age, but has <lb/>
            even made it luxurious and delightful too. Never, there­ <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            fore, can philosophy be praised as highly as it deserves, <lb/>
            considering that its faithful disciple is able to spend every <lb/>
            period of his life with unruffled feelings. However, on other <lb/>
            subjects I have spoken at large, and shall often speak again: <lb/>
            this book which I herewith send you is on Old Age. I <lb/>
            have put the whole discourse not, as Alisto of Cos did, <lb/>
            in the mouth of Tithonus—for a mere fable would have <lb/>
            lacked conviction-but in that of Marcus Cato when he <lb/>
            was an old man, to give my essay greater weight. I repre­ <lb/>
            sent Laelius and Scipio at his house expressing surprise <lb/>
            at his carrying his years so lightly, and Cato answering <lb/>
            them. If he shall seem to shew somewhat more learning <lb/>
            in this discourse than he generally did in his own books, <lb/>
            put it down to the Greek literature of which it is known that <lb/>
            he became an eager student in his old age. But what need <lb/>
            of more? Cato's own words will at once explain all I feel <lb/>
            about old age.</p>
          <p>M. CATO. PUBLIUS CORNELIUS SCIPIO AFRICANUS (the <lb/>
            younger). GAIUS LAELIUS.</p>
          <p>2. Scipio. Many a time have I in conversation with my <lb/>
            friend Gaius Laelius here expressed my admiration, Marcus <lb/>
            Cato, of the eminent, nay perfect, wisdom displayed by you <lb/>
            indeed at all points, but above everything because I have <lb/>
            noticed that old age never seemed a burden to you, while <lb/>
            to most old men it is so hateful that they declare themselves <lb/>
            under a weight heavier than Aetna.</p>
          <p>Cato. Your admiration is easily excited, it seems, my <lb/>
            dear Scipio and Laelius. Men, of course, who have no <lb/>
            resources in themselves for securing a good and happy life <lb/>
            find every age burdensome. But those who look for all <lb/>
            happiness from within can never think anything bad which <lb/>
            nature makes inevitable. In that category before anything <lb/>
            else comes old age, to which all wish to attain, and at which <lb/>
            all grumble when attained. Such is Folly's inconsistency <lb/>
            and unreasonableness! They say that it is stealing upon <lb/>
            them faster than they expected. In the first place, who com­ <lb/>
            pelled them to hug an illusion? For in what respect did old <lb/>
            age steal upon manhood faster than manhood upon child. <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            hood? In the next place, in what way would old age have <lb/>
            been less disagreeable to them if they were in their eight- <lb/>
            hundredth year than in their eightieth? For their past, <lb/>
            however long, when once it was past, would have no con­ <lb/>
            solation for a stupid old age. Wherefore, if it is your wont <lb/>
            to admire my wisdom-and I would that it were worthy of <lb/>
            your good opinion and of my own surname of Sapiens-it <lb/>
            really consists in the fact that I follow Nature, the best of <lb/>
            guides, as I would a god, and am loyal to her commands. <lb/>
            It is not likely, if she has written the rest of the play well, <lb/>
            that she has been careless about the last act like some idle <lb/>
            poet. But after all some "last" was inevitable, just as to <lb/>
            the berries of a tree and the fruits of the earth there comes <lb/>
            in the fulness of time a period of decay and fall. A wise <lb/>
            man will not make a grievance of this. To rebel against <lb/>
            nature-is not that to fight like the giants with the gods?</p>
          <p>Laelius. And yet, Cato, you will do us a very great favour <lb/>
            (I venture to speak for Scipio as for myself) if-since we <lb/>
            all hope, or at least wish, to become old men-you would <lb/>
            allow us to learn from you in good time before it arrives, <lb/>
            by what methods we may most easily acquire the strength <lb/>
            to support the burden of advancing age.</p>
          <p>Cato. I will do so without doubt, Laelius, especially if, as <lb/>
            you say, it will be agreeable to you both.</p>
          <p>Laelius. We do wish very much, Cato, if it is no trouble <lb/>
            to you, to be allowed to see the nature of the bourne which <lb/>
            you have reached after completing a long journey, as it were, <lb/>
            upon which we too are bound to embark.</p>
          <p>3. Cato. I will do the best I can, Laelius. It has often <lb/>
            been my fortune to hear the complaints of my contempo­ <lb/>
            raries-like will to like, you know, according to the old <lb/>
            proverb-complaints to which men like C. Salinator and Sp. <lb/>
            Albinus, who were of consular rank and about my time, <lb/>
            used to give vent. They were, first, that they had lost the <lb/>
            pleasures of the senses, without which they did not regard <lb/>
            life as life at all; and, secondly, that they were neglected <lb/>
            by those from whom they had been used to receive attentions. <lb/>
            Such men appear to me to lay the blame on the wrong <lb/>
            thing. For if it had been the fault of old age, then these <lb/>
            same misfortunes would have befallen me and all other <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            men of advanced years. But I have known many of them <lb/>
            who never said a word of complaint against old age; for <lb/>
            they were only too glad to be freed from the bondage of pas­ <lb/>
            sion, and were not at all looked down upon by their friends. <lb/>
            The fact is that the blame for all complaints of that kind <lb/>
            is to be charged to character, not to a particular time of life. <lb/>
            For old men who are reasonable and neither cross-grained <lb/>
            nor churlish find old age tolerable enough: whereas unreason <lb/>
            and churlishness cause uneasiness at every time of life.</p>
          <p>Laelius. It is as you say, Cato. But perhaps some one <lb/>
            may suggest that it is your large means, wealth, and high <lb/>
            position that make you think old age tolerable: whereas <lb/>
            such good fortune only falls to few.</p>
          <p>Cato. There is something in that, Laelius, but by no <lb/>
            means all. For instance, the story is told of the answer <lb/>
            of Themistocles in a wrangle with a certain Seriphian, who <lb/>
            asserted that he owed his brilliant position to the reputation <lb/>
            of his country, not to his own. " If I had been a Seri­ <lb/>
            phian," said he, " even I should never have been famous, <lb/>
            nor would you if you had been an Athenian. Something <lb/>
            like this may be said of old age. For the philosopher him­ <lb/>
            self could not find old age easy to bear in the depths of <lb/>
            poverty, nor the fool feel it anything but a burden though <lb/>
            he were a millionaire. You may be sure, my dear Scipio <lb/>
            and Laelius, that the arms best adapted to old age are cul­ <lb/>
            ture and the active exercise of the virtues. For if they <lb/>
            have been maintained at every period-if one has lived much <lb/>
            as well as long-the harvest they produce is wonderful, not <lb/>
            only because they never fail us even in our last days <lb/>
            (though that in itself is supremely important), but also <lb/>
            because the consciousness of a well-spent life and the recol­ <lb/>
            lection of many virtuous actions are exceedingly delightful.</p>
          <p>4. Take the case of Q. Fabius Maximus, the man, I mean, <lb/>
            who recovered Tarentum. When I was a young man and <lb/>
            he an old one, I was as much attached to him as if he <lb/>
            had been my contemporary. For that great man's serious <lb/>
            dignity was tempered by courteous manners, nor had old <lb/>
            age made any change in his character. True, he was not <lb/>
            exactly an old man when my devotion to him began, yet <lb/>
            he was nevertheless well on in life; for his first consulship <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            fell in the year after my birth. When quite a stripling I <lb/>
            went with him in his fourth consulship as a soldier in the <lb/>
            ranks, on the expedition against Capua, and in the fifth <lb/>
            year after that against Tarentum. Four years after that <lb/>
            I was elected Quaestor, holding office in the consulship of <lb/>
            Tuditanus and Cethegus, in which year, indeed, he as a <lb/>
            very old man spoke in favour of the Cincian law " on gifts <lb/>
            and fees."</p>
          <p>Now this man conducted wars with all the spirit of youth <lb/>
            when he was far advanced in life, and by his persistence <lb/>
            gradually wearied out Hannibal, when rioting in all the <lb/>
            confidence of youth. How brilliant are those lines of my <lb/>
            friend Ennius on him! <lb/>
            For us, down beaten by the storms of fate, <lb/>
            One man by wise delays restored the State. <lb/>
            Praise or dispraise moved not his constant mood, <lb/>
            True to his purpose, to his country's good! <lb/>
            Down ever-lengthening avenues of fame <lb/>
            Thus shines and shall shine still his glorious name. <lb/>
            Again what vigilance, what profound skill did he show in <lb/>
            the capture of Tarentum! It was indeed in my hearing <lb/>
            that he made the famous retort to Salinator, who had re­ <lb/>
            treated into the citadel after losing the town: " It was <lb/>
            owing to me, Quintus Fabius, that you retook Tarentum." <lb/>
            " Quite so," he replied with a laugh; " for had you not lost <lb/>
            it, I should never have recovered it." Nor was he less emi­ <lb/>
            nent in civil life than in war. In his second consulship, <lb/>
            though his colleague would not move in the matter, he <lb/>
            resisted as long as he could the proposal of the tribune C. <lb/>
            Flaminius to divide the territory of the Picenians and <lb/>
            Gauls in free allotments in defiance of a resolution of the <lb/>
            Senate. Again, though he was an augur, he ventured to <lb/>
            say that whatever was done in the interests of the State <lb/>
            was done with the best possible auspices, that any laws pro­ <lb/>
            posed against its interest were proposed against the auspices. <lb/>
            I was cognisant of much that was admirable in that great <lb/>
            man, but nothing struck me with greater astonishment than <lb/>
            the way in which he bore the death of his son—a man <lb/>
            of brilliant character and who had been consul. His funeral <lb/>
            speech over him is in wide circulation, and when we read <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            it, is there any philosopher of whom we do not think meanly? <lb/>
            Nor in truth was he only great in the light of day and in <lb/>
            the sight of his fellow-citizens; he was still more eminent in <lb/>
            private and at home. What a wealth of conversation! <lb/>
            What weighty maxims! What a wide acquaintance with <lb/>
            ancient history! What an accurate knowledge of the science <lb/>
            of augury! For a Roman, too, he had a great tincture of <lb/>
            letters. He had a tenacious memory for military history <lb/>
            of every sort, whether of Roman or foreign wars. And I <lb/>
            used at that time to enjoy his conversation with a passionate <lb/>
            eagerness, as though I already divined, what actually turned <lb/>
            out to be the case, that when he died there would be no <lb/>
            one to teach me anything.</p>
          <p>5. What then is the purpose of such a long disquisition <lb/>
            on Maximus? It is because you now see that an old age <lb/>
            like his cannot conscientiously be called unhappy. Yet it is <lb/>
            after all true that everybody cannot be a Scipio or a Maxi­ <lb/>
            mus, with stormings of cities, with battles by land and <lb/>
            sea, with wars in which they themselves commanded, and <lb/>
            with triumphs to recall. Besides this there is a quiet, pure, <lb/>
            and cultivated life which produces a calm and gentle old <lb/>
            age, such as we have been told Plato's was, who died at his <lb/>
            writing-desk in his eighty-first year; or like that of Isoc­ <lb/>
            rates, who says that he wrote the book called The Panegyric <lb/>
            in his ninety-fourth year, and who lived for five years after­ <lb/>
            wards; while his master Gorgias of Leontini completed a <lb/>
            hundred and seven years without ever relaxing his diligence <lb/>
            or giving up work. When some one asked him why he <lb/>
            consented to remain so long alive— “ I have no fault," said <lb/>
            he, " to find with old age." That was a noble answer, and <lb/>
            worthy of a scholar. For fools impute their own frailties <lb/>
            and guilt to old age, contrary to the practice of Ennius. <lb/>
            whom I mentioned just now. In the lines- <lb/>
            Like some brave steed that oft before <lb/>
            The Olympic wreath of victory bore, <lb/>
            Now by the weight of years oppressed, <lb/>
            Forgets the race, and takes his rest­ <lb/>
            he compares his own old age to that of a high-spirited <lb/>
            and successful race-horse. And him indeed you may very <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            well remember. For the present consuls Titus Flamininus <lb/>
            and Manius Acilius were elected in the nineteenth year after <lb/>
            his death; and his death occurred in the consulship of Caepio <lb/>
            and Philippus, the latter consul for the second time: in <lb/>
            which year I, then sixty-six years old, spoke in favour of <lb/>
            the Voconian law in a voice that was still strong and with <lb/>
            ungs still sound; while he, though seventy years old, sup­ <lb/>
            ported two burdens considered the heaviest of all-poverty <lb/>
            and old age-in such a way as to be all but fond of them.</p>
          <p>The fact is that when I come to think it over, I find that <lb/>
            there are four reasons for old age being thought unhappy: <lb/>
            First, that it withdraws us from active employments; second, <lb/>
            that it enfeebles the body; third, that it deprives us of nearly <lb/>
            all physical pleasures; fourth, that it is the next step to <lb/>
            death. Of each of these reasons, if you will allow me, let <lb/>
            us examine the force and justice separately.</p>
          <p>6. OLD AGE WITHDRAWS US FROM ACTIVE EMPLOYMENTS. <lb/>
            From which of them? Do you mean from those carried <lb/>
            on by youth and bodily strength? Are there then no old <lb/>
            men's employments to be after all conducted by the intellect, <lb/>
            even when bodies are weak? So then Q. Maximus did <lb/>
            nothing; nor L. Aemilius-your father, Scipio, and my ex­ <lb/>
            cellent son's father-in-law! So with other old men-the <lb/>
            Fabricii, the Curii and Coruncanii-when they were sup­ <lb/>
            porting the State by their advice and influence, they were <lb/>
            doing nothing! To old age Appius Claudius had the addi­ <lb/>
            tional disadvantage of being blind; yet it was he who, when <lb/>
            the Senate was inclining towards a peace with Pyrrhus <lb/>
            and was for making a treaty, did not hesitate to say what <lb/>
            Ennius has embalmed in the verses: <lb/>
            Whither have swerved the souls so firm of yore? <lb/>
            Is sense grown senseless? Can feet stand no more? <lb/>
            And so on in a tone of the most passionate vehemence. You <lb/>
            know the poem, and the speech of Appius himself is extant. <lb/>
            Now, he delivered it seventeen years after his second con­ <lb/>
            sulship, there having been an interval of ten years between <lb/>
            the two consulships, and he having been censor before his <lb/>
            previous consulship. This will show you that at the time <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            of the war with Pyrrhus he was a very old man. Yet this <lb/>
            is the story handed down to us.</p>
          <p>There is therefore nothing in the arguments of those who <lb/>
            say that old age takes no part in public business. They are <lb/>
            like men who would say that a steersman does nothing in. <lb/>
            sailing a ship, because, while some of the crew are climbing <lb/>
            the masts, others hurrying up and down the gangways, <lb/>
            others pumping out the bilge water, he sits quietly in the <lb/>
            stern holding the tiller. He does not do what young men <lb/>
            do; nevertheless he does what is much more important and <lb/>
            better. The great affairs of life are not performed by <lb/>
            physical strength, or activity, or nimbleness of body, but by <lb/>
            deliberation, character, expression of opinion. Of these old <lb/>
            age is not only not deprived, but, as a rule, has them in <lb/>
            a greater degree. Unless by any chance I, who as a soldier <lb/>
            in the ranks, as military tribune, as legate, and as consul <lb/>
            have been employed in various kinds of war, now appear to <lb/>
            you to be idle because not actively engaged in war. But I <lb/>
            enjoin upon the Senate what is to be done, and how. Car­ <lb/>
            thage has long been harbouring evil designs, and I accord­ <lb/>
            ingly proclaim war against her in good time. I shall never <lb/>
            cease to entertain fears about her till I hear of her having <lb/>
            been levelled with the ground. The glory of doing that I <lb/>
            pray that the immortal gods may reserve for you, Scipio, <lb/>
            so that you may complete the task begun by your grand­ <lb/>
            father, now dead more than thirty-two years ago; though all <lb/>
            years to come will keep that great man's memory green. <lb/>
            He died in the year before my censorship, nine years after <lb/>
            my consulship, having been returned consul for the second <lb/>
            time in my own consulship. If then he had lived to his <lb/>
            hundredth year, would he have regretted having lived to <lb/>
            be old? For he would of course not have been practising <lb/>
            rapid marches, nor dashing on a foe, nor hurling spears <lb/>
            from a distance, nor using swords at close quarters-but only <lb/>
            counsel, reason, and senatorial eloquence. And if those qual­ <lb/>
            ities had not resided in us seniors, our ancestors would <lb/>
            never have called their supreme council a Senate. At <lb/>
            Sparta, indeed, those who hold the highest magistracies are <lb/>
            in accordance with the fact actually called " elders." But <lb/>
            if you will take the trouble to read or listen to foreign <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            history, you will find that the mightiest States have been <lb/>
            brought into peril by young men, have been supported and <lb/>
            restored by old. The question occurs in the poet Naevius's <lb/>
            Sport: <lb/>
            Pray, who are those who brought your State <lb/>
            With such despatch to meet its fate ? <lb/>
            There is a long answer, but this is the chief point: <lb/>
            A crop of brand-new orators we grew, <lb/>
            And foolish, paltry lads who thought they knew. <lb/>
            For of course rashness is the note of youth, prudence of <lb/>
            old age.</p>
          <p>7. But, it is said, memory dwindles. No doubt, unless you <lb/>
            keep it in practice, or if you happen to be somewhat dull by <lb/>
            nature. Themistocles had the names of all his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens by heart. Do you imagine that in his old age he <lb/>
            used to address Aristides as Lysimachus? For my part, I <lb/>
            know not only the present generation, but their fathers also, <lb/>
            and their grandfathers. Nor have I any fear of losing my <lb/>
            memory by reading tombstones, according to the vulgar <lb/>
            superstition. On the contrary, by reading them I renew <lb/>
            my memory of those who are dead and gone. Nor, in point <lb/>
            of fact, have I ever heard of any old man forgetting where <lb/>
            he had hidden his money. They remember everything that <lb/>
            interests them: when to answer to their bail, business ap­ <lb/>
            pointments, who owes them money, and to whom they owe <lb/>
            it. What about lawyers, pontiffs, augurs, philosophers, <lb/>
            when old? What a multitude of things they remember! <lb/>
            Old men retain their intellects well enough, if only they <lb/>
            keep their minds active and fully employed. Nor is that <lb/>
            the case only with men of high position and great office: <lb/>
            it applies equally to private life and peaceful pursuits. <lb/>
            Sophocles composed tragedies to extreme old age; and being <lb/>
            believed to neglect the care of his property owing to his <lb/>
            devotion to his art, his sons brought him into court to get <lb/>
            a judicial decision depriving, him of the management of <lb/>
            his property on the ground of weak intellect-just as in <lb/>
            our law it is customary to deprive a paterfamilias of the <lb/>
            management of his property if he is squandering it. There­ <lb/>
            upon the old poet is said to have read to the judges the <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            play he had on hand and had just composed-the Oedipus <lb/>
            Coloneus—and to have asked them whether they thought <lb/>
            that the work of a man of weak intellect. After the read­ <lb/>
            ing he was acquitted by the jury. Did old age then com­ <lb/>
            pel this man to become silent in his particular art, or <lb/>
            Homer, Hesiod, Simonides, or Isocrates and Gorgias <lb/>
            whom I mentioned before, or the founders of schools of <lb/>
            philosophy, Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato, Xenocrates, or <lb/>
            later Zeno and Cleanthus, or Diogenes the Stoic, whom <lb/>
            you too saw at Rome? Is it not rather the case with all <lb/>
            these that the active pursuit of study only ended with life?</p>
          <p>But, to pass over these sublime studies, I can name some <lb/>
            rustic Romans from the Sabine district, neighbours and <lb/>
            friends of my own, without whose presence farm work of <lb/>
            importance is scarcely ever performed-whether sowing, or <lb/>
            harvesting or storing crops. And yet in other things this <lb/>
            is less surprising; for no one is so old as to think that he <lb/>
            may not live a year. But they bestow their labour on what <lb/>
            they know does not affect them in any case: <lb/>
            He plants his trees to serve a race to come, <lb/>
            as our poet Statius says in his Comrades. Nor indeed <lb/>
            would a farmer, however old, hesitate to answer any one <lb/>
            who asked him for whom he was planting: "For the im­ <lb/>
            mortal gods, whose will it was that I should not merely <lb/>
            receive these things from my ancestors, but should also hand <lb/>
            them on to the next generation."</p>
          <p>8. That remark about the old man is better than the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing : <lb/>
            If age brought nothing worse than this, <lb/>
            It were enough to mar our bliss, <lb/>
            That he who bides for many years <lb/>
            Sees much to shun and much for tears. <lb/>
            Yes, and perhaps much that gives him pleasure too. Be­ <lb/>
            sides, as to subjects for tears, he often comes upon them <lb/>
            in youth as well.</p>
          <p>A still more questionable sentiment in the same Caecilius <lb/>
            is: <lb/>
            No greater misery can of age be told <lb/>
            Than this: be sure, the young dislike the old.</p><pb n="55"/>
            
          <p>Delight in them is nearer the mark than dislike. For <lb/>
            just as old men, if they are wise, take pleasure in the <lb/>
            society of young men of good parts, and as old age is ren­ <lb/>
            dered less dreary for those who are courted and liked by the <lb/>
            youth, so also do young men find pleasure in the maxims <lb/>
            of the old, by which they are drawn to the pursuit of ex­ <lb/>
            cellence. Nor do I perceive that you find my society less <lb/>
            pleasant than I do yours. But this is enough to show you <lb/>
            how, so far from being listless and sluggish, old age is <lb/>
            even a busy time, always doing and attempting something, <lb/>
            of course of the same nature as each man's taste had been <lb/>
            in the previous part of his life. Nay, do not some even add <lb/>
            to their stock of learning? We see Solon, for instance, <lb/>
            boasting in his poems that he grows old "daily learning <lb/>
            something new." Or again in my own case, it was only <lb/>
            when an old man that I became acquainted with Greek <lb/>
            literature, which in fact I absorbed with such avidity-in <lb/>
            my yearning to quench, as it were, a long-continued thirst <lb/>
            -that I became acquainted with the very facts which you <lb/>
            see me now using as precedents. When I heard what <lb/>
            Socrates had done about the lyre I should have liked for <lb/>
            my part to have done that too, for the ancients used to <lb/>
            learn the lyre but, at any rate, I worked hard at literature.</p>
          <p>9. Nor, again, do I now MISS THE BODILY STRENGTH OF <lb/>
            A YOUNG MAN (for that was the second point as to the dis­ <lb/>
            advantages of old age) any more than as a young man I <lb/>
            missed the strength of a bull or an elephant. You should <lb/>
            use what you have, and whatever you may chance to be <lb/>
            doing, do it with all your might. What could be weaker <lb/>
            than Milo of Croton's exclamation? When in his old age he <lb/>
            was watching some athletes practising in the course, he is <lb/>
            said to have looked at his arms and to have exclaimed with <lb/>
            tears in his eyes: "Ah well! these are now as good as dead." <lb/>
            Not a bit more so than yourself, you trifler! For at no <lb/>
            time were you made famous by your real self, but by chest <lb/>
            and biceps. Sext. Aelius never gave vent to such a re­ <lb/>
            mark, nor, many years before him, Titus Coruncanius, nor, <lb/>
            more recently, P. Crassus—all of them learned juris-consults <lb/>
            in active practice, whose knowledge of their profession was <lb/>
            maintained to their last breath. I am afraid an orator does <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            lose vigour by old age, for his art is not a matter of the <lb/>
            intellect alone, but of lungs and bodily strength. Though <lb/>
            as a rule that musical ring in the voice even gains in bril­ <lb/>
            liance in a certain way as one grows old-certainly I have <lb/>
            not yet lost it, and you see my years. Yet after all the <lb/>
            style of speech suitable to an old man is the quiet and <lb/>
            unemotional, and it often happens that the chastened and <lb/>
            calm delivery of an old man eloquent secures a hearing. If <lb/>
            you cannot attain to that yourself, you might still instruct <lb/>
            a Scipio and a Laelius. For what is more charming than <lb/>
            old age surrounded by the enthusiasm of youth? Shall we <lb/>
            not allow old age even the strength to teach the young, to <lb/>
            train and equip them for all the duties of life? And what <lb/>
            can be a nobler employment? For my part, I used to think <lb/>
            Publius and Gnaeus Scipio and your two grandfathers, L. <lb/>
            Aemilius and P. Africanus, fortunate men when I saw them <lb/>
            with a company of young nobles about them. Nor should <lb/>
            we think any teachers of the fine arts otherwise than happy, <lb/>
            however much their bodily forces may have decayed and <lb/>
            failed. And yet that same failure of the bodily forces is <lb/>
            more often brought about by the vices of youth than of old <lb/>
            age; for a dissolute and intemperate youth hands down the <lb/>
            body to old age in a worn-out state. Xenophon's Cyrus, for <lb/>
            instance, in his discourse delivered on his death-bed and at <lb/>
            a very advanced age, says that he never perceived his old <lb/>
            age to have become weaker than his youth had been. I <lb/>
            remember as a boy Lucius Metellus, who having been cre­ <lb/>
            ated Pontifex Maximus four years after his second consul­ <lb/>
            ship, held that office twenty-two years, enjoying such ex­ <lb/>
            cellent strength of body in the very last hours of his life <lb/>
            as not to miss his youth. I need not speak of myself; <lb/>
            though that indeed is an old man's way and is generally <lb/>
            allowed to my time of life. Don't you see in Homer how <lb/>
            frequently Nestor talks of his own good qualities ? For he was <lb/>
            living through a third generation; nor had he any reason <lb/>
            to fear that upon saying what was true about himself he <lb/>
            should appear either over vain or talkative. For, as Homer <lb/>
            says, " from his lips flowed discourse sweeter than honey," <lb/>
            for which sweet breath he wanted no bodily strength. <lb/>
            And yet, after all, the famous leader of the Greeks nowhere <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            wishes to have ten men like Ajax, but like Nestor: if he <lb/>
            could get them, he feels no doubt of Troy shortly falling.</p>
          <p>10. But to return to my own case: I am in my eighty- <lb/>
            fourth year. I could wish that I had been able to make the <lb/>
            same boast as Cyrus; but, after all, I can say this: I am not <lb/>
            indeed as vigorous as I was as a private soldier in the <lb/>
            Punic war, or as quaestor in the same war, or as consul in <lb/>
            Spain, and four years later when as a military tribune I <lb/>
            took part in the engagement at Thermopylae under the con­ <lb/>
            sul Manius Acilius Glabrio; but yet, as you see, old age has <lb/>
            not entirely destroyed my muscles, has not quite brought me <lb/>
            to the ground. The Senate-house does not find all my vigour <lb/>
            gone, nor the rostra, nor my friends, nor my clients, nor <lb/>
            my foreign guests. For I have never given in to that ancient <lb/>
            and much-praised proverb: <lb/>
            Old when young <lb/>
            Is old for long.</p>
          <p>For myself, I had rather be an old man a somewhat shorter <lb/>
            time than an old man before my time. Accordingly, no one <lb/>
            up to the present has wished to see me, to whom I have been <lb/>
            denied as engaged. But, it may be said, I have less strength <lb/>
            than either of you. Neither have you the strength of the <lb/>
            centurion T. Pontius: is he the more eminent man on that <lb/>
            account? Let there be only a proper husbanding of <lb/>
            strength, and let each man proportion his efforts to his <lb/>
            powers. Such an one will assuredly not be possessed with <lb/>
            any great regret for his loss of strength. At Olympia Milo <lb/>
            is said to have stepped into the course carrying a live ox <lb/>
            on his shoulders. Which then of the two would you prefer <lb/>
            to have given to you-bodily strength like that, or intel­ <lb/>
            lectual strength like that of Pythagoras? In fine, enjoy that <lb/>
            blessing when you have it; when it is gone, don't wish it <lb/>
            back-unless we are to think that young men should wish <lb/>
            their childhood back, and those somewhat older their youth! <lb/>
            The course of life is fixed, and nature admits of its being <lb/>
            run but in one way, and only once; and to each part of <lb/>
            our life there is something specially seasonable; so that <lb/>
            the feebleness of children, as well as the high spirit of youth, <lb/>
            the soberness of maturer years, and the ripe wisdom of old <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            age—all have a certain natural advantage which should be <lb/>
            secured in its proper season. I think you are informed, <lb/>
            Scipio, what your grandfather's foreign friend Masinissa does <lb/>
            to this day, though ninety years old. When he has once <lb/>
            begun a journey on foot he does not mount his horse at <lb/>
            all; when on horseback he never gets off his horse. By no <lb/>
            rain or cold can he be induced to cover his head. His body <lb/>
            is absolutely free from unhealthy humours, and so he still <lb/>
            performs all the duties and functions of a king. Active <lb/>
            exercise, therefore, and temperance can preserve some part <lb/>
            of one's former strength even in old age.</p>
          <p>II. Bodily strength is wanting to old age; but neither is <lb/>
            bodily strength demanded from old men. Therefore, both <lb/>
            by law and custom, men of my time of life are exempt from <lb/>
            those duties which cannot be supported without bodily <lb/>
            strength. Accordingly not only are we not forced to do what <lb/>
            we cannot do; we are not even obliged to do as much as we <lb/>
            can. But, it will be said, many old men are so feeble that <lb/>
            they cannot perform any duty in life of any sort or kind. <lb/>
            That is not a weakness to be set down as peculiar to old age: <lb/>
            it is one shared by ill health. How feeble was the son of <lb/>
            P. Africanus, who adopted you! What weak health he had, <lb/>
            or rather no health at all I If that had not been the case, <lb/>
            we should have had in him a second brilliant light in the <lb/>
            political horizon; for he had added a wider cultivation to his <lb/>
            father's greatness of spirit. What wonder, then, that old <lb/>
            men are eventually feeble, when even young men cannot <lb/>
            escape it? My dear Laelius and Scipio, we must stand up <lb/>
            against old age and make up for its drawbacks by taking <lb/>
            pains. We must fight it as we should an illness. We must <lb/>
            look after our health, use moderate exercise, take just <lb/>
            enough food and drink to recruit, but not to overload, our <lb/>
            strength. Nor is it the body alone that must be supported, <lb/>
            but the intellect and soul much more. For they are like <lb/>
            lamps: unless you feed them with oil, they too go out from <lb/>
            old age. Again, the body is apt to get gross from exercise; <lb/>
            but the intellect becomes nimbler by exercising itself. <lb/>
            For what Caecilius means by "old dotards of the comic <lb/>
            stage" are the credulous, the forgetful, and the slipshod. <lb/>
            These are faults that do not attach to old age as such, but to <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            a sluggish, spiritless, and sleepy old age. Young men are <lb/>
            more frequently wanton and dissolute than old men; but yet, <lb/>
            as it is not all young men that are so, but the bad set among <lb/>
            them, even so senile folly-usually called imbecility-applies <lb/>
            to old men of unsound character, not to all. Appius gov­ <lb/>
            erned four sturdy sons, five daughters, that great estab­ <lb/>
            lishment, and all those clients, though he was both old and <lb/>
            blind. For he kept his mind at full stretch like a bow, and <lb/>
            never gave in to old age by growing slack. He maintained <lb/>
            not merely an influence, but an absolute command over his <lb/>
            family: his slaves feared him, his sons were in awe of him, <lb/>
            all loved him. In that family, indeed, ancestral custom and <lb/>
            discipline were in full vigour. The fact is that old age is <lb/>
            respectable just as long as it asserts itself, maintains its <lb/>
            proper rights, and is not enslaved to any one. For as I <lb/>
            admire a young man who has something of the old man in <lb/>
            him, so do I an old one who has something of a young man. <lb/>
            The man who aims at this may possibly become old in body­ <lb/>
            in mind he never will. I am now engaged in composing the <lb/>
            seventh book of my Origins. I collect all the records of <lb/>
            antiquity. The speeches delivered in all the celebrated cases <lb/>
            which I have defended I am at this particular time getting <lb/>
            into shape for publication. I am writing treatises on aug­ <lb/>
            ural, pontifical, and civil law. I am, besides, studying hard <lb/>
            at Greek, and after the manner of the Pythagoreans-to <lb/>
            keep my memory in working order—I repeat in the evening <lb/>
            whatever I have said, heard, or done in the course of each <lb/>
            day. These are the exercises of the intellect, these the <lb/>
            training grounds of the mind: while I sweat and labour on <lb/>
            these I don't much feel the loss of bodily strength. I appear <lb/>
            in court for my friends; I frequently attend the Senate <lb/>
            and bring motions before it on my own responsibility, pre­ <lb/>
            pared after deep and long reflection. And these I support <lb/>
            by my intellectual, not my bodily forces. And if I were not <lb/>
            strong enough to do these things, yet I should enjoy my <lb/>
            sofa-imagining the very operations which I was now un­ <lb/>
            able to perform. But what makes me capable of doing this <lb/>
            is my past life. For a man who is always living in the midst <lb/>
            of these studies and labours does not perceive when old age <lb/>
            creeps upon him. Thus, by slow and imperceptible degrees <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            life draws to its end. There is no sudden breakage; it <lb/>
            just slowly goes out.</p>
          <p>12. The third charge against old age is that it LACKS SEN­ <lb/>
            SUAL PLEASURES. What a splendid service does old age <lb/>
            render, if it takes from us the greatest blot of youth! Listen, <lb/>
            my dear young friends, to a speech of Archytas of Taren­ <lb/>
            turn, among the greatest and most illustrious of men, which <lb/>
            was put into my hands when as a young man I was at <lb/>
            Tarentum with Q. Maximus. " No more deadly curse than <lb/>
            sensual pleasure has been inflicted on mankind by nature, <lb/>
            to gratify which our wanton appetites are roused beyond all <lb/>
            prudence or restraint. It is a fruitful source of treasons, <lb/>
            revolutions, secret communications with: the enemy. In <lb/>
            fact, there is no crime, no evil deed, to which the appetite <lb/>
            for sensual pleasures does not impel us. Fornications and <lb/>
            adulteries, and every abomination of that kind, are brought <lb/>
            about by the enticements of pleasure and by them alone. <lb/>
            Intellect is the best gift of nature or God: to this divine <lb/>
            gift and endowment there is nothing so inimical as pleasure. <lb/>
            For when appetite is our master, there is no place for self- <lb/>
            control; nor where pleasure reigns supreme can virtue hold <lb/>
            its ground. To see this more vividly, imagine a man excited <lb/>
            to the highest conceivable pitch of sensual pleasure. It can <lb/>
            be doubtful to no one that such a person, so long as he is <lb/>
            under the influence of such excitation of the senses, will be <lb/>
            unable to use to any purpose either intellect, reason, or <lb/>
            thought. Therefore nothing can be so execrable and so <lb/>
            fatal as pleasure; since, when more than ordinarily violent <lb/>
            and lasting, it darkens all the light of the soul."</p>
          <p>These were the words addressed by Archytas to the Sam­ <lb/>
            nite Caius Pontius, father of the man by whom the consuls <lb/>
            Spurius Postumius and Titus Veturius were beaten in the <lb/>
            battle of Caudium. My friend Nearchus of Tarentum, who <lb/>
            had remained loyal to Rome, told me that he had heard them <lb/>
            repeated by some old men; and that Plato the Athenian was <lb/>
            present, who visited Tarentum, I find, in the consulship of L. <lb/>
            Camillus and Appius Claudius.</p>
          <p>What is the point of all this? It is to show you that, if <lb/>
            we were unable to scorn pleasure by the aid of reason and <lb/>
            philosophy, we ought to have been very grateful to old age <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            for depriving us of all inclination for that which it was <lb/>
            wrong to do. For pleasure hinders thought, is a foe to <lb/>
            reason, and, so to speak, blinds the eyes of the mind. It is, <lb/>
            moreover, entirely alien to virtue. I was sorry to have to <lb/>
            expel Lucius, brother of the gallant Titus Flamininus, from <lb/>
            the Senate seven years after his consulship; but I thought <lb/>
            it imperative to affix a stigma on an act of gross sensuality. <lb/>
            For when he was in Gaul as consul, he had yielded to the <lb/>
            entreaties of his paramour at a dinner-party to behead a <lb/>
            man who happened to be in prison condemned on a capital <lb/>
            charge. When his brother Titus was Censor, who preceded <lb/>
            me, he escaped; but I and Flaccus could not countenance <lb/>
            an act of such criminal and abandoned lust, especially as, <lb/>
            besides the personal dishonour, it brought disgrace on the <lb/>
            Government.</p>
          <p>13. I have often been told by men older than myself, who <lb/>
            said that they had heard it as boys from old men, that <lb/>
            Gaius Fabricius was in the habit of expressing astonishment <lb/>
            at having heard, when envoy at the headquarters of king <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, from the Thessalian Cineas, that there was a man <lb/>
            of Athens who professed to be a " philosopher," and af­ <lb/>
            firmed that everything we did was to be referred to pleasure. <lb/>
            When he told this to Manius Curius and Publius Decius, <lb/>
            they used to remark that they wished that the Samnites and <lb/>
            Pyrrhus himself would hold the same opinion. It would be <lb/>
            much easier to conquer them, if they had once given them­ <lb/>
            selves over to sensual indulgences. Manius Curius had been <lb/>
            intimate with P. Decius, who four years before the former's <lb/>
            consulship had devoted himself to death for the Republic. <lb/>
            Both Fabricius and Coruncanius knew him also, and from the <lb/>
            experience of their own lives, as well as from the action of <lb/>
            P. Decius, they were of opinion that there did exist some­ <lb/>
            thing intrinsically noble and great, which was sought for <lb/>
            its own sake, and at which all the best men aimed, to the <lb/>
            contempt and neglect of pleasure. Why then do I spend <lb/>
            so many words on the subject of pleasure? Why, because, <lb/>
            far from being a charge against old age, that it does <lb/>
            not much feel the want of any pleasures, it is its highest <lb/>
            praise.</p>
          <p>But, you will say, it is deprived of the pleasures of the <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            table, the heaped up board, the rapid passing of the wine­ <lb/>
            cup. Well, then, it is also free from headache, disordered <lb/>
            digestion, broken sleep. But if we must grant pleasure <lb/>
            something, since we do not find it easy to resist its charms,­ <lb/>
            for Plato, with happy inspiration, calls pleasure " vice's <lb/>
            bait," because of course men are caught by it as fish by a <lb/>
            hook,-yet, although old age has to abstain from extrav­ <lb/>
            agant banquets, it is still capable of enjoying modest festiv­ <lb/>
            ities. As a boy I often used to see Gaius Duilius the son <lb/>
            of Marcus, then an old man, returning from a dinner-party. <lb/>
            He thoroughly enjoyed the frequent use of torch and flute­ <lb/>
            player, distinctions which he had assumed though unpre­ <lb/>
            cedented in the case of a private person. It was the <lb/>
            privilege of his glory. But why mention others? I will <lb/>
            come back to my own case. To begin with, I have always <lb/>
            remained a member of a " club”—clubs, you know, were <lb/>
            established in my quaestorship on the reception of the Magna <lb/>
            Mater from Ida. So I used to dine at their feast with the <lb/>
            members of my club-on the whole with moderation, though <lb/>
            there was a certain warmth of temperament natural to my <lb/>
            time of life; but as that advances there is a daily decrease <lb/>
            of all excitement. Nor was I, in fact, ever wont to measure <lb/>
            my enjoyment even of these banquets by the physical <lb/>
            pleasures they gave more than by the gathering and con­ <lb/>
            versation of friends. For it was a good idea of our ancestors <lb/>
            to style the presence of guests at a dinner-table-seeing that <lb/>
            it implied a community of enjoyment-a convivium, "a liv­ <lb/>
            ing together." It is a better term than the Greek words <lb/>
            which mean "a drinking together," or, "an eating together." <lb/>
            For they would seem to give the preference to what is really <lb/>
            the least important part of it.</p>
          <p>14. For myself, owing to the pleasure I take in conver­ <lb/>
            sation, I enjoy even banquets that begin early in the after­ <lb/>
            noon, and not only in company with my contemporaries­ <lb/>
            of whom very few survive-but also with men of your age <lb/>
            and with yourselves. I am thankful to old age, which has <lb/>
            increased my avidity for conversation, while it has removed <lb/>
            that for eating and drinking. But if anyone does enjoy <lb/>
            these-not to seem to have proclaimed war against all pleas­ <lb/>
            ure without exception, which is perhaps a feeling inspired <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            by nature-I fail to perceive even in these very pleasures <lb/>
            that old age is entirely without the power of appreciation. <lb/>
            For myself, I take delight even in the old-fashioned appoint­ <lb/>
            ment of master of the feast; and in the arrangement of the <lb/>
            conversation, which according to ancestral custom is begun <lb/>
            from the last place on the left-hand couch when the wine is <lb/>
            brought in; as also in the cups which, as in Xenophon's <lb/>
            banquet, are small and filled by driblets; and in the con­ <lb/>
            trivance for cooling in summer, and for warming by the <lb/>
            winter sun or winter fire. These things I keep up even <lb/>
            among my Sabine countrymen, and every day have a full <lb/>
            dinner-party of neighbours, which we prolong as far into <lb/>
            the night as we can with varied conversation.</p>
          <p>But you may urge-there is not the same tingling sensa­ <lb/>
            tion of pleasure in old men. No doubt; but neither do they <lb/>
            miss it so much. For nothing gives you uneasiness which <lb/>
            you do not miss. That was a fine answer of Sophocles to a <lb/>
            man who asked him, when in extreme old age, whether he was <lb/>
            still a lover. "Heaven forbid!" he replied; " I was only too <lb/>
            glad to escape from that, as though from a boorish and in­ <lb/>
            sane master." To men indeed who are keen after such <lb/>
            things it may possibly appear disagreeable and uncomfort­ <lb/>
            able to be without them; but to jaded appetites it is pleas­ <lb/>
            anter to lack than to enjoy. However, he cannot be said <lb/>
            to lack who does not want: my contention is that not to <lb/>
            want is the pleasanter thing.</p>
          <p>But even granting that youth enjoys these pleasures with <lb/>
            more zest; in the first place, they are insignificant <lb/>
            things to enjoy, as I have said; and in the second <lb/>
            place, such as age is not entirely without, if it does <lb/>
            not possess them in profusion. Just as a man gets <lb/>
            greater pleasure from Ambivius Turpio if seated in the <lb/>
            front row at the theatre than if he was in the last, yet, after <lb/>
            all, the man in the last row does get pleasure; so youth, be­ <lb/>
            cause it looks at pleasures at closer quarters, perhaps enjoys <lb/>
            itself more, yet even old age, looking at them from a dis­ <lb/>
            tance, does enjoy itself well enough. Why, what blessings <lb/>
            are these-that the soul, having served its time, so to speak, <lb/>
            in the campaigns of desire and ambition, rivalry and hatred, <lb/>
            and all the passions, should live in its own thoughts, and, <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            as the expression goes, should dwell apart! Indeed, if it <lb/>
            has in store any of what I may call the food of study and <lb/>
            philosophy, nothing can be pleasanter than an old age of <lb/>
            leisure. We were witnesses to C. Gallus-a friend of your <lb/>
            father's, Scipio—intent to the day of his death on mapping <lb/>
            out the sky and land. How often did the light surprise <lb/>
            him while still working out a problem begun during the <lb/>
            night! How often did night find him busy on what he had <lb/>
            begun at dawn! How he delighted in predicting for us <lb/>
            solar and lunar eclipses long before they occurred! Or <lb/>
            again in studies of a lighter nature, though still requiring <lb/>
            keenness of intellect, what pleasure Naevius took in his <lb/>
            Punic War Plautus in his Truculentus and Pseudolus! I <lb/>
            even saw Livius Andronicus, who, having produced a play <lb/>
            six years before I was born-in the consulship of Cento and <lb/>
            Tuditanus-lived till I had become a young man. Why <lb/>
            speak of Publius Licinius Crassus's devotion to pontifical <lb/>
            and civil Jaw, or of the Publius Scipio of the present time, <lb/>
            who within these last few days has been created Pontifex <lb/>
            Maximus ? And yet I have seen all whom I have mentioned <lb/>
            ardent in these pursuits when old men. Then there is Marcus <lb/>
            Cethegus, whom Ennius justly called "Persuasion's Mar­ <lb/>
            row”—with what enthusiasm did we see him exert himself <lb/>
            in oratory even when quite old! What pleasures are there <lb/>
            in feasts, games, or mistresses comparable to pleasures such <lb/>
            as these ? And they are all tastes, too, connected with learn­ <lb/>
            ing, which in men of sense and good education grow with <lb/>
            their growth. It is indeed an honourable sentiment which <lb/>
            Solon expresses in a verse which I have quoted before­ <lb/>
            that he grew old learning many a fresh lesson every day. <lb/>
            Than that intellectual pleasure none certainly can be greater.</p>
          <p>15. I come now to the pleasures of the farmer, in which <lb/>
            I take amazing delight. These are not hindered by any <lb/>
            extent of old age, and seem to me to approach nearest to <lb/>
            the ideal wise man's life. For he has to deal with the earth, <lb/>
            which never refuses its obedience, nor ever returns what it <lb/>
            has received without usury; sometimes, indeed, with less, <lb/>
            but generally with greater interest. For my part, however, <lb/>
            it is not merely the thing produced, but the earth's own force <lb/>
            and natural productiveness that delight me. For having <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            received in its bosom the seed scattered broadcast upon it, <lb/>
            softened and broken up, she first keeps it concealed therein <lb/>
            (hence the harrowing which accomplishes this gets its name <lb/>
            from a word meaning "to hide"); next, when it has been <lb/>
            warmed by her heat and close pressure, she splits it open <lb/>
            and draws from it the greenery of the blade. This, sup­ <lb/>
            ported by the fibres of the root, little by little grows up, and <lb/>
            held upright by its jointed stalk is enclosed in sheaths, as <lb/>
            being still immature. When it has emerged from them it <lb/>
            produces an ear of corn arranged in order, and is defended <lb/>
            against the pecking of the smaller birds by a regular pali­ <lb/>
            sade of spikes.</p>
          <p>Need I mention the starting, planting, and growth of <lb/>
            vines? I can never have too much of this pleasure-to let <lb/>
            you into the secret of what gives my old age repose and <lb/>
            amusement. For I say nothing here of the natural force <lb/>
            which all things propagated from the earth possess-the <lb/>
            earth which from that tiny grain in a fig, or the grape- <lb/>
            stone in a grape, or the most minute seeds of the other <lb/>
            cereals and plants, produces such huge trunks and boughs. <lb/>
            Mallet-shoots, slips, cuttings, quicksets, layers-are they not <lb/>
            enough to fill anyone with delight and astonishment? The <lb/>
            vine by nature is apt to fall, and unless supported drops <lb/>
            down to the earth; yet in order to keep itself upright it <lb/>
            embraces whatever it reaches with its tendrils as though <lb/>
            they were hands. Then as it creeps on, spreading itself in <lb/>
            intricate and wild profusion, the dresser's art prunes it with <lb/>
            the knife and prevents it growing a forest of shoots and <lb/>
            expanding to excess in every direction. Accordingly at the <lb/>
            beginning of spring in the shoots which have been left there <lb/>
            protrudes at each of the joints what is termed an "eye." <lb/>
            From this the grape emerges and shows itself; which, <lb/>
            swollen by the juice of the earth and the heat of the sun, <lb/>
            is at first very bitter to the taste, but afterwards grows sweet <lb/>
            as it matures; and being covered with tendrils is never with­ <lb/>
            out a moderate warmth, and yet is able to ward off the <lb/>
            fiery heat of the sun. Can anything be richer in product <lb/>
            or more beautiful to contemplate? It is not its utility only, <lb/>
            as I said before, that charms me, but the method of its <lb/>
            cultivation and the natural process of its growth: the rows <note type="footnote"> 3—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            of uprights, the cross-pieces for the tops of the plants, the <lb/>
            tying up of the vines and their propagation by layers, the <lb/>
            pruning, to which I have already referred, of some shoots, <lb/>
            the setting of others. I need hardly mention irrigation, or <lb/>
            trenching and digging the soil, which much increase its <lb/>
            fertility. As to the advantages of manuring I have spoken <lb/>
            in my book on agriculture. The learned Hesiod did not say <lb/>
            a single word on this subject, though he was writing on the <lb/>
            cultivation of the soil; yet Homer, who in my opinion was <lb/>
            many generations earlier, represents Laertes as softening his <lb/>
            regret for his son by cultivating and manuring his farm. <lb/>
            Nor is it only in cornfields and meadows and vineyards and <lb/>
            plantations that a farmer's life is made cheerful. There are <lb/>
            the garden and the orchard, the feeding of sheep, the swarms <lb/>
            of bees, endless varieties of flowers. Nor is it only planting <lb/>
            out that charms: there is also grafting-surely the most in­ <lb/>
            genious invention ever made by husbandmen.</p>
          <p>16. I might continue my list of the delights of country <lb/>
            life; but even what I have said I think is somewhat over <lb/>
            long. However, you must pardon me; for farming is a very <lb/>
            favourite hobby of mine, and old age is naturally rather gar­ <lb/>
            rulous-for I would not be thought to acquit it of all faults.</p>
          <p>Well, it was in a life of this sort that Manius Curius, after <lb/>
            celebrating triumphs over the Samnites, the Sabines, and <lb/>
            Pyrrhus, spent his last days. When I look at his villa— <lb/>
            for it is not far from my own—I never can enough admire <lb/>
            the man's own frugality or the spirit of the age. As Curius <lb/>
            was sitting at his hearth the Samnites, who brought hitn a <lb/>
            large sum of gold, were repulsed by him; for it was not, he <lb/>
            said, a fine thing in his eyes to possess gold, but to rule <lb/>
            those who possessed it. Could such a high spirit fail to <lb/>
            make old age pleasant?</p>
          <p>But to return to farmers—not to wander from my own <lb/>
            mètier. In those days there were senators, i. e. old men, on <lb/>
            their farms. For L. Quinctius Cincinnatus was actually at <lb/>
            the plough when word was brought him that he had been <lb/>
            named Dictator. It was by his order as Dictator, by the <lb/>
            way, that C. Servilius Ahala, the Master of the Horse, <lb/>
            seized and put to death Spurius Maelius when attempting to <lb/>
            obtain royal power. Curius as well as other old men used <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            to receive their summonses to attend the Senate in their <lb/>
            farm houses, from which circumstance the summoners were <lb/>
            called viatores or "travellers." Was these men's old age an <lb/>
            object of pity who found their pleasure in the cultivation of <lb/>
            the land? In my opinion, scarcely any life can be more <lb/>
            blessed, not alone from its utility (for agriculture is bene­ <lb/>
            ficial to the whole human race), but also as much from the <lb/>
            mere pleasure of the thing, to which I have already alluded, <lb/>
            and from the rich abundance and supply of all things neces­ <lb/>
            sary for the food of man and for the worship of the gods <lb/>
            above. So, as these are objects of desire to certain people, <lb/>
            let us make our peace with pleasure. For the good and <lb/>
            hard-working farmer’s wine-cellar and oil-store, as well as <lb/>
            his larder, are always well filled, and his whole farm-house <lb/>
            is richly furnished. It abounds in pigs, goats, lambs, fowls, <lb/>
            milk, cheese, and honey. Then there is the garden, which <lb/>
            the farmers themselves call their " second flitch." A zest <lb/>
            and flavour is added to all these by hunting and fowling in <lb/>
            spare hours. Need I mention the greenery of meadows, the <lb/>
            rows of trees, the beauty of vineyard and olive-grove? I <lb/>
            will put it briefly: nothing can either furnish necessaries <lb/>
            more richly, or present a fairer spectacle, than well-culti­ <lb/>
            vated land. And to the enjoyment of that, old age does not <lb/>
            merely present no hindrance-it actually invites and allures <lb/>
            to it. For where else can it better warm itself, either by <lb/>
            basking in the sun or by sitting by the fire, or at the proper <lb/>
            time cool itself more wholesomely by the help of shade or <lb/>
            water? Let the young keep their arms then to themselves, <lb/>
            their horses, spears, their foils and ball, their swimming­ <lb/>
            baths and running path. To us old men let them, out of the <lb/>
            many forms of sport, leave dice and counters; but even that <lb/>
            as they choose, since old age can be quite happy without <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>17. Xenophon's books are very useful for many purposes. <lb/>
            Pray go on reading them with attention, as you have ever <lb/>
            done. In what ample terms is agriculture lauded by him in <lb/>
            the book about husbanding one's property, which is called <lb/>
            OeconomicusI But to show you that he thought nothing so <lb/>
            worthy of a prince as the taste for cultivating the soil, I will <lb/>
            translate what Socrates says to Critobulus in that book: <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            "When that most gallant Lacedaemonian Lysander came <lb/>
            to visit the Persian prince Cyrus at Sardis, so eminent for his <lb/>
            character and the glory of his rule, bringing him presents <lb/>
            from his allies, he treated Lysander in all ways with courteous <lb/>
            familiarity and kindness, and, among other things, took him <lb/>
            to see a certain park carefully planted. Lysander expressed <lb/>
            admiration of the height of the trees and the exact arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of their rows in the quincunx, the careful cultivation <lb/>
            of the soil, its freedom from weeds, and the sweetness of <lb/>
            the odours exhaled from the flowers, and went on to say <lb/>
            that what he admired was not the industry only, but also the <lb/>
            skill of the man by whom this had been planned and laid <lb/>
            out. Cyrus replied: ' Well, it was I who planned the whole <lb/>
            thing; these rows are my doing, the laying out is all mine; <lb/>
            many of the trees were even planted by own hand.’ Then <lb/>
            Lysander, looking at his purple robe, the brilliance of his <lb/>
            person, and his adornment Persian fashion with gold and <lb/>
            many jewels, said: ‘People are quite right, Cyrus, to call <lb/>
            you happy, since the advantages of high fortune have been <lb/>
            joined to an excellence like yours.'"</p>
          <p>This kind of good fortune, then, it is in the power of old <lb/>
            men to enjoy; nor is age any bar to our maintaining pur­ <lb/>
            suits of every other kind, and especially of agriculture, to the <lb/>
            very extreme verge of old age. For instance, we have it <lb/>
            on record that M. Valerius Corvus kept it up to his hundredth <lb/>
            year, living on his land and cultivating it after his active <lb/>
            career was over, though between his first and sixth con­ <lb/>
            sulships there was an interval of six and forty years. So <lb/>
            that he had an official career lasting the number of years <lb/>
            which our ancestors defined as coming between birth and <lb/>
            the beginning of old age. Moreover, that last period of his <lb/>
            old age was more blessed than that of his middle life, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as he had greater influence and less labour. For the <lb/>
            crowning grace of old age is influence.</p>
          <p>How great was that of L. Caecilius Metellus! How great <lb/>
            that of Atilius Calatinus, over whom the famous epitaph was <lb/>
            placed, " Very many classes agree in deeming this to have <lb/>
            been the very first man of the nation"! The line cut on his <lb/>
            tomb is well known. It is natural, then, that a man should <lb/>
            have had influence, in whose praise the verdict of history <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            is unanimous. Again, in recent times, what a great man <lb/>
            was Publius Crassua, Pontifex Maximus, and his successor <lb/>
            in the same office, M. Lepidus! I need scarcely mention <lb/>
            Paulus or Africanus, or, as I did before, Maximus. It was <lb/>
            not only their senatorial utterances that had weight: their <lb/>
            least gesture had it also. In fact, old age, especially when it <lb/>
            has enjoyed honours, has an influence worth all the pleasures <lb/>
            of youth put together.</p>
          <p>18. But throughout my discourse remember that my pan­ <lb/>
            egyric applies to an old age that has been established on <lb/>
            foundations laid by youth. From which may be deduced what <lb/>
            I once said with universal applause, that it was a wretched <lb/>
            old age that had to defend itself by speech. Neither white <lb/>
            hairs nor wrinkles can at once claim influence in themselves: <lb/>
            it is the honourable conduct of earlier days that is rewarded <lb/>
            by possessing influence at the last. Even things generally <lb/>
            regarded as trifling and matters of course-being saluted, <lb/>
            being courted, having way made for one, people rising when <lb/>
            one approaches, being escorted to and from the forum, being <lb/>
            referred to for advice-all these are marks of respect, ob­ <lb/>
            served among us and in other States-always most sedu­ <lb/>
            lously where the moral tone is highest. They say that Ly­ <lb/>
            sander the Spartan, whom I have mentioned before, used <lb/>
            to remark that Sparta was the most dignified home for old <lb/>
            age; for that nowhere was more respect paid to years, no­ <lb/>
            where was old age held in higher honour. Nay, the story <lb/>
            is told of how when a man of advanced years came into the <lb/>
            theatre at Athens when the games were going on, no place <lb/>
            was given him anywhere in that large assembly by his own <lb/>
            countrymen; but when he came near the Lacedaemonians, <lb/>
            who as ambassadors had a fixed place assigned to them, they <lb/>
            rose as one man out of respect for him, and gave the <lb/>
            veteran a seat. When they were greeted with rounds of <lb/>
            applause from the whole audience, one of them remarked: <lb/>
            "The Athenians know what is right, but will not do it."</p>
          <p>There are many excellent rules in our augural college, <lb/>
            but among the best is one which affects our subject-that <lb/>
            precedence in speech goes by seniority; and augurs who are <lb/>
            older are preferred only to those who have held higher office, <lb/>
            but even to those who are actually in possession of imperium. <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            What then are the physical pleasures to be compared witH <lb/>
            the reward of influence ? Those who have employed it with <lb/>
            distinction appear to me to have played the drama of life <lb/>
            to its end, and not to have broken down in the last act like <lb/>
            unpractised players.</p>
          <p>But, it will be said, old men are fretful, fidgety, ill-tem­ <lb/>
            pered, and disagreeable. If you come to that, they are also <lb/>
            avaricious. But these are faults of character, not of the <lb/>
            time of life. And, after all, fretfulness and the other faults <lb/>
            I mentioned admit of some excuse-not, indeed, a complete <lb/>
            one, but one that may possibly pass muster: they think them­ <lb/>
            selve9 neglected, looked down upon, mocked, Besides, with <lb/>
            bodily weakness every rub is a source of pain. Yet all <lb/>
            these faults are softened both by good character and good <lb/>
            education. Illustrations of this may be found in real life, <lb/>
            as also on the stage in the case of the brothers in the Adelphi. <lb/>
            What harshness in the one, what gracious manners in the <lb/>
            other! The fact is that, just as it is not every wine, so it is <lb/>
            not every life, that turns sour from keeping, Serious gravity <lb/>
            I approve of in old age, but, as in other things, it must be <lb/>
            within due limits: bitterness I can in no case approve. <lb/>
            What the object of senile avarice may be I cannot conceive. <lb/>
            For can there be anything more absurd than to seek more <lb/>
            journey money, the less there remains of the journey?</p>
          <p>19. There remains the fourth reason, which more than <lb/>
            anything else appears to torment men of my age and keep <lb/>
            them in a flutter—THE NEARNESS OF DEATH, which, it must <lb/>
            be allowed, cannot be far from an old man. But what a poor <lb/>
            dotard must he be who has not learnt in the course of so <lb/>
            long a life that death is not a thing to be feared? Death, <lb/>
            that is either to be totally disregarded, if it entirely ex­ <lb/>
            tinguishes the soul, or is even to be desired, if it brings him <lb/>
            where he is to exist forever. A third alternative, at any <lb/>
            rate, cannot possibly be discovered. Why then should I <lb/>
            be afraid if I am destined either not to be miserable after <lb/>
            death or even to be happy? After all, who is such a fool <lb/>
            as to feel certain-however young he may be-that he will <lb/>
            be alive in the evening? Nay, that time of life has many <lb/>
            more chances of death than ours, Young men more easily <lb/>
            contract diseases; their illnesses are more serious; their <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            treatment has to be more severe. Accordingly, only a few <lb/>
            arrive at old age. If that were not so, life would be con­ <lb/>
            ducted better and more wisely; for it is in old men that <lb/>
            thought, reason, and prudence are to be found; and if there <lb/>
            had been no old men, States would never have existed at <lb/>
            all. But I return to the subject of the imminence of death. <lb/>
            What sort of charge is this against old age, when you see <lb/>
            that it is shared by youth? I had reason in the case of my <lb/>
            excellent son—as you had, Scipio, in that of your brothers, <lb/>
            who were expected to attain the highest honours-to realise <lb/>
            that death is common to every time of life. Yes, you will <lb/>
            say; but a young man expects to live long; an old man can­ <lb/>
            not expect to do so. Well, he is a fool to expect it. For <lb/>
            what can be more foolish than to regard the uncertain as <lb/>
            certain, the false as true ? " An old man has nothing even <lb/>
            to hope." Ah, but it is just there that he is in a better <lb/>
            position than a young man, since what the latter only hopes <lb/>
            he has obtained. The one wishes to live long; the other <lb/>
            has lived long.</p>
          <p>And yet, good heaven! what is " long" in a man's life ? <lb/>
            For grant the utmost limit: let us expect an age like that <lb/>
            of the King of the Tartessi. For there was, as I find re­ <lb/>
            corded, a certain Agathonius at Gades who reigned eighty <lb/>
            years and lived a hundred and twenty. But to my mind <lb/>
            nothing seems even long in which there is any " last," for <lb/>
            when that arrives, then all the past has slipped away-only <lb/>
            that remains to which you have attained by virtue and right­ <lb/>
            eous actions. Hours indeed, and days and months and years <lb/>
            depart, nor does past time ever return, nor can the future <lb/>
            be known. Whatever time each is granted for life, with <lb/>
            that he is bound to be content. An actor, in order to earn <lb/>
            approval, is not bound to perform the play from beginning <lb/>
            to end; let him only satisfy the audience in whatever act he <lb/>
            appears. Nor need a wise man go on to the concluding <lb/>
            " plaudite." For a short term of life is long enough for <lb/>
            living well and honourably. But if you go farther, you have <lb/>
            no more right to grumble than farmers do because the charm <lb/>
            of the spring season is past and the summer and autumn have <lb/>
            come. For the word " spring " in a way suggests youth, and <lb/>
            points to the harvest to be: the other seasons are suited for <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            the reaping and storing of the crops. Now the harvest of <lb/>
            old age is, as I have often said, the memory and rich store <lb/>
            of blessings laid up in earlier life. Again, all things that <lb/>
            accord with nature are to be counted as good. But what <lb/>
            can be more in accordance with nature than for old men <lb/>
            to die? A thing, indeed, which also befalls young men, <lb/>
            though nature revolts and fights against it. Accordingly, <lb/>
            the death of young men seems to me like putting out a great <lb/>
            fire with a deluge of water; but old men die like a fire going <lb/>
            out because it has burnt down of its own nature without <lb/>
            artificial means. Again, just as apples when unripe are <lb/>
            torn from trees, but when ripe and mellow drop down, so <lb/>
            it is violence that takes life from young men, ripeness from <lb/>
            old. This ripeness is so delightful to me, that, as I approach <lb/>
            nearer to death, I seem as it were to be sighting land, and <lb/>
            to be coming to port at last after a long voyage.</p>
          <p>20. Again, there is no fixed borderline for old age, and <lb/>
            you are making a good and proper use of it as long as you <lb/>
            can satisfy the call of duty and disregard death. The result <lb/>
            of this is, that old age is even more confident and courageous <lb/>
            than youth. That is the meaning of Solon's answer to the <lb/>
            tyrant Pisistratus. When the latter asked him what he re­ <lb/>
            lied upon in opposing him with such boldness, he is said to <lb/>
            have replied, " On my old age." But that end of life is the <lb/>
            best, when, without the intellect or senses being impaired, <lb/>
            Nature herself takes to pieces her own handiwork which she <lb/>
            also put together. Just as the builder of a ship or a house <lb/>
            can break them up more easily than any one else, so the <lb/>
            nature that knit together the human frame can also best un­ <lb/>
            fasten it. Moreover, a thing freshly glued together is always <lb/>
            difficult to pull asunder; if old, this is easily done.</p>
          <p>The result is that the short time of life left to them is not <lb/>
            to be grasped at by old men with greedy eagerness, or aban­ <lb/>
            doned without cause. Pythagoras forbids us, without an <lb/>
            order from our commander, that is God, to desert life's <lb/>
            fortress and outpost. Solon's epitaph, indeed, is that of a <lb/>
            wise man, in which he says that he does not wish his death <lb/>
            to be unaccompanied by the sorrow and lamentations of his <lb/>
            friends. He wants, I suppose, to be beloved by them. <lb/>
            But I rather think Ennius says better: <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            None grace me with their tears, nor weeping loud <lb/>
            Make sad my funeral rites! <lb/>
            He holds that a death is not a subject for mourning when it <lb/>
            is followed by immortality.</p>
          <p>Again, there may possibly be some sensation of dying­ <lb/>
            and that only for a short time, especially in the case of an <lb/>
            old man: after death, indeed, sensation is either what one <lb/>
            would desire, or it disappears altogether. But to disregard <lb/>
            death is a lesson which must be studied from our youth up; <lb/>
            for unless that is learnt, no one can have a quiet mind. For <lb/>
            die we certainly must, and that too without being certain <lb/>
            whether it may not be this very day. As death, therefore, <lb/>
            is hanging over our head every hour, how can a man ever <lb/>
            be unshaken in soul if he fears it?</p>
          <p>But on this theme I don't think I need much enlarge: when <lb/>
            I remember what Lucius Brutus did, who was killed while <lb/>
            defending his country; or the two Decii, who spurred their <lb/>
            horses to a gallop and met a voluntary death; or M. Atilius <lb/>
            Regulus, who left his home to confront a death of torture, <lb/>
            rather than break the word which he had pledged to the <lb/>
            enemy; or the two Scipios, who determined to block the <lb/>
            Carthaginian advance even with their own bodies; or your <lb/>
            grandfather Lucius Paulus, who paid with his life for the <lb/>
            rashness of his colleague in the disgrace at Cannae; or M. <lb/>
            Marcellus, whose death not even the most bloodthirsty of <lb/>
            enemies would allow to go without the honour of burial. <lb/>
            It is enough to recall that our legions (as I have recorded in <lb/>
            my Origins) have often marched with cheerful and lofty <lb/>
            spirit to ground from which they believed that they would <lb/>
            never return. That, therefore, which' young men-not only <lb/>
            uninstructed, but absolutely ignorant-treat as of no account, <lb/>
            shall men who are neither young nor ignorant shrink from <lb/>
            in terror? As a general truth, as it seems to me, it is weari­ <lb/>
            ness of all pursuits that creates weariness of life. There <lb/>
            are certain pursuits adapted to childhood: do young men <lb/>
            miss them ? There are others suited to early manhood: does <lb/>
            that settled time of life called " middle age " ask for them ? <lb/>
            There are others, again, suited to that age, but not looked <lb/>
            for in old age. There are, finally, some which belong to <lb/>
            old age. Therefore, as the pursuits of the earlier ages have <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            their time for disappearing, so also have those of old age. <lb/>
            And when that takes place, a satiety of life brings on the <lb/>
            ripe time for death.</p>
          <p>21. For I do not see why I should not venture to tell you <lb/>
            my personal opinion as to death, of which I seem to myself <lb/>
            to have a clearer vision in proportion as I am nearer to it. <lb/>
            I believe, Scipio and Laelius, that your fathers-those illus­ <lb/>
            trious men and my dearest friends-are still alive, and <lb/>
            that too with a life which alone deserves the name. For <lb/>
            as long as we are imprisoned in this framework of the body, <lb/>
            we perform a certain function and laborious work assigned <lb/>
            us by fate. The soul, in fact, is of heavenly origin, forced <lb/>
            down from its home in the highest, and, so to speak, buried <lb/>
            in earth, a place quite opposed to its divine nature and its im­ <lb/>
            mortality. But I suppose the immortal gods to have sown <lb/>
            souls broadcast in human bodies, that there might be some <lb/>
            to survey the world, and while contemplating the order of the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies to imitate it in the unvarying regularity of <lb/>
            their life. Nor is it only reason and arguments that have <lb/>
            brought me to this belief, but the great fame and authority <lb/>
            of the most distinguished philosophers. I used to be told <lb/>
            that Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans-almost natives of <lb/>
            our country, who in old times had been called the Italian <lb/>
            school of philosophers-never doubted that we had souls <lb/>
            drafted from the universal Divine intelligence. I used be­ <lb/>
            sides to have pointed out to me the discourse delivered by <lb/>
            Socrates on the last day of his life upon the immortality of <lb/>
            the soul—Socrates who was pronounced by the oracle at <lb/>
            Delphi to be the wisest of men. I need say no more. I <lb/>
            have convinced myself, and I hold-in view of the rapid <lb/>
            movement of the soul, its vivid memory of the past and its <lb/>
            prophetic knowledge of the future, its many accomplish­ <lb/>
            ments, its vast range of knowledge, its numerous discoveries <lb/>
            -that a nature embracing such varied gifts cannot itself <lb/>
            be mortal. And since the soul is always in motion and yet <lb/>
            has no external source of motion, for it is self-moved, I <lb/>
            conclude that it will also have no end to its motion, because <lb/>
            it is not likely ever to abandon itself. Again, since the nature <lb/>
            of the soul is not composite, nor has in it any admixture that <lb/>
            is not homogeneous and similar, I conclude that it is in­ <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            divisible, and, if indivisible, that it cannot perish. It is <lb/>
            again a strong proof of men knowing most things before <lb/>
            birth, that when mere children they grasp innumerable facts <lb/>
            with such speed as to show that they are not then taking <lb/>
            them in for the first time, but remembering and recalling <lb/>
            them. This is roughly Plato's argument.</p>
          <p>22. Once more in Xenophon we have the elder Cyrus on <lb/>
            his deathbed speaking as follows:­ <lb/>
            " Do not suppose, my dearest sons, that when I have left <lb/>
            you I shall be nowhere and no one. Even when I was with <lb/>
            you, you did not see my soul, but knew that it was in this <lb/>
            body of mine from what I did. Believe then that it is still <lb/>
            the same, even though you see it not. The honours paid to il­ <lb/>
            lustrious men had not continued to exist after their death, had <lb/>
            the souls of these very men not done something to make us <lb/>
            retain our recollection of them beyond the ordinary time. <lb/>
            For myself, I never could be persuaded that souls while in <lb/>
            mortal bodies were alive, and died directly they left them; <lb/>
            nor, in fact, that the soul only lost all intelligence when it <lb/>
            left the unintelligent body. I believe rather that when, by <lb/>
            being liberated from all corporeal admixture, it has begun to <lb/>
            be pure and undefiled, it is then that it becomes wise. And <lb/>
            again, when man's natural frame is resolved into its elements <lb/>
            by death, it is clearly seen whither each of the other ele­ <lb/>
            ments departs: for they all go to the place from which they <lb/>
            came: but the soul alone is invisible alike when present and <lb/>
            when departing. Once more, you see that nothing is so like <lb/>
            death as sleep. And yet it is in sleepers that souls most <lb/>
            clearly reveal their divine nature; for they foresee many <lb/>
            events when they are allowed to escape and are left free. <lb/>
            This shows what they are likely to be when they have com­ <lb/>
            pletely freed themselves from the fetters of the body. <lb/>
            Wherefore, if these things are so, obey me as a god. But <lb/>
            if my soul is to perish with my body, nevertheless do you <lb/>
            from awe of the gods, who guard and govern this fair uni­ <lb/>
            verse, preserve my memory by the loyalty and piety of your <lb/>
            lives."</p>
          <p>23. Such are the words of the dying Cyrus. I will now, <lb/>
            with your good leave, look at home. No one, my dear Scipio, <lb/>
            shall ever persuade me that your father Paulus and your two <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            grandfathers Paulus and Africanus, or the father of Afri­ <lb/>
            canus, or his uncle, or many other illustrious men not nec­ <lb/>
            essary to mention, would have attempted such lofty deeds as <lb/>
            to be remembered by posterity, had they not seen in their <lb/>
            minds that future ages concerned them. Do you suppose­ <lb/>
            to take an old man's privilege of a little self-praise-that I <lb/>
            should have been likely to undertake such heavy labours by <lb/>
            day and night, at home and abroad, if I had been destined <lb/>
            to have the same limit to my glory as to my life? Had it <lb/>
            not been much better to pass an age of ease and repose with­ <lb/>
            out any labour or exertion? But my soul, I know not <lb/>
            how, refusing to be kept down, ever fixed its eyes upon future <lb/>
            ages, as though from a conviction that it would begin to live <lb/>
            only when it had left the body. But had it not been the case <lb/>
            that souls were immortal, it would not have been the souls <lb/>
            of all the best men that made the greatest efforts after an im­ <lb/>
            mortality of fame.</p>
          <p>Again, is there not the fact that the wisest man ever dies <lb/>
            with the greatest cheerfulness, the most unwise with the <lb/>
            least? Don't you think that the soul which has the clearer <lb/>
            and longer sight sees that it is starting for better things, while <lb/>
            the soul whose vision is dimmer does not see it? For my <lb/>
            part, I am transported with the desire to see your fathers, <lb/>
            who were the object of my reverence and affection. Nor <lb/>
            is it only those whom I knew that I long to see; it is those <lb/>
            also of whom I have been told and have read, whom I have <lb/>
            myself recorded in my history. When I am setting out for <lb/>
            that, there is certainly no one who will find it easy to draw <lb/>
            me back, or boil me up again like second Pelios. Nay, if <lb/>
            some god should grant me to renew my childhood from my <lb/>
            present age and once more to be crying in my cradle, I would <lb/>
            firmly refuse; nor should I in truth be willing, after having, <lb/>
            as it were, run the full course, to be recalled from the <lb/>
            winning-crease to the barriers. For what blessing has life to <lb/>
            offer? Should we not rather say what labour? But grant­ <lb/>
            ing that it has, at any rate it has after all a limit either to <lb/>
            enjoyment or to existence. I don't wish to depreciate life, as <lb/>
            many men and good philosophers have often done; nor do <lb/>
            I regret having lived, for I have done so in a way that lets me <lb/>
            think that I was not born in vain. But I quit life as I would <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            an inn, not as I would a home. For nature has given us <lb/>
            a place of entertainment, not of residence.</p>
          <p>Oh glorious day when I shall set out to join that heavenly <lb/>
            conclave and company of souls, and depart from the turmoil <lb/>
            and impurities of this world! For I shall not go to join <lb/>
            only those whom I have before mentioned, but also my son <lb/>
            Cato, than whom no better man was ever born, nor one more <lb/>
            conspicuous for piety. His body was burnt by me, though <lb/>
            mine ought, on the contrary, to have been burnt by him; but <lb/>
            his spirit, not abandoning, but ever looking back upon me, has <lb/>
            certainly gone whither he saw that I too must come. I was <lb/>
            thought to bear that loss heroically, not that I really bore <lb/>
            it without distress, but I found my own consolation in the <lb/>
            thought that the parting and separation between us was not <lb/>
            to be for long.</p>
          <p>It is by these means, my dear Scipio,—for you said that <lb/>
            you and Laelius were wont to express surprise on this point, <lb/>
            -that my old age sits lightly on me, and is not only not <lb/>
            oppressive but even delightful. But if I am wrong in think­ <lb/>
            ing the human soul immortal, I am glad to be wrong; nor <lb/>
            will I allow the mistake which gives me so much pleasure <lb/>
            to be wrested from me as long as I live. But if when dead, <lb/>
            as some insignificant philosophers think, I am to be without <lb/>
            sensation, I am not afraid of dead philosophers deriding <lb/>
            my errors. Again, if we are not to be immortal, it is never­ <lb/>
            theless what a man must wish-to have his life end at its <lb/>
            proper time. For nature puts a limit to living as to every­ <lb/>
            thing else. Now, old age is as it were the playing out of <lb/>
            the drama, the full fatigue of which we should shun, es­ <lb/>
            pecially when we also feel that we have had more than <lb/>
            enough of it.</p>
          <p>This is all I had to say on old age. I pray that you <lb/>
            may arrive at it, that you may put my words to a practical <lb/>
            test.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE letters of Cicero are of a very varied character. They <lb/>
            range from the most informal communications with members of <lb/>
            his family to serious and elaborate compositions which are prac­ <lb/>
            tically treatises in epistolary form. A very large proportion of <lb/>
            them were obviously written out of the mood of the moment, with <lb/>
            no thought of the possibility of publication; and in these the <lb/>
            style is comparatively relaxed and colloquial. Others, addressed <lb/>
            to public characters, are practically of the same nature as his <lb/>
            speeches, discussions of political questions intended to influence <lb/>
            public opinion, and performing a function in the Roman life of the <lb/>
            time closely analogous to that fulfilled at the present day by arti­ <lb/>
            cles in the great reviews, or editorials in prominent journals.</p>
          <p>In the case of both of these two main groups the interest is two­ <lb/>
            fold: personal and historical, though it is naturally in the private <lb/>
            letters that we find most light thrown on the character of the: <lb/>
            writer. In spite of the spontaneity of these epistles there exists a <lb/>
            great difference of opinion among scholars as to the personality <lb/>
            revealed by them, and both in the extent of the divergence of view <lb/>
            and in the heat of the controversy we are reminded of modern dis­ <lb/>
            cussions of the characters of men such as Gladstone or Roose­ <lb/>
            velt. It has been fairly said that there is on the whole more chance <lb/>
            of justice to Cicero from the man of the world who understands <lb/>
            how the stress and change of politics lead a statesman into ap­ <lb/>
            parently inconsistent utterances than from the professional scholar <lb/>
            who subjects these utterances to the severest logical scrutiny, <lb/>
            without the illumination of practical experience.</p>
          <p>Many sides of Cicero's life other than the political are reflected <lb/>
            in the letters. From them we can gather a picture of how an <lb/>
            ambitious Roman gentleman of some inherited wealth took to the <lb/>
            legal profession as the regular means of becoming a public figure; <lb/>
            of how his fortune might be increased by fees, by legacies from <lb/>
            friends, clients, and even complete strangers who thus sought <lb/>
            to confer distinction on themselves; of how the governor of <lb/>
            a province could become rich in a year; of how the sons of <lb/>
            Roman men of wealth gave trouble to their tutors, were sent to <lb/>
            Athens, as to a university in our day, and found an allowance <lb/>
            of over $4,000 a year insufficient for their extravagances. Again, <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            we see the greatest orator of Rome divorce his wife after thirty <lb/>
            years, apparently because she had been indiscreet or unscrupulous <lb/>
            in money matters, and marry at the age of sixty-three his own <lb/>
            ward, a young girl whose fortune he admitted was the main attrac­ <lb/>
            tion. The coldness of temper suggested by these transactions is <lb/>
            contradicted in turn by Cicero's romantic affection for his daugh­ <lb/>
            ter Tullia, whom he is never tired of praising for her cleverness <lb/>
            and charm, and whose death almost broke his heart.</p>
          <p>Most of Cicero's letters were written in ink on paper or parch­ <lb/>
            ment with a reed pen; a few on tablets of wood or ivory covered <lb/>
            with wax, the marks being cut with a stylus. The earlier letters <lb/>
            he wrote with his own hand, the later were, except in rare cases, <lb/>
            dictated to a secretary. There was, of course, no postal service, <lb/>
            so the epistles were carried by private messengers or by the <lb/>
            couriers who were constantly traveling between the provincial <lb/>
            officials and the capital.</p>
          <p>Apart from the letters to Atticus, the collection, arrangement, <lb/>
            and publication of Cicero's correspondence seems to have been <lb/>
            due to Tiro, the learned freedman who served him as secretary, <lb/>
            and to whom some of the letters are addressed. Titus Pomponius <lb/>
            Atticus, who edited the large collection of the letters written to him­ <lb/>
            self, was a cultivated Roman who lived more than twenty years <lb/>
            in Athens for purposes of study. His seal for cultivation was <lb/>
            combined with the successful pursuit of wealth; and though Cicero <lb/>
            relied on him for aid and advice in public as well as private mat­ <lb/>
            ters, their friendship did not prevent Atticus from being on good <lb/>
            terms with men of the opposite party.</p>
          <p>Generous, amiable, and cultured, Atticus was not remarkable <lb/>
            for the intensity of his devotion either to principles or persons. <lb/>
            “That he was the lifelong friend of Cicero," says Professor <lb/>
            Tyrrell, "is the best title which Atticus has to remembrance. As <lb/>
            a man he was kindly, careful, and shrewd, but nothing more: there <lb/>
            was never anything grand or noble in his character. He was the <lb/>
            quintessence of prudent mediocrity”</p>
          <p>The period covered by the letters of Cicero is one of the most <lb/>
            interesting and momentous in the history of the world, and these <lb/>
            letters afford a picture of the chief personages and most important <lb/>
            events of that age from the pen of a man who was not only him­ <lb/>
            self in the midst of the conflict, but who was a consummate <lb/>
            literary artist.</p>

            HE state of things in regard to my candidature, in <lb/>
            which I know that you are supremely interested, is <lb/>
            this, as far as can be as yet conjectured. The only <lb/>
            person actually canvassing is P. Sulpicius Galba. He meets <lb/>
            with a good old-fashioned refusal without reserve or dis­ <lb/>
            guise. In the general opinion this premature canvass of his <lb/>
            is not unfavourable to my interests; for the voters generally <lb/>
            give as a reason for their refusal that they are under obliga­ <lb/>
            tions to me. So I hope my prospects are to a certain degree <lb/>
            improved by the report getting about that my friends are <lb/>
            found to be numerous. My intention was to begin my own <lb/>
            canvass just at the very time that Cincius tells me that your <lb/>
            servant starts with this letter, namely, in the campus at the <lb/>
            time of the tribunician elections on the 17th of July. My <lb/>
            fellow candidates, to mention only those who seem certain, <lb/>
            are Galba and Antonius and Q. Cornificius. At this I <lb/>
            imagine you smiling or sighing. Well, to make you positively <lb/>
            smite your forehead, there are people who actually think that <lb/>
            Cæsonius will stand. I don't think Aquilius will, for he <lb/>
            openly disclaims it and has alleged as an excuse his health <lb/>
            and his leading position at the bar. Catiline will certainly <lb/>
            be a candidate, if you can imagine a jury finding that the sun <lb/>
            does not shine at noon. As for Aufidius and Palicanus, I don't <lb/>
            think you will expect to hear from me about them. Of the <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            candidates for this year's election Caesar is considered cer­ <lb/>
            tain. Thermus is looked upon as the rival of Silanus. These <lb/>
            latter are so weak both in friends and reputation that it <lb/>
            seems pas impossible to bring in Curius over their heads. <lb/>
            But no one else thinks so. What seems most to my interests <lb/>
            is that Thermus should get in with Caesar. For there is none <lb/>
            of those at present canvassing who, if left over to my year, <lb/>
            seems likely to be a stronger candidate, from the fact thathe <lb/>
            is commissioner of the via Flaminia, and when that has been <lb/>
            finished, I shall be greatly relieved to have seen him elected <lb/>
            consul this election. Such in outline is the position of affairs <lb/>
            in regard to candidates up to date. For myself I shall take <lb/>
            the greatest pains to carry out all the duties of a candidate, <lb/>
            and perhaps, as Gaul seems to have a considerable voting <lb/>
            power, as soon as business at Rome has come to a standstill <lb/>
            I shall obtain a libera legatio and make an excursion in the <lb/>
            course of September to visit Piso, but so as not to be back <lb/>
            later than January. When I have ascertained the feelings <lb/>
            of the nobility I will write you word. Everything else I hope <lb/>
            will go smoothly, at any rate while my competitors are such <lb/>
            as are now in town. You must undertake to secure for me <lb/>
            the entourage of our friend Pompey, since you are nearer <lb/>
            than I. Tell him I shall not be annoyed if lie doesn't come to <lb/>
            my election. So much for that business. But there is a <lb/>
            matter for which I am very anxious that you should forgive <lb/>
            me. Your uncle Caecilius having been defrauded of a large <lb/>
            sum of money by P. Varius, began an action against his <lb/>
            cousin A. Caninius Satyrus for the property which (as he <lb/>
            alleged) the latter had received from Varius by a collusive <lb/>
            sale. He was joined in this action by the other creditors, <lb/>
            among whom were Lucullus and P. Scipio, and the man <lb/>
            whom they thought would be official receiver if the property <lb/>
            was put up for sale, Lucius Pontius; though it is ridiculous <lb/>
            to be talking about a receiver at this stage in the proceed­ <lb/>
            ings. Caecilius asked me to appear for him against Satyrus. <lb/>
            Now, scarcely a day passes that Satyrus does not call at my <lb/>
            house. The chief object of his attentions is L. Domitius, but <lb/>
            I am next in his regard. He has been of great service both <lb/>
            to myself and to my brother Quintus in our elections. I was <lb/>
            very much embarrassed by my intimacy with Satyrus as well <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            as that with Domitius, on whom the success of my election <lb/>
            depends more than on anyone else. I pointed out these facts <lb/>
            to Caecilius; at the same time I assured him that if the case <lb/>
            had been one exclusively between himself and Satyrus, I <lb/>
            would have done what he wished. As the matter actually <lb/>
            stood, all the creditors being concerned-and that two men <lb/>
            of the highest rank, who, without the aid of anyone specially <lb/>
            retained by Caecilius, would have no difficulty in maintain­ <lb/>
            ing their common cause-it was only fair that he should <lb/>
            have consideration both for my private friendship and my <lb/>
            present situation. He seemed to take this somewhat less <lb/>
            courteously than I could have wished, or than is usual <lb/>
            among gentlemen; and from that time forth he has entirely <lb/>
            withdrawn from the intimacy with me which was only of a <lb/>
            few days' standing. Pray forgive me, and believe that I was <lb/>
            prevented by nothing but natural kindness from assailing the <lb/>
            reputation of a friend in so vital a point at a time of such <lb/>
            very great distress, considering that he had shewn me every <lb/>
            sort of kindness and attention. But if you incline to the <lb/>
            harsher view of my conduct, take it that the interests of my <lb/>
            canvass prevented me. Yet, even granting that to be so, I <lb/>
            think you should pardon me, "since not for sacred beast or <lb/>
            oxhide shield.” You see in fact the position I am in, and <lb/>
            how necessary I regard it, not only to retain but even to <lb/>
            acquire all possible sources of popularity. I hope I have <lb/>
            justified myself in your eyes, I am at any rate anxious to <lb/>
            have done so. The Hermathena you sent I am delighted <lb/>
            with: it has been placed with such charming effect that the <lb/>
            whole gymnasium seems arranged specially for it. I am ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly obliged to you.</p>

          <p>IF you and the army are well I shall be glad. From your <lb/>
            official despatch I have, in common with everyone else, <lb/>
            received the liveliest satisfaction; for you have given us <lb/>
            that strong hope of peace, of which, in sole reliance on you, <lb/>

            old enemies-now posing as your friends-have received a <lb/>
            stunning blow by this despatch, and, being disappointed in <lb/>
            the high hopes they were entertaining, are thoroughly de­ <lb/>
            pressed. Though your private letter to me contained a. <lb/>
            somewhat slight expression of your affection, yet I can <lb/>
            assure you it gave me pleasure: for there is nothing in <lb/>
            which I habitually find greater satisfaction than in the con­ <lb/>
            sciousness of serving my friend; and if on any occasion I <lb/>
            do not meet with an adequate return, I am not at all sorry <lb/>
            to have the balance of kindness in my favour. Of this I feel <lb/>
            no doubt-even if my extraordinary zeal in your behalf has <lb/>
            failed to unite you to me-that the interests of the state will <lb/>
            certainly effect a mutual attachment and coalition between <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            us. To let you know, however, what I missed in your letter <lb/>
            I will write with the candour which my own disposition and <lb/>
            our common friendship demand. I did expect some con­ <lb/>
            gratulation in your letter on my achievements, for the sake <lb/>
            at once of the ties between us and of the Republic. This I <lb/>
            presume to have been omitted by you from a fear of hurting <lb/>
            anyone's feelings. But let me tell you that what I did for <lb/>
            the salvation of the country is approved by the judgment <lb/>
            and testimony of the whole world. You are a much greater <lb/>
            man that Africanus, but I am not much inferior to Laelius <lb/>
            either; and when you come home you will recognize that I <lb/>
            have acted with such prudence and spirit, that you will not <lb/>

            as in private friendship.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>YOUR letter, in which you inclose copies of his letters, has <lb/>
            made me realize that my brother Quintus's feelings have <lb/>
            undergone many alternations, and that his opinions and judg­ <lb/>
            ments have varied widely from time to time. This has not <lb/>
            only caused me all the pain which my extreme affection for <lb/>
            both of you was bound to bring, but it has also made me <lb/>
            wonder what can have happened to cause my brother Quintus <lb/>
            such deep offence, or such an extraordinary change of <lb/>
            feeling. And yet I was already aware, as I saw that you <lb/>
            also, when you took leave of me, were beginning to suspect, <lb/>
            that there was some lurking dissatisfaction, that his feelings <lb/>
            were wounded, and that certain unfriendly suspicions had <lb/>
            sunk deep into his heart. On trying on several previous <lb/>
            occasions, but more eagerly than ever after the allotment of <lb/>
            his province, to assuage these feelings, I failed to discover <lb/>
            on the one hand that the extent of his offence was so great <lb/>
            as your letter indicates; but on the other I did not make as <lb/>
            much progress in allaying it as I wished. However, I con­ <lb/>
            soled myself with thinking that there would be no doubt of <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            his seeing you at Dyrrachium, or somewhere in your part <lb/>
            of the country: and, if that happened, I felt sure and fully <lb/>
            persuaded that everything would be made smooth between <lb/>
            you, not only by conversation and mutual explanation, but <lb/>
            by the very sight of each other in such an interview. For <lb/>
            I need not say in writing to you, who knows it quite well, <lb/>
            how kind and sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to <lb/>
            forgive as he is sensitive in taking offence. But it most <lb/>
            unfortunately happened that you did not see him anywhere. <lb/>
            For the impression he had received from the artifices of <lb/>
            others had more weight with him than duty or relationship, <lb/>
            or the old affection so long existing between you, which <lb/>
            ought to have been the strongest influence of all. And yet, <lb/>
            as to where the blame for this misunderstanding resides, I <lb/>
            can more easily conceive than write: since I am afraid that, <lb/>
            while defending my own relations, I should not spare yours. <lb/>
            For I perceive that, though no actual wound was inflicted by <lb/>
            members of the family, they yet could at least have cured it. <lb/>
            But the root of the mischief in this case, which perhaps <lb/>
            extends farther than appears, I shall more conveniently <lb/>
            explain to you when we meet. As to the letter he sent to you <lb/>
            from Thessalonica, and about the language which you sup­ <lb/>
            pose him to have used both at Rome among your friends and <lb/>
            on his journey, I don't know how far the matter went, but <lb/>
            my whole hope of removing this unpleasantness rests on <lb/>
            your kindness. For if you will only make up your mind to <lb/>
            believe that the best men are often those whose feelings are <lb/>
            most easily irritated and appeased, and that this quickness, <lb/>
            so to speak, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally <lb/>
            signs of a good heart; and lastly-and this is the main <lb/>
            thing-that we must mutually put up with each other's <lb/>
            gaucheries (shall I call them?), or faults, or injurious acts, <lb/>
            then these misunderstandings will, I hope, be easily smoothed <lb/>
            away. I beg you to take this view, for it is the dearest wish <lb/>
            of my heart (which is yours as no one else's can be) that <lb/>
            there should not be one of my family or friends who does <lb/>
            not love you and is not loved by you.</p>
          <p>That part of your letter was entirely superfluous, in which <lb/>
            you mention what opportunities of doing good business in <lb/>
            the provinces or the city you let pass at other times as well <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            as in the year of my consulship: for I am thoroughly per­ <lb/>
            suaded of your unselfishness and magnanimity, nor did I ever <lb/>
            think that there was any difference between you and me <lb/>
            except in our choice of a career. Ambition led me to seek <lb/>
            official advancement, while another and perfectly laudable <lb/>
            resolution led you to seek an honourable privacy. In the <lb/>
            true glory, which is founded on honesty, industry, and piety, <lb/>
            I place neither myself nor anyone else above you. In affec­ <lb/>
            tion towards myself, next to my brother and immediate <lb/>
            family, I put you first. For indeed, indeed I have seen and <lb/>
            thoroughly appreciated how your anxiety and joy have cor­ <lb/>
            responded with the variations of my fortunes. Often has <lb/>
            your congratulation added a charm to praise, and your con­ <lb/>
            solation a welcome antidote to alarm. Nay, at this moment <lb/>
            of your absence, it is not only your advice-in which you <lb/>
            excel-but the interchange of speech-in which no one gives <lb/>
            me so much delight as you do-that I miss most, shall I say <lb/>
            in politics, in which circumspection is always incumbent on <lb/>
            me, or in my forensic labour, which I formerly sustained <lb/>
            with a view to official promotion, and nowadays to maintain <lb/>
            my position by securing popularity, or in the mere business <lb/>
            of my family? In all these I missed you and our conversa­ <lb/>
            tions before my brother left Rome, and still more do I miss <lb/>
            them since. Finally, neither my work nor rest, neither my <lb/>
            business nor leisure, neither my affairs in the forum or at <lb/>
            home, public or private, can any longer do without your most <lb/>
            consolatory and affectionate counsel and conversation. The <lb/>
            modest reserve which characterizes both of us has often <lb/>
            prevented my mentioning these facts; but on this occasion <lb/>
            it was rendered necessary by that part of your letter in <lb/>
            which you expressed a wish to have yourself and your char­ <lb/>
            acter " put straight" and “ cleared ” in my eyes. Yet, in <lb/>
            the midst of all this unfortunate alienation and anger on his <lb/>
            part, there is yet one fortunate circumstance-that your <lb/>
            determination of not going to a province was known to me <lb/>
            and your other friends, and had been at various times <lb/>
            asserted by yourself; so that your not being with him may <lb/>
            be attributed to your personal tastes and judgment, not to <lb/>
            the quarrel and rupture between you. So those ties which <lb/>
            have been broken will be restored, and ours which have been <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            so religiously preserved will retain all their old inviolability. <lb/>
            At Rome I find politics in a shaky condition; everything <lb/>
            is unsatisfactory and foreboding change. For I have no <lb/>
            doubt you have been told that our friends, the equites, are <lb/>
            all but alienated from the senate. Their first grievance was <lb/>
            the promulgation of a bill on the authority of the senate for <lb/>
            the trial of such as had taken bribes for giving a verdict. I <lb/>
            happened not to be in the house when that decree was passed, <lb/>
            but when I found that the equestrian order was indignant at <lb/>
            it, and yet refrained from openly saying so, I remonstrated <lb/>
            with the senate, as I thought, in very impressive language, and <lb/>
            was very weighty and eloquent considering the unsatisfac­ <lb/>
            tory nature of my cause. But here is another piece of almost <lb/>
            intolerable coolness on the part of the equites, which I have <lb/>
            not only submitted to, but have even put in as good a light <lb/>
            as possible! The companies which had contracted with the <lb/>
            censors for Asia complained that in the heat of the com­ <lb/>
            petition they had taken the contract at an excessive price; <lb/>
            they demanded that the contract should be annulled. I led <lb/>
            in their support, or rather, I was second, for it was Crassus <lb/>
            who induced them to venture on this demand. The case is <lb/>
            scandalous, the demand a disgraceful one, and a confession <lb/>
            of rash speculation. Yet there was a very great risk that, <lb/>
            if they got no concession, they would be completely alienated <lb/>
            from the senate. Here again I came to the rescue more than <lb/>
            anyone else, and secured them a full and very friendly house, <lb/>
            in which I, on the 1st and 2nd of December, delivered long <lb/>
            speeches on the dignity and harmony of the two orders. The <lb/>
            business is not yet settled, but the favourable feeling of the <lb/>
            senate has been made manifest: for no one had spoken <lb/>
            against it except the consul-designate, Metellus; while our <lb/>
            hero Cato had still to speak, the shortness of the day having <lb/>
            prevented his turn being reached. Thus I, in the mainte­ <lb/>
            nance of my steady policy, preserve to the best of my ability <lb/>
            that harmony of the orders which was originally my joiner's <lb/>
            work; but since it all now seems in such a crazy condition, <lb/>
            I am constructing what I may call a road towards the main­ <lb/>
            tenance of our power, a safe one I hope, which I cannot <lb/>
            fully describe to you in a letter, but of which I will never­ <lb/>
            theless give you a hint. I cultivate close intimacy with <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            Pompey. I foresee what you will say. I will use all neces­ <lb/>
            sary precautions, and I will write another time at greater <lb/>
            length about my schemes for managing the Republic. You <lb/>
            must know that Lucceius has it in his mind to stand for the <lb/>
            consulship at once; for there are said to be only two candi­ <lb/>
            dates in prospect. Caesar is thinking of coming to terms <lb/>
            with him by the agency of Arrius, and Bibulus also thinks he <lb/>
            may effect a coalition with him by means of C. Piso. You <lb/>
            smile? This is no laughing matter, believe me. What else <lb/>
            shall I write to you ? What ? I have plenty to say, but must <lb/>
            put it off to another time. If you mean to wait till you <lb/>
            hear, let me know. For the moment I am satisfied with a <lb/>
            modest request, though it is what I desire above every thing- <lb/>
            that you should come to Rome as soon as possible. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">V To TERENTIA, TULLIOI-A, AND YOUNG CICERO (AT ROME) BRUNDISIUM, 29 APRIL</title>
          </ab>
          <p>YES, I do write to you less often than I might, because, <lb/>
            though I am always wretched, yet when I write to you or <lb/>
            read a letter from you, I am in such floods of tears that I <lb/>
            cannot endure it. Oh, that I had clung less to life! I should <lb/>
            at least never have known real sorrow, or not much of it, in <lb/>
            my life. Yet if fortune has reserved for me any hope of re­ <lb/>
            covering at any time any position again, I was not utterly <lb/>
            wrong to do so: if these miseries are to be permanent, I <lb/>
            only wish, my dear, to see you as soon as possible and to die <lb/>
            in your arms, since neither gods, whom you have worshipped <lb/>
            with such pure devotion, nor men, whom I have ever served, <lb/>
            have made us any return. I have been thirteen days at <lb/>
            Brundisium in the house of M. Laenius Flaccus, a very <lb/>
            excellent man, who has despised the risk to his fortunes and <lb/>
            civil existence in comparison to keeping me safe, nor has <lb/>
            been induced by the penalty of a most iniquitous law to <lb/>
            refuse me the rights and good offices of hospitality and <lb/>
            friendship. May I sometime have the opportunity of repay­ <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            ing him Feel gratitude I always shall. I set out from <lb/>
            Brundisium on the 29th of April, and intend going through <lb/>
            Macedonia to Cyzicus. What a fall! What a disaster! <lb/>
            What can I say? Should I ask you to come-a woman of <lb/>
            weak health and broken spirit? Should I refrain from <lb/>
            asking you? Am I to be without you, then? I think the <lb/>
            best course is this: if there is any hope of my restoration, <lb/>
            stay to promote it and push the thing on: but if, as I fear, <lb/>
            it proves hopeless, pray come to me by any means in your <lb/>
            power. Be sure of this, that if I have you I shall not <lb/>
            think myself wholly lost. But what is to become of my <lb/>
            darling Tullia? You must see to that now: I can think of <lb/>
            nothing. But certainly, however things turn out, we must <lb/>
            do everything to promote that poor little girl's married hap­ <lb/>
            piness and reputation. Again, what is my boy Cicero to <lb/>
            do? Let him, at any rate, be ever in my bosom and in my <lb/>
            arms. I can't write more. A fit of weeping hinders me. <lb/>
            I don't know how you have got on; whether you are left in <lb/>
            possession of anything, or have been, as I fear, entirely <lb/>
            plundered. Piso, as you say, I hope will always be our <lb/>
            friend. As to the manumission of the slaves you need not <lb/>
            be uneasy. To begin with, the promise made to yours was <lb/>
            that you would treat them according as each severally de­ <lb/>
            served. So far Orpheus has behaved well, besides him no <lb/>
            one very markedly so. With the rest of the slaves the <lb/>
            arrangement is that, if my property is forfeited, they should <lb/>
            become my freedmen, supposing them to be able to main­ <lb/>
            tain at law that status. But if my property remained in <lb/>
            my ownership, they were to continue slaves, with the ex­ <lb/>
            ception of a very few. But these are trifles. To return to <lb/>
            your advice, that I should keep up my courage and not <lb/>
            give up hope of recovering my position, I only wish that <lb/>
            there were any good grounds for entertaining such a hope. <lb/>
            As it is, when, alas! shall I get a letter from you ? Who will <lb/>
            bring it me? I would have waited for it at Brundisium, but <lb/>
            the sailors would not allow it, being unwilling to lose a <lb/>
            favourable wind. For the rest, put as dignified a face on <lb/>
            the matter as you can, my dear Terentia. Our life is over: <lb/>
            we have had our day: it is not any fault of ours that has <lb/>
            ruined us, but our virtue. I have made no false step, except <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            in not losing my life when I lost my honours. But since our <lb/>
            children preferred my living, let us bear everything else, <lb/>
            however intolerable. And yet I, who encourage you, cannot <lb/>
            encourage myself. I have sent that faithful fellow Clodius <lb/>
            Philhetaerus home, because he was hampered with weakness <lb/>
            of the eyes. Sallustius seems likely to outdo everybody in his <lb/>
            attentions. Pescennius is exceedingly kind to me; and I <lb/>
            have hopes that he will always be attentive to you. Sicca <lb/>
            had said that he would accompany me; but he has left <lb/>
            Brundisium. Take the greatest care of your health, and <lb/>
            believe me that I am more affected by your distress than my <lb/>
            own. My dear Terentia, most fr.ithful and best of wives, <lb/>
            and my darling little daughter, and that last hope of my <lb/>
            race, Cicero, good-bye! <lb/>
            29 April, from Brundisium.</p>

            <title type="sub">VI To His BROTHER QUINTUS (ON HIS WAY TO ROME) THESSALONICA, 15 JUNE</title>
          </ab>
          <p>BROTHER! Brother! Brother! did you really fear that I had <lb/>
            been induced by some angry feeling to send slaves to you <lb/>
            without a letter? Or even that I did not wish to see you? I <lb/>
            to be angry with you! Is it possible for me to be angry with <lb/>
            you ? Why, one would think that it was you that brought me <lb/>
            low! Your enemies, your unpopularity, that miserably ruined <lb/>
            me, and not I that unhappily ruined you! The fact is, the <lb/>
            much-praised consulate of mine has deprived me of you, of <lb/>
            children, country, fortune; from you I should hope it will <lb/>
            have taken nothing but myself. Certainly on your side I <lb/>
            have experienced nothing but what was honourable and <lb/>
            gratifying: on mine you have grief for my fall and fear for <lb/>
            your own, regret, mourning, desertion. I not wish to see <lb/>
            you? The truth is rather that I was unwilling to be <lb/>
            seen by you. For you would not have seen your brother-not <lb/>
            the brother you had left, not the brother you knew, not him <lb/>
            to whom you had with mutual tears bidden farewell as he fol­ <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            lowed you on your departure for your province: not a trace <lb/>
            even or faint image of him, but rather what I may call the <lb/>
            likeness of a living corpse. And oh that you had sooner seen <lb/>
            me or heard of me as a corpse! Oh that I could have left <lb/>
            you to survive, not my life merely, but my undiminished <lb/>
            rank! But I call all the gods to witness that the one argu­ <lb/>
            ment which recalled me from death was, that all declared <lb/>
            that to some extent your life depended upon mine. In which <lb/>
            matter I made an error and acted culpably. For if I had <lb/>
            died, that death itself would have given clear evidence of my <lb/>
            fidelity and love to you. As it is, I have allowed you to be <lb/>
            deprived of my aid, though I am alive, and with me still <lb/>
            living to need the help of others; and my voice, of all others, <lb/>
            to fail when dangers threatened my family, which had so <lb/>
            often been successfully used in the defence of the tnerest <lb/>
            strangers. For as to the slaves coming to you without a <lb/>
            letter, the real reason (for you see that it was not anger) <lb/>
            was a deadness of my faculties, and a seemingly endless <lb/>
            deluge of tears and sorrows. How many tears do you sup­ <lb/>
            pose these very words have cost me? As many as I know <lb/>
            they will cost you to read them! Can I ever refrain from <lb/>
            thinking of you or ever think of you without tears? For <lb/>
            when I miss you, is it only a brother that I miss ? Rather it <lb/>
            is a brother of almost my own age in the charm of his <lb/>
            companionship, a son in his consideration for my wishes, a <lb/>
            father in the wisdom of his advice! What pleasure did I <lb/>
            ever have without you, or you without me ? And what must <lb/>
            my case be when at the same time I miss a daughter: How <lb/>
            affectionate! how modest! how clever! The express image <lb/>
            of my face, of my speech, of my very soul! Or again a <lb/>
            son, the prettiest boy, the very joy of my heart? Cruel in­ <lb/>
            human monster that I am, I dismissed him from my arms <lb/>
            better schooled in the world than I could have wished: for <lb/>
            the poor child began to understand what was going on. So, <lb/>
            too, your own son, your own image, whom my little Cicero <lb/>
            loved as a brother, and was now beginning to respect as an <lb/>
            elder brother! Need I mention also how I refused to allow <lb/>
            my unhappy wife-the truest of helpmates-to accompany <lb/>
            me, that there might be some one to protect the wrecks of <lb/>
            the calamity which had fallen on us both, and guard our <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            common children? Nevertheless, to the best of my ability, <lb/>
            I did write a letter to you, and gave it to your freedman <lb/>
            Philogonus, which, I believe, was delivered to you later on; <lb/>
            and in this I repeat the advice and entreaty, which had been <lb/>
            already transmitted to you as a message from me by my <lb/>
            slaves, that you should go on with your journey and hasten <lb/>
            to Rome. For, in the first place, I desired your protection, <lb/>
            in case there were any of my enemies whose cruelty was <lb/>
            not yet satisfied by my fall. In the next place, I dreaded the <lb/>
            renewed lamentation which our meeting would cause: while <lb/>
            I could not have borne your departure, and was afraid <lb/>
            of the very thing you mention in your letter-that you <lb/>
            would be unable to tear yourself away. For these reasons <lb/>
            the supreme pain of not seeing you-and nothing more <lb/>
            painful or more wretched could, I think, have happened to <lb/>
            the most affectionate and united of brothers-was a less <lb/>
            misery than would have been such a meeting followed by <lb/>
            such a parting. Now, if you can, though I, whom you al­ <lb/>
            ways regarded as a brave man, cannot do so, rouse yourself <lb/>
            and collect your energies in view of any contest you may <lb/>
            have to confront. I hope, if my hope has anything to go <lb/>
            upon, that your own spotless character and the love of your <lb/>
            fellow citizens, and even remorse for my treatment, may <lb/>
            prove a certain protection to you. But if it turns out that <lb/>
            you are free from personal danger, you will doubtless do <lb/>
            whatever you think can be done for me. In that matter, <lb/>
            indeed, many write to me at great length and declare they <lb/>
            have hopes; but I personally cannot see what hope there <lb/>
            is, since my enemies have the greatest influence, while <lb/>
            my friends have in some cases deserted, in others even be­ <lb/>
            trayed me, fearing perhaps in my restoration a censure on <lb/>
            their own treacherous conduct. But how matters stand <lb/>
            with you I would have you ascertain and report to me. In <lb/>
            any case I shall continue to live as long as you shall need <lb/>
            me, in view of any danger you may have to undergo: longer <lb/>
            than that I cannot go in this kind of life. For there is <lb/>
            neither wisdom nor philosophy with sufficient strength to <lb/>
            sustain such a weight of grief. I know that there has been <lb/>
            a time for dying, more honourable and more advantageous; <lb/>
            and this is not the only one of my many omissions; which, <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            if I should choose to bewail, I should merely be increasing <lb/>
            your sorrow and emphasizing my own stupidity. But one <lb/>
            thing I am not bound to do, and it is in fact impossible-re­ <lb/>
            main in a life so wretched and so dishonoured any longer <lb/>
            than your necessities, or some well-grounded hope, shall de­ <lb/>
            mand. For I, who was lately supremely blessed in brother, <lb/>
            children, wife, wealth, and in the very nature of that wealth, <lb/>
            while in position, influence, reputation, and popularity, I was <lb/>
            inferior to none, however, distinguished—I cannot, I repeat. <lb/>
            go on longer lamenting over myself and those dear to me <lb/>
            in a life of such humiliation as this, and in a state of such <lb/>
            utter ruin. Wherefore, what do you mean by writing to me <lb/>
            about negotiating a bill of exchange? As though I were <lb/>
            not now wholly dependent on your means! And that is <lb/>
            just the very thing in which I see and feel, to my misery, of <lb/>
            what a culpable act I have been guilty in squandering to no <lb/>
            purpose the money which I received from the treasury in <lb/>
            your name, while you have to satisfy your creditors out of <lb/>
            the very vitals of yourself and your son. However, the <lb/>
            sum mentioned in your letter has been paid to M. Antonius, <lb/>
            and the same amount to Cæpio. For me the sum at present <lb/>
            in my hands is sufficient for what I contemplate doing. For <lb/>
            in either case-whether I am restored or given up in de­ <lb/>
            spair-I shall not want any more money. For yourself, if <lb/>
            you are molested, I think you should apply to Crassus and <lb/>
            Calidius. I don't know how far Hortensius is to be trusted. <lb/>
            Myself, with the most elaborate presence of affection and <lb/>
            the closest daily intimacy, he treated with the most utter <lb/>
            want of principle and the most consummate treachery, and <lb/>
            Q. Arrius helped him in it: acting under whose advice, <lb/>
            promises, and injunctions, I was left helpless to fall into <lb/>
            this disaster. But this you will keep dark for fear they might <lb/>
            injure you. Take care also-and it is on this account that <lb/>
            I think you should cultivate Hortensius himself by means <lb/>
            of Pomponius-that the epigram on the lex Aurelia at­ <lb/>
            tributed to you when candidate for the ædileship is not <lb/>
            proved by false testimony to be yours. For there is nothing <lb/>
            that I am so afraid of as that, when people understand how <lb/>
            much pity for me your prayers and your acquittal will rouse, <lb/>
            they may attack you with all the greater violence. Messalla <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            I reckon as really attached to you: Pompey I regard as still <lb/>
            pretending only. But may you never have to put these <lb/>
            things to the test! And that prayer I would have offered to <lb/>
            the gods had they not ceased to listen to prayers of mine. <lb/>
            However, I do pray that they may be content with these <lb/>
            endless miseries of ours; among which, after all, there <lb/>
            is no discredit for any wrong thing done-sorrow is the <lb/>
            beginning and end, sorrow that punishment is most severe <lb/>
            when our conduct has been most unexceptionable. As <lb/>
            to my daughter and yours and my young Cicero, why <lb/>
            should I recommend them to you, my dear brother? Rather <lb/>
            I grieve that their orphan state will cause you no less <lb/>
            sorrow than it does me. Yet as long as you are uncon­ <lb/>
            demned they will not be fatherless. The rest, by my hopes <lb/>
            of restoration and the privilege of dying in my fatherland, <lb/>
            my tears will not allow me to write! Terentia also I would <lb/>
            ask you to protect, and to write me word on every subject. <lb/>
            Be as brave as the nature of the case admits. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">VII To ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)' ROME (SEPTEMBER)</title>
          </ab>
          <p>DIRECTLY I arrived at Rome, and there was anyone to whom <lb/>
            I could safely intrust a letter for you, I thought the very <lb/>
            first thing I ought to do was to congratulate you in your <lb/>
            absence on my return. For I knew, to speak candidly, that <lb/>
            though in giving me advice you had not been more courageous <lb/>
            or far-seeing than myself, nor-considering my devotion to <lb/>
            you in the past-too careful in protecting me from disaster, <lb/>
            yet that you-though sharing in the first instance in my mis­ <lb/>
            take, or rather madness, and in my groundless terror-had <lb/>
            nevertheless been deeply grieved at our separation, and had <lb/>
            bestowed immense pains, zeal, care, and labour in securing <lb/>
            my return. Accordingly, I can truly assure you of this, that <lb/>
            in the midst of supreme joy and the most gratifying con­ <lb/>
            gratulations, the one thing wanting to fill my cup of happi­ <lb/>
            ness to the brim is the sight of you, or rather your embrace: <note type="footnote"> 4—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            and if I ever forfeit that again, when I have once got pos­ <lb/>
            session of it, and if, too, I do not exact the full delights of <lb/>
            your charming society that have fallen into arrear in the <lb/>
            past, I shall certainly consider myself unworthy of this <lb/>
            renewal of my good fortune.</p>
          <p>In regard to my political position, I have resumed what <lb/>
            I thought there would be the utmost difficulty in recovering­ <lb/>
            my brilliant standing at the bar, my influence in the senate, <lb/>
            and a popularity with the loyalists even greater than I <lb/>
            desired. In regard, however, to my private property-as to <lb/>
            which you are well aware to what an extent it has been <lb/>
            crippled, scattered, and plundered-I am in great difficulties, <lb/>
            and stand in need, not so much of your means (which I look <lb/>
            upon as my own), as of your advice for collecting and <lb/>
            restoring to a sound state the fragments that remain. For <lb/>
            the present, though I believe everything finds its way to you <lb/>
            in the letters of your friends, or even by messengers and <lb/>
            rumour, yet I will write briefly what I think you would like <lb/>
            to learn from my letters above all others. On the 4th of <lb/>
            August I started from Dyrrachium, the very day on which <lb/>
            the law about me was carried. I arrived at Brundisium on <lb/>
            the 5th of August. There my dear Tulliola met me on what <lb/>
            was her own birthday, which happened also to be the name­ <lb/>
            day of the colony of Brundisium and of the temple of Safety, <lb/>
            near your house. This coincidence was noticed and cele­ <lb/>
            brated with warm congratulations by the citizens of Brun­ <lb/>
            disium. On the 8th of August, while still at Brundisium, I <lb/>
            learnt by a letter from Quintus that the law had been passed <lb/>
            at the comitia centuriata with a surprising enthusiasm on <lb/>
            the part of all ages and ranks, and with an incredible influx <lb/>
            of voters from Italy. I then commenced my journey, amidst <lb/>
            the compliments of the men of highest consideration at Brun­ <lb/>
            disium, and was met at every point by legates bearing con­ <lb/>
            gratulations. My arrival in the neighbourhood of the city <lb/>
            was the signal for every soul of every order known to my <lb/>
            nomenclator coming out to meet me, except those enemies <lb/>
            who could not either dissemble or deny the fact of their <lb/>
            being such. On my arrival at the Porta Capena, the steps <lb/>
            of the temples were already thronged from top to bottom by <lb/>
            the populace; and while their congratulations were dis­ <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            played by the loudest possible applause, a similar throng and <lb/>
            similar applause accompanied me right up to the Capitol, <lb/>
            and in the forum and on the Capitol itself there was again <lb/>
            a wonderful crowd. Next day, in the senate, that is, the <lb/>
            5th of September, I spoke my thanks to the senators. Two <lb/>
            days after that-there having been a very heavy rise in the <lb/>
            price of corn, and great crowds having flocked first to the <lb/>
            theatre and then to the senate-house, shouting out, at the <lb/>
            instigation of Clodius, that the scarcity of corn was my <lb/>
            doing-meetings of the senate being held on those days to <lb/>
            discuss the corn question, and Pompey being called upon to <lb/>
            undertake the management of its supply in the common talk <lb/>
            not only of the plebs, but of the aristocrats also, and being <lb/>
            himself desirous of the commission, when the people at large <lb/>
            called upon me by name to support a decree to that effect, <lb/>
            I did so, and gave my vote in a care fully-worded speech. <lb/>
            The other consulars, except Messalla and Afranius, having <lb/>
            absented themselves on the ground that they could not vote <lb/>
            with safety to themselves, a decree of the senate was passed <lb/>
            in the sense of my motion, namely, that Pompey should be <lb/>
            appealed to to undertake the business, and that a law should <lb/>
            be proposed to that effect. This decree of the senate having <lb/>
            been publicly read, and the people having, after the sense­ <lb/>
            less and new-fangled custom that now prevails, applauded <lb/>
            the mention of my name, I delivered a speech. All the <lb/>
            magistrates present, except one prætor and two tribunes, <lb/>
            called on me to speak. Next day a full senate, including all <lb/>
            the consulars, granted everything that Pompey asked for. <lb/>
            Having demanded fifteen legates, he named me first in the <lb/>
            list, and said that he should regard me in all things as a <lb/>
            second self. The consuls drew up a law by which complete <lb/>
            control over the corn-supply for five years throughout the <lb/>
            whole world was given to Pompey. A second law is drawn <lb/>
            up by Messius, granting him power over all money, and <lb/>
            adding a fleet and army, and an imperium in the provinces <lb/>
            superior to that of their governors. After that our consular <lb/>
            law seems moderate indeed: that of Messius is quite intoler­ <lb/>
            able. Pompey professes to prefer the former; his friends <lb/>
            the latter. The consulars led by Favonius murmur: I hold <lb/>
            my tongue, the more so that the pontifices have as yet given <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            no answer in regard to my house. If they annul the con­ <lb/>
            secration I shall have a splendid site. The consuls, in <lb/>
            accordance with a decree of the senate, will value the cost <lb/>
            of the building that stood upon it; but if the pontifices decide <lb/>
            otherwise, they will pull down the Clodian building, give out <lb/>
            a contract in their own name (for a temple), and value to <lb/>
            me the cost of a site and house. So our affairs are <lb/>
            "For happy though but ill, for ill not worst." <lb/>
            In regard to money matters I am, as you know, much embar­ <lb/>
            rassed. Besides, there are certain domestic troubles, which <lb/>
            I do not intrust to writing. My brother Quintus I love as <lb/>
            he deserves for his eminent qualities of loyalty, virtue, and <lb/>
            good faith. I am longing to see you, and beg you to hasten <lb/>
            your return, resolved not to allow me to be without the <lb/>
            benefit of your advice. I am on the threshold, as it were, <lb/>
            of a second life. Already certain persons who defended me <lb/>
            in my absence begin to nurse a secret grudge at me now that <lb/>
            I am here, and to make no secret of their jealousy. I want <lb/>
            you very much.</p>

            <title type="sub">VIII To HIS BROTHER QUINTUS (IN SARDINIA) ROME, 12 FEBRUARY</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE already told you the earlier proceedings; now let <lb/>
            me describe what was done afterwards. The legations were <lb/>
            postponed from the 1st of February to the 13th. On the <lb/>
            former day our business was not brought to a settlement. On <lb/>
            the 2nd of February Milo appeared for trial. Pompey came to <lb/>
            support him. Marcellus spoke on being called upon by me. <lb/>
            We came off with flying colours. The case was adjourned <lb/>
            to the 7th. Meanwhile (in the senate), the legations having <lb/>
            been postponed to the 13th, the business of allotting the <lb/>
            quaestors and furnishing the outfit of the praetors was <lb/>
            brought before the house. But nothing was done, because <lb/>
            many speeches were interposed denouncing the state of the <lb/>
            Republic. Gaius Cato published his bill for the recall of <lb/>
            Lentulus, whose son thereon put on mourning. On the <lb/>
            7th Milo appeared. Pompey spoke, or rather wished to <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            speak. For as soon as he got up Clodius's ruffians raised a <lb/>
            shout, and throughout his whole speech he was interrupted, <lb/>
            not only by hostile cries, but by personal abuse and insult­ <lb/>
            ing remarks. However, when he had finished his speech­ <lb/>
            for he shewed great courage in these circumstances, he was <lb/>
            not cowed, he said all he had to say, and at times had by <lb/>
            his commanding presence even secured silence for his words <lb/>
            -well, when he had finished, up got Clodius. Our party <lb/>
            received him with such a shout-for they had determined to <lb/>
            pay him out-that he lost all presence of mind, power of <lb/>
            speech, or control over his countenance. This went on up <lb/>
            to two o'clock-Pompey having finished his speech at noon <lb/>
            -and every kind of abuse, and finally epigrams of the most <lb/>
            outspoken indecency were uttered against Clodius and <lb/>
            Clodia. Mad and livid with rage Clodius, in the very midst <lb/>
            of the shouting, kept putting questions to his claque: "Who <lb/>
            was it who was starving the commons to death ?" His <lb/>
            ruffians answered, "Pompey." "Who wanted to be sent to <lb/>
            Alexandria?" They answered, "Pompey." "Who did they <lb/>
            wish to go?" They answered, "Crassus." The latter was <lb/>
            present at the time with no friendly feelings to Milo. About <lb/>
            three o'clock, as though at a given signal, the Clodians began <lb/>
            spitting at our men. There was an outburst of rage. They <lb/>
            began a movement for forcing us from our ground. Our <lb/>
            men charged: his ruffians turned tail. Clodius was pushed <lb/>
            off the rostra: and then we too made our escape for fear of <lb/>
            mischief in the riot. The senate was summoned into the <lb/>
            Curia: Pompey went home. However, I did not myself enter <lb/>
            the senate-house, lest I should be obliged either to refrain <lb/>
            from speaking on matters of such gravity, or in defend­ <lb/>
            ing Pompey (for he was being attacked by Bibulus, Curio, <lb/>
            Favonius, and Servilius the younger) should give offence to <lb/>
            the loyalists. The business was adjourned to the next day. <lb/>
            Clodius fixed the Quirinalia (17th of February) for his pros­ <lb/>
            ecution. On the 8th the senate met in the temple of Apollo, <lb/>
            that Pompey might attend. Pompey made an impressive <lb/>
            speech. That day nothing was concluded. On the 9th in the <lb/>
            temple of Apollo a degree passed the senate "that what had <lb/>
            taken place on the 7th of February was treasonable." On this <lb/>
            day Cato warmly inveighed against Pompey, and throughout <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            his speech arraigned him as though he were at the bar. He <lb/>
            said a great deal about me, to my disgust, though it was in <lb/>
            very laudatory terms. When he attacked Pompey's perfidy <lb/>
            to me, he was listened to in profound silence on the part of <lb/>
            my enemies. Pompey answered him boldly with a palpable <lb/>
            allusion to Crassus, and said outright that "he would take <lb/>
            better precautions to protect his life than Africanus had <lb/>
            done, whom C. Carbo had assassinated." Accordingly, <lb/>
            important events appear to me to be in the wind. For <lb/>
            Pompey understands what is going on, and imparts to me <lb/>
            that plots, are being formed against his life, that Gaius Cato <lb/>
            is being supported by Crassus, that money is being supplied <lb/>
            to Clodius, that both are backed by Crassus and Curio, as <lb/>
            well as by Bibulus and his other detractors: that he must <lb/>
            take extraordinary precautions to prevent being overpowered <lb/>
            by that demagogue-with a people all but wholly alienated, <lb/>
            a nobility hostile, a senate ill-affected, and the younger men <lb/>
            corrupt. So he is making his preparations and summoning <lb/>
            men from the country. On his part, Clodius is rallying his <lb/>
            gangs: a body of men is being got together for the Quiri­ <lb/>
            nalia. For that occasion we are considerably in a majority, <lb/>
            owing to the forces brought up by Pompey himself: and a <lb/>
            large contingent is expected from Picenum and Gallia, to <lb/>
            enable us to throw out Cato's bills also about Milo and <lb/>
            Lentulus.</p>
          <p>On the loth of February an indictment was lodged against <lb/>
            Sestius for bribery by the informer Cn. Nerius, of the Pupi­ <lb/>
            nian tribe, and on the same day by a certain M. Tullius for <lb/>
            riot. He was ill. I went at once, as I was bound to do. <lb/>
            to his house, and put myself wholly at his service: and that <lb/>
            was more than people expected, who thought that I had <lb/>
            good cause for being angry with him. The result is that my <lb/>
            extreme kindness and grateful disposition are made manifest <lb/>
            both to Sestius himself and to all the world, and I shall <lb/>
            be as good as my word. But this same informer Nerius <lb/>
            also named Cn. Lentulus Vatia and C. Cornelius to the <lb/>
            commissioners. On the same day a decree passed the <lb/>
            senate "that political clubs and associations should be <lb/>
            broken up, and that a law in regard to them should be <lb/>
            brought in, enacting that those who did not break off from <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            them should be liable to the same penalty as those convicted <lb/>
            of riot."</p>
          <p>On the 11th of February I spoke in defence of Bestia on <lb/>
            a charge of bribery before the praetor Cn. Domitius, in the <lb/>
            middle of the forum and in a very crowded court; and in the <lb/>
            course of my speech I came to the incident of Sestius, after <lb/>
            receiving many wounds in the temple of Castor, having been <lb/>
            preserved by the aid of Bestia. Here I took occasion to <lb/>
            pave the way beforehand for a refutation of the charges <lb/>
            which are being got up against Sestius, and I passed a well­ <lb/>
            deserved encomium upon him with the cordial approval of <lb/>
            everybody. He was himself very much delighted with it. <lb/>
            I tell you this because you have often advised me in your <lb/>
            letters to retain the friendship of Sestius. I am writing <lb/>
            this on the 12th of February before daybreak; the day on <lb/>
            which I am to dine with Pomponius on the occasion of his <lb/>
            wedding.</p>
          <p>Our position in other respects is such as you used to cheer <lb/>
            my despondency by telling me it would be-one of great <lb/>
            dignity and popularity: this is a return to old times for <lb/>
            you and me effected, my brother, by your patience, high <lb/>
            character, loyalty, and, I may also add, your conciliatory <lb/>
            manners. The house of Licinius, near the grove of Piso, <lb/>
            has been taken for you. But, as I hope, in a few months’ <lb/>
            time, after the 1st of July, you will move into your own. <lb/>
            Some excellent tenants, the Lamiae, have taken your house <lb/>
            in Carinæ. I have received no letter from you since the <lb/>
            one dated Olbia. I am anxious to hear how you are and <lb/>
            what you find to amuse you, but above all to see you your­ <lb/>
            self as soon as possible. Take care of your health, my dear <lb/>
            brother, and though it is winter time, yet reflect that after all <lb/>
            it is Sardinia that you arc In. <lb/>
            IS February.</p><pb n="104"/>

          <p>IT will be delightful if you come to see us here. You will <lb/>
            find that Tyrannic has made a wonderfully good arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of my books, the remains of which are better than I had <lb/>

            But all this is only if not inconvenient to you. In any case, <lb/>
            be sure you come yourself, if you can halt for a while in such <lb/>

            <title type="sub">X To L. LUCCEIUS ARPINUM (APRIL)</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE often tried to say to you personally what I am <lb/>
            about to write, but was prevented by a kind of almost <lb/>
            clownish bashfulness. Now that I am not in your presence <lb/>
            I shall speak out more boldly: a letter does not blush. I <lb/>
            am inflamed with an inconceivably ardent desire, and one, as <lb/>
            I think, of which I have no reason to be ashamed, that in a <lb/>
            history written by you my name should be conspicuous and <lb/>
            frequently mentioned with praise. And though you have <lb/>
            often shewn me that you meant to do so, yet I hope you <lb/>
            will pardon my impatience. For the style of your compo­ <lb/>
            sition, though I had always entertained the highest expecta­ <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            tions of it, has yet surpassed my hopes, and has taken such a <lb/>
            hold upon me, or rather has so fired my imagination, that I <lb/>
            was eager to have my achievements as quickly as possible <lb/>
            put on record in your history. For it is not only the thought <lb/>
            of being spoken of by future ages that makes me snatch at <lb/>
            what seems a hope of immortality, but it is also the desire of <lb/>
            fully enjoying in my lifetime an authoritative expression <lb/>
            of your judgment, or a token of your kindness for me, or the <lb/>
            charm of your genius. Not, however, that while thus writing <lb/>
            I am unaware under what heavy burdens you are labouring <lb/>
            in the portion of history you have undertaken, and by this <lb/>
            time have begun to write. But because I saw that your his­ <lb/>
            tory of the Italian and Civil Wars was now all but finished, <lb/>
            and because also you told me that you were already em­ <lb/>
            barking upon the remaining portions of your work, I de­ <lb/>
            termined not to lose my chance for the want of suggesting <lb/>
            to you to consider whether you preferred to weave your ac­ <lb/>
            count of me into the main context of your history, or <lb/>
            whether, as many Greek writers have done—Callisthenes, <lb/>
            the Phocian War; Timaeus, the war of Pyrrhus; Polybius, <lb/>
            that of Numantia; all of whom separated the wars I have <lb/>
            named from their main narratives-you would, like them, <lb/>
            separate the civil conspiracy from public and external wars. <lb/>
            For my part, I do not see that it matters much to my reputa­ <lb/>
            tion, but it docs somewhat concern my impatience, that you <lb/>
            should not wait till you come to the proper place, but should <lb/>
            at once anticipate the discussion of that question as a whole <lb/>
            and the history of that epoch. And at the same time, if your <lb/>
            whole thoughts are engaged on one incident and one person, <lb/>
            I can see in imagination how much fuller your material will <lb/>
            be, and how much more elaborately worked out. I am quite <lb/>
            aware, however, what little modesty I display, first, in im­ <lb/>
            posing on you so heavy a burden (for your engagements may <lb/>
            well prevent your compliance with my request), and in the <lb/>
            second place, in asking you to shew me off to advantage. <lb/>
            What if those transactions are not in your judgment so very <lb/>
            deserving of commendation ? Yet, after all, a man who has <lb/>
            once passed the border-line of modesty had better put a bold <lb/>
            face on it and be frankly impudent. And so I again and <lb/>
            again ask you outright, both to praise those actions of mine in <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            warmer terms than you perhaps feel, and in that respect <lb/>
            to neglect the laws of history. I ask you, too, in regard to <lb/>
            the personal predilection, on which you wrote in a certain <lb/>
            introductory chapter in the most gratifying and explicit <lb/>
            terms-and by which you shew that you were as incapable <lb/>
            of being diverted as Xenophon's Hercules by Pleasure-not <lb/>
            to go against it, but to yield to your affection for me a little <lb/>
            more than truth shall justify. But if I can induce you to un­ <lb/>
            dertake this, you will have, I am persuaded, matter worthy <lb/>
            of your genius and your wealth of language. For from <lb/>
            the beginning of the conspiracy to my return from exile <lb/>
            it appears to me that a moderate-sized monograph might be <lb/>
            composed, in which you will, on the one hand, be able to <lb/>
            utilize your special knowledge of civil disturbances, either in <lb/>
            unravelling the causes of the revolution or in proposing <lb/>
            remedies for evils, blaming meanwhile what you think de­ <lb/>
            serves denunciation, and establishing the righteousness of <lb/>
            what you approve by explaining the principles on which they <lb/>
            rest: and on the other hand, if you think it right to be more <lb/>
            outspoken (as you generally do), you will bring out the <lb/>
            perfidy, intrigues, and treachery of many people towards <lb/>
            me. For my vicissitudes will supply you in your composition <lb/>
            with much variety, which has in itself a kind of charm, <lb/>
            capable of taking a strong hold on the imagination of readers, <lb/>
            when you are the writer. For nothing is better fitted to inter­ <lb/>
            est a reader than variety of circumstance and vicissitudes <lb/>
            of fortune, which, though the reverse of welcome to us in <lb/>
            actual experience, will make very pleasant reading: for the <lb/>
            untroubled recollection of a past sorrow has a charm of its <lb/>
            own. To the rest of the world, indeed, who have had no <lb/>
            trouble themselves, and who look upon the misfortunes of <lb/>
            others without any suffering of their own, the feeling of pity <lb/>
            is itself a source of pleasure. For what man of us is not de­ <lb/>
            lighted, though feeling a certain compassion too, with the <lb/>
            death-scene of Epaminondas at Mantinea? He, you know, <lb/>
            did not allow the dart to be drawn from his body until he had <lb/>
            been told, in answer to his question, that his shield was safe, <lb/>
            so that in spite of the agony of his wound he died calmly and <lb/>
            with glory. Whose interest is not roused and sustained by <lb/>
            the banishment and return of Themistocles ? Truly the mere <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            chronological record of the annals has very little charm for <lb/>
            us—little more than the entries in the fasti: but the doubtful <lb/>
            and varied fortunes of a man, frequently of eminent charac­ <lb/>
            ter, involve feelings of wonder, suspense, joy, sorrow, hope, <lb/>
            fear: if these fortunes are crowned with a glorious death, <lb/>
            the imagination is satisfied with the most fascinating delight <lb/>
            which reading can give. Therefore it will be more in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with my wishes if you come to the resolution to <lb/>
            separate from the main body of your narrative, in which you <lb/>
            embrace a continuance history of events, what I may call <lb/>
            the drama of my actions and fortunes: for it includes varied <lb/>
            acts, and shifting scenes both of policy and circumstance. <lb/>
            Nor am I afraid of appearing to lay snares for your favour <lb/>
            by flattering suggestions, when I declare that I desire to be <lb/>
            complimented and mentioned with praise by you above all <lb/>
            other writers. For you are not the man to be ignorant of <lb/>
            your own powers, or not to be sure that those who withhold <lb/>
            their admiration of you are more to be accounted jealous, <lb/>
            than those who praise you flatterers. Nor, again, am I so <lb/>
            senseless as to wish to be consecrated to an eternity of fame <lb/>
            by one who, in so consecrating me, does not also gain for <lb/>
            himself the glory which right fully belongs to genius. For the <lb/>
            famous Alexander himself did not wish to be painted by <lb/>
            Apelles, and to have his statue made by Lysippus above all <lb/>
            others, merely from personal favour to them, but because he <lb/>
            thought that their art would be a glory at once to them and <lb/>
            to himself. And, indeed, those artists used to make images <lb/>
            of the person known to strangers: but if such had never ex­ <lb/>
            isted, illustrious men would yet be no less illustrious. The <lb/>
            Spartan Agesilaus, who would not allow a portrait of him­ <lb/>
            self to be painted or a statue made, deserves to be quoted as <lb/>
            an example quite as much as those who have taken trouble <lb/>
            about such representations: for a single pamphlet of Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon's in praise of that king has proved much more effective <lb/>
            than all the portraits and statues of them all. And, more­ <lb/>
            over, it will more redound to my present exultation and the <lb/>
            honour of my memory to have found my way into your his­ <lb/>
            tory, than if I had done so into that of others, in this, that <lb/>
            I shall profit not only by the genius of the writer-as Timo­ <lb/>
            leon did by that of Timaeus, Themistocles by that of He­ <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            rodotus—but also by the authority of a man of a most illus­ <lb/>
            trious and well-established character, and one well known <lb/>
            and of the first repute for his conduct in the most important <lb/>
            and weighty matters of state; so that I shall seem to have <lb/>
            gained not only the fame which Alexander on his visit to <lb/>
            Sigeum said had been bestowed on Achilles by Homer, but <lb/>
            also the weighty testimony of a great and illustrious man. <lb/>
            For I like that saying of Hector in Naevius, who not only re­ <lb/>
            joices that he is "praised," but adds, "and by one who has <lb/>
            himself been praised." But if I fail to obtain my request <lb/>
            from you, which is equivalent to saying, if you are by some <lb/>
            means prevented-for I hold it to be out of the question that <lb/>
            you would refuse a request of mine—I shall perhaps be <lb/>
            forced to do what certain persons have often found fault <lb/>
            with, write my own panegyric, a thing, after all, which has a <lb/>
            precedent of many illustrious men. But it will not escape <lb/>
            your notice that there are the following drawbacks in a com­ <lb/>
            position of that sort: men are bound, when writing of them­ <lb/>
            selves, both to speak with greater reserve of what is praise­ <lb/>
            worthy, and to omit what calls for blame. Added to which <lb/>
            such writing carries less conviction, less weight; many people, <lb/>
            in fine, carp at it, and say that the heralds at the public <lb/>
            games are more modest, far after having placed garlands <lb/>
            on the other recipients and proclaimed their names in a loud <lb/>
            voice, when their own turn comes to be presented with a gar­ <lb/>
            land before the games break up, they call in the services of <lb/>
            another herald, that they may not declare themselves victors <lb/>
            with their own voice. I wish to avoid all this, and, if you <lb/>
            undertake my cause, I shall avoid it: and, accordingly, I ask <lb/>
            you this favour. But why, you may well ask, when you have <lb/>
            already often assured me that you intended to record in your <lb/>
            book with the utmost minuteness the policy and events of <lb/>
            my consulship, do I now make this request to you with such <lb/>
            earnestness and in so many words? The reason is to be <lb/>
            found in that burning desire, of which I spoke at the be­ <lb/>
            ginning of my letter, for something prompt: because I am <lb/>
            in a flutter of impatience, both that men should learn what I <lb/>
            am from your book, while I am still alive, and that I may <lb/>
            myself in my lifetime have the full enjoyment of my little <lb/>
            bit of glory. What you intend doing on this subject I should <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            like you to write me word, if not troublesome to you. For if <lb/>
            you do undertake the subject, I will put together some notes <lb/>
            of all occurrences: but if you put me off to some future time, <lb/>
            I will talk the matter over with you. Meanwhile, do not <lb/>
            relax your efforts, and thoroughly polish what you have <lb/>
            already on the stocks, and-continue to love me.</p>

            <title type="sub">XI To M. FADIUS GALLUS ROME (MAY)</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I HAD only just arrived from Arpinum when your letter <lb/>
            was delivered to me; and from the same bearer I received a <lb/>
            letter from Avianius, in which there was this most liberal <lb/>
            offer, that when he came to Rome he would enter my debt <lb/>
            to him on whatever day I chose. Pray put yourself in my <lb/>
            place: is it consistent with your modesty or mine, first to <lb/>
            prefer a request as to the day, and then to ask more than a <lb/>
            yearns credit? But, my dear Gallus, everything would have <lb/>
            been easy, if you had bought the things I wanted, and only <lb/>
            up to the price that I wished. However, the purchases which, <lb/>
            according to your letter, you have made shall not only be <lb/>
            ratified by me, but with gratitude besides: for I fully under­ <lb/>
            stand that you have displayed zeal and affection in purchas­ <lb/>
            ing (because you thought them worthy of me) things which <lb/>
            pleased yourself-a man, as I have ever thought, of the most <lb/>
            fastidious judgment in all matters of taste. Still, I should <lb/>
            like Damasippus to abide by his decision: for there is abso­ <lb/>
            lutely none of those purchases that I care to have. But you, <lb/>
            being unacquainted with my habits, have bought four or five <lb/>
            of your selection at a price at which I do not value any <lb/>
            statues in the world. You compare your Bacchæ with Metel­ <lb/>
            lus's Muses. Where is the likeness? To begin with, I should <lb/>
            never have considered the Muses worth all that money, and <lb/>
            I think all the Muses would have approved my judgment: <lb/>
            still, it would have been appropriate to a library, and in <lb/>
            harmony with my pursuits. But Bacchae! What place is <lb/>
            there in my house for them? But, you will say, they are <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            pretty. I know them very well and have often seem them. <lb/>
            I would have commissioned you definitely in the case of <lb/>
            statues known to me, if I had decided on them. The sort of <lb/>
            statues that I am accustomed to buy are such as may adorn a <lb/>
            place in a palæstra after the fashion of gymnasia. What, <lb/>
            again, have I, the promoter, of peace, to do with a statue of <lb/>
            Mars ? I am glad there was not a statue of Saturn also: for <lb/>
            I should have thought these two statues had brought me <lb/>
            debt! I should have preferred some representation of <lb/>
            Mercury: I might then, I suppose, have made a more <lb/>
            favourable bargain with Arrianus. You say you meant the <lb/>
            table-stand for yourself; well, if you like it, keep it. But if <lb/>
            you have changed your mind I will, of course, have it. For <lb/>
            the money you have laid out, indeed, I would rather have <lb/>
            purchased a place of call at Tarracina, to prevent my being <lb/>
            always a burden on my host. Altogether I perceive that the <lb/>
            fault is with my freedman, whom I had distinctly commis­ <lb/>
            sioned to purchase certain definite things, and also with <lb/>
            Iunius, whom I think you know, an intimate friend of <lb/>
            Avianius. I have constructed some new sitting-rooms in a <lb/>
            miniature colonnade on my Tusculan property. I want to <lb/>
            ornament them with pictures: for if I take pleasure in any­ <lb/>
            thing of that sort it is in painting. However, if I am to <lb/>
            have what you have bought, I should like you to inform me <lb/>
            where they are, when they are to be fetched, and by what <lb/>
            kind of conveyance. For if Damasippus doesn't abide by <lb/>
            his decision, I shall look for some would-be Damasippus, <lb/>
            even at a loss.</p>
          <p>As to what you say about the house, as I was going out <lb/>
            of town I intrusted the matter to my daughter Tullia: for <lb/>
            it was at the very hour of my departure that I got your <lb/>
            letter. I also discussed the matter with your friend Nicias, <lb/>
            because he is, as you know, intimate with Cassius. On my <lb/>
            return, however, before I got your last letter, I asked Tullia <lb/>
            what she had done. She said that she had approached <lb/>
            Licinia (though I think Cassius is not very intimate with <lb/>
            his sister), and that she at once said that she could venture, <lb/>
            in the absence of her husband (Dexius is gone to Spain), <lb/>
            to change houses without his being there and knowing about <lb/>
            it. I am much gratified that you should value association <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            with me and my domestic life so highly, as, in the first place, <lb/>
            to take a house which would enable you to live not only near <lb/>
            me, but absolutely with me, and, in the second place, to be <lb/>
            in such a hurry to make this change of residence. But, <lb/>
            upon my life, I do not yield to you in eagerness for that <lb/>
            arrangement. So I will try every means in my power. For <lb/>
            I see the advantage to myself, and, indeed, the advantages <lb/>
            to us both. If I succeed in doing anything, I will let you <lb/>
            know. Mind you also write me word back on everything, <lb/>
            and let me know, if you please, when I am to expect you.</p>

            <title type="sub">XII To M. MARIUS (AT CUMÆ) ROME (OCTOBER?)</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IF some bodily pain or weakness of health has prevented <lb/>
            your coming to the games, I put it down to fortune rather <lb/>
            than your own wisdom: but if you have made up your mind <lb/>
            that these things which the rest of the world admires are <lb/>
            only worthy of contempt, and, though your health would <lb/>
            have allowed of it, you yet were unwilling to come, then I <lb/>
            rejoice at both facts-that you were free from bodily pain, <lb/>
            and that you had the sound sense to disdain what others <lb/>
            causelessly admire. Only I hope that some fruit of your <lb/>
            leisure may be forthcoming, a leisure, indeed, which you <lb/>
            had a splendid opportunity of enjoying to the full, seeing <lb/>
            that you were left almost alone in your lovely country. For <lb/>
            I doubt not that in that study of yours, from which you have <lb/>
            opened a window into the Stabian waters of the bay, and <lb/>
            obtained a view of Misenum, you have spent the morning <lb/>
            hours of those days in light reading, while those who left <lb/>
            you there were watching the ordinary farces half asleep. <lb/>
            The remaining parts of the day, too, you spent in the <lb/>
            pleasures which you had yourself arranged to suit your own <lb/>
            taste, while we had to endure whatever had met with the <lb/>
            approval of Spurius Maecius. On the whole, if you care to <lb/>
            know, the games were most splendid, but not to your taste. <lb/>
            I judge from my own. For, to begin with, as a special <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            honour to the occasion, those actors had come back to the <lb/>
            stage who, I thought, had left it for their own. Indeed, your <lb/>
            favourite, my friend Æsop, was in such a state that no one <lb/>
            could say a word against his retiring from the profession. <lb/>
            On beginning to recite the oath his voice failed him at the <lb/>
            words " If I knowingly deceive." Why should I go on with <lb/>
            the story? You know all about the rest of the games, which <lb/>
            hadn't even that amount of charm which games on a moderate <lb/>
            scale generally have: for the spectacle was so elaborate as <lb/>
            to leave no room for cheerful enjoyment, and I think you <lb/>
            need feel no regret at having missed it. For what is the <lb/>
            pleasure of a train of six hundred mules in the " Clytem­ <lb/>
            nestra," or three thousand bowls in the " Trojan Horse," or <lb/>
            gay-colored armour of infantry and cavalry in some battle? <lb/>
            These things roused the admiration of the vulgar; to you <lb/>
            they would have brought no delight. But if during those <lb/>
            days you listened to your reader Protogenes, so long at least <lb/>
            as he read anything rather than my speeches, surely you had <lb/>
            far greater pleasure than any one of us. For I don't suppose <lb/>
            you wanted to see Greek or Oscan plays, especially as you <lb/>
            can see Oscan farces in your senate-house over there, while <lb/>
            you are so far from liking Greeks, that you generally won't <lb/>
            even go along the Greek road to your villa Why, again, <lb/>
            should I suppose you to care about missing the athletes, since <lb/>
            you disdained the gladiators ? in which even Pompey himself <lb/>
            confesses that he lost his trouble and his pains. There <lb/>
            remain the two wild-beast hunts, lasting five days, mag­ <lb/>
            nificent-nobody denies it-and yet, what pleasure can it be <lb/>
            to a man of refinement, when either a weak man is torn by <lb/>
            an extremely powerful animal, or a splendid animal is trans- <lb/>
            fixed by a hunting spear? Things which, after all, if worth <lb/>
            seeing, you have often seen before; nor did I, who was <lb/>
            present at the games, see anything the least new. The last <lb/>
            day was that of the elephants, on which there was a great <lb/>
            deal of astonishment on the part of the vulgar crowd, but <lb/>
            no pleasure whatever. Nay, there was even a certain feeling <lb/>
            of compassion aroused by it, and a kind of belief created <lb/>
            that that animal has something in common with mankind. <lb/>
            However, for my part, during this day, while the theatrical <lb/>
            exhibitions were on, lest by chance you should think me too <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            Messed, I almost split my lungs in defending your friend <lb/>
            Caninius Gallus. But if the people were as indulgent to me <lb/>
            as they were to Æsop, I would, by heaven, have been glad <lb/>
            to abandon my profession and live with you and others like <lb/>
            us. The fact is I was tired of it before, even when both <lb/>
            age and ambition stirred me on, and when I could also <lb/>
            decline any defence that I didn't like; but now, with things <lb/>
            in the state that they are, there is no life worth having. <lb/>
            For, on the one hand, I expect no profit of my labor; and, <lb/>
            on the other, I am sometimes forced to defend men who have <lb/>
            been no friends to me, at the request of those to whom I am <lb/>
            under obligations. Accordingly, I am on the look-out for <lb/>
            every excuse for at last managing my life according to my <lb/>
            own taste, and I loudly applaud and vehemently approve both <lb/>
            you and your retired plan of life: and as to your infrequent <lb/>
            appearances among us, I am the more resigned to that be­ <lb/>
            cause, were you in Rome, I should be prevented from enjoy­ <lb/>
            ing the charm of your society, and so would you of mine, if <lb/>
            I have any, by the overpowering nature of my engagements; <lb/>
            from which, if I get any relief-for entire release I don't ex­ <lb/>
            pect—I will give even you, who have been studying nothing <lb/>
            else for many years, some hints as to what it is to live a life <lb/>
            of cultivated enjoyment. Only be careful to nurse your weak <lb/>
            health and to continue your present care of it, so that you <lb/>
            may be able to visit my country houses and make excursions <lb/>
            with me in my litter. I have written you a longer letter than <lb/>
            usual, from superabundance, not of leisure, but of affection, <lb/>
            because, if you remember, you asked me in one of your let­ <lb/>
            ters to write you something to prevent you feeling sorry at <lb/>
            having missed the games. And if I have succeeded in that, I <lb/>
            am glad: if not, I yet console myself with this reflexion, that <lb/>
            in future you will both come to the games and come to see <lb/>
            me, and will not leave your hope of enjoyment dependent on <lb/>
            my letters.</p><pb n="114"/>

          <p>YOUR note by its strong language has drawn out this letter. <lb/>
            For as to what actually occurred on the day of your start, it <lb/>
            supplied me with absolutely no subject for writing. But as <lb/>
            when we are together we are never at a loss for something <lb/>
            to say, so ought our letters at times to digress into loose <lb/>
            chat. Well then, to begin, the liberty of the Tenedians has <lb/>
            received short shrift, no one speaking for them except my­ <lb/>
            self, Bibulus, Calidius, and Favonius. A complimentary ref­ <lb/>
            erence to you was made by the legates from Magnesia and <lb/>
            Sipylum, they saying that you were the man who alone <lb/>
            had resisted the demand of L. Sestius Pansa. On the re­ <lb/>
            maining days of this business in the senate, if anything occurs <lb/>
            which you ought to know, or even if there is nothing, I will <lb/>
            write you something every day. On the 12th I will not fail <lb/>
            you or Pomponius. The poems of Lucretius are as you say­ <lb/>
            with many flashes of genius, yet very technical. But when <lb/>
            you return, ... if you succeed in reading the Empedoclea <lb/>
            of Sallustius, I shall regard you as a hero, yet scarcely <lb/>
            human.</p>

            <title type="sub">XIV To His BROTHER QUINTUS (IN BRITAIN) ARPINUM AND ROME, 28 SEPTEMBER</title>
          </ab>
          <p>AFTER extraordinary hot weather-I never remember <lb/>
            greater heat—I have refreshed myself at Arpinum, and en­ <lb/>
            joyed the extreme loveliness of the river during the days of <lb/>
            the games, having left my tribesmen under the charge of <lb/>
            Philotimus. I was at Arcanum on the loth of September. <lb/>
            There I found Mescidius and Philoxenus, and saw the water, <lb/>
            for which they were making a course not far from your villa, <lb/>
            running quite nicely, especially considering the extreme <lb/>
            drought, and they said they were going to collect it in much <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            greater abundance. Everything is right with Herus. In your <lb/>
            Manilian property I came across Diphilus outdoing himself <lb/>
            in dilatoriness. Still, he had nothing left to construct, except <lb/>
            baths, and a promenade, and an aviary. I liked that villa <lb/>
            very much, because its paved colonnade gives it an air of very <lb/>
            great dignity. I never appreciated this till now that the <lb/>
            colonnade itself has been all laid open, and the columns have <lb/>
            been polished. It all depends-and this I will look to-upon <lb/>
            the stuccoing being prettily done. The pavements seemed to <lb/>
            be being well laid. Certain of the ceilings I did not like, and <lb/>
            ordered them to be changed. As to the place in which they <lb/>
            say that you write word that a small entrance hall is to be <lb/>
            built-namely, in the colonnade-I liked it better as it is. For <lb/>
            I did not think there was space sufficient for an entrance <lb/>
            hall; nor is it usual to have one, except in those buildings <lb/>
            which have a larger court; nor could it have bedrooms and <lb/>
            apartments of that kind attached to it. As it is, from the <lb/>
            very beauty of its arched roof, it will serve as an admirable <lb/>
            summer room. However, if you think differently, write back <lb/>
            word as soon as possible. In the bath I have moved the hot <lb/>
            chamber to the other corner of the dressing-room, because it <lb/>
            was so placed that its steampipe was immediately under the <lb/>
            bedrooms. A fair-sized bed-room and a lofty winter one I <lb/>
            admired very much, for they were both spacious and well­ <lb/>
            situated-on the side of the promenade nearest to the bath. <lb/>
            Diphilus had placed the columns out of the perpendicular, <lb/>
            and not opposite each other. These, of course, he shall take <lb/>
            down; he will learn some day to use the plumb-line and <lb/>
            measure. On the whole, I hope Diphilus's work will be <lb/>
            completed in a few months: for Caesius, who was with me at <lb/>
            the time, keeps a very sharp look-out upon him.</p>
          <p>Thence I started straight along the via Vitularia to your <lb/>
            Fufidianum, the estate which we bought for you a few weeks <lb/>
            ago at Arpinum for 100,000 sesterces (about £800). I never <lb/>
            saw a shadier spot in summer-water springs in many parts <lb/>
            of it, and abundant into the bargain. In short, Caesius <lb/>
            thought that you would easily irrigate fifty iugera of the <lb/>
            meadow land. For my part, I can assure you of this, which <lb/>
            is more in my line, that you will have a villa marvellously <lb/>
            pleasant, with the addition of a fish-pond, spouting fountains, <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            a palæstra, and a shrubbery. I am told that you wish to <lb/>
            keep this Bovillæ estate. You will determine as you think <lb/>
            good. Calvus said that, even if the control of the water <lb/>
            were taken from you, and the right of drawing it off were <lb/>
            established by the vendor, and thus an easement were im­ <lb/>
            posed on that property, we could yet maintain the price in <lb/>
            case we wish to sell. He said that he had agreed with you <lb/>
            to do the work at three sesterces a foot, and that he had <lb/>
            stepped it, and made it three miles. It seemed to me more. <lb/>
            But I will guarantee that the money could nowhere be bet­ <lb/>
            ter laid out. I had sent for Cillo from Venafrum, but on <lb/>
            that very day four of his fellow servants and apprentices <lb/>
            had been crushed by the falling in of a tunnel at Venafrum. <lb/>
            On the 13th of September I was at Laterium. I examined <lb/>
            the road, which appeared to me to be so good as to seem <lb/>
            almost like a high road, except a hundred and fifty paces­ <lb/>
            for I measured it myself from the little bridge at the temple <lb/>
            of Furina, in the direction of Satricum. There they had put <lb/>
            down dust, not gravel (this shall be changed), and that part <lb/>
            of the road is a very steep incline. But I understood that it <lb/>
            could not be taken in any other direction, particularly as you <lb/>
            did not wish it to go through the property of Locusta or <lb/>
            Varro. The latter alone had made the road very well where <lb/>
            it skirted his own property. Locusta hadn't touched it; but <lb/>
            I will call on him at Rome, and think I shall be able to stir <lb/>
            him up, and at the same time I think I shall ask M. Tarus, <lb/>
            who is now at Rome, and whom I am told promised to allow <lb/>
            you to do so, about making a watercourse through his prop­ <lb/>
            erty. I much approved of your steward Nicephorius and I <lb/>
            asked him what orders you had given about that small build­ <lb/>
            ing at Laterium, about which you spoke to me. He told me <lb/>
            in answer that he had himself contracted to do the work <lb/>
            for sixteen sestertia (about £128), but that you had after­ <lb/>
            wards made many additions to the work, but nothing to the <lb/>
            price, and that he had therefore given it up. I quite approve <lb/>
            by Hercules, of your making the additions you had deter­ <lb/>
            mined upon; although the villa as it stands seems to have the <lb/>
            air of a philosopher, meant to rebuke the extravagance of <lb/>
            other villas. Yet, after all, that addition will be pleasing. I <lb/>
            praised your landscape gardener: he has so covered every­ <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            thing with ivy, both the foundation-wall of the villa and the <lb/>
            spaces between the columns of the walk, that, upon my word, <lb/>
            those Greek statues seemed to be engaged in fancy garden­ <lb/>
            ing, and to be shewing off the ivy. Finally, nothing can be <lb/>
            cooler or more mossy than the dressing-room of the bath. <lb/>
            That is about all I have to say about country matters. The <lb/>
            gardener, indeed, as well as Philotimus and Cincius are press­ <lb/>
            ing on the ornamentation of your town house; but I also often <lb/>
            look in upon it myself, as I can do without difficulty. Where­ <lb/>
            fore don't be at all anxious about that.</p>
          <p>As to your always asking me about your son, of course I <lb/>
            " excuse you "; but I must ask you to " excuse " me also, for <lb/>
            I don't allow that you love him more than I do. And oh <lb/>
            that he had been with me these last few days at Arpinum, as <lb/>
            he had himself set his heart on being, and as I had no less <lb/>
            done! As to Pomponia, please write and say that, when I <lb/>
            go out of town anywhere, she is to come with me and bring <lb/>
            the boy. I'll do wonders with him, if I get him to myself <lb/>
            when I am at leisure: for at Rome there is no time to breathe. <lb/>
            You know I formerly promised to do so for nothing. What <lb/>
            do you expect with such a reward as you. promise me? I <lb/>
            now come to your letters which I received in several packets <lb/>
            when I was at Arpinum. For I received three from you in <lb/>
            one day, and, indeed, as it seemed, despatched by you at the <lb/>
            same time-one of considerable length, in which your first <lb/>
            point was that my letter to you was dated earlier than that <lb/>
            to Caesar. Oppius at times cannot help this: the reason is <lb/>
            that, having settled to send letter-carriers, and having re­ <lb/>
            ceived a letter from me, he is hindered by something turn­ <lb/>
            ing up, and obliged to despatch them later than he had in­ <lb/>
            tended; and I don't take the trouble to have the day altered <lb/>
            on a letter which I have once handed to him. You write <lb/>
            about Caesar's extreme affection for us. This affection you <lb/>
            must on your part keep warm, and I for mine will endeavour <lb/>
            to increase it by every means in my power. About Pompey, <lb/>
            I am carefully acting, and shall continue to act, as you <lb/>
            advise. That my permission to you to stay longer is a wel­ <lb/>
            come one, though I grieve at your absence and miss you <lb/>
            exceedingly, I am yet partly glad. What you can be think­ <lb/>
            ing of in sending for such people as Hippodamus and some <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            others, I do not understand. There is not one of those fel­ <lb/>
            lows that won't expect a present from you equal to a sub­ <lb/>
            urban estate. However, there is no reason for your classing <lb/>
            ray friend Trebatius with them. I sent him to Caesar, and <lb/>
            Caesar has done all I expected. If he has not done quite <lb/>
            what he expected himself, I am not bound to make it up to <lb/>
            him, and I in like manner free and absolve you from all <lb/>
            claims on his part. Your remark, that you are a greater <lb/>
            favourite with Caesar every day, is a source of undying sat­ <lb/>
            isfaction to me. As to Balbus, who, as you say, promotes <lb/>
            that state of things, he is the apple of my eye. I am indeed <lb/>
            glad that you and my friend Trebonius like each other. As <lb/>
            to what you say about the military tribuneship, I, indeed, <lb/>
            asked for it definitely for Curtius, and Caesar wrote back <lb/>
            definitely to say that there was one at Curtius's service, and <lb/>
            chided me for my modesty in making the request. If I <lb/>
            have asked one for anyone else-as I told Oppius to write <lb/>
            and tell Cæsar—I shall not be at all annoyed by a refusal, <lb/>
            since those who pester me for letters are annoyed at a re­ <lb/>
            fusal from me. I like Curtius, as I have told him, not only <lb/>
            because you asked me to do so, but from the character you <lb/>
            gave of him; for from your letter I have gathered the zeal <lb/>
            he shewed for my restoration. As for the British expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, I conclude from your letter that we have no occasion <lb/>
            either for fear or exultation. As to public affairs, about <lb/>
            which you wish Tiro to write to you, I have written to you <lb/>
            hitherto somewhat more carelessly than usual, because I <lb/>
            knew that all events, small or great, were reported to Caesar. <lb/>
            I have now answered your longest letter.</p>
          <p>Now hear what I have to say to your small one. The <lb/>
            first point is about Clodius's letter to Caesar. In that matter <lb/>
            I approve of Caesar's policy, in not having given way to <lb/>
            your request so far as to write a single word to that Fury. <lb/>
            The next thing is about the speech of Calventius " Marius." <lb/>
            I am surprised at your saying that you think I ought to an­ <lb/>
            swer it, particularly as, while no one is likely to read that <lb/>
            speech, unless I write an answer to it, every schoolboy <lb/>
            learns mine against him as an exercise. My books, all of <lb/>
            which you are expecting, I have begun, but I cannot finish <lb/>
            them for some days yet The speeches for Scaurus and <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            Plancius which you clamour for I have finished. The poem <lb/>
            to Caesar, which I had begun, I have cut short. I will write <lb/>
            what you ask me for, since your poetic springs are running <lb/>
            dry, as soon as I have time.</p>
          <p>Now for the third letter. It is very pleasant and welcome <lb/>
            news to hear from you that Balbus is soon coming to Rome, <lb/>
            and so well accompanied! and will stay with me continu­ <lb/>
            ously till the 15th of May. As to your exhorting me in the <lb/>
            same letter, as in many previous ones, to ambition and <lb/>
            labour, I shall, of course, do as you say: but when am I to <lb/>
            enjoy any real life?</p>
          <p>Your fourth letter reached me on the 13th of September, <lb/>
            dated on the loth of August from Britain. In it there was <lb/>
            nothing new except about your Erigona, and if I get that <lb/>
            from Oppius I will write and tell you what I think of it. I <lb/>
            have no doubt I shall like it. Oh yes! I had almost for­ <lb/>
            gotten to remark as to the man who, you say in your letter, <lb/>
            had written to Caesar about the applause given to Milo— <lb/>
            I am not unwilling that Caesar should think that it was as <lb/>
            warm as possible. And in point of fact it was so, and yet <lb/>
            that applause, which is given to him, seems in a certain <lb/>
            sense to be given to me.</p>
          <p>I have also received a very old letter, but which was late <lb/>
            in coming into my hands, in which you remind me about the <lb/>
            temple of Tellus and the colonnade of Catulus. Both of these <lb/>
            matters are being actively carried out. At the temple of <lb/>
            Tellus I have even got your statue placed. So, again, as to <lb/>
            your reminder about a suburban villa and gardens, I was <lb/>
            never very keen for one, and now my town house has all the <lb/>
            charm of such a pleasure-ground. On my arrival in Rome on <lb/>
            the 18th of September I found the roof on your house fin­ <lb/>
            ished: the part over the sitting-rooms, which you did not <lb/>
            wish to have many gables, now slopes gracefully towards <lb/>
            the roof of the lower colonnade. Our boy, in my absence, <lb/>
            did not cease working with his rhetoric master. You have no <lb/>
            reason for being anxious about his education, for you know <lb/>
            his ability, and I see his application. Everything else I take <lb/>
            it upon myself to guarantee, with full consciousness that I <lb/>
            am bound to make it good.</p>
          <p>As yet there are three parties prosecuting Gabinius: first, <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            L. Lentulus, son of the flamen, who has entered a prosecution <lb/>
            for lèse majesté; secondly, Tib. Nero with good names at the <lb/>
            back of his indictment; thirdly, C. Memmius the tribune in <lb/>
            conjunction with L. Capito. He came to the walls of the <lb/>
            city on the loth of September, undignified and neglected to <lb/>
            the last degree. But in the present state of the law courts <lb/>
            I do not venture to be confident of anything. As Cato is <lb/>
            unwell, he has not yet been formally indicted for extortion. <lb/>
            Pompey is trying hard to persuade me to be reconciled to <lb/>
            him, but as yet he has not yet succeeded at all, nor, if I retain <lb/>
            a shred of liberty, will he succeed. I am very anxious for a <lb/>
            letter from you. You say that you have been told that I was <lb/>
            a party to the coalition of the consular candidates-it is a lie. <lb/>
            The compacts made in that coalition afterwards made public <lb/>
            by Memmius, were of such a nature that no loyal man ought <lb/>
            to have been a party to them; nor at the same time was it <lb/>
            possible for me to be a party to a coalition from which <lb/>
            Messalla was excluded, who is thoroughly satisfied with my <lb/>
            conduct in every particular, as also, I think, is Memmius. To <lb/>
            Domitius himself I have rendered many services which he <lb/>
            desired and asked of me. I have put Scaurus under a <lb/>
            heavy obligation by my defence of him. It is as yet very <lb/>
            uncertain both when the elections will be and who will be <lb/>
            consuls.</p>
          <p>Just as I was folding up this epistle letter-carriers arrived <lb/>
            from you and Caesar (20th September) after a journey of <lb/>
            twenty days. How anxious I was! How painfully I was <lb/>
            affected by Cæsar’s most kind letter! But the kinder it was, <lb/>
            the more sorrow did his loss occasion me. But to turn to <lb/>
            your letter. To begin with, I reiterate my approval of your <lb/>
            staying on, especially as, according to your account, you have <lb/>
            consulted Caesar on the subject. I wonder that Oppius has <lb/>
            anything to do with Publius for I advised against it. Farther <lb/>
            on in your letter you say that I am going to be made legatus <lb/>
            to Pompey on the 13th of September: I have heard nothing <lb/>
            about it, and I wrote to Caesar to tell him that neither Vibul­ <lb/>
            lius nor Oppius had delivered his message to Pompey about <lb/>
            my remaining at home. Why, I know not. However, it was <lb/>
            I who restrained Oppius from doing so, because it was Vibul­ <lb/>
            lius who should take the leading part in that matter: for <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            with him Caesar had communicated personally, with Oppius <lb/>
            only by letter. I indeed can have no " second thoughts " in <lb/>
            matters connected with Caesar. He comes next after you and <lb/>
            our children in my regard, and not much after. I think I act <lb/>
            in this with deliberate judgment, for I have by this time good <lb/>
            cause for it, yet warm personal feeling no doubt does influ­ <lb/>
            ence me also.</p>
          <p>Just as I had written these last words—which are by my <lb/>
            own hand-your boy came in to dine with me, as Pomponia <lb/>
            was dining out. He gave me your letter to read, which he <lb/>
            had received shortly before-a truly Aristophanic mixture of <lb/>
            jest and earnest, with which I was greatly charmed. He gave <lb/>
            me also your second letter, in which you bid him cling to my <lb/>
            side as a mentor. How delighted he was with those letters! <lb/>
            And so was I. Nothing could be more attractive than that <lb/>
            boy, nothing more affectionate to me!—This, to explain its <lb/>
            being in another handwriting, I dictated to Tiro while at <lb/>
            dinner.</p>
          <p>Your letter gratified Annalis very much, as shewing that <lb/>
            you took an active interest in his concerns, and yet assisted <lb/>
            him with exceedingly candid advice. Publius Servilius the <lb/>
            elder, from a letter which he said he had received from <lb/>
            Caesar, declares himself highly obliged to you for having <lb/>
            spoken with the greatest kindness and earnestness of his <lb/>
            devotion to Caesar. After my return to Rome from Arpinum <lb/>
            I was told that Hippodamus had started to join you. I <lb/>
            cannot say that I was surprised at his having acted so dis­ <lb/>
            courteously as to start to join you without a letter from me: <lb/>
            I only say that, that I was annoyed. For I had long re­ <lb/>
            solved, from an expression in your letter, that if I had any­ <lb/>
            thing I wished conveyed to you with more than usual care, I <lb/>
            should give it to him: for, in truth, into a letter like this, <lb/>
            which I send you in an ordinary way, I usually put nothing <lb/>
            that, if it fell into certain hands, might be a source of an­ <lb/>
            noyance. I reserve myself for Minucius and Salvius and <lb/>
            Labeo. Labeo will either be starting late or will stay here <lb/>
            altogether. Hippodamus did not even ask me whether he <lb/>
            could do anything for me. T. Penarius sends me a kind <lb/>
            letter about you: says that he is exceedingly charmed with <lb/>
            your literary pursuits, conversation, and above all by your <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            dinners. He was always a favourite of mine, and I see a <lb/>
            good deal of his brother. Wherefore continue, as you have <lb/>
            begun, to admit the young man to your intimacy.</p>
          <p>From the fact of this letter having been in hand during <lb/>
            many days, owing to the delay of the letter-carriers, I have <lb/>
            jotted down in it many various things at odd times, as, for <lb/>
            instance, the following: Titus Anicius has mentioned to me <lb/>
            more than once that he would not hesitate to buy a suburban <lb/>
            property for you, if he found one. In these remarks of his I <lb/>
            find two things surprising: first, that when you write to him <lb/>
            about buying a suburban property, you not only don't write <lb/>
            to me to that effect, but write even in a contrary sense; and, <lb/>
            secondly, that in writing to him you totally forget his letters <lb/>
            which you shewed me at Tusculum, and as totally the rule <lb/>
            of Epicharmus, " Notice how he has treated another": in <lb/>
            fact, that you have quite forgotten, as I think, the lesson <lb/>
            conveyed by the expression of his face, his conversation, and <lb/>
            his spirit. But this is your concern. As to a suburban prop­ <lb/>
            erty, be sure to let me know your wishes, and at the same <lb/>
            time take care that that fellow doesn't get you into trouble. <lb/>
            What else have I to say? Anything? Yes, there is this: <lb/>
            Gabinius entered the city by night on the 27th of September, <lb/>
            and to-day, at two o'clock, when he ought to have appeared <lb/>
            on his trial for lèse majesté, in accordance with the edict <lb/>
            of C. Alfius, he was all but crushed to the earth by a great <lb/>
            and unanimous demonstration of the popular hatred. Noth­ <lb/>
            ing could exceed his humiliating position. However, Piso <lb/>
            comes next to him. So I think of introducing a marvellous <lb/>
            episode into my second book-Apollo declaring in the coun­ <lb/>
            cil of the gods what sort of return that of the two com­ <lb/>
            manders was to be, one of whom had lost, and the other <lb/>
            sold his army. From Britain I have a letter of Cæsar’s <lb/>
            dated the 1st of September, which reached me on the 27th, <lb/>
            satisfactory enough as far as the British expedition is con­ <lb/>
            cerned, in which, to prevent my wondering at not getting one <lb/>
            from you, he tells me that you were not with him when he <lb/>
            reached the coast. To that letter I made no reply, not even <lb/>
            a formal congratulation, on account of his mourning. Many. <lb/>
            many wishes, dear brother, for your health.</p><pb n="123"/>

            <title type="sub">XV To P. LENTULUS SPINTHER (IN CILICIA) ROME (OCTOBER)</title>
          </ab>
          <p>M. CICERO desires his warmest regards to P. Lentulus, <lb/>
            imperator. Your letter was very gratifying to me, from <lb/>
            which I gathered that you fully appreciated my devotion to <lb/>
            you: for why use the word kindness, when even the word <lb/>
            "devotion" itself, with all its solemn and holy associations, <lb/>
            seems too weak to express my obligations to you? As for <lb/>
            your saying that my services to you are gratefully accepted, <lb/>
            it is you who in your overflowing affection make things, <lb/>
            which cannot be omitted without criminal negligence, appear <lb/>
            deserving of even gratitude. However, my feelings towards <lb/>
            you would have been much more fully known and con­ <lb/>
            spicuous, if, during all this time that we have been separated, <lb/>
            we had been together, and together at Rome. For precisely <lb/>
            in what you declare your intention of doing-what no one is <lb/>
            more capable of doing, and what I confidently look forward <lb/>
            to from you-that is to say, in speaking in the senate, and <lb/>
            in every department of public life and political activity, we <lb/>
            should together have been in a very strong position (what <lb/>
            my feelings and position are in regard to politics I will <lb/>
            explain shortly, and will answer the questions you ask), and <lb/>
            at any rate I should have found in you a supporter, at once <lb/>
            most warmly attached and endowed with supreme wisdom, <lb/>
            while in me you would have found an adviser, perhaps not <lb/>
            the most unskilful in the world, and at least both faithful and <lb/>
            devoted to your interests. However, for your own sake, of <lb/>
            course, I rejoice, as I am bound to do, that you have been <lb/>
            greeted with the title of imperator, and are holding your pro­ <lb/>
            vince and victorious army after a successful campaign. But <lb/>
            certainly, if you had been here, you would have enjoyed to a <lb/>
            fuller extent and more directly the benefit of the services <lb/>
            which I am bound to render you. Moreover, in taking <lb/>
            vengeance on those whom you know in some cases to be your <lb/>
            enemies, because you championed the cause of my recall, in <lb/>
            others to be jealous of the splendid position and renown <lb/>
            which that measure brought you, I should have done you <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            yeoman's service as your associate. However, that per­ <lb/>
            petual enemy of his own friends, who, in spite of having <lb/>
            been honoured with the highest compliments on your part, <lb/>
            has selected you of all people for the object of his impotent <lb/>
            and enfeebled violence, has saved me the trouble by punish­ <lb/>
            ing himself. For he has made attempts, the disclosure of <lb/>
            which has left him without a shred, not only of political <lb/>
            position, but even of freedom of action. And though I <lb/>
            should have preferred that you should have gained your <lb/>
            experience in my case alone, rather than in your own also, <lb/>
            yet in the midst of my regret I am glad that you have learnt <lb/>
            what the fidelity of mankind is worth, at no great cost to <lb/>
            yourself, which I learnt at the price of excessive pain. And <lb/>
            I think that I have now an opportunity presented me, while <lb/>
            answering the questions you have addressed to me, of also <lb/>
            explaining my entire position and view. You say in your <lb/>
            letter that you have been informed that I have become recon­ <lb/>
            ciled to Caesar and Appius, and you add that you have no <lb/>
            fault to find with that. But you express a wish to know <lb/>
            what induced me to defend and compliment Vatinius,. In <lb/>
            order to make my explanation plainer I must go a little <lb/>
            farther back in the statement of my policy and its grounds.</p>
          <p>Well, Lentulus t At first—after the success of your efforts <lb/>
            for my recall-I looked upon myself as having been re­ <lb/>
            stored not alone to my friends, but to the Republic also; <lb/>
            and seeing that I owed you an affection almost surpassing <lb/>
            belief, and every kind of service, however great and rare, <lb/>
            that could be bestowed on your person, I thought that to <lb/>
            the Republic, which had much assisted you in restoring me, <lb/>
            I at least was bound to entertain the feeling which I had <lb/>
            in old times shewed merely from the duty incumbent on <lb/>
            all citizens alike, and not as an obligation incurred by some <lb/>
            special kindness to myself. That these were my sentiments <lb/>
            I declared to the senate when you were consul, and you <lb/>
            had yourself a full view of them in our conversations and <lb/>
            discussions. Yet from the very first my feelings were hurt <lb/>
            by many circumstances, when, on your mooting the question <lb/>
            of the full restoration of my position, I detected the covert <lb/>
            hatred of some and the equivocal attachment of others. <lb/>
            For you received no support from either in regard to my <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            monuments, or the illegal violence by which, in common <lb/>
            with my brother, I had been driven from my house; nor, <lb/>
            by heaven, did they shew the goodwill which I had ex­ <lb/>
            pected in regard to those matters which, though necessary <lb/>
            to me owing to the shipwreck of my fortune, were yet re­ <lb/>
            garded by me as least valuable-I mean as to indemnifying <lb/>
            me for my losses by decree of the senate. And though I <lb/>
            saw all this-for it was not difficult to see-yet their present <lb/>
            conduct did not affect me with so much bitterness as what <lb/>
            they had done for me did with gratitude. And therefore, <lb/>
            though according to your own assertion and testimony I was <lb/>
            under very great obligation to Pompey, and though I loved <lb/>
            him not only for his kindness, but also from my own feelings, <lb/>
            and, so to speak, from my unbroken admiration of him, <lb/>
            nevertheless, without taking any account of his wishes, I <lb/>
            abode by all my old opinions in politics. With Pompey <lb/>
            sitting in court, upon his having entered the city to give <lb/>
            evidence in favour of Sestius, and when the witness Vatinius <lb/>
            had asserted that, moved by the good fortune and success <lb/>
            of Caesar, I had begun to be his friend, I said that I pre­ <lb/>
            ferred the fortune of Bibulus, which he thought a humilia­ <lb/>
            tion, to the triumphs and victories of everybody else; and <lb/>
            I said during the examination of the same witness, in an­ <lb/>
            other part of my speech, that the same men had prevented <lb/>
            Bibulus from leaving his house as had forced me from mine: <lb/>
            my whole cross-examination, indeed, was nothing but a <lb/>
            denunciation of his tribuneship; and in it I spoke throughout <lb/>
            with the greatest freedom and spirit about violence, neglect <lb/>
            of omens, grants of royal titles. Nor, indeed, in the support <lb/>
            of this view is it only of late that I have spoken: I have <lb/>
            done so consistently on several occasions in the senate. Nay. <lb/>
            even in the consulship of Marcellinus and Philippus, on <lb/>
            the 5th of April the senate voted on my motion that the <lb/>
            question of the Campanian land should be referred to a full <lb/>
            meeting of the senate on the 15th of May. Could I more <lb/>
            decidedly invade the stronghold of his policy, or shew more <lb/>
            clearly that I forgot my own present interests, and re­ <lb/>
            membered my former political career? On my delivery of <lb/>
            this proposal a great impression was made on the minds <lb/>
            not only of those who were bound to have been impressed, <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            but also of those of whom I had never expected it. For, <lb/>
            after this decree had passed in accordance with my motion, <lb/>
            Pompey, without shewing the least sign of being offended <lb/>
            with me, started for Sardinia and Africa, and in the course <lb/>
            of that journey visited Caesar at Luca. There Caesar com­ <lb/>
            plained a great deal about my motion, for he had already <lb/>
            seen Crassus at Ravenna also, and had been irritated by <lb/>
            him against me. It was well known that Pompey was much <lb/>
            vexed at this, as I was told by others, but learnt most defi­ <lb/>
            nitely from my brother. For when Pompey met him in Sar­ <lb/>
            dinia, a few days after leaving Luca, he said: " You are <lb/>
            the very man I want to see; nothing could have happened <lb/>
            more conveniently. Unless you speak very strongly to your <lb/>
            brother Marcus, you will have to pay up what you guar­ <lb/>
            anteed on his behalf." I need not go on. He grumbled a <lb/>
            great deal: mentioned his own service to me: recalled what <lb/>
            he had again and again said to my brother himself about <lb/>
            the "acts" of Caesar, and what my brother had undertaken <lb/>
            in regard to me; and called my brother himself to witness <lb/>
            that what he had done in regard to my recall he had done <lb/>
            with the consent of Caesar: and asked him to commend to <lb/>
            me the latter's policy and claims, that I should not attack, <lb/>
            even if I would not or could not support them. My brother <lb/>
            having conveyed these remarks to me, and Pompey having, <lb/>
            nevertheless, sent Vibullius to me with a message, begging <lb/>
            me not to commit myself on the question of the Campanian <lb/>
            land till his return, I reconsidered my position and begged <lb/>
            the state itself, as it were, to allow me, who had suffered <lb/>
            and done so much for it, to fulfil the duty which gratitude <lb/>
            to my benefactors and the pledge which my brother had <lb/>
            given demanded, and to suffer one whom it had ever re­ <lb/>
            garded as an honest citizen to shew himself an honest man. <lb/>
            Moreover, in regard to all those motions and speeches of <lb/>
            mine which appeared to be giving offence to Pompey, the <lb/>
            remarks of a particular set of men, whose names you must <lb/>
            surely guess, kept on being reported to me; who, while <lb/>
            in public affairs they were really in sympathy with my policy, <lb/>
            and had always been so, yet said that they were glad that <lb/>
            Pompey was dissatisfied with me, and that Caesar would be <lb/>
            very greatly exasperated against me. This in itself was <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            Vexatious to me: but much more so was the fact that they <lb/>
            used, before my very eyes, so to embrace, fondle, make much <lb/>
            of, and kiss my enemy-mine do I say? rather the enemy <lb/>
            of the laws, of the law courts, of peace, of his country, of <lb/>
            all loyal men!—that they did not indeed rouse my bile, for <lb/>
            I have utterly lost all that, but imagined they did. In these <lb/>
            circumstances, having, as far as is possible for human pru­ <lb/>
            dence, thoroughly examined my whole position, and having <lb/>
            balanced the items of the account, I arrived at a final result <lb/>
            of all my reflexions, which, as well as I can, I will now <lb/>
            briefly put before you.</p>
          <p>If I had seen the Republic in the hands of bad or prof­ <lb/>
            ligate citizens, as we know happened during the supremacy <lb/>
            of Cinna, and on some other occasions, I should not under <lb/>
            the pressure, I don't say of rewards, which are the last <lb/>
            things to influence me, but even of danger, by which, after <lb/>
            all, the bravest men are moved, have attached myself to their <lb/>
            party, not even if their services to me had been of the very <lb/>
            highest kind. As it is, seeing that the leading statesman <lb/>
            in the Republic was Pompey, a man who had gained this <lb/>
            power and renown by the most eminent services to the state <lb/>
            and the most glorious achievements, and one of whose <lb/>
            position I had been a supporter from my youth up, and in <lb/>
            my praetorship and consulship an active promoter also, and <lb/>
            seeing that this same statesman had assisted me, in his own <lb/>
            person by the weight of his influence and the expression of <lb/>
            his opinion, and, in conjunction with you, by his counsels <lb/>
            and zeal, and that he regarded my enemy as his own su­ <lb/>
            preme enemy in the state-I did not think that I need fear <lb/>
            the reproach of inconsistency, if in some of my senatorial <lb/>
            votes I somewhat changed my standpoint, and contributed <lb/>
            my zeal to the promotion of the dignity of a most distin­ <lb/>
            guished man, and one to whom I am under the highest <lb/>
            obligations. In this sentiment I had necessarily to include <lb/>
            Caesar, as you see, for their policy and position were in­ <lb/>
            separably united. Here I was greatly influenced by two <lb/>
            things-the old friendship which you know that I and my <lb/>
            brother Quintus have had with Caesar, and his own kindness <lb/>
            and liberality, of which we have recently had clear and un­ <lb/>
            mistakable evidence both by his letters and his personal <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            attentions. I wa9 also strongly affected by the Republic <lb/>
            itself, which appeared to me to demand, especially consider­ <lb/>
            ing Cæsar’s brilliant successes, that there should be no <lb/>
            quarrel maintained with these men, and indeed to forbid <lb/>
            it in the strongest manner possible. Moreover, while en­ <lb/>
            tertaining these feelings, I was above all shaken by the <lb/>
            pledge which Pompey had given for me to Caesar, and my <lb/>
            brother to Pompey. Besides, I was forced to take into <lb/>
            consideration the state maxim so divinely expressed by our <lb/>
            master Plato—“ Such as are the chief men in a republic, <lb/>
            such are ever wont to be the other citizens." I called to <lb/>
            mind tEat in my consulship, from the very ist of January, <lb/>
            such a foundation was laid of encouragement for the senate, <lb/>
            that no one ought to have been surprised that on the 5th <lb/>
            of December there was so much spirit and such commanding <lb/>
            influence in that house. I also remember that when I be­ <lb/>
            came a private citizen up to the consulship of Caesar and <lb/>
            Bibulus, when the opinions expressed by me had great <lb/>
            weight in the senate, the feeling among all the loyalists was <lb/>
            invariable. Afterwards, while you were holding the prov­ <lb/>
            ince of hither Spain with imperium and the Republic had no <lb/>
            genuine consuls, but mere hucksters of provinces, mere <lb/>
            slaves and agents of sedition, an accident threw my head <lb/>
            as an apple of discord into the midst of contending factions <lb/>
            and civil broils. And in that hour of danger, though a <lb/>
            unanimity was displayed on the part of the senate that was <lb/>
            surprising, on the part of all Italy surpassing belief, and of <lb/>
            all the loyalists unparalleled, in standing forth in my defence, <lb/>
            I will not say what happened-for the blame attaches to <lb/>
            many, and is of various shades of turpitude—I will only <lb/>
            say briefly that it was not the rank and file, but the leaders, <lb/>
            that played me false. And in this matter, though some <lb/>
            blame does attach to those who failed to defend me, no less <lb/>
            attaches to those who abandoned me: and if those who were <lb/>
            frightened deserve reproach, if there are such, still more <lb/>
            are those to be blamed who pretended to be frightened. At <lb/>
            any rate, my policy is justly to be praised for refusing to <lb/>
            allow my fellow citizens (preserved by me and ardently de­ <lb/>
            siring to preserve me) to be exposed while bereft of leaders <lb/>
            to armed slaves, and for preferring that it should be made <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            manifest how much force there might be in the unanimity <lb/>
            of the loyalists, if they had been permitted to champion my <lb/>
            cause before I had fallen, when after that fall they had <lb/>
            proved strong enough to raise me up again. And the real <lb/>
            feelings of these men you not only had the penetration to <lb/>
            see, when bringing forward my case, but the power to en­ <lb/>
            courage and keep alive. In promoting which measure-I <lb/>
            will not merely not deny, but shall always remember also <lb/>
            and gladly proclaim it—you found certain men of the <lb/>
            highest rank more courageous in securing my restoration <lb/>
            than they had been in preserving me from my fall: and, <lb/>
            if they had chosen to maintain that frame of mind, they <lb/>
            would have recovered their own commanding position along <lb/>
            with my salvation. For when the spirit of the loyalists had <lb/>
            been renewed by your consulship, and they had been roused <lb/>
            from their dismay by the extreme firmness and rectitude of <lb/>
            your official conduct; when, above all, Pompey's support had <lb/>
            been secured; and when Caesar, too, with all the prestige <lb/>
            of his brilliant achievements, after being honoured with <lb/>
            unique and unprecedented marks of distinction and com­ <lb/>
            pliments by the senate, was now supporting the dignity of <lb/>
            the house, there could have been no opportunity for a dis­ <lb/>
            loyal citizen of outraging the Republic.</p>
          <p>But now notice, I beg, what actually ensued. First of <lb/>
            all, that intruder upon the women's rites, who had shewn no <lb/>
            more respect for the Bona Dea than for his three sisters, <lb/>
            secured immunity by the votes of those men who, when a <lb/>
            tribune wished by a legal action to exact penalties from a <lb/>
            seditious citizen by the agency of the loyalists, deprived <lb/>
            the Republic of what would have been hereafter a most <lb/>
            splendid precedent for the punishment of sedition. And <lb/>
            these same persons, in the case of the monument, which was <lb/>
            not mine, indeed-for it was not erected from the proceeds <lb/>
            of spoils won by me, and I had nothing to do with it <lb/>
            beyond giving out the contract for its construction-well, <lb/>
            they allowed this monument of the senators to have branded <lb/>
            upon it the name of a public enemy, and an inscription <lb/>
            written in blood. That those men wished my safety rouses <lb/>
            my liveliest gratitude, but I could have wished that they <lb/>
            had not chosen to take my bare safety into consideration, <note type="footnote"> 5—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            like doctors, but, like trainers, my strength and complexion <lb/>
            also! As it is, just as Apelles perfected the head and bust <lb/>
            of his Venus with the most elaborate art, but left the rest of <lb/>
            her body in the rough, so certain persons only took pains <lb/>
            with my head, and left the rest of my body unfinished and <lb/>
            unworked. Yet in this matter I have falsified the expec­ <lb/>
            tation, not only of the jealous, but also of the downright hos­ <lb/>
            tile, who formerly conceived a wrong opinion from the case <lb/>
            of Quintus Metellus, son of Lucius—the most energetic and <lb/>
            gallant man in the world, and in my opinion of surpassing <lb/>
            courage and firmness-who, people say, was much cast down <lb/>
            and dispirited after his return from exile. Now, in the first <lb/>
            place, we are asked to believe that a man who accepted exile <lb/>
            with entire willingness and remarkable cheerfulness, and <lb/>
            never took any pains at all to get recalled, was crushed in <lb/>
            spirit about an affair in whicH he had shewn more firmness <lb/>
            and constancy than anyone else, even than the pre-eminent <lb/>
            M. Scaurus himself! But, again, the account they had re­ <lb/>
            ceived, or rather the conjectures they were indulging in <lb/>
            about him, they now transferred to me, imagining that I <lb/>
            should be more than usually broken in spirit: whereas, in <lb/>
            fact, the Republic was inspiring me with even greater <lb/>
            courage than I had ever had before, by making it plain that <lb/>
            I was the one citizen it could not do without; and by the <lb/>
            fact that while a bill proposed by only one tribune had re­ <lb/>
            called Metellus, the whole state had joined as one man in <lb/>
            recalling me—the senate leading the way, the whole of Italy <lb/>
            following after, eight of the tribunes publishing the bill, a <lb/>
            consul putting the question at the centuriate assembly, all <lb/>
            orders and individuals pressing it on, in fact, with all the <lb/>
            forces at its command. Nor is it the case that I afterwards <lb/>
            made any pretension, or am making any at this day, which <lb/>
            can justly offend anyone, even the most malevolent: my <lb/>
            only effort is that I may not fail either my friends or those <lb/>
            more remotely connected with me in either active service, <lb/>
            or counsel, or personal exertion. This course of life per­ <lb/>
            haps offends those who fix their eyes on the glitter and show <lb/>
            of my professional position, but are unable to appreciate <lb/>
            its anxieties and laboriousness.</p>
          <p>Again, they make no concealment of their dissatisfaction <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            on the ground that in the speeches which I make in the <lb/>
            senate in praise of Caesar I am departing from my old policy. <lb/>
            But while giving explanations on the points which I put <lb/>
            before you a short time ago, I will not keep till the last the <lb/>
            following, which I have already touched upon. You will <lb/>
            not find, my dear Lentulus, the sentiments of the loyalists <lb/>
            the same as you left them-strengthened by my consulship, <lb/>
            suffering relapse at intervals afterwards, crushed down be­ <lb/>
            fore your consulship, revived by you: they have now been <lb/>
            abandoned by those whose duty it was to have maintained <lb/>
            them: and this fact they, who in the old state of things as it <lb/>
            existed in our day used to be called Optimates, not only <lb/>
            declare by look and expression of countenance, by which a <lb/>
            false pretence is easiest supported, but have proved again <lb/>
            and again by their actual sympathies and votes. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, the entire view and aim of wise citizens, such as I <lb/>
            wish both to be and to be reckoned, must needs have under­ <lb/>
            gone a change. For that is the maxim of that same great <lb/>
            Plato, whom I emphatically regard as my master: "Main­ <lb/>
            tain a political controversy only so far as you can convince <lb/>
            your fellow citizens of its justice: never offer violence to <lb/>
            parent or fatherland." He, it is true, alleges this as his <lb/>
            motive for having abstained from politics, because, having <lb/>
            found the Athenian people all but in its dotage, and seeing <lb/>
            that it could not be ruled by persuasion, or by anything short <lb/>
            of compulsion, while he doubted the possibility of persuasion, <lb/>
            he looked upon compulsion as criminal. My position was <lb/>
            different in this: as the people was not in its dotage, nor <lb/>
            the question of engaging in politics still an open one for <lb/>
            me, I was bound hand and foot. Yet I rejoiced that I was <lb/>
            permitted in one and the same cause to support a policy at <lb/>
            once advantageous to myself and acceptable to every loyalist. <lb/>
            An additional motive was Caesar's memorable and almost <lb/>
            superhuman kindness to myself and my brother, who thus <lb/>
            would have deserved my support whatever he undertook; <lb/>
            while as it is, considering his great success and his brilliant <lb/>
            victories, he would seem, even if he had not behaved to me <lb/>
            as he has, to claim a panegyric from me. For I would have <lb/>
            you believe that, putting you aside, who were the authors of <lb/>
            my recall, there is no one by whose good offices I would <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            not only confess, but would even rejoice, to have been so <lb/>
            much bound.</p>
          <p>Having explained this matter to you, the questions you <lb/>
            ask about Vatinius and Crassus are easy to answer. For, <lb/>
            since you remark about Appius, as about Caesar, "that you <lb/>
            have no fault to find," I can only say that I am glad you <lb/>
            approve my policy. But as to Vatinius, in the first place <lb/>
            there had been in the interval a reconciliation effected <lb/>
            through Pompey, immediately after his election to the <lb/>
            praetorship, though I had, it is true, impugned his candida­ <lb/>
            ture in some very strong speeches in the senate, and yet not <lb/>
            so much for the sake of attacking him as of defending and <lb/>
            complimenting Cato. Again, later on, there followed a very <lb/>
            pressing request from Caesar that I should undertake his <lb/>
            defence. But my reason for testifying to his character I <lb/>
            beg you will not ask, either in the case of this defendant or <lb/>
            of others, lest I retaliate by asking you the same question <lb/>
            when you come home: though I can do so even before you <lb/>
            return: for remember for whom you sent a certificate of <lb/>
            character from the ends of the earth. However, don't be <lb/>
            afraid, for those same persons are praised by myself, and <lb/>
            will continue to be so. Yet, after all, there was also the <lb/>
            motive spurring me on to undertake his defence, of which, <lb/>
            during the trial, when I appeared for him, I remarked that <lb/>
            I was doing just what the parasite in the Eunuchus advised <lb/>
            the captain to do: <lb/>
            "As oft as she names Phaedria, you retort <lb/>
            With Pamphila. If ever she suggest, <lb/>
            'Do let us have in Phædria to our revel:' <lb/>
            Quoth you, 'And let us call on Pamphila <lb/>
            To sing a song.' If she shall praise his looks, <lb/>
            Do you praise hers to match them: and, in fine, <lb/>
            Give tit for tat, that you may sting her soul." <lb/>
            So I asked the jurors, since certain men of high rank, who. <lb/>
            had also done me very great favours, were much enamoured <lb/>
            of my enemy, and often under my very eyes in the senate <lb/>
            now took him aside in grave consultation, now embraced him <lb/>
            familiarly and cheerfully—since these men had their Publius, <lb/>
            to grant me another Publius, in whose person I might repay <lb/>
            a slight attack by a moderate retort. And, indeed, I am <lb/>
            often as good as my word, with the applause of gods and <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            men. So much for Vatinius. Now about Crassus. I thought <lb/>
            I had done much to secure his gratitude in having, for the <lb/>
            sake of the general harmony, wiped out by a kind of volun­ <lb/>
            tary act of oblivion all his very serious injuries, when he <lb/>
            suddenly undertook the defence of Gabinius, whom only a <lb/>
            few days before he had attacked with the greatest bitterness. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, I should have borne that, if he had done so <lb/>
            without casting any offensive reflexions on me. But on <lb/>
            his attacking me, though I was only arguing and not in­ <lb/>
            veighing against him, I fired up not only, I think, with the <lb/>
            passion of the moment-for that perhaps would not have <lb/>
            been so hot-but the smothered wrath at his many wrongs <lb/>
            to me, of which I thought I had wholly got rid, having, <lb/>
            unconsciously to myself, lingered in my soul, it suddenly <lb/>
            shewed itself in full force. And it was at this precise time <lb/>
            that certain persons (the same whom I frequently indicate <lb/>
            by a sign or hint), while declaring that they had much en­ <lb/>
            joyed my outspoken style, and had never before fully realized <lb/>
            that I was restored to the Republic in all my old character, <lb/>
            and when my conduct of that controversy had gained me <lb/>
            much credit outside the house also, began saying that they <lb/>
            were glad both that he was now my enemy, and that those <lb/>
            who were involved with him would never be my friends. So <lb/>
            when their ill-natured remarks were reported to me by men <lb/>
            of most respectable character, and when Pompey pressed <lb/>
            me as he had never done before to be reconciled to Crassus, <lb/>
            and Caesar wrote to say that he was exceedingly grieved at <lb/>
            that quarrel, I took into consideration not only my circum­ <lb/>
            stances, but my natural inclination: and Crassus, that our <lb/>
            reconciliation might, as it were, be attested to the Roman <lb/>
            people, started for his province, it might almost be said, from <lb/>
            my hearth. For he himself named a day and dined with me <lb/>
            in the suburban villa of my son-in-law Crassipes. On this <lb/>
            account, as you say that you have been told, I supported his <lb/>
            cause in the senate, which I had undertaken on Pompey's <lb/>
            strong recommendation, as I was bound in honour to do.</p>
          <p>I have now told you with what motives I have sup­ <lb/>
            ported each measure and cause, and what my position is <lb/>
            in politics as far as I take any part in them: and I would <lb/>
            wish you to make sure of this-that I should have enter­ <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            tamed the same sentiments, if I had been still perfectly <lb/>
            uncommitted and free to choose. For I should not have <lb/>
            thought it right to fight against such overwhelming power, <lb/>
            nor to destroy the supremacy of the most distinguished citi­ <lb/>
            zens, even if it had been possible; nor, again, should I have <lb/>
            thought myself bound to abide by the same view, when cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances were changed and the feelings of the loyalists <lb/>
            altered, but rather to bow to circumstances. For the per­ <lb/>
            sistence in the same view has never been regarded as a merit <lb/>
            in men eminent for their guidance of the helm of state; <lb/>
            but as in steering a ship one secret of the art is to run before <lb/>
            the storm, even if you cannot make the harbour; yet, when <lb/>
            you can do so by tacking about, it is folly to keep to the <lb/>
            course you have begun rather than by changing it to arrive <lb/>
            all the same at the destination you desire: so while we all <lb/>
            ought in the administration of the state to keep always in <lb/>
            view the object I have very frequently mentioned, peace <lb/>
            combined with dignity, we are not bound always to use the <lb/>
            same language, but to fix our eyes on the same object. <lb/>
            Wherefore, as I laid down a little while ago, if I had had <lb/>
            as free a hand as possible in everything, I should yet have <lb/>
            been no other than I now am in politics. When, moreover, <lb/>
            I am at once induced to adopt these sentiments by the kind­ <lb/>
            ness of certain persons, and driven to do so by the injuries <lb/>
            of others, I am quite content to think and speak about public <lb/>
            affairs as I conceive best conduces to the interests both of <lb/>
            myself and of the Republic. Moreover, I make this declara­ <lb/>
            tion the more openly and frequently, both because my <lb/>
            brother Quintus is Cæsar’s legate, and because no word of <lb/>
            mine, however trivial, to say nothing of any act, in support <lb/>
            of Caesar has ever transpired, which he has not received with <lb/>
            such marked gratitude, as to make me look upon myself as <lb/>
            closely bound to him. Accordingly, I have the advantage <lb/>
            of his popularity, which you know to be very great, and his <lb/>
            material resources, which you know to be immense, as <lb/>
            though they were my own. Nor do I think that I could in <lb/>
            any other way have frustrated the plots of unprincipled <lb/>
            persons against me, unless I had now combined with those <lb/>
            protections, which I have always possessed, the goodwill also <lb/>
            of the men in power. I should, to the best of my belief, <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            have followed this same line of policy even if I had had you <lb/>
            here. For I well know the reasonableness and soberness of <lb/>
            your judgment: I know your mind, while warmly attached <lb/>
            to me, to be without a tinge of malevolence to others, but on <lb/>
            the contrary as open and candid as it is great and lofty. I <lb/>
            have seen certain persons conduct themselves' towards you as <lb/>
            you might have seen the same persons conduct themselves <lb/>
            towards me. The same things that have annoyed me would <lb/>
            certainly have annoyed you. But whenever I shall have the <lb/>
            enjoyment of your presence, you will be the wise critic of <lb/>
            all my plans: you who took thought for my safety will also <lb/>
            do so for my dignity. Me, indeed, you will have as the <lb/>
            partner and associate in all your actions, sentiments, wishes <lb/>
            -in fact, in everything; nor shall I ever in all my life have <lb/>
            any purpose so steadfastly before me, as that you should <lb/>
            rejoice more and more warmly every day that you did me <lb/>
            such eminent service.</p>
          <p>As to your request that I would send you any books I <lb/>
            have written since your departure, there are some speeches, <lb/>
            which I will give Menocritus, not so very many, so don't be <lb/>
            afraid! I have also written- for I am now rather withdraw­ <lb/>
            ing from oratory and returning to the gentler Muses, which <lb/>
            now give me greater delight than any others, as they have <lb/>
            done since my earliest youth-well, then, I have written in <lb/>
            the Aristotelian style, at least that was my aim, three <lb/>
            books in the form of a discussion in dialogue "On the <lb/>
            Orator," which, I think, well be of some service to your <lb/>
            Lentulus. For they differ a good deal from the current <lb/>
            maxims, and embrace a discussion on the whole oratorical <lb/>
            theory of the ancients, both that of Aristotle and Isocrates. <lb/>
            I have also written in verse three books "On my own <lb/>
            Times," which I should have sent you some time ago, if I <lb/>
            had thought they ought to be published-for they are wit­ <lb/>
            nesses, and will be eternal witnesses, of your services to <lb/>
            me and of my affection-but I refrained because I was <lb/>
            afraid, not of those who might think themselves attacked, <lb/>
            for I have been very sparing and gentle in that respect, but <lb/>
            of my benefactors, of whom it were an endless task to <lb/>
            mention the whole list. Nevertheless, the books, such as <lb/>
            they are, if I find anyone to whom I can safely commit <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            them, I will take care to have conveyed to you: and as far <lb/>
            as that part of my life and conduct is concerned, I submit <lb/>
            it entirely to your judgment. All that I shall succeed in <lb/>
            accomplishing in literature or in learning—my old favourite <lb/>
            relaxations-I shall with the utmost cheerfulness place be­ <lb/>
            fore the bar of your criticism, for you have always had a <lb/>
            fondness for such things. As to what you say in your letter <lb/>
            about your domestic affairs, and all you charge me to do, I <lb/>
            am so attentive to them that I don't like being reminded, <lb/>
            can scarcely bear, indeed, to be asked without a very pain­ <lb/>
            ful feeling. As to your saying, in regard to Quintus's busi­ <lb/>
            ness, that you could not do anything last summer, because <lb/>
            you were prevented by illness from crossing to Cilicia, but <lb/>
            that you will now do everything in your power to settle it, <lb/>
            I may tell you that the fact of the matter is that, if he can <lb/>
            annex this property, my brother thinks that he will owe to <lb/>
            you the consolidation of this ancestral estate. I should like <lb/>
            you to write about all your affairs, and about the studies and <lb/>
            training of your son Lentulus (whom I regard as mine also) <lb/>
            as confidentially and as frequently as possible, and to believe <lb/>
            that there never has been anyone either dearer or more con­ <lb/>
            genial to another than you are to me, and that I will not only <lb/>
            make you feel that to be the case, but will make all the <lb/>
            world and posterity itself to the latest generation aware of it.</p>
          <p>Appius used some time back to repeat in conversation, <lb/>
            and afterwards said openly, even in the senate, that if he <lb/>
            were allowed to carry a law in the comitia curiata, he would <lb/>
            draw lots with his colleague for their provinces; but if no <lb/>
            curiatian law were passed, he would make an arrangement <lb/>
            with his colleague and succeed you: that a curiatian law was <lb/>
            a proper thing for a consul, but was not a necessity: that <lb/>
            since he was in possession of a province by a decree of the <lb/>
            senate, he should have imperium in virtue of the Cornelian <lb/>
            law until such time as he entered the city. I don't know <lb/>
            what your several connexions write to you on the subject: <lb/>
            I understand that opinion varies. There are some who <lb/>
            think that you can legally refuse to quit your province, be­ <lb/>
            cause your successor is named without a curiatian law: <lb/>
            some also hold that, even if you do quit it, you may leave <lb/>
            some one behind you to conduct its government. For myself, <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            I do not feel so certain about, the point of law-although <lb/>
            there is not much doubt even about that-as I do of this, <lb/>
            that it is for your greatest honour, dignity, and independ­ <lb/>
            ence, which I know you always value above everything, to <lb/>
            hand over your province to a successor without any delay, <lb/>
            especially as you cannot thwart his greediness without <lb/>
            rousing suspicion of your own. I regard my duty as two­ <lb/>
            fold-to let you know what I think, and to defend what you <lb/>
            have done.</p>
          <p>P.S.—I had written the above when I received your letter <lb/>
            about the publicani, to whom I could not but admire the <lb/>
            justice of your conduct. I could have wished that you had <lb/>
            been able by some lucky chance to avoid running counter <lb/>
            to the interests and wishes of that order, whose honour you <lb/>
            have always promoted. For my part, I shall not cease to <lb/>
            defend your decrees: but you know the ways of that class <lb/>
            of men; you are aware how bitterly hostile they were to <lb/>
            the famous Q. Scaevola himself. However, I advise you <lb/>
            to reconcile that order to yourself, or at least soften its <lb/>
            feelings, if you can by any means do so. Though difficult, I <lb/>
            think it is, nevertheless, not beyond the reach of your <lb/>
            sagacity.</p>

          <p>IN the "Trojan Horse," just at the end, you remember the <lb/>
            words, "Too late they learn wisdom." You, however, old <lb/>
            man, were wise in time. Those first snappy letters of yours <lb/>
            were foolish enough, and then——! I don't at all blame you <lb/>
            for not being over-curious in regard to Britain. For the <lb/>
            present, however, you seem to be in winter quarters some­ <lb/>
            what short of warm clothing, and therefore not caring to <lb/>
            stir out: <lb/>
            "Not here and there, but everywhere, <lb/>
            Be wise and ware: <lb/>
            No sharper steel can warrior bear."</p>
          <p>If I had been by way of dining out, I would not have <lb/>
            failed your friend Cn. Octavius; to whom, however, I did <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            remark upon his repeated invitations, "Pray, who are you?" <lb/>
            But, by Hercules, joking apart, he is a pretty fellow: I <lb/>
            could have wished you had taken him with you! Let me <lb/>
            know for certain what you are doing and whether you in­ <lb/>
            tend coming to Italy at all this winter. Balbus has assured <lb/>
            me that you will be rich. Whether he speaks after the <lb/>
            simple Roman fashion, meaning that you will be well sup­ <lb/>
            plied with money, or according to the Stoic dictum, that "all <lb/>
            are rich who can enjoy the sky and the earth," I shall know <lb/>
            hereafter. Those who come from your part accuse you of <lb/>
            pride, because they say you won't answer men who put <lb/>
            questions to you. However, there is one thing that will <lb/>
            please you: they all agree in saying that there is no better <lb/>

          <p>YES, I saw well enough what your feelings were as I <lb/>
            parted from you; what mine were I am my own witness. <lb/>
            This makes it all the more incumbent on you to prevent an <lb/>
            additional decree being passed, so that this mutual regret <lb/>
            of ours may not last more than a year. As to Annius Satur­ <lb/>
            ninus, your measures are excellent. As to the guarantee, <lb/>
            pray, during your stay at Rome, give it yourself. You <lb/>
            will find several guarantees on purchase, such as those of the <lb/>
            estates of Memmius, or rather of Attilius. As to Oppius, <lb/>
            that is exactly what I wished, and especially your having en­ <lb/>
            gaged to pay him the 800 sestertia (about £6,400), which I <lb/>
            am determined shall be paid in any case, even if I have to <lb/>
            borrow to do so, rather than wait for the last day of getting <lb/>
            in my own debts.</p>
          <p>I now come to that last line of your letter written cross­ <lb/>
            ways, in which you give me a word of caution about your <lb/>
            sister. The facts of the matter are these. On arriving at <lb/>
            my place at Arpinum, my brother came to see me, and our <lb/>
            first subject of conversation was yourself, and we discussed <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            it at great length. After this I brought the conversation <lb/>
            round to what you and I had discussed at Tusculum, on the <lb/>
            subject of your sister. I never saw anything so gentle <lb/>
            and placable as my brother was on that occasion in regard to <lb/>
            your sister: so much so, indeed, that if there had been any <lb/>
            cause of quarrel on the score of expense, it was not apparent. <lb/>
            So much for that day. Next day we started from Arpinum. <lb/>
            A country festival caused Quintus to stop at Arcanum; I <lb/>
            stopped at Aquinum; but we lunched at Arcanum. You <lb/>
            know his property there. When we got there Quintus said, <lb/>
            in the kindest manner, " Pomponia, do you ask the ladies in, <lb/>
            I will invite the men." Nothing, as I thought, could be <lb/>
            more courteous, and that, too, not only in the actual words, <lb/>
            but also in his intention and the expression of face. But <lb/>
            she, in the hearing of us all, exclaimed, " I am only a stranger <lb/>
            here! " The origin of that was, as I think, the fact that <lb/>
            Statius had preceded as to look after the luncheon. There­ <lb/>
            upon Quintus said to me, " There, that's what I have to put <lb/>
            up with every day!”You will say, " Well, what does that <lb/>
            amount to ? " A great deal, and, indeed, she had irritated <lb/>
            even me: her answer had been given with such unnecessary <lb/>
            acrimony, both of word and look. I concealed my annoyance. <lb/>
            We all took our places at table except her. However, <lb/>
            Quintus sent her dishes from the table, which she declined. <lb/>
            In short, I thought I never saw anything better tempered <lb/>
            than my brother, or crosser than your sister: and there were <lb/>
            many particulars which I omit that raised my bile more <lb/>
            than did that of Quintus himself. I then went on to Aquinum; <lb/>
            Quintus stopped at Arcanum, and joined me early the next <lb/>
            day at Aquinum. He told me that she had refused to sleep <lb/>
            with him, and when on the point of leaving she behaved just <lb/>
            as I had seen her. Need I say more? You may tell her <lb/>
            herself that in my judgment she shewed a marked want of <lb/>
            kindness on that day. I have told you this story at greater <lb/>
            length, perhaps, than was necessary, to convince you that <lb/>
            you, too, have something to do in the way of giving her in­ <lb/>
            struction and advice.</p>
          <p>There only remains for me to beg you to complete all my <lb/>
            commissions before leaving town; to give Pomptinus a push, <lb/>
            and make him start; to let me know as soon as you have <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            left town, and to believe that, by heaven, there is nothing <lb/>
            I love and find more pleasure in than yourself. I said a <lb/>
            most affectionate good-bye to that best of men, A. Torquatus, <lb/>
            at Minturnæ, to whom I wish you would remark, in the <lb/>
            course of conversation, that I have mentioned him in my <lb/>
            letter.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>YOUR own immense prestige and my unvarying belief <lb/>
            in your consummate virtue have convinced me of the great <lb/>
            importance it is to me that you should be acquainted with <lb/>
            what I have accomplished, and that you should not be igno­ <lb/>
            rant of the equity and disinterestedness with which I pro­ <lb/>
            tected our allies and governed my province. For if you knew <lb/>
            these facts, I thought I should with greater ease secure your <lb/>
            approval of my wishes.</p>
          <p>Having entered my province on the last day of July, and <lb/>
            seeing that the time of year made it necessary for me to <lb/>
            make all haste to the army, I spent but two days at Laodicea, <lb/>
            four at Apamea, three at Synnada, and the same at Philo­ <lb/>
            melium. Having held largely attended assizes in these towns, <lb/>
            I freed a great number of cities from very vexatious tributes, <lb/>
            excessive interest, and fraudulent debt. Again, the army <lb/>
            having before my arrival been broken up by something like <lb/>
            a mutiny, and five cohorts-without a legate or a military <lb/>
            tribune, and, in fact, actually without a single centurion- <lb/>
            having taken up its quarters at Philomelium, while the rest <lb/>
            of the army was in Lycaonia, I ordered my legate M. Anneius <lb/>
            to bring those five cohorts to join the main army; and, hav­ <lb/>
            ing thus got the whole army together into one place, to <lb/>
            pitch a camp at Iconium in Lycaonia. This order having <lb/>
            been energetically executed by him, I arrived at the camp <lb/>
            myself on the 24th of August, having meanwhile, in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the decree of the senate, collected in the interven­ <lb/>
            ing days a strong body of reserve men, a very adequate force <lb/>
            of cavalry, and a contingent of volunteers from the free <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            peoples and allied sovereigns. While this was going on, <lb/>
            and when, after reviewing the army, I had on the 28th of <lb/>
            August begun my march to Cilicia, some legates sent to me <lb/>
            by the sovereign of Commagene announced, with every sign <lb/>
            of panic, yet not without some foundation, that the Parthians <lb/>
            had entered Syria. On hearing this I was rendered very <lb/>
            anxious both for Syria and my own province, and, in fact, <lb/>
            for all the rest of Asia. Accordingly, I made up my mind <lb/>
            that I must lead the army through the district of Cappadocia, <lb/>
            which adjoins Cilicia. For if I had gone straight down into <lb/>
            Cilicia, I could easily indeed have held Cilicia itself, owing <lb/>
            to the natural strength of Mount Amanus-for there are <lb/>
            only two defiles opening into Cilicia from Syria, both of which <lb/>
            are capable of being closed by insignificant garrisons owing <lb/>
            to their narrowness, nor can anything be imagined better <lb/>
            fortified than is Cilicia on the Syrian side-but I was dis­ <lb/>
            turbed for Cappadocia, which is quite open on the Syrian <lb/>
            side, and is surrounded by kings, who, even if they are our <lb/>
            friends in secret, nevertheless do not venture to be openly <lb/>
            hostile to the Parthians. Accordingly, I pitched my camp <lb/>
            in the extreme south of Cappadocia at the town of Cybistra, <lb/>
            not far from Mount Taurus, with the object at once of <lb/>
            covering Cilicia, and of thwarting the designs of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring tribes by holding Cappadocia. Meanwhile, in the <lb/>
            midst of this serious commotion and anxious expectation <lb/>
            of a very formidable war king Deiotarus, who has with good <lb/>
            reason been always highly honoured in your judgment and <lb/>
            my own, as well as that of the senate-a man distinguished <lb/>
            for his goodwill and loyalty to the Roman people, as well as <lb/>
            for his eminent courage and wisdom-sent legates to tell <lb/>
            me that he was on his way to my camp in full force. Much <lb/>
            affected by his zeal and kindness, I sent him a letter of <lb/>
            thanks, and urged him to hasten. However, being detained <lb/>
            at Cybistra five days while maturing my plan of campaign, <lb/>
            I rescued king Ariobarzanes, whose safety had been in­ <lb/>
            trusted to me by the senate on your motion, from a plot <lb/>
            that, to his surprise, had been formed against him: and I <lb/>
            not only saved his life, but I took pains also to secure that <lb/>
            his royal authority should be respected. Metras and Ath­ <lb/>
            enaeus (the latter strongly commended to me by yourself), <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            who had been exiled owing to the persistent enmity of queen <lb/>
            Athenais, I restored to a position of the highest influence <lb/>
            and favour with the king. Then, as there was danger of <lb/>
            serious hostilities arising in Cappadocia in case the priest, <lb/>
            as it was thought likely that he would do, defended him­ <lb/>
            self with arms-for he was a young man, well furnished <lb/>
            with horse and foot and money, and relying on those all who <lb/>
            desired political change of any sort—I contrived that he <lb/>
            should leave the kingdom: and that the king, without civil <lb/>
            war or an appeal to arms, with the full authority of the <lb/>
            court thoroughly secured, should hold the kingdom with <lb/>
            proper dignity.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, I was informed by despatches and messen­ <lb/>
            gers from many sides, that the Parthians and Arabs <lb/>
            had approached the town of Antioch in great force, <lb/>
            and that a large body of their horsemen, which had crossed <lb/>
            into Cilicia, had been cut to pieces by some squadrons of <lb/>
            my cavalry and the praetorian cohort then on garrison duty <lb/>
            at Epiphanea. Wherefore, seeing that the forces of the <lb/>
            Parthians had turned their backs upon Cappadocia, and were <lb/>
            not far from the frontiers of Cilicia, I led my army to <lb/>
            Amanus with the longest forced marches I could. Arrived <lb/>
            there, I learnt that the enemy had retired from Antioch, and <lb/>
            that Bibulus was at Antioch. I thereupon informed Deio­ <lb/>
            tarus, who was hurrying to join me with a large and strong <lb/>
            body of horse and foot, and with all the forces he could <lb/>
            muster, that I saw no reason for his leaving his own do­ <lb/>
            minions, and that in case of any new event, I would imme­ <lb/>
            diately write and send to him. And as my intention in <lb/>
            coming had been to relieve both provinces, should occasion <lb/>
            arise, so now I proceeded to do what I had all along made <lb/>
            up my mind was greatly to the interest of both provinces, <lb/>
            namely, to reduce Amanus, and to remove from that moun­ <lb/>
            tain an eternal enemy. So I made a feint of retiring from <lb/>
            the mountain and making for other parts of Cilicia: and <lb/>
            having gone a day's march from Amanus and pitched a <lb/>
            camp, on the 12th of October, towards evening, at Epiphanea, <lb/>
            with my army in light marching order I effected such a <lb/>
            night march, that by dawn on the 13th I was already ascend­ <lb/>
            ing Amanus. Having formed the cohorts and auxiliaries <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            into several columns of attack-I and my legate Quintus <lb/>
            (my brother) commanding one, my legate C. Pomptinus <lb/>
            another, and my legates M. Anneius and L. Tullius the rest <lb/>
            —we surprised most of the inhabitants, who, being cut off <lb/>
            from all retreat, were killed or taken prisoners. But Erana, <lb/>
            which was more like a town than a village, and was the <lb/>
            capital of Amanus, as also Sepyra and Commons, which <lb/>
            offered a determined and protracted resistance from before <lb/>
            daybreak till four in the afternoon-Pomptinus being in <lb/>
            command in that part of Amanus-we took, after killing a <lb/>
            great number of the enemy, and stormed and set fire to <lb/>
            several fortresses. After these operations we lay encamped <lb/>
            for four days on the spurs of Amanus, near the Aræ <lb/>
            Alexandri, and all that time we devoted to the destruction <lb/>
            of the remaining inhabitants of Amanus, and devastating <lb/>
            their lands on that side of the mountain which belongs to my <lb/>
            province. Having accomplished this, I led the army away <lb/>
            to Pindenissus, a town of the Eleutherocilices. And since <lb/>
            this town was situated on a very lofty and strongly fortified <lb/>
            spot, and was inhabited by men who have never submitted <lb/>
            even to the kings, and since they were offering harbourage <lb/>
            to deserters, and were eagerly expecting the arrival of the <lb/>
            Parthians, I thought it of importance to the prestige of the <lb/>
            empire to suppress their audacity, in order that there <lb/>
            might be less difficulty in breaking the spirits of all such as <lb/>
            were anywhere disaffected to our rule. I encircled them <lb/>
            with a stockade and trench: I beleagured them with six <lb/>
            forts and huge camps: I assaulted them by the aid of earth- <lb/>
            works, pent-houses, and towers: and having employed nu­ <lb/>
            merous catapults and bowmen, with great personal labour, <lb/>
            and without troubling the allies or costing them anything, <lb/>
            I reduced them to such extremities that, after every region <lb/>
            of their town had been battered down or fired, they sur­ <lb/>
            rendered to me on the fifty-seventh day. Their next neigh­ <lb/>
            bours were the people of Tebra, no. less predatory and <lb/>
            audacious: from them after the capture of Pindenissus I <lb/>
            received hostages. I then dismissed the army to winter <lb/>
            quarters; and I put my brother in command, with orders to <lb/>
            station the men in villages that had either been captured or <lb/>
            were disaffected.</p><pb n="144"/>
            
          <p>Well now, I would have you feel convinced that, should <lb/>
            a motion be brought before the senate on these matters, I <lb/>
            shall consider that the highest possible compliment has been <lb/>
            paid me, if you give your vote in favour of a mark of <lb/>
            honour being bestowed upon me. And as to this, though I <lb/>
            am aware that in such matters men of the most respectable <lb/>
            character are accustomed to ask and to be asked, yet I think <lb/>
            in your case that it is rather a reminder than a request which <lb/>
            is called for from me. For it is you who have on very many <lb/>
            occasions complimented me in votes which you delivered, <lb/>
            who have praised me to the skies in conversation, in pan­ <lb/>
            egyric, in the most laudatory speeches in senate and public <lb/>
            meeting: you are the man to whose words I ever attached <lb/>
            such weight as to hold myself in possession of my utmost <lb/>
            ambition, if your lips joined the chorus of my praise. It <lb/>
            was you finally, as I recollect, who said, when voting against <lb/>
            a supplicatio in honour of a certain illustrious and noble <lb/>
            person, that you would have voted for it, if the motion had <lb/>
            related to what he had done in the city as consul. It was <lb/>
            you, too, who voted for granting me a supplicatio, though <lb/>
            only a civilian, not as had been done in many instances, <lb/>
            "for good services to the state," but, as I remember, "for <lb/>
            having saved the state." I pass over your having shared the <lb/>
            hatred I excited, the dangers I ran, all the storms that I <lb/>
            have encountered, and your having been entirely ready to <lb/>
            have shared them much more fully if I had allowed it; and <lb/>
            finally your having regarded my enemy as your own; of <lb/>
            whose death even-thus shewing me clearly how much you <lb/>
            valued me—you manifested your approval by supporting the <lb/>
            cause of Milo in the senate. On the other hand, I have <lb/>
            borne a testimony to you, which I do not regard as consti­ <lb/>
            tuting any claim on your gratitude, but as a frank ex­ <lb/>
            pression of genuine opinion: for I did not confine myself to <lb/>
            a silent admiration of your eminent virtues-who does not <lb/>
            admire them? But in all forms of speech, whether in the <lb/>
            senate or at the bar; in all kinds of writing, Greek or Latin; <lb/>
            in fine, in all the various branches of my literary activity, <lb/>
            I proclaimed your superiority not only to contemporaries, <lb/>
            but also to those of whom we have heard in history.</p>
          <p>You will ask, perhaps, why I place such value on this or <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            that modicum of congratulation or compliment from the <lb/>
            senate. I will be frank with you, as our common tastes and <lb/>
            mutual good services, our close friendship, nay, the intimacy <lb/>
            of our fathers demand. If there ever was anyone by natural <lb/>
            inclination, and still more, I think, by reason and reflexion, <lb/>
            averse from the empty praise and comments of the vulgar, I <lb/>
            am certainly the man. Witness my consulship, in which, as <lb/>
            in the rest of my life, I confess that I eagerly pursued the <lb/>
            objects capable of producing true glory: mere glory for its <lb/>
            own sake I never thought a subject for ambition. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, I not only passed over a province after the votes for <lb/>
            its outfit had been taken, but also with it an almost certain <lb/>
            hope of a triumph; and finally the priesthood, though, as <lb/>
            I think you will agree with me, I could have obtained it <lb/>
            without much difficulty, I did not try to get. Yet after my <lb/>
            unjust disgrace-always stigmatized by you as, a disaster to <lb/>
            the Republic, and rather an honour than a disaster to myself <lb/>
            —I was anxious that some very signal marks of the appro­ <lb/>
            bation of the senate and Roman people should be put on <lb/>
            record. Accordingly, in the first place, I did subsequently <lb/>
            wish for the augurship, about which I had not troubled my­ <lb/>
            self before; and the compliment usually paid by the senate <lb/>
            in the case of success in war, though passed over by me in <lb/>
            old times, I now think an object to be desired. That you <lb/>
            should approve and support this wish of mine, in which you <lb/>
            may trace a strong desire to heal the wounds inflicted upon <lb/>
            me by my disgrace, though I a little while ago declared that <lb/>
            I would not ask it, I now do earnestly ask of you: but only <lb/>
            on condition that you shall not think my humble services <lb/>
            paltry and insignificant, but of such a nature and im­ <lb/>
            portance, that many for far less signal successes have ob­ <lb/>
            tained the highest honours from the senate. I have, too, I <lb/>
            think, noticed this-for you know how attentively I ever <lb/>
            listen to you-that in granting or withholding honours you <lb/>
            are accustomed to look not so much to the particular achieve­ <lb/>
            ments as to the character, the principles- and conduct of <lb/>
            commanders. Well, if you apply this test to my case, you <lb/>
            will find that, with a weak army, my strongest support against <lb/>
            the threat of a very formidable war has been my equity and <lb/>
            purity of conduct. With these as my aids I accomplished <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            what I never could have accomplished by any amount of <lb/>
            legions: among the allies I have created the warmest devo­ <lb/>
            tion in place of the most extreme alienation; the most com­ <lb/>
            plete loyalty in place of the most dangerous disaffection; <lb/>
            and their spirits fluttered by the prospect of change I have <lb/>
            brought back to feelings of affection for the old rule.</p>
          <p>But I have said too much of myself, especially to you, in <lb/>
            whom singly the grievances of all our allies alike find a <lb/>
            listener. You will learn the truth from those who think <lb/>
            themselves restored to life by my administration. And while <lb/>
            all with nearly one consent will praise me in your hearing as <lb/>
            I most desire to be praised, so will your two chief client <lb/>
            states-the island of Cyprus and the kingdom of Cappadocia <lb/>
            -have something to say to you about me also. So, too, I <lb/>
            think, will Deiotarus, who is attached to you with special <lb/>
            warmth. Now, if these things are above the common run, <lb/>
            and if in all ages it has been rarer to find men capable of <lb/>
            conquering their own desires than capable of conquering an <lb/>
            enemy's army, it is quite in harmony with your principles, <lb/>
            when you find these rarer and more difficult virtues com­ <lb/>
            bined with success in war, to regard that success itself as <lb/>
            more complete and glorious.</p>
          <p>I have only one last resource-philosophy: and to make <lb/>
            her plead for me, as though I doubted the efficacy of a mere <lb/>
            request: philosophy, the best friend I have ever had in all <lb/>
            my life, the greatest gift which has been bestowed by the <lb/>
            gods upon mankind. Yes! this common sympathy in tastes <lb/>
            and studies-our inseparable devotion and attachment to <lb/>
            which from boyhood have caused us to become almost unique <lb/>
            examples of men bringing that true and ancient philosophy <lb/>
            (which some regard as only the employment of leisure and <lb/>
            idleness) down to the forum, the council chamber, and the <lb/>
            very camp itself-pleads the cause of my glory with you: <lb/>
            and I do not think a Cato can, with a good conscience, say <lb/>
            her nay. Wherefore I would have you convince yourself <lb/>
            that, if my despatch is made the ground of paying me this <lb/>
            compliment with your concurrence, I shall consider that <lb/>
            the dearest wish of my heart has been fulfilled owing at <lb/>
            once to your influence and to your friendship.</p><pb n="147"/>

            <title type="sub">XIX To ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS) LAODICEA, 22 FEBRUARY</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I RECEIVED your letter on the fifth day before the Terminalia <lb/>
            (19th of February) at Laodicea. I was delighted to read it, <lb/>
            for it teemed with affection, kindness, and an active and <lb/>
            obliging temper. I will, therefore, answer it sentence by <lb/>
            sentence-for such is your request-and I will not intro­ <lb/>
            duce an arrangement of my own, but will follow your order.</p>
          <p>You say that the last letter you had of mine was from <lb/>
            Cybistra, dated 21st September, and you want to know which <lb/>
            of yours I have received. Nearly all you mention, except <lb/>
            the one that you say that you delivered to Lentulus's mes­ <lb/>
            sengers at Equotuticus and Brundisium. Wherefore your <lb/>
            industry has not been thrown away, as you fear, but has <lb/>
            been exceedingly well laid out, if, that is to say, your object <lb/>
            was to give me pleasure. For I have never been more de­ <lb/>
            lighted with anything. I am exceedingly glad that you ap­ <lb/>
            prove of my self-restraint in the case of Appius, and of my <lb/>
            independence even in the case of Brutus: and I had thought <lb/>
            that it might be somewhat otherwise. For Appius, in the <lb/>
            course of his journey, had sent me two or three rather <lb/>
            querulous letters, because I rescinded some of his decisions. <lb/>
            It is exactly as if a doctor, upon a patient having been placed <lb/>
            under another doctor, should choose to be angry with the <lb/>
            latter if he changed some of his prescriptions. Thus Appius, <lb/>
            having treated the province on the system of depletion, bleed­ <lb/>
            ing, and removing everything he could, and having handed <lb/>
            it over to me in the last state of exhaustion, he cannot bear <lb/>
            seeing it treated by me on the nutritive system. Yet he is <lb/>
            sometimes angry with me, at other times thanks me; for <lb/>
            nothing I ever do is accompanied with any reflexion upon <lb/>
            him. It is only the dissimilarity of my system that annoys <lb/>
            him. For what could be a more striking difference-under <lb/>
            his rule a province drained by charges for maintenance and <lb/>
            by losses, under mine, not a penny exacted either from <lb/>
            private persons or public bodies ? Why speak of his prafecti, <lb/>
            staff, and legates ? Or even of acts of plunder, licentiousness, <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            and insult? While as things actually are, no private house, <lb/>
            by Hercules, is governed with so much system, or on such <lb/>
            strict principles, nor is so well disciplined, as is my whole <lb/>
            province. Some of Appius's friends put a ridiculous con­ <lb/>
            struction on this, holding that I wish for a good reputation <lb/>
            to set off his bad one, and act rightly, not for the sake of <lb/>
            my own credit, but in order to cast reflexion upon him. But <lb/>
            if Appius, as Brutus's letter forwarded by you indicated, ex­ <lb/>
            presses gratitude to me, I am satisfied. Nevertheless, this <lb/>
            very day on which I write this, before dawn, I am thinking <lb/>
            of rescinding many of his inequitable appointments and <lb/>
            decisions.</p>
          <p>I now come to Brutus, whose friendship I embraced with <lb/>
            all possible earnestness on your advice. I had even begun <lb/>
            to feel genuine affection for him—but here I pull myself up <lb/>
            short, lest I should offend you: for don't imagine that there <lb/>
            is anything I wish more than to fulfil his commissions, or <lb/>
            that there is anything about which I have taken more <lb/>
            trouble. Now he gave me a volume of commissions, and <lb/>
            you bad already spoken with me about the same matters. <lb/>
            I have pushed them on with the greatest energy. To begin <lb/>
            with, I put such pressure on Ariobarzanes, that he paid him <lb/>
            the talents which he promised me. As long as the king <lb/>
            was with me, the business was in excellent train: later on <lb/>
            he begun to be pressed by countless agents of Pompey. <lb/>
            Now Pompey has by himself more influence than all the <lb/>
            rest put together for many reasons, and especially because <lb/>
            there is an idea that he is coming to undertake the Parthian <lb/>
            war. However, even he has to put up with the following <lb/>
            scale of payment: on every thirtieth day thirty-three Attic <lb/>
            talents (£7,920), and that raised by special taxes: nor is it <lb/>
            sufficient for the monthly interest. But our friend Gnaeus <lb/>
            is an easy creditor: he stands out of his capital, is content <lb/>
            with the interest, and even that not in full. The king neither <lb/>
            pays anyone else, nor is capable of doing so: for he has no <lb/>
            treasury, no regular income. He levies taxes after the <lb/>
            method of Appius. They scarcely produce enough to satisfy <lb/>
            Pompey's interest. The king has two or three very rich <lb/>
            friends, but they stick to their own as energetically as you <lb/>
            or 1. For my part, nevertheless, I do not cease sending <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            letters asking, urging, chiding the king. Deiotarus also has <lb/>
            informed me that he has sent emissaries to him on Brutus's <lb/>
            business: that they have brought him back word that he <lb/>
            has not got the money. And, by Hercules, I believe it is <lb/>
            the case; nothing can be stripped cleaner than his kingdom, <lb/>
            or be more needy than the king. Accordingly, I am think­ <lb/>
            ing either of renouncing my guardianship, or, as Scaevola did <lb/>
            on behalf of Glabrio, of stopping payment altogether—prin­ <lb/>
            cipal and interest alike. However, I have conferred the <lb/>
            prefectures which I promised Brutus through you on M. <lb/>
            Scaptius and L. Gavius, who were acting as Brutus's agents <lb/>
            in the kingdom: for they were not carrying on business in <lb/>
            my own province. You will remember that I made that <lb/>
            condition, that he might have as many prefectures as he <lb/>
            pleased, so long as it was not for a man in business. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, I have given him two others besides: but the <lb/>
            men for whom he asked them had left the province. Now <lb/>
            for the case of the Salaminians, which I see came upon you <lb/>
            also as a novelty, as it did upon me. For Brutus never told <lb/>
            me that the money was his own. Nay, I have his own docu­ <lb/>
            ment containing the words, “The Salaminians owe my friends <lb/>
            M. Scaptius and P. Matinius a sum of money." He recom­ <lb/>
            mends them to me: he even adds, as though by way of a <lb/>
            spur to me, that he has gone surety for them to a large <lb/>
            amount. I had succeeded in arranging that they should <lb/>
            pay with interest for six years at the rate of twelve per <lb/>
            cent., and added yearly to the capital sum. But Scaptius <lb/>
            demanded forty-eight per cent. I was afraid, if he got that, <lb/>
            you yourself would cease to have any affection for me. For <lb/>
            I should have receded from my own edict, and should have <lb/>
            utterly ruined a state which was under the protection not <lb/>
            only of Cato, but also of Brutus himself, and had been the <lb/>
            recipient of favours from myself. When lo and behold! at <lb/>
            this very juncture Scaptius comes down upon me with a <lb/>
            letter from Brutus, stating that his own property is being <lb/>
            imperilled—a fact that Brutus had never told either me or <lb/>
            you. He also begged that I would confer a prefecture on <lb/>
            Scaptius. That was the very reservation that I had made <lb/>
            to you-" not to a man in business ": and if to anyone, to <lb/>
            such a man as that-no! For he has been a præfectus to <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            Appius, and had, in fact, had some squadrons of cavalry, <lb/>
            with which he had kept the senate under so close a siege in <lb/>
            their own council chamber at Salamis, that five senators <lb/>
            died of starvation. Accordingly, the first day of my entering <lb/>
            my province, Cyprian legates having already visited me at <lb/>
            Ephesus, I sent orders for the cavalry to quit the island at <lb/>
            once. For these reasons I believe Scaptius has written <lb/>
            some unfavorable remarks about me to Brutus. However, <lb/>
            my feeling is this: if Brutus holds that I ought to have <lb/>
            decided in favour of forty-eight per cent., though through­ <lb/>
            out my province I have only recognized twelve per cent., <lb/>
            and had laid down that rule in my edict with the assent <lb/>
            even of the most grasping money-lenders; if he complains <lb/>
            of my refusal of a prefecture to a man in business, which I <lb/>
            refused to our friend Torquatus in the case of your protégé <lb/>
            Laenius, and to Pompey himself in the case of Sext. Statius, <lb/>
            without offending either of them; if, finally, he is annoyed <lb/>
            at my recall of the cavalry, I shall indeed feel some dis­ <lb/>
            tress at his being angry with me, but much greater distress <lb/>
            at finding him not to be the man that I had thought him. <lb/>
            Thus much Scaptius will own-that he had the opportunity <lb/>
            in my court of taking away with him the whole sum allowed <lb/>
            by my edict. I will add a fact which I fear you may not <lb/>
            approve. The interest ought to have ceased to run (I mean <lb/>
            the interest allowed by my edict), but I induced the Sala­ <lb/>
            minians to say nothing about that. They gave in to me, it is <lb/>
            true, but what will become of them if Paullus comes here? <lb/>
            However, I have granted all this in favour of Brutus, who <lb/>
            writes very kind letters to you about me, but to me my­ <lb/>
            self, even when he has a favour to ask, writes usually in <lb/>
            a tone of hauteur, arrogance, and offensive superiority. <lb/>
            You, however, I hope will write to him on this business, <lb/>
            in order that I may know how he takes what I have done. <lb/>
            For you will tell me. I have, it is true, written you a full <lb/>
            and careful account in a former letter, but I wished you <lb/>
            clearly to understand that I had not forgotten what you had <lb/>
            said to me in one of your letters: that if I brought home <lb/>
            from this province nothing else except his goodwill, I should <lb/>
            have done enough. By all means, since you will have it so: <lb/>
            but I assume my dealings with him to be without breach of <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            duty on my part. Well, then, by my decree the payment of the <lb/>
            money to Statius is good at law: whether that is just you <lb/>
            must judge for yourself—I will not appeal even to Cato. But <lb/>
            don't think that I have cast your exhortations to the winds: <lb/>
            they have sunk deeply into my mind. With tears in your <lb/>
            eyes you urged me to be careful of my reputation. Have I <lb/>
            ever got a letter from you without the same subject being <lb/>
            mentioned? So, then, let who will be angry, I will endure <lb/>
            it: " for the right is on my side," especially as I have given <lb/>
            six books as bail, so to speak, for my good conduct. I am <lb/>
            very glad you like them, though in one point-about Cn. <lb/>
            Flavius, son of Annius—you question my history. He, it <lb/>
            is true, did not live before the decemvirs, for he was curule <lb/>
            aedile, an office created many years after the decemvirs. <lb/>
            What good did he do, then, by publishing the Fasti? It is <lb/>
            supposed that the tablet containing them had been kept <lb/>
            concealed up to a certain date, in order that information <lb/>
            as to days for doing business might have to be sought from <lb/>
            a small coterie. And indeed several of our authorities <lb/>
            relate that a scribe named Cn. Flavius published the Fasti <lb/>
            and composed forms of pleading-so don't imagine that I, <lb/>
            or rather Africanus (for he is the spokesman), invented the <lb/>
            fact. So you noticed the remark about the " action of an <lb/>
            actor," did you? You suspect a malicious meaning: I wrote <lb/>
            in all simplicity.</p>
          <p>You say that Philotimus told you about my having been <lb/>
            saluted imperator. But I feel sure that, as you are now in <lb/>
            Epirus, you have received my own letters on the whole sub­ <lb/>
            ject, one from Pindenissus after its capture, another from <lb/>
            Laodicea, both delivered to your own messengers. On these <lb/>
            events, for fear of accidents at sea, I sent a public despatch <lb/>
            to Rome in duplicate by two different letter-carriers.</p>
          <p>As to my Tullia, I agree with you, and I have written to <lb/>
            her and to Terentia giving my consent. For you have already <lb/>
            said in a previous letter to me, " and I could wish that you <lb/>
            had returned to your old set." There was no occasion to <lb/>
            alter the letter you sent by Memnius: for I much prefer to <lb/>
            accept this man from Pontidia, than the other from Servilia. <lb/>
            Wherefore take our friend Saufeius into council. He was <lb/>
            always fond of me, and now I suppose all the more so as he <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            is bound to have accepted Appius's affection for me with the <lb/>
            rest of the property he has inherited. Appius often showed <lb/>
            how much he valued me, and especially in the trial of Bursa. <lb/>
            Indeed you will have relieved me of a serious anxiety.</p>
          <p>I don't like Furnius's proviso. For, in fact, there is no <lb/>
            state of things that alarms me except just that of which he <lb/>
            makes the only exception. But I should have written at <lb/>
            great length to you on this subject if you had been at Rome. <lb/>
            I don't wonder that you rest all your hope of peace on <lb/>
            Pompey: I believe that is the truth, and in my opinion you <lb/>
            must strike out your word " insincerity." If my arrangement <lb/>
            of topics is somewhat random, blame yourself: for I am <lb/>
            following your own haphazard order.</p>
          <p>My son and nephew are very fond of each other. They <lb/>
            take their lessons and their exercise together; but as Isocrates <lb/>
            said of Ephorus and Theopompus, the one wants the rein, <lb/>
            the other the spur. I intend giving Quintus the toga virilis <lb/>
            on the Liberalia. For his father commissioned me to do <lb/>
            so. And I shall observe the day without taking intercalation <lb/>
            into account. I am very fond of Dionysius: the boys, how­ <lb/>
            ever, say that he gets into mad passions. But after all there <lb/>
            could not be a man of greater learning, purer character, or <lb/>
            more attached to you and me. The praises you hear of <lb/>
            Thermus and Silius are thoroughly deserved: they conduct <lb/>
            themselves in the most honourable manner. You may say <lb/>
            the same of M. Nonius, Bibulus, and myself, if you like. I <lb/>
            only wish Scrofa had had an opportunity to do the same: for <lb/>
            he is an excellent fellow. The rest don't do much honour to <lb/>
            Cato's policy. Many thanks for commending my case to <lb/>
            Hortensius. As for Anianus, Dionysius thinks there is no <lb/>
            hope. I haven't found a trace of Terentius. Mœragenes has <lb/>
            certainly been killed. I made a progress through his district, <lb/>
            in which there was not a single living thing left. I didn't <lb/>
            know about this, when I spoke to your man Democritus. <lb/>
            I have ordered the service of Rhosian ware. But, hallo! <lb/>
            what are you thinking of ? You generally serve us up a <lb/>
            dinner of herbs on fern-pattern plates, and the most sparkling <lb/>
            of baskets: what am I to expect you to give on porcelain? I <lb/>
            have ordered a horn for Phemius: one will be sure to turn <lb/>
            up; I only hope he may play something worthy of it.</p><pb n="153"/>
            
          <p>There is a threat of a Parthian war. Cassius's despatch <lb/>
            was empty brag: that of Bibulus had not arrived: when that <lb/>
            is read I think the senate will at length be roused. I am <lb/>
            myself in serious anxiety. If, as I hope, my government is <lb/>
            not prolonged, I have only June and July to fear. May it <lb/>
            be so! Bibulus will keep them in check for two months. <lb/>
            What will happen to the man I leave in charge, especially if <lb/>
            it is my brother? Or, again, what will happen to me, if I <lb/>
            don't leave my province so soon? It is a great nuisance. <lb/>
            However, I have agreed with Deiotarus that he should join <lb/>
            my camp in full force. He has thirty cohorts of four hundred <lb/>
            men apiece, armed in the Roman fashion, and two thousand <lb/>
            cavalry. That will be sufficient to hold out till the arrival of <lb/>
            Pompey, who in a letter he writes to me indicates that the <lb/>
            business will be put in his hands. The Parthians are winter­ <lb/>
            ing in a Roman province. Orodes is expected in person. In <lb/>
            short, it is a serious matter. As to Bibulus's edict there is <lb/>
            nothing new, except the proviso of which you said in your <lb/>
            letter, "that it reflected with excessive severity on our order." <lb/>
            I, however, have a proviso in my own edict of equivalent <lb/>
            force, but less openly expressed (derived from the Asiatic edict <lb/>
            of Q. Mucius, son of Publius)—“provided that the agree­ <lb/>
            ment made is not such as cannot hold good in equity." I <lb/>
            have followed Scaevola in many points, among others in this <lb/>
            -which the Greeks regard as a charta of liberty-that Greeks <lb/>
            are to decide controversies between each other according to <lb/>
            their own laws. But my edict was shortened by my method <lb/>
            of making a division, as I thought it well to publish it under <lb/>
            two heads: the first, exclusively applicable to a province, <lb/>
            concerned borough accounts, debt, rate of interest, contracts, <lb/>
            all regulations also referring to the publicani: the second, in­ <lb/>
            cluding what cannot conveniently be transacted without an <lb/>
            edict, related to inheritances, ownership and sale, appoint­ <lb/>
            ment of receivers, all which are by custom brought into court <lb/>
            and settled in accordance with the edict: a third division, em­ <lb/>
            bracing the remaining departments of judicial business, I left <lb/>
            unwritten. I gave out that in regard to that class of business <lb/>
            I should accommodate my decisions to those made at Rome: I <lb/>
            accordingly do so, and give general satisfaction. The Greeks, <lb/>
            indeed, are jubilant because they have non-Roman jurors. <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            " Yes," you will say, " a very poor kind." What does that <lb/>
            matter? They, at any rate, imagine themselves to have ob­ <lb/>
            tained " autonomy." You at Rome, I suppose, have men of <lb/>
            high character in that capacity—Tupio the shoemaker and <lb/>
            Vettius the broker! You seem to wish to know how I treat <lb/>
            the publicani. I pet, indulge, compliment, and honour them: <lb/>
            I contrive, however, that they oppress no one. The most <lb/>
            surprising thing is that even Servilius maintained the rates of <lb/>
            usury entered on their contracts. My line is this: I name <lb/>
            a day fairly distant, before which, if they have paid, I give <lb/>
            out that I shall recognize only twelve per cent: if they have <lb/>
            not paid, the rate shall be according to the contract. The <lb/>
            result is that the Greeks pay at a reasonable rate of interest, <lb/>
            and the publicani are thoroughly satisfied by receiving in full <lb/>
            measure what I mentioned-complimentary speeches and <lb/>
            frequent invitations. Need I say more? They are all on <lb/>
            such terms with me that each thinks himself my most in­ <lb/>
            timate friend. However, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μπδὲν αὐτοῑς</foreign>—you know the rest.</p>
          <p>As to the statue of Africanus—what a mass of confusion! <lb/>
            But that was just what interested me in your letter. Do <lb/>
            you really mean it? Does the present Metellus Scipio not <lb/>
            know that his great-grand father was never censor? Why, <lb/>
            the statue placed at a high elevation in the temple of Ops <lb/>
            had no inscription except CENS, while on the statue near the <lb/>
            Hercules of Polycles there is also the inscription CENS, and <lb/>
            that this is the statue of the same man is proved by attitude, <lb/>
            dress, ring, and the likeness itelf. But, by Hercules, when <lb/>
            I observed in the group of gilded equestrian statues, placed by <lb/>
            the present Metellus on the Capitol, a statue of Africanus <lb/>
            with the name of Serapio inscribed under it, I thought it a <lb/>
            mistake of the workman. I now see that it is an error of <lb/>
            Metellus's. What a shocking historical blunder! For that <lb/>
            about Flavius and the Fasti, if it is a blunder, is one shared <lb/>
            in by all, and you were quite right to raise the question. I <lb/>
            followed the opinion which runs through nearly all historians, <lb/>
            as is often the case with Greek writers. For example, do <lb/>
            they not all say that Eupolis, the poet of the old comedy, was <lb/>
            thrown into the sea by Alcibiades on his voyage to Sicily? <lb/>
            Eratosthenes disproves it: for he produces some plays ex­ <lb/>
            hibited by him after that date. Is that careful historian, <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            Duris of Samos, laughed out of court because he, in common <lb/>
            with many others, made this mistake ? Has not, again, every <lb/>
            writer affirmed that Zaleucus drew up a constitution for the <lb/>
            Locrians? Are we on that account to regard Theophrastus <lb/>
            as utterly discredited, because your favourite Timaeus at­ <lb/>
            tacked his statement ? But not to know that one's own great- <lb/>
            grandfather was never censor is discreditable, especially as <lb/>
            since his consulship no Cornelius was censor in his lifetime.</p>
          <p>As to what you say about Philotimus and the payment of <lb/>
            the 20,600 sestertia, I hear that Philotimus arrived in the <lb/>
            Chersonese about the Ist of January: but as yet I have not <lb/>
            had a word from him. The balance due to me Camillus <lb/>
            writes me word that he has received; I don't know how much <lb/>
            it is, and I am anxious to know. However, we will talk of <lb/>
            this later on, and with greater advantage, perhaps, when we <lb/>
            meet?</p>
          <p>But, my dear Atticus, that sentence almost at the end of <lb/>
            your letter gave me great uneasiness. For you say, " What <lb/>
            else is there to say ? " and then you go on to entreat me in <lb/>
            most affectionate terms not to forget my vigilance, and to <lb/>
            keep my eyes on what is going on. Have you heard any­ <lb/>
            thing about anyone? I am sure nothing of the sort has <lb/>
            taken place. No, no, it can't be! It would never have <lb/>
            eluded my notice, nor will it. Yet that reminder of yours, <lb/>
            so carefully worded, seems to suggest something.</p>
          <p>As to M. Octavius, I hereby again repeat that your answer <lb/>
            was excellent: I could have wished it a little more positive <lb/>
            still. For Caelius has sent me a freedman and a carefully <lb/>
            written letter about some panthers and also a grant from the <lb/>
            states. I have written back to say that, as to the latter, I <lb/>
            am much vexed if my course of conduct is still obscure, and <lb/>
            if it is not known at Rome that not a penny has been <lb/>
            exacted from my province except for the payment of debt; <lb/>
            and I have explained to him that it is improper both for me <lb/>
            to solicit the money and for him to receive it; and I have <lb/>
            advised him (for I am really attached to him) that, after <lb/>
            prosecuting others, he should be extra-careful as to his own <lb/>
            conduct. As to the former request, I have said that it is <lb/>
            inconsistent with my character that the people of Cibyra <lb/>
            should hunt at the public expense while I am governor.</p><pb n="156"/>
            
          <p>Lepta jumps for joy at your letter. It is indeed prettily <lb/>
            written, and has placed me in a very agreeable light in his <lb/>
            eyes. I am much obliged to your little daughter for so <lb/>
            earnestly bidding you send me her love. It is very kind of <lb/>
            Pilia also; but your daughter's kindness is the greater, be­ <lb/>
            cause she sends the message to one she has never seen. <lb/>
            Therefore pray give my love to both in return. The day on <lb/>
            which your letter was dated, the last day of December, <lb/>
            reminded me pleasantly of that glorious oath of mine, <lb/>
            which I have not forgotten. I was a civilian Magnus <lb/>
            on that day.</p>
          <p>There's your letter completely answered! Not as you <lb/>
            were good enough to ask, with "gold for bronze," but tit <lb/>
            for tat. Oh, but here is another little note, which I will not <lb/>
            leave unanswered. Lucceius, on my word, could get a good <lb/>
            price for his Tusculan property, unless, perchance, his flute­ <lb/>
            player is a fixture (for that's his way), and I should like to <lb/>
            know in what condition it is. Our friend Lentulus, I hear, <lb/>
            has advertised everything for sale except his Tusculan prop­ <lb/>
            erty. I should like to see these men cleared of their <lb/>
            embarrassments, Cestius also, and you may add Caelius, to <lb/>
            all of whom the line applies, <lb/>
            "Ashamed to shrink and yet afraid to take." <lb/>
            I suppose you have heard of Curio's plan for recalling <lb/>
            Memmius. Of the debt due from Egnatius of Sidicinum I am <lb/>
            not without some hope, though it is a feeble one. Pinarius, <lb/>
            whom you recommended to me, is seriously ill, and is being <lb/>
            very carefully looked after by Deiotarus. So there's the <lb/>
            answer to your note also.</p>
          <p>Pray talk to me on paper as frequently as possible while <lb/>
            I am at Laodicea, where I shall be up to the 15th of May: <lb/>
            and when you reach Athens at any rate send me letter- <lb/>
            carriers, for by that time we shall know about the business <lb/>
            in the city and the arrangements as to the provinces, the <lb/>
            settlement of all which has been fixed for March.</p>
          <p>But look here! Have you yet wrung out of Caesar by the <lb/>
            agency of Herodes the fifty Attic talents? In that matter <lb/>
            you have, I hear, roused great wrath on the part of Pompey. <lb/>
            For he thinks that you have snapped up money rightly his, <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            and that Caesar will be no less lavish in his building at the <lb/>
            Nemus Dianas.</p>
          <p>I was told all this by P. Vedius, a hare-brained fellow <lb/>
            enough, but yet an intimate friend of Pompey's. This <lb/>
            Vedius came to meet me with two chariots, and a carriage <lb/>
            and horses, and a sedan, and a large suite of servants, for <lb/>
            which last, if Curio has carried his law, he will have to <lb/>
            pay a toll of a hundred sestertii apiece. There was also <lb/>
            in a chariot a dog-headed baboon, as well as some wild <lb/>
            asses. I never saw a more extravagant fool. But the cream <lb/>
            of the whole is this. He stayed at Laodicea with Pompeius <lb/>
            Vindullus. There he deposited his properties when coming <lb/>
            to see me. Meanwhile Vindullus dies, and his property is <lb/>
            supposed to revert to Pompeius Magnus. Gaius Vennonius <lb/>
            comes to Vindullus's house: when, while putting a seal on all <lb/>
            goods, he comes across the baggage of Vedius. In this are <lb/>
            found five small portrait busts of married ladies, among <lb/>
            which is one of the wife of your friend—“ brute," indeed, to <lb/>
            be intimate with such a fellow! and of the wife of Lepidus— <lb/>
            as easy-going as his name to take this so calmly! I wanted <lb/>
            you to know these historiettes by the way; for we have <lb/>
            both a pretty taste in gossip. There is one other thing I <lb/>
            should like you to turn over in your mind. I am told that <lb/>
            Appius is building a propylaum at Eleusis. Should I be <lb/>
            foolishly vain if I also built one at the Academy? " I think <lb/>
            so,” you will say. Well, then, write and tell me that that is <lb/>
            your opinion. For myself, I am deeply attached to Athens <lb/>
            itself. I would like some memorial of myself to exist. I <lb/>
            loathe sham inscriptions on statues really representing other <lb/>
            people. But settle it as you please, and be kind enough to <lb/>
            inform me on what day the Roman mysteries fall, and how <lb/>
            you have passed the winter. Take care of your health. <lb/>

            rejoicing that your virtue, integrity, and energy, already <lb/>
            known at home in a most important crisis, when you were a <lb/>
            civilian, should be maintained abroad with the same pains- <lb/>
            taking care now that you have military command. Therefore <lb/>
            what I could conscientiously do in setting forth in laudatory <lb/>
            terms that the province had been defended by your wisdom; <lb/>
            that the kingdom of Ariobarzanes, as well as the king .him­ <lb/>
            self, had been preserved; and that the feelings of the allies <lb/>
            had been won back to loyalty to our empire-that I have <lb/>
            done by speech and vote. That a thanksgiving was decreed <lb/>
            I am glad, if you prefer our thanking the gods rather than <lb/>
            giving you the credit for a success which has been in no <lb/>
            respect left to chance, but has been secured for the Republic <lb/>
            by your own eminent prudence and self-control. But if you <lb/>
            think a thanksgiving to be a presumption in favour of a <lb/>
            triumph, and therefore prefer fortune having the credit <lb/>
            rather than yourself, let me remind you that a triumph does <lb/>
            not always follow a thanksgiving; and that it is an honour <lb/>
            much more brilliant than a triumph for the senate to declare <lb/>
            its opinion, that a province has been retained rather by the <lb/>
            uprightness and mildness of its governor, than by the <lb/>
            strength of an army or the favour of heaven: and that is <lb/>
            what I meant to express by my vote. And I write this to <lb/>
            you at greater length than I usually do write, because I wish <lb/>
            above all things that you should think of me as taking pains <lb/>
            to convince you, both that I have wished for you what I be­ <lb/>
            lieved to be for your highest honour, and am glad that you <lb/>
            have got what you preferred to it. Farewell: continue to <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>" RIGHT glad am I to be praised "-says Hector, I think, in <lb/>
            Nævius—“by thee, reverend senior, who hast thyself been <lb/>
            praised." For certainly praise is sweet that comes from <lb/>
            those who themselves have lived in high repute. For my­ <lb/>
            self, there is nothing I should not consider myself to have <lb/>
            attained either by the congratulation contained in your <lb/>
            letter, or the testimony borne to me in your senatorial speech: <lb/>
            and it was at once the highest compliment and the greatest <lb/>
            gratification to me, that you willingly conceded to friendship, <lb/>
            what you transparently conceded to truth. And if, I don't <lb/>
            say all, but if many were Catos in our state-in which it is a <lb/>
            matter of wonder that there is even one-what triumphal <lb/>
            chariot or laurel should I have compared with praise from <lb/>
            you ? For in regard to my feelings, and in view of the ideal <lb/>
            honesty and subtility of your judgment, nothing can be more <lb/>
            complimentary than the speech of yours, which has been <lb/>
            copied for me by my friends. But the reason of my wish, <lb/>
            for I will not call it desire, I have explained to you in a <lb/>
            former letter. And even if it does not appear to you to <lb/>
            be entirely sufficient, it at any rate leads to this conclusion <lb/>
            -not that the honour is one to excite excessive desire, <lb/>
            but yet is one which, if offered by the senate, ought certainly <lb/>
            not to be rejected. Now I hope that that House, considering <lb/>
            the labours I have undergone on behalf of the state, will not <lb/>
            think me undeserving of an honour, especially one that has <lb/>
            become a matter of usage. And if this turns out to be so, all <lb/>
            I ask of you is that-to use your own most friendly words- <lb/>
            since you have paid me what in your judgment is the highest <lb/>
            Compliment, you will still "be glad" if I have the good <lb/>
            fortune to get what I myself have preferred. For I per­ <lb/>
            ceive that you have acted, felt, and written in this sense: <lb/>
            and the facts themselves shew that the compliment paid me <lb/>
            of a supplicatio was agreeable to you, since your name ap­ <lb/>
            pears on the decree: for decrees of the senate of this nature <lb/>
            are, I am aware, usually drawn out by the warmest friends <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            of the man concerned in the honour. I shall, I hope, soon <lb/>
            see you, and may it be in a better state of political affairs <lb/>
            than my fears forebode!</p>

          </ab>
          <p>CICERO and his son greet Tiro warmly. We parted from <lb/>
            you, as you know, on the 2nd of November. We arrived <lb/>
            at Leucas on the 6th of November, on the 7th at Actium. <lb/>
            There we were detained till the 8th by a storm. Thence <lb/>
            on the 9th we arrived at Corcyra after a charming voyage. <lb/>
            At Corcyra we were detained by bad weather till the 15th. <lb/>
            On the 16th we continued our voyage to Cassiope, a harbor <lb/>
            of Corcyra, a distance of 120 stades. There we were de­ <lb/>
            tained by winds until the 22nd. Many of those who in this <lb/>
            interval impatiently attempted the crossing suffered ship­ <lb/>
            wreck. On the 22nd, after dinner, we weighed anchor. <lb/>
            Thence with a very gentle south wind and a clear sky, in <lb/>
            the course of that night and the next day we arrived in high <lb/>
            spirits on Italian soil at Hydrus, and with the same wind <lb/>
            next day-that is, the 24th of November-at 10 o'clock in <lb/>
            the morning we reached Brundisium, and exactly at the <lb/>
            same time as ourselves Terentia (who values you very <lb/>
            highly) made her entrance into the town. On the 26th, at <lb/>
            Brundisium, a slave of Cn. Plancius at length delivered to <lb/>
            me the ardently expected letter from you, dated the 13th of <lb/>
            November. It greatly lightened my anxiety: would that it <lb/>
            had entirely removed it! However, the physician Asclapo <lb/>
            positively asserts that you will shortly be well. What need <lb/>
            is there for me at this time of day to exhort you to take <lb/>
            every means to re-establish your health? I know your good <lb/>
            sense, temperate habits, and affection for me: I am sure <lb/>
            you will do everything you can to join me as soon as <lb/>
            possible. But though I wish this, I would not have you <lb/>
            hurry yourself in any way. I could have wished you had <lb/>
            shirked Lyso's concert, for fear of incurring a fourth fit of <lb/>
            your seven-day fever. But since you have preferred to con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            suit your politeness rather than your health, be careful for <lb/>
            the future. I have sent orders to Curius for a douceur to <lb/>
            be given to the physician, and that he should advance you <lb/>
            whatever you want, engaging to pay the money to any agent <lb/>
            he may name. I am leaving a horse and mule for you at <lb/>
            Brundisium.</p>
          <p>At Rome I fear that the ist of January will be <lb/>
            the beginning of serious disturbances. I shall take a <lb/>
            moderate line in all respects. It only remains to beg and <lb/>
            entreat you not to set sail rashly-seamen are wont to hurry <lb/>
            things for their own profit: be cautious, my dear Tiro: you <lb/>
            have a wide and difficult sea before you. If you can, start <lb/>
            with Mescinius; he is usually cautious about a sea passage: <lb/>
            if not, travel with some man of rank, whose position may <lb/>
            give him influence over the ship-owner. If you take every <lb/>
            precaution in this matter and present yourself to us safe and <lb/>
            sound, I shall want nothing more of you. Good-bye, again <lb/>
            and again, dear Tiro! I am writing with the greatest <lb/>
            earnestness about you to the physician, to Curius, and to <lb/>
            Lyso. Good-bye, and God bless you.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I WAS charmed with your letter, in which, first of all, what <lb/>
            I loved was the tenderness which prompted you to write, <lb/>
            in alarm lest Silius should by his news have caused me any <lb/>
            anxiety. About this news, not only had you written to <lb/>
            me before-in fact twice, one letter being a duplicate of <lb/>
            the other-shewing me clearly that you were upset, but I <lb/>
            also had answered you in full detail, in order that I might, <lb/>
            as far as such a business and such a crisis admitted, free <lb/>
            you from your anxiety, or at any rate alleviate it. But <lb/>
            since you shew in your last also how anxious you are about <lb/>
            that matter-make up your mind to this, my dear Pætus <lb/>
            that whatever could possibly be accomplished by art-for it <lb/>
            is not enough nowadays to contend with mere prudence, a <note type="footnote"> 8—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            sort of system must be elaborated-however, whatever could <lb/>
            be done or effected towards winning and securing the good­ <lb/>
            will of those men I have done, and not, I think, in vain. <lb/>
            For I receive such attentions, such politenesses from all <lb/>
            Caesar's favourites as make me believe myself beloved by <lb/>
            them. For, though genuine love is not easily distinguished <lb/>
            from feigned, unless some crisis occurs of a kind to test <lb/>
            faithful affection by its danger, as gold in the fire, there are <lb/>
            other indications of a general nature. But I only employ <lb/>
            one proof to convince me that I am loved from the heart <lb/>
            and in sincerity-namely, that my fortune and theirs is of <lb/>
            such a kind as to preclude any motive on their part for pre­ <lb/>
            tending. In regard, again, to the man who now possesses <lb/>
            all power, I see no reason for my being alarmed: except <lb/>
            the fact that, once depart from law, everything is uncertain; <lb/>
            and that nothing can be guaranteed as to the future which <lb/>
            depends on another man's will, not to say caprice. Be that <lb/>
            as it may, personally his feelings have in no respect been <lb/>
            wounded by me. For in that particular point I have ex­ <lb/>
            hibited the greatest self-control. For, as in old times I used <lb/>
            to reckon that to speak without reserve was a privilege of <lb/>
            mine, since to my exertions the existence of liberty in the <lb/>
            state was owing, so, now that that is lost, I think it is my <lb/>
            duty to say nothing calculated to offend either his wishes or <lb/>
            those of his favourites. But if I want to avoid the credit of <lb/>
            certain keen or witty epigrams, I must entirely abjure a <lb/>
            reputation for genius, which I would not refuse to do, if <lb/>
            I could. But after all Caesar himself has a very keen criti­ <lb/>
            cal faculty, and, just as your cousin Servius—whom I con­ <lb/>
            sider to have been a most accomplished man of letters-had <lb/>
            no difficulty in saying: "This verse is not Plautus's, this <lb/>
            is—” because he had acquired a sensitive ear by dint of <lb/>
            classifying the various styles of poets and habitual read­ <lb/>
            ing, so I am told that Caesar, having now completed his <lb/>
            volumes of bans mots, if anything is brought to him as <lb/>
            mine, which is not so, habitually rejects it. This he now <lb/>
            does all the more, because his intimates are in my company <lb/>
            almost every day. Now in tile course of our discursive talk <lb/>
            many remarks are let fall, which perhaps at the time of my <lb/>
            making them seem to them wanting neither in literary <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            flavour nor in piquancy. These are conveyed to him along <lb/>
            with the other news of the day: for so he himself directed. <lb/>
            Thus it comes about that if he is told of anything besides about <lb/>
            me, he considers that he ought not to listen to it. Where­ <lb/>
            fore I have no need of your (Enomaus, though your quota­ <lb/>
            tion of Accius's verses was very much on the spot. But what <lb/>
            is this jealousy, or what have I now of which anyone can be <lb/>
            jealous? But suppose the worst. I find that the philosophers, <lb/>
            who alone in my view grasp the true nature of virtue, hold <lb/>
            that the wise man does not pledge himself against anything <lb/>
            except doing wrong; and of this I consider myself clear in <lb/>
            two ways, first in that my veiws were most absolutely cor­ <lb/>
            rect; and second because, when I found that we had not <lb/>
            sufficient material force to maintain them, I was against a <lb/>
            trial of strength with the stronger party. Therefore, so far <lb/>
            as the duty of a good citizen is concerned, I am certainly <lb/>
            not open to reproach. What remains is that I should not <lb/>
            say or do anything foolish or rash against the men in power: <lb/>
            that too, I think, is the part of the wise man. As to the <lb/>
            rest-what this or that man may say that I said, or the <lb/>
            light in which he views it, or the amount of good faith with <lb/>
            which those who continually seek me out and pay me at­ <lb/>
            tention may be acting-for these things I cannot be re­ <lb/>
            sponsible. The result is that I console myself with the con­ <lb/>
            sciousness of my uprightness in the past and my moderation <lb/>
            in the present, and apply that simile of Accius's not to <lb/>
            jealousy, but to fortune, which I hold-as being incon­ <lb/>
            stant and frail-ought to be beaten back by a strong and <lb/>
            manly soul, as a wave is by a rock. For, considering that <lb/>
            Greek history is full of examples of how the wisest men en­ <lb/>
            dured tyrannies either at Athens or Syracuse, when, though <lb/>
            their countries were enslaved, they themselves in a certain <lb/>
            sense remained free—am I to believe that I cannot so main­ <lb/>
            tain my position as not to hurt anyone's feelings and yet not <lb/>
            blast my own character ?</p>
          <p>I now come to your jests, since as an afterpiece to <lb/>
            Accius's (Enomaus, you have brought on the stage, not, as <lb/>
            was his wont, an Atellan play, but, according to the pres­ <lb/>
            ent fashion, a mime. What's all this about a pilot-fish, <lb/>
            a denarius, and a dish of salt fish and cheese? In my old <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            easy-going days I put up with that sort of thing: but times <lb/>
            are changed. Hirtius and Dolabella are my pupils in rhet­ <lb/>
            oric, but my masters in the art of dining. For I think <lb/>
            you must have heard, if you really get all news, that their <lb/>
            practice is to declaim at my house, and mine to dine at <lb/>
            theirs. Now it is no use your making an affidavit of insol­ <lb/>
            vency to me: for when you had some property, petty profits <lb/>
            used to keep you a little too close to business; but as <lb/>
            things are now, seeing that you are losing money so cheer­ <lb/>
            fully, all you have to do, when entertaining me, is to regard <lb/>
            yourself as accepting a "composition"; and even that loss <lb/>
            is less annoying when it comes from a friend than from a <lb/>
            debtor. Yet, after all, I don't require dinners superfluous <lb/>
            in quantity: only let what there is be first-rate in quality <lb/>
            and recherché. I remember you used to tell me stories of <lb/>
            Phamea's dinner. Let yours be earlier, but in other re­ <lb/>
            spects like that. But if you persist in bringing me back <lb/>
            to a dinner like your mother's, I should put up with that <lb/>
            also. For I should like to see the man who had the face <lb/>
            to put on the table for me what you describe, or even a <lb/>
            polypus-looking as red as Iupiter Miniatus. Believe me, <lb/>
            you won't dare. Before I arrive the fame of my new mag­ <lb/>
            nificence will reach you: and you will be awestruck at it. <lb/>
            Yet it is no use building any hope on your hors d'œuvre. I <lb/>
            have quite abolished that: for in old times I found my ap­ <lb/>
            petite spoilt by your olives and Lucanian sausages. But <lb/>
            why all this talk? Let me only get to you. By all means­ <lb/>
            for I wish to wipe away all fear from your heart-go <lb/>
            back to your old cheese-and-sardine dish. The only ex­ <lb/>
            pense I shall cause you will be that you will have to have <lb/>
            the bath heated. All the rest according to my regular <lb/>
            habits. What I have just been saying was all a joke.</p>
          <p>As to Selicius's villa, you have managed the business <lb/>
            carefully and written most wittily. So I think I won't buy. <lb/>
            For there is enough salt and not enough savour.</p><pb n="165"/>

          </ab>
          <p>BEING quite at leisure in my Tusculan villa, because I had <lb/>
            sent my pupils to meet him, that they might at the same <lb/>
            time present me in as favourable a light as possible to their <lb/>
            friend, I received your most delightful letter, from which <lb/>
            I learnt that you approved my idea of having begun-now <lb/>
            that legal proceedings are abolished and my old supremacy <lb/>
            in the forum is lost-to keep a kind of school, just as Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius, when expelled from Syracuse, is said to have opened <lb/>
            . a school at Corinth. In short, I too am delighted with the <lb/>
            idea, for I secure many advantages. First and foremost, I <lb/>
            am strengthening my position in view of the present crisis, <lb/>
            and that is of primary importance at this time. How much <lb/>
            that amounts to I don't know: I only see that as at present <lb/>
            advised I prefer no one's policy to this, unless, of course, it <lb/>
            had been better to have died. In one's own bed, I confess <lb/>
            it might have been, but that did not occur: and as to the <lb/>
            field of battle, I was not there. The rest indeed-Pompey, <lb/>
            your friend Lentulus, Afranius—perished ingloriously. But, <lb/>
            it may be said, Cato died a noble death. Well, that at any <lb/>
            rate is in our power when we will: let us only do our best <lb/>
            to prevent its being as necessary to us as it was to him. <lb/>
            That is what I am doing. So that is the first thing I had to <lb/>
            say. The next is this: I am improving, in the first place in <lb/>
            health, which I had lost from giving up all exercise of my <lb/>
            lungs. In the second place, my oratorical faculty, such as it <lb/>
            was, would have completely dried up, had I not gone back to <lb/>
            these exercises. The last thing I have to say, which I rather <lb/>
            think you will consider most important of all, is this: I have <lb/>
            now demolished more peacocks than you have young <lb/>
            pigeons! You there revel in Haterian law-sauce, I here in <lb/>
            Hirtian hot-sauce. Come then, if you are half a man, and <lb/>
            learn from me the maxims which you seek: yet it is a case <lb/>
            of "a pig teaching Minerva." But it will be my business to <lb/>
            see to that: as for you, if you can't find purchasers for your <lb/>
            foreclosures and so fill your pot with denarii, back you <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            must come to Rome. It is better to die of indigestion here, <lb/>
            than of starvation there. I see you have lost money: I hope <lb/>
            these friends of yours have done the same. You are a <lb/>
            ruined man if you don't look out. You may possibly get to <lb/>
            Rome on the only mule that you say you have left, since <lb/>
            you have eaten up your pack horse. Your seat in the <lb/>
            school, as second master, will be next to mine: the honour <lb/>
            of a cushion will come by-and-by.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I WAS doubly charmed by your letter, first because it made <lb/>
            me laugh myself, and secondly because I saw that you could <lb/>
            still laugh. Nor did I in the least object to being over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with your shafts of ridicule, as though I were a <lb/>
            light skirmisher in the war of wits. What I am vexed at is <lb/>
            that I have not been able, as I intended, to run over to see <lb/>
            you: for you would not have had a mere guest, but a <lb/>
            brother-in-arms. And such a hero! not the man whom you <lb/>
            used to do for by the hors d'ceuvre. I now bring an un­ <lb/>
            impaired appetite to the egg, and so the fight is maintained <lb/>
            right up to the roast veal. The compliments you used to <lb/>
            pay me in old times—“What a contented person!" "What <lb/>
            an easy guest to entertain!”—are things of the past. All my <lb/>
            anxiety about the good of the state, all meditating of <lb/>
            speeches to be delivered in the senate, all getting up of <lb/>
            briefs I have cast to the winds. I have thrown myself into <lb/>
            the camp of my old enemy Epicurus—not, however, with <lb/>
            a view to the extravagance of the present day, but to that <lb/>
            refined splendour of yours—I mean your old style when <lb/>
            you had money to spend (though you never had more <lb/>
            landed estate). Therefore prepare! You have to deal <lb/>
            with a man, who not only has a large appetite, but who <lb/>
            also knows a thing or two. You are aware of the ex­ <lb/>
            travagance of your bourgeois gentilhomme. You must for­ <lb/>
            get all your little baskets and your omelettes. I am now <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            so far advanced in the art that I frequently venture to ask <lb/>
            your friend Verrius and Camillus to dinner-what dandies! <lb/>
            how fastidious! But think of my audacity: I even gave <lb/>
            Hirtius a dinner, without a peacock however. In that dinner <lb/>
            my cook could not imitate him in anything but the hot <lb/>
            sauce.</p>
          <p>So this is my way of life nowadays: in the morning I re­ <lb/>
            ceive not only a large number of "loyalists," who, how­ <lb/>
            ever, look gloomy enough, but also our exultant conquerors <lb/>
            here, who in my case are quite prodigal in polite and affec­ <lb/>
            tionate attentions. When the stream of morning callers has <lb/>
            ebbed, I wrap myself up in my books, either writing or <lb/>
            reading. There are also some visitors who listen to my <lb/>
            discourses under the belief of my being a man of learning, <lb/>
            because I am a trifle more learned than themselves. After <lb/>
            that all my time is given to my bodily comfort. I have <lb/>
            mourned for my country more deeply and longer than any <lb/>
            mother for her only son. But take care, if you love me, to <lb/>
            keep your health, lest I should take advantage of your be­ <lb/>
            ing laid up to eat you out of house and home. For I am <lb/>
            resolved not to spare you even when you are ill.</p>

            <title type="sub">XXVI To AULUS CECINA (IN EXILE) ROME (SEPTEMBER)</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I AM afraid you may think me remiss in my attentions to <lb/>
            you, which, in view of our close union resulting from many <lb/>
            mutual services and kindred tastes, ought never to be lack­ <lb/>
            ing. In spite of that I fear you do find me wanting in the <lb/>
            matter of writing. The fact is, I would have sent you a <lb/>
            letter long ago and on frequent occasions, had I not, from <lb/>
            expecting day after day to have some better news for you, <lb/>
            wished to fill my letter with congratulation rather than with <lb/>
            exhortations to courage. As it is, I shall shortly, I hope, have <lb/>
            to congratulate you: and so I put off that subject for a <lb/>
            letter to another time. But in this letter I think that your <lb/>
            courage-which I am told and hope is not at all shaken— <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            ought to be repeatedly braced by the authority of a man, <lb/>
            who, if not the wisest in the world, is yet the most devoted <lb/>
            to you: and that not with such words as I should use to <lb/>
            console one utterly crushed and bereft of all hope of restora­ <lb/>
            tion, but as to one of whose rehabilitation I have no more <lb/>
            doubt than I remember that you had of mine. For when <lb/>
            those men had driven me from the Republic, who thought <lb/>
            that it could not fall while I was on my feet, I remember <lb/>
            hearing from many visitors from Asia, in which country <lb/>
            you then were, that you were emphatic as to my glorious <lb/>
            and rapid restoration. If that system, so to speak, of Tuscan <lb/>
            augury which you had inherited from your noble and ex­ <lb/>
            cellent father did not deceive you, neither will our power of <lb/>
            divination deceive me; which I have acquired from the <lb/>
            writings and maxims of the greatest savants, and, as you <lb/>
            know, by a very diligent study of their teaching, as well as <lb/>
            by an extensive experience in managing public business, <lb/>
            and from the great vicissitudes of fortune which I have en­ <lb/>
            countered. And this divination I am the more inclined to <lb/>
            trust, from the fact that it never once deceived me in the <lb/>
            late troubles, in spite of their obscurity and confusion. I <lb/>
            would have told you what events I foretold, were I not <lb/>
            afraid to be thought to be making up a story after the event <lb/>
            Yet, after all, I have numberless witnesses to the fact that I <lb/>
            warned Pompey not to form a union with Caesar, and after­ <lb/>
            wards not to sever it. By this union I saw that the power <lb/>
            of the senate would be broken, by its severance a civil war <lb/>
            be provoked. And yet I was very intimate with Caesar, and <lb/>
            had a very great regard for Pompey, but my advice was <lb/>
            at once loyal to Pompey and in the best interests of both <lb/>
            alike. My other predictions I pass over; for I would not <lb/>
            have Caesar think that I gave Pompey advice, by which, if <lb/>
            he had followed it, Caesar himself would have now been a <lb/>
            man of illustrious character in the state indeed, and the first <lb/>
            man in it, but yet not in possession of the great power he <lb/>
            now wields. I gave it as my opinion that he should go to <lb/>
            Spain; and if he had done so, there would have been no <lb/>
            civil war at all. That Caesar should be allowed to stand for <lb/>
            the consulship in his absence I did not so much contend to <lb/>
            be constitutional, as that, since the law had been passed by <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            the people at the instance of Pompey himself when consul, <lb/>
            it should be done. The pretext for hostilities was given. <lb/>
            What advice or remonstrance did I omit, when urging that <lb/>
            any peace, even the most inequitable, should be preferred to <lb/>
            the most righteous war? My advice was overruled, not so <lb/>
            much by Pompey-for he was affected by it-as by those <lb/>
            who, relying on him as a military leader, thought that a <lb/>
            victory in that war would be highly conducive to their <lb/>
            private interests and personal ambitions. The war was <lb/>
            begun without my taking any active part in it; it was <lb/>
            forcibly removed from Italy, while I remained there as long <lb/>
            as I could. But honour had greater weight with me than <lb/>
            fear: I had scruples about failing to support Pompey's <lb/>
            safety, when on a certain occasion he had not failed to sup­ <lb/>
            port mine. Accordingly, overpowered by a feeling of duty, <lb/>
            or by what the loyalists would say, or by a regard for <lb/>
            my honor—whichever you please-like Amphiarus in the <lb/>
            play, I went deliberately, and fully aware of what I was <lb/>
            doing, "to ruin full displayed before my eyes." In this <lb/>
            war there was not a single disaster that I did not foretell. <lb/>
            Therefore, since, after the manner of augurs and astrolo­ <lb/>
            gers, I too, as a state augur, have by my previous pre­ <lb/>
            dictions established the credit of my prophetic power and <lb/>
            knowledge of divination in your eyes, my prediction will <lb/>
            justly claim to be believed. Well, then, the prophecy I now <lb/>
            give you does not rest on the flight of a bird nor the note <lb/>
            of a bird of good omen on the left-according to the system <lb/>
            of our augural college-nor from the normal and audible <lb/>
            pattering of the corn of the sacred chickens. I have other <lb/>
            signs to note; and if they are not more infallible than those, <lb/>
            yet after all they are less obscure or misleading. Now <lb/>
            omens as to the future are observed by me in what I may <lb/>
            call a twofold method: the one I deduce from Caesar him­ <lb/>
            self, the other from the nature and complexion of the po­ <lb/>
            litical situation. Caesar's characteristics are these: a dispo­ <lb/>
            sition naturally placable and clement-as delineated in your <lb/>
            brilliant book of “Grievances”—and a great liking also for <lb/>
            superior talent, such as your own. Besides this, he is re­ <lb/>
            lenting at the expressed wishes of a large number of your <lb/>
            friends, which are well-grounded and inspired by affection, <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            not hollow and self-seeking. Under this head the unani­ <lb/>
            mous feeling of Etruria will have great influence on him.</p>
          <p>Why, then—you may ask—have these things as yet had <lb/>
            no effect? Why, because he thinks if he grants you yours, <lb/>
            he cannot resist the applications of numerous petitioners <lb/>
            with whom to all appearance he has juster grounds for <lb/>
            anger. "What hope, then," you will say, "from an angry <lb/>
            man?" Why, he knows very well that he will draw deep <lb/>
            draughts of praise from the same fountain, from which he <lb/>
            has been already-though sparingly-bespattered. Lastly, <lb/>
            he is a man very acute and farseeing: he knows very well <lb/>
            that a man like you—far and away the greatest noble in an <lb/>
            important district of Italy, and in the state at large the equal <lb/>
            of anyone of your generation, however eminent, whether <lb/>
            in ability or popularity or reputation among the Roman <lb/>
            people-cannot much longer be debarred from taking part <lb/>
            in public affairs. He will be unwilling that you should, as <lb/>
            you would sooner or later, have time to thank for this rather <lb/>
            than his favour.</p>
          <p>So much for Caesar. Now I will speak of the nature of <lb/>
            the actual situation. There is no one so bitterly opposed <lb/>
            to the cause, which Pompey undertook with better inten­ <lb/>
            tions than provisions, as to venture to call us bad citizens <lb/>
            or dishonest men. On this head I am always struck with <lb/>
            astonishment at Caesar's sobriety, fairness, and wisdom. He <lb/>
            never speaks of Pompey except in the most respectful terms. <lb/>
            "But," you will say, "in regard to him as a public man his <lb/>
            actions have often been bitter enough." Those were acts <lb/>
            of war and victory, not of Caesar. But see with what open <lb/>
            arms he has received us! Cassius he has made his legate; <lb/>
            Brutus governor of Gaul; Sulpicius of Greece; Marcellus, <lb/>
            with whom he was more angry than with anyone, he has re­ <lb/>
            stored with the utmost consideration for his rank. To what, <lb/>
            then, does all this tend? The nature of things and of the <lb/>
            political situation will not suffer, nor will any constitutional <lb/>
            theory—whether it remain as it is or is changed-permit, <lb/>
            first, that the civil and personal position of all should not <lb/>
            be alike when the merits of their cases are the same; and, <lb/>
            secondly, that good men and good citizens of unblemished <lb/>
            character should not return to a state, into which so many <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            have returned after having been condemned of atrocious <lb/>
            crimes.</p>
          <p>That is my prediction. If I had felt any doubt about it <lb/>
            I would not have employed it in preference to a consolation <lb/>
            which would have easily enabled me to support a man of <lb/>
            spirit. It is this. If you had taken up arms for the Republic <lb/>
            -for so you then thought-with the full assurance of vic­ <lb/>
            tory, you would not deserve special commendation. But if, <lb/>
            in view of the uncertainty attaching to all wars, you had <lb/>
            taken into consideration the possibility of our being beaten, <lb/>
            you ought not, while fully prepared to face success, to <lb/>
            be yet utterly unable to endure failure. I would have urged <lb/>
            also what a consolation the consciousness of your action, <lb/>
            what a delightful distraction in adversity, literature ought <lb/>
            to be. I would have recalled to your mind the signal dis­ <lb/>
            asters not only of men of old times, but of those of our own <lb/>
            day also, whether they were your leaders or your comrades. <lb/>
            I would even have named many cases of illustrious for­ <lb/>
            eigners: for the recollection of what I may call a common <lb/>
            law and of the conditions of human existence softens grief. <lb/>
            I would also have explained the nature of our life here in <lb/>
            Rome, how bewildering the disorder, how universal the <lb/>
            chaos: for it must needs cause less regret to be absent from <lb/>
            a state in disruption, than from one well-ordered. But <lb/>
            there is no occasion for anything of this sort. I shall soon <lb/>
            see you, as I hope, or rather as I clearly perceive, in en­ <lb/>
            joyment of your civil rights. Meanwhile, to you in your <lb/>
            absence, as also to your son who is here-the express image <lb/>
            of your soul and person, and a man of unsurpassable firm­ <lb/>
            ness and excellence—I have long ere this both promised and <lb/>
            tendered practically my zeal, duty, exertions, and labours: <lb/>
            all the more so now that Caesar daily receives me with more <lb/>
            open arms, while his intimate friends distinguish me above <lb/>
            everyone. Any influence or favour I may gain with him <lb/>
            I will employ in your service. Be sure, for your part, to sup­ <lb/>
            port yourself not only with courage, but also with the bright­ <lb/>
            est hopes.</p><pb n="172"/>

            <title type="sub">XXVII SERVIUS SULPICIUS TO CICERO (AT AsTURA) ATHENS (MARCH)</title>
          </ab>
          <p>WHEN I received the news of your daughter Tullia's <lb/>
            death, I was indeed much grieved and distressed as I was <lb/>
            bound to be, and looked upon it as a calamity in which I <lb/>
            shared. For, if I had been at home, I should not have failed <lb/>
            to be at your side, and should have made my sorrow plain <lb/>
            to you face to face. That kind of consolation involves much <lb/>
            distress and pain, because the relations and friends, whose <lb/>
            part it is to offer it, are themselves overcome by an equal sor­ <lb/>
            row. They cannot attempt it without many tears, so that <lb/>
            they seem to require consolation themselves rather than to <lb/>
            be able to afford it to others. Still I have decided to set <lb/>
            down briefly for your benefit such thoughts as have occurred <lb/>
            to my mind, not because I suppose them to be unknown <lb/>
            to you, but because your sorrow may perhaps hinder you <lb/>
            from being so keenly alive to them.</p>
          <p>Why is it that a private grief should agitate you so deeply? <lb/>
            Think how fortune has hitherto dealt with us. Reflect that <lb/>
            we have had snatched from us what ought to be no less <lb/>
            dear to human beings than their children-country , honour, <lb/>
            rank, every political distinction. What additional wound to <lb/>
            your feelings could be inflicted by this particular loss? Or <lb/>
            where is the heart that should not by this time have lost all <lb/>
            sensibility and learn to regard everything else as of minor <lb/>
            importance? Is it on her account, pray, that you sorrow? <lb/>
            How many times have you recurred to the thought-and I <lb/>
            have often been struck with the same idea-that in times <lb/>
            like these theirs is far from being the worst fate to whom it <lb/>
            has been granted to exchange life for a painless death? <lb/>
            Now what was there at such an epoch that could greatly <lb/>
            tempt her to live? What scope, what hope, what hearts <lb/>
            solace? That she might spend her life with some young <lb/>
            and distinguished husband? How impossible for a man of <lb/>
            your rank to select from the present generation of young <lb/>
            men a son-in-law, to whose honour you might think your­ <lb/>
            self safe in trusting your child! Was it that she might bear <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            children to cheer her with the sight of their vigorous youth? <lb/>
            who might by their own character maintain the position <lb/>
            handed down to them by their parent, might be expected to <lb/>
            stand for the offices in their order, might exercise their <lb/>
            freedom in supporting their friends? What single one of <lb/>
            these prospects has not been taken away before it was given? <lb/>
            But, it will be said, after all it is an evil to lose one's <lb/>
            children. Yes, it is: only it is a worse one to endure and <lb/>
            submit to the present state of things.</p>
          <p>I wish to mention to you a circumstance which gave me <lb/>
            no common consolation, on the chance of its also proving <lb/>
            capable of diminishing your sorrow. On my voyage from <lb/>
            Asia, as I was sailing from Ægina towards Megara, I began <lb/>
            to survey the localities that were on every side of me. Be­ <lb/>
            hind me was Ægina, in front Megara, on the right Piraeus, <lb/>
            on my left Corinth: towns which at one time were most <lb/>
            flourishing, but now lay before my eyes in ruin and decay. <lb/>
            I began to reflect to myself thus: "Hah! do we mannikins <lb/>
            feel rebellious if one of us perishes or is killed—we whose <lb/>
            life ought to be still shorter-when the corpses of so many <lb/>
            towns lie in helpless ruin ? Will you please, Servius, restrain <lb/>
            yourself and recollect that you are born a mortal man?" <lb/>
            Believe me, I was no little strengthened by that reflection. <lb/>
            Now take the trouble, if you agree with me, to put this <lb/>
            thought before your eyes. Not long ago all those most <lb/>
            illustrious men perished at one blow: the empire of the <lb/>
            Roman people suffered that huge loss: all the provinces <lb/>
            were shaken to their foundations. If you have become the <lb/>
            poorer by the frail spirit of one poor girl, are you agitated <lb/>
            thus violently? If she had not died now, she would yet <lb/>
            have had to die a few years hence, for she was mortal born. <lb/>
            You, too, withdraw soul and thought from such things and <lb/>
            rather remember those which become the part you have <lb/>
            played in life: that she lived as long as life had anything to <lb/>
            give her; that her life outlasted that of the Republic; that <lb/>
            she lived to see you—her own father—prætor, consul, and <lb/>
            augur; that she married young men of the highest rank; <lb/>
            that she had enjoyed nearly every possible blessing; that, <lb/>
            when the Republic fell, she departed from life. What fault <lb/>
            have you or she to find with fortune on this score? In fine, <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            do not forget that yott are Cicero, and a man accustomed <lb/>
            to instruct and advise others; and do not imitate bad <lb/>
            physicians, who in the diseases of others profess to under­ <lb/>
            stand the art of healing, but are unable to prescribe for <lb/>
            themselves. Rather suggest to yourself and bring home to <lb/>
            your own mind the very maxims which you are accustomed <lb/>
            to impress upon others. There is no sorrow beyond the <lb/>
            power of time at length to diminish and soften: it is a re­ <lb/>
            flexion on you that you should wait for this period, and not <lb/>
            rather anticipate that result by the aid of your wisdom. But <lb/>
            if here is any consciousness still existing in the world below, <lb/>
            such was her love for you and her dutiful affection for all <lb/>
            her family, that she certainly does not wish you to act as you <lb/>
            are acting. Grant this to her-your lost one! Grant it <lb/>
            to your friends and comrades who mourn with you in your <lb/>
            sorrow! Grant it to your country, that if the need arises <lb/>
            she may have the use of your services and advice.</p>
          <p>Finally-since we are reduced by fortune to the neces­ <lb/>
            sity of taking precautions on this point also-do not allow <lb/>
            anyone to think that you are not mourning so much for your <lb/>
            daughter as for the state of public affairs and the victory <lb/>
            of others. I am ashamed to say any more to you on this <lb/>
            subject, lest I should appear to distrust your wisdom. There­ <lb/>
            fore I will only make one suggestion before bringing my <lb/>
            letter to an end. We have seen you on many occasions <lb/>
            bear good fortune with a noble dignity which greatly en­ <lb/>
            hanced your fame: now is the time for you to convince <lb/>
            us that you are able to bear bad fortune equally well, and <lb/>
            that it does not appear to you to be a heavier burden than <lb/>
            you ought to think it. I would not have this to be the only <lb/>
            one of all the virtues that you do not possess.</p>
          <p>As far as I am concerned, when I learn that your mind <lb/>
            is more composed, I will write you an account of what is <lb/>
            going on here, and of the condition of the province. <lb/>
            Good-bye.</p><pb n="175"/>

            <title type="sub">XXVIII To SERVIUS SULPICIUS RUFUS (IN ACHAIA)' FICULEA (APRIL)</title>
          </ab>
          <p>YES, indeed, my dear Servius, I would have wished-as <lb/>
            you say-that you had been by my side at the time of my <lb/>
            grievous loss. How much help your presence might have <lb/>
            given me, both by consolation and by your taking an almost <lb/>
            equal share in my sorrow, I can easily gather from the fact <lb/>
            that after reading your letter I experienced a great feeling <lb/>
            of relief. For not only was what you wrote calculated to <lb/>
            soothe a mourner, but in offering me consolation you <lb/>
            manifested no slight sorrow of heart yourself. Yet, after all, <lb/>
            your son Servius by all the kindness of which such a <lb/>
            time admitted made it evident, both how much he person­ <lb/>
            ally valued me, and how gratifying to you he thought such <lb/>
            affection for me would be. His kind offices have of course <lb/>
            often been pleasanter to me, yet never more acceptable. <lb/>
            For myself again, it is not only your words and (I had <lb/>
            almost said) your partnership in my sorrow that consoles <lb/>
            me, it is your character also. For I think it a disgrace that <lb/>
            I should not bear my loss as you—a man of such wisdom- <lb/>
            think it should be borne. But at times I am taken by sur­ <lb/>
            prise and scarcely offer any resistance to my grief, because <lb/>
            those consolations fail me, which were not wanting in a <lb/>
            similar misfortune to those others, whose examples I put <lb/>
            before my eyes. For instance, Quintus Maximus, who lost <lb/>
            a son who had been consul and was of illustrious character <lb/>
            and brilliant achievements, and Lucius Paullus, who lost <lb/>
            two within seven days, and your kinsman Gallus and M. <lb/>
            Cato, who each lost a son of the highest character and <lb/>
            valour,-all lived in circumstances which permitted their <lb/>
            own great position, earned by their public services, to as­ <lb/>
            suage their grief. In my case, after losing the honours <lb/>
            which you yourself mention, and which I had gained by the <lb/>
            greatest possible exertions, there was only that one solace <lb/>
            left which has now been torn away. My sad musings were <lb/>
            not interrupted by the business of my friends, nor by the <lb/>
            management of public affairs: there was nothing I cared <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            to do in the forum: I could not bear the sight of the senate- <lb/>
            house; I thought-as was the fact-that I had lost all the <lb/>
            fruits both of my industry and of fortune. But while I <lb/>
            thought that I shared these losses with you and certain others, <lb/>
            and while I was conquering my feelings and forcing myself <lb/>
            to bear them with patience, I had a refuge, one bosom where <lb/>
            I could find repose, one in whose conversation and sweet­ <lb/>
            ness I could lay aside all anxieties and sorrows. But now, <lb/>
            after such a crushing blow as this, the wounds which seemed <lb/>
            to have healed break out afresh. For there is no republic <lb/>
            now to offer me a refuge and a consolation by its good for­ <lb/>
            tunes when I leave my home in sorrow, as there once was a <lb/>
            home to receive me when I returned saddened by the state <lb/>
            of public affairs. Hence I absent myself both from home <lb/>
            and forum, because home can no longer console the sorrow <lb/>
            which public affairs cause me, nor public affairs that which <lb/>
            I suffer at home. All the more I look forward to your com­ <lb/>
            ing, and long to see you as soon as possible. No reasoning <lb/>
            can give me greater solace than a renewal of our inter­ <lb/>
            course and conversation. However, I hope your arrival <lb/>
            is approaching, for that is what I am told. For myself, <lb/>
            while I have many reasons for wishing to see you as soon <lb/>
            as possible, there is this one especially-that we may discuss <lb/>
            beforehand on what principles we should live through this <lb/>
            period of entire submission to the will of one man who is at <lb/>
            once wise and liberal, far, as I think I perceive, from being <lb/>
            hostile to me, and very friendly to you. But though that <lb/>
            is so, yet it is a matter for serious thought what plans, I <lb/>
            don't say of action, but of passing a quiet life by his leave <lb/>
            and kindness, we should adopt. Good-bye.</p>

            Caesar himself to dine in. Two thousand men, if you please! <lb/>
            I was in a great taking as to what was to happen the next <lb/>
            day; and so Cassius Barba came to my aid and gave me <lb/>
            guards. A camp was pitched in the open, the villa was <lb/>
            put in a state of defence. He stayed with Philippus on the <lb/>
            third day of the Saturnalia till one o'clock, without admitting <lb/>
            anyone. He was engaged on his accounts, I think, with <lb/>
            Balbus. Then he took a walk on the beach. After two he <lb/>
            went to the bath. Then he heard about Mamurra without <lb/>
            changing countenance. He was anointed: took his place at <lb/>
            the table. He was under a course of emetics, and so ate and <lb/>
            drank without scruple and as suited his taste. It was a very <lb/>
            good dinner, and well served, and not only so, but <lb/>
            "Well cooked, well seasoned food, with rare discourse: <lb/>
            A banquet in a word to cheer the heart.” <lb/>
            Besides this, the staff were entertained in three rooms in a <lb/>
            very liberal style. The freedmen of lower rank and the <lb/>
            slaves had everything they could want. But the upper sort <lb/>
            had a really recherché dinner. In fact, I shewed that I <lb/>
            was somebody. However, he is not a guest to whom one <lb/>
            would say, "Pray look me up again on your way back." <lb/>
            Once is enough. We didn't say a word about politics. There <lb/>
            was plenty of literary talk. In short, he was pleased and <lb/>
            enjoyed himself. He said he should stay one day at Puteoli, <lb/>
            another at Baiæ. That's the story of the entertainment, or I <lb/>
            might call it the billeting on me—trying to the temper, but <lb/>
            not seriously inconvenient. I am staying on here for a <lb/>
            short time and then go to Tusculum. When he was passing <lb/>
            Dolabella's villa, the whole guard formed up on the right <lb/>
            and left of his horse, and nowhere else. This I was told <lb/>
            by Nicias.</p><pb n="178"/>

            <title type="sub">XXX To ATTICUS (AT ROME) MATIUS'S SUBURBAN VILLA, 7 APRIL</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE come on a visit to the man, of whom J was talking <lb/>
            to you this morning. His view is that "the state of things <lb/>
            is perfectly shocking: that there is no way out of the em­ <lb/>
            broglio. For if a man of Caesar's genius failed, who can <lb/>
            hope to succeed?" In short, he says that the ruin is com­ <lb/>
            plete. I am not sure that he is wrong; but then he rejoices <lb/>
            in it, and declares that within twenty days there will be a <lb/>
            rising in Gaul: that he has not had any conversation with <lb/>
            anyone except Lepidus since the Ides of March: finally <lb/>
            that these things can't pass off like this. What a wise <lb/>
            man Oppius is, who regrets Caesar quite as much, but yet <lb/>
            says nothing that can offend any loyalist! But enough of <lb/>
            this. Pray don't be idle about writing me word of any­ <lb/>
            thing new, for I expect a great deal. Among other things, <lb/>
            whether we can rely on Sextus Pompeius; but above all <lb/>
            about our friend Brutus, of whom my host says that Caesar <lb/>
            was in the habit of remarking: "It is of great importance <lb/>
            what that man wishes; at any rate, whatever he wishes <lb/>
            he wishes strongly": and that he noticed, when he was <lb/>
            pleading for Deiotarus at Nicæa, that he seemed to speak <lb/>
            with great spirit and freedom. Also-for I like to jot down <lb/>
            things as they occur to me—that when on the request of <lb/>
            Sestius I went to Caesar's house, and was sitting waiting till <lb/>
            I was called in, he remarked: "Can I doubt that I am ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly disliked, when Marcus Cicero has to sit waiting <lb/>
            and cannot see me at his own convenience? And yet if <lb/>
            there is a good-natured man in the world it is he; still I feel <lb/>
            no doubt that he heartily dislikes me." This and a good <lb/>
            deal of the same sort. But to my purpose. Whatever the <lb/>
            news, small as well as great, write and tell me of it. I will <lb/>
            on my side let nothing pass.</p><pb n="179"/>

          <p>CONFOUND Lucius Antonius, if he makes himself trouble­ <lb/>
            some to the Buthrotians! I have drawn out a deposition <lb/>
            which shall be signed and sealed whenever you please. As <lb/>
            for the money of the Arpinates, if the ædile L. Fadius asks <lb/>
            for it, pay him back every farthing. In a previous letter I <lb/>
            mentioned to you a sum of no sestertia to be paid to Statics. <lb/>
            If, then, Fadius applies for the money, I wish it paid to <lb/>
            him, and to no one except Fadius. I think that amount <lb/>
            was put into my hands, and I have written to Eros to pro­ <lb/>
            duce it.</p>
          <p>I can't stand the Queen: and the voucher for her prom­ <lb/>
            ises, Hammonius, knows that I have good cause for saying <lb/>
            so. What she promised, indeed, were all things of the <lb/>
            learned sort and suitable to my character-such as I could <lb/>
            avow even in a public meeting. As for Sara, besides find­ <lb/>
            ing him to be an unprincipled rascal, I also found him in­ <lb/>
            clined to give himself airs to me. I only saw him once at <lb/>
            my house. And when I asked him politely what I could do <lb/>
            for him, he said that he had come in hopes of finding Atticus. <lb/>
            The Queen's insolence, too, when she was living in Caesar's <lb/>
            trans-Tiberine villa, I cannot recall without a pang. I won't <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            have anything to do therefore with that lot. They think <lb/>
            not so much that I have no spirit, as- that I have scarcely <lb/>
            any proper pride at all. My leaving Italy is hindered by <lb/>
            Eros's way of doing business. For whereas from the bal­ <lb/>
            ances struck by him on the 5th of April I ought to be well <lb/>
            off, I am obliged to borrow, while the receipts from those <lb/>
            paying properties of mine I think have been put aside for <lb/>
            building the shrine. But I have charged Tiro to see to all <lb/>
            this, whom I am sending to Rome for the express purpose.</p>
          <p>I did not wish to add to your existing embarrassments. <lb/>
            The steadier the conduct of my son, the more I am vexed <lb/>
            at his being hampered. For he never mentioned the sub­ <lb/>
            ject to me—the first person to whom he should have done so. <lb/>
            But he said in a letter to Tiro that he had received nothing <lb/>
            since the 1st of April-for that was the end of his financial <lb/>
            year. Now I know that your own kind feeling always caused <lb/>
            you to be of opinion that he ought to be treated not only <lb/>
            with liberality, but with splendour and generosity, and that <lb/>
            you also considered that to be due to my position. Where­ <lb/>
            fore pray see—I would not have troubled you if I could <lb/>
            have done it through anyone else-that he has a bill of ex­ <lb/>
            change at Athens for his year's allowance. Eros will pay <lb/>
            you the money. I am sending Tiro on that business. Pray <lb/>
            therefore see to it, and write and tell me any idea you may <lb/>

          <p>You jeered at me yesterday amidst our cups, for having said <lb/>
            that it was a disputed point whether an heir could lawfully <lb/>
            prosecute on an embezzlement which had been committed <lb/>
            before he became the owner. Accordingly, though I returned <lb/>
            home full of wine and late in the evening, I marked the <lb/>
            section in which that question is treated and caused it to be <lb/>
            copied out and sent to you. I wanted to convince you that <lb/>
            the doctrine which you said was held by no one was main­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>AFTER I had been anxiously expecting letter-carriers day <lb/>
            after day, at length they arrived forty-six days after they left <lb/>
            you. Their arrival was most welcome to me: for while I <lb/>
            took the greatest possible pleasure in the letter of the kindest <lb/>
            and most beloved of fathers, still your most delightful letter <lb/>
            put a finishing stroke to my joy. So I no longer repent <lb/>
            of having suspended writing for a time, but am rather re­ <lb/>
            joiced at it; for I have reaped a great reward in your kind­ <lb/>
            ness from my pen having been silent. I am therefore ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly glad that you have unhesitatingly accepted my <lb/>
            excuse. I am sure, dearest Tiro, that the reports about <lb/>
            me which reach you answer your best wishes and hopes. I <lb/>
            will make them good, and will do my best that this belief in <lb/>
            me, which day by day becomes more and more en evidence, <lb/>
            shall be doubled. Wherefore you may with confidence and <lb/>
            assurance fulfil your promise of being the trumpeter of my <lb/>
            reputation. For the errors of my youth have caused me so <lb/>
            much remorse and suffering, that not only does my heart <lb/>
            shrink from what I did, my very ears abhor the mention of <lb/>
            it. And of this anguish and sorrow I know and am assured <lb/>
            that you have taken your share. And I don't wonder at it! <lb/>
            for while you wished me all success for my sake, you did so <lb/>
            also for your own; for I have ever meant you to be my <lb/>
            partner in all my good fortunes. Since, therefore, you have <lb/>
            suffered sorrow through me, I will now take care that <lb/>
            through me your joy shall be doubled. Let me assure you <lb/>
            that my very close attachment to Cratippus is that of a <lb/>
            son rather than a pupil: for though I enjoy his lectures, I <lb/>
            am also specially charmed with his delightful manners. I <lb/>
            spend whole days with him, and often part of the night: for <lb/>
            I induce him to dine with me as often as possible. This <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            intimacy having been established, he often drops in upon us <lb/>
            unexpectedly while we are at dinner, and laying aside the <lb/>
            stiff airs of a philosopher joins in our jests with the greatest <lb/>
            possible freedom. He is such a man—so delightful, so dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished—that you should take pains to make his ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance at the earliest possible opportunity. I need <lb/>
            hardly mention Bruttius, whom I never allow to leave my <lb/>
            side. He is a man of a strict and moral life, as well as being <lb/>
            the most delightful company. For in him fun is not divorced <lb/>
            from literature and the daily philosophical inquiries which <lb/>
            we make in common. I have hired a residence next door <lb/>
            to him, and as far as I can with my poor pittance I sub­ <lb/>
            sidize his narrow means. Farthermore, I have begun prac­ <lb/>
            tising declamation in Greek with Cassius; in Latin I like <lb/>
            having my practice with Bruttius. My intimate friends and <lb/>
            daily company are those whom Cratippus brought with him <lb/>
            from Mitylene—good scholars, of whom he has the highest <lb/>
            opinion. I also see a great deal of Epicrates, the leading <lb/>
            man at Athens, and Leonides, and other men of that sort. <lb/>
            So now you know how I am going on.</p>
          <p>You remark in your letter on the character of Gorgias. <lb/>
            The fact is, I found him very useful in my daily practice of <lb/>
            declamation; but I subordinated everything to obeying my <lb/>
            father's injunctions, for he had written ordering me to give <lb/>
            him up at once. I wouldn't shilly-shally about the business, <lb/>
            for fear my making a fuss should cause my father to har­ <lb/>
            bour some suspicion. Moreover, it occurred to me that it <lb/>
            would be offensive for me to express an opinion on a de­ <lb/>
            cision of my father's. However, your interest and advice are <lb/>
            welcome and acceptable. Your apology for lack of time I <lb/>
            quite accept; for I know how busy you always are. I am <lb/>
            very glad that you have bought an estate, and you have my <lb/>
            best wishes for the success of your purchase. Don't be sur­ <lb/>
            prised at my congratulations coming in at this point in my <lb/>
            letter, for it was at the corresponding point in yours that <lb/>
            you told me of your purchase. You are a man of property! <lb/>
            You must drop your city manners: you have become a Ro­ <lb/>
            man country-gentleman. How clearly I have your dearest <lb/>
            face before my eyes at this moment! For I seem to see you <lb/>
            buying things for the farm, talking to your bailiff, saving the <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            seeds at dessert in the corner of your cloak. But as to the <lb/>
            matter of money, I am as sorry as you that I was not on <lb/>
            the spot to help you. But do not doubt, my dear Tiro, of <lb/>
            my assisting you in the future, if fortune does but stand by <lb/>
            me; especially as I know that this estate has been purchased <lb/>
            for our joint advantage. As to my commissions about which <lb/>
            you are taking trouble-many thanks! But I beg you to <lb/>
            send me a secretary at the earliest opportunity-if possi­ <lb/>
            ble a Greek; for he will save me a great deal of trouble in <lb/>
            copying out notes. Above all, take care of your health, that <lb/>
            we may have some literary talk together hereafter. I com­ <lb/>

          <p>You have Messalla with you. What letter, therefore, can <lb/>
            I write with such minute care as to enable me to explain to <lb/>
            you what is being done and what is occurring in public <lb/>
            affairs, more thoroughly than he will describe them to you, <lb/>
            who has at once the most intimate knowledge of everything, <lb/>
            and the talent for unfolding and conveying it to you in the <lb/>
            best possible manner? For beware of thinking, Brutus <lb/>
            -for though it is unnecessary for me to write to you <lb/>
            what you know already, yet I cannot pass over in silence <lb/>
            such eminence in every kind of greatness-beware of think­ <lb/>
            ing, I say, that he has any parallel in honesty and firmness, <lb/>
            care and zeal for the Republic. So much so that in him <lb/>
            eloquence-in which he is extraordinarily eminent—scarcely <lb/>
            seems to offer any opportunity for praise. Yet in this accom­ <lb/>
            plishment itself his wisdom is made more evident; with <lb/>
            such excellent judgment and with so much acuteness has he <lb/>
            practised himself in the most genuine style of rhetoric. Such <lb/>
            also is his industry, and so great the amount of midnight <lb/>
            labour that he bestows on this study, that the chief thanks <lb/>
            would not seem to be due to natural genius, great as it <lb/>
            is in his case. But my affection carries me away: for it is <lb/>
            not the purpose of this letter to praise Mesalla, especially to <lb/>
            Brutus, to whom his excellence is not less known than it is <lb/>
            to me, and these particular accomplishments of his which I <lb/>
            am praising even better. Grieved as I was to let him go <lb/>
            from my side, my one consolation was that in going to you <lb/>
            who are to me a second self, he was performing a duty and <lb/>
            following the path of the truest glory. But enough of this. <lb/>
            I now come, after a long interval of time, to a certain letter <lb/>
            of yours, in which, while paying me many compliments, you <lb/>
            find one fault with me—that I was excessive and, as it were, <lb/>
            extravagant in proposing votes of honour. That is your <lb/>
            criticism: another's, perhaps, might be that I was too stern <lb/>
            in inflicting punishment and exacting penalties, unless by <lb/>
            chance you blame me for both. If that is so, I desire that <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            my principle in both these things should be very clearly <lb/>
            known to you. And I do not rely solely on the dictum of <lb/>
            Solon, who was at once the wisest of the Seven and the only <lb/>
            lawgiver among them. He said that a state was kept to­ <lb/>
            gether by two things-reward and punishment. Of course <lb/>
            there is a certain moderation to be observed in both, as in <lb/>
            everything else, and what we may call a golden mean in <lb/>
            both these things. But I have no intention to dilate on such <lb/>
            an important subject in this place.</p>
          <p>But what has been my aim during this war in the motions <lb/>
            I have made in the senate I think it will not be out of place <lb/>
            to explain. After the death of Caesar and your ever memor­ <lb/>
            able Ides of March, Brutus, you have not forgotten what I <lb/>
            said had been omitted by you and your colleagues, and what <lb/>
            a heavy cloud I declared to be hanging over the Republic. A <lb/>
            great pest had been removed by your means, a great blot on <lb/>
            the Roman people wiped out, immense glory in truth acquired <lb/>
            by yourselves: but an engine for exercising kingly power had <lb/>
            been put into the hands of Lepidus and Antony, of whom the <lb/>
            former was the more fickle of the two, the latter the more <lb/>
            corrupt, but both of whom dreaded peace and were enemies <lb/>
            to quiet. Against these men, inflamed with the ambition of <lb/>
            revolutionizing the state, we had no protecting force to <lb/>
            oppose. For the fact of the matter was this: the state had <lb/>
            become roused as one man to maintain its liberty; I at the <lb/>
            time was even excessively warlike; you, perhaps with more <lb/>
            wisdom, quitted the city which you had liberated, and when <lb/>
            Italy offered you her services declined them. Accordingly, <lb/>
            when I saw the city in the possession of parricides, and that <lb/>
            neither you nor Cassius could remain in it with safety, and <lb/>
            that it was held down by Antony's armed guards, I thought <lb/>
            that I too ought to leave it: for a city held down by traitors, <lb/>
            with all opportunity of giving aid cut off, was a shocking <lb/>
            spectacle. But the same spirit as always had animated me, <lb/>
            staunch to the love of country, did not admit the thought of <lb/>
            a departure from its dangers. Accordingly, in the very midst <lb/>
            of my voyage to Achaia, when in the period of the Etesian <lb/>
            gales a south wind-as though remonstrating against my <lb/>
            design-had brought me back to Italy, I saw you at Velia <lb/>
            and was much distressed: for you were on the point of leav­ <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            ing the country, Brutus—leaving it, I say, for our friends <lb/>
            the Stoics deny that wise men ever " flee." As soon as I <lb/>
            reached Rome I at once threw myself in opposition to <lb/>
            Antony's treason and insane policy: and having roused his <lb/>
            wrath against me, I began entering upon a policy truly <lb/>
            Brutus-like—for this is the distinctive mark of your family <lb/>
            -that of freeing my country. The rest of the story is too <lb/>
            long to tell, and must be passed over by me, for it is about <lb/>
            myself. I will only say this much: that this young Caesar, <lb/>
            thanks to whom we still exist, if we would confess the truth, <lb/>
            was a stream from the fountain-head of my policy. To him <lb/>
            I voted honours, none indeed, Brutus, that were not his due, <lb/>
            none that were not inevitable. For directly we began the <lb/>
            recovery of liberty, when the divine excellence of even <lb/>
            Decimus Brutus had not yet bestirred itself sufficiently to <lb/>
            give us an indication of the truth, and when our sole pro­ <lb/>
            tection depended on the boy who had shaken Antony from <lb/>
            our shoulders, what honour was there that he did not de­ <lb/>
            serve to have decreed to him? However, all I then pro­ <lb/>
            posed for him was a complimentary vote of thanks, and that <lb/>
            too expressed with moderation. I also proposed a decree <lb/>
            conferring imperium on him, which, although it seemed too <lb/>
            great a compliment for one of his age, was yet necessary for <lb/>
            one commanding an army-for what is an army without a <lb/>
            commander with imperiumt Philippus proposed a statue; <lb/>
            Servius at first proposed a license to stand for office before <lb/>
            the regular time. Servilius afterwards proposed that the <lb/>
            time should be still farther curtailed. At that time nothing <lb/>
            was thought too good for him.</p>
          <p>But somehow men are more easily found who are liberal <lb/>
            at a time of alarm, than grateful when victory has been won. <lb/>
            For when that most joyful day of Decimus Brutus's relief <lb/>
            from blockade had dawned on the Republic and happened <lb/>
            also to be his birthday, I proposed that the name of Brutus <lb/>
            should be entered in the fasti under that date. And in that <lb/>
            I followed the example of our ancestors, who paid this <lb/>
            honour to the woman Laurentia, at whose altar in the <lb/>
            Velabrum you pontiffs are accustomed to offer service. And <lb/>
            when I proposed this honor to Brutus I wished that there <lb/>
            should be in the fasti an eternal memorial of a most welcome <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            victory: and yet on that very day I discovered that the ill­ <lb/>
            disposed in the senate were somewhat in a majority over the <lb/>
            grateful. In the course of those same days I lavished <lb/>
            honours-if you like that word-upon the dead Hirtius, <lb/>
            Pansa, and even Aquila. And who has any fault to find <lb/>
            with that, unless he be one who, no sooner an alarm is over, <lb/>
            forgets the past danger? There was added to this grateful <lb/>
            memorial of a benefit received some consideration of what <lb/>
            would be for the good of posterity also; for I wished that <lb/>
            there should exist some perpetual record of the popular <lb/>
            execration of our most ruthless enemies. I suspect that the <lb/>
            next step does not meet with your approbation. It was dis­ <lb/>
            approved by your friends, who are indeed most excellent <lb/>
            citizens, but inexperienced in public business. I mean my <lb/>
            proposing an ovation for Caesar. For myself, however- <lb/>
            though I am perhaps wrong, and I am not a man who be­ <lb/>
            lieves his own way necessarily right—I think that in the <lb/>
            course of this war I never took a more prudent step. The <lb/>
            reason for this I must not reveal, lest I should seem to have <lb/>
            a sense of favours to come rather than to be grateful for <lb/>
            those received. I have said too much already: let us look <lb/>
            at other points. I proposed honours to Decimus Brutus, <lb/>
            and also to Lucius Plancus. Those indeed are noble spirits <lb/>
            whose spur to action is glory: but the senate also is wise to <lb/>
            avail itself of any means-provided that they are honourable <lb/>
            -by which it thinks that a particular man can be induced <lb/>
            to support the Republic. But—you say—I am blamed in re­ <lb/>
            gard to Lepidus: for, having placed his statue on the rostra, <lb/>
            I also voted for its removal. I tried by paying him a <lb/>
            compliment to recall him from his insane policy. The in­ <lb/>
            fatuation of that most unstable of men rendered my pru­ <lb/>
            dence futile. Yet all the same more good was done by <lb/>
            demolishing the statue of Lepidus, than harm by putting <lb/>
            it up.</p>
          <p>Enough about honours; now I must say a few words <lb/>
            about penalties. For I have gathered from frequent expres­ <lb/>
            sions in your letters that in regard to those whom you have <lb/>
            conquered in war, you desire that your clemency should be <lb/>
            praised. I hold, indeed, that you do and say nothing but <lb/>
            what becomes a philosopher. But to omit the punishment <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            of a crime-for that is what " pardoning " amounts to-even <lb/>
            if it is endurable in other cases, is mischievous in a war like <lb/>
            this. For there has been no civil war, of all that have <lb/>
            occurred in the state within my memory, in which there was <lb/>
            not certain to be some form of constitution remaining, <lb/>
            whichever of the two sides prevailed. In this war, if we are <lb/>
            victorious, I should not find it easy to affirm what kind of <lb/>
            constitution we are likely to have; if we are conquered, <lb/>
            there will certainly never be any. I therefore proposed <lb/>
            severe measures against Antony, and severe ones also against <lb/>
            Lepidus, and not so much out of revenge as in order that I <lb/>
            might for the present prevent unprincipled men by this <lb/>
            terror from attacking their country, and might for the future <lb/>
            establish a warning for all who were minded to imitate their <lb/>
            infatuation.</p>
          <p>However, this proposal was not mine more than it was <lb/>
            everybody's. The point in it which had the appearance of <lb/>
            cruelty was that the penalty extended to the children who <lb/>
            did not deserve any. But that is a thing of long standing <lb/>
            and characteristic of all states. For instance, the children <lb/>
            of Themistocles were in poverty. And if the same penalty <lb/>
            attaches to citizens legally condemned in court, how could <lb/>
            we be more indulgent to public enemies? What, moreover, <lb/>
            can anyone say against me when he must confess that, had <lb/>
            that man conquered, he would have been still more revenge­ <lb/>
            ful towards me ?</p>
          <p>Here you have the principles which dictated my senatorial <lb/>
            proposals, at any rate in regard to this class of honours and <lb/>
            penalties. For, in regard to other matters, I think you have <lb/>
            been told what opinions I have expressed and what votes I <lb/>
            have given. But all this is not so very pressing. What is <lb/>
            really pressing, Brutus, is that you should come to Italy with <lb/>
            your army as soon as possible. There is the greatest anxiety <lb/>
            for your arrival. Directly you reach Italy all classes will <lb/>
            flock to you. For whether we win the victory-and we had <lb/>
            in fact won a most glorious one, only that Lepidus set his <lb/>
            heart on ruining everything and perishing himself with all <lb/>
            his friends-there will be need of your counsel in establish­ <lb/>
            ing some form of constitution. And even if there is still <lb/>
            some fighting left to be done, our greatest hope is both in <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            your personal influence and in the material strength of your <lb/>
            army. But make haste, in God's name! You know the <lb/>
            importance of seizing the right moment, and of rapidity. <lb/>
            What pains I am taking in the interests of your sister's <lb/>
            children, I hope you know from the letters of your mother <lb/>
            and sister. In undertaking their cause I shew more regard <lb/>
            to your affection, which is very precious to me, than, as <lb/>
            some think, to my own consistency. But there is nothing <lb/>
            in which I more wish to be and to seem consistent than in <lb/>
            loving you.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</title>
          </head>
          <p>GAIUS PLINIUS CAECILIUS SECUNDUS, usually known as Pliny <lb/>
            the Younger, was born at Como in 62 A. D. He was only eight <lb/>
            years old when his father Caecilius died, and he was adopted by <lb/>
            his uncle, the elder Pliny, author of the Natural History. He <lb/>
            was carefully educated, studying rhetoric under Quintilian and <lb/>
            other famous teachers, and he became the most eloquent pleader <lb/>
            of his time. In this and in much else he imitated Cicero, who <lb/>
            had by this time come to be the recognized master of Latin style. <lb/>
            While still young he served as military tribune in Syria, but he <lb/>
            does not seem to have taken zealously to a soldier's life. On <lb/>
            his return he entered politics under the Emperor Domitian; and <lb/>
            in the year 100 A. D. was appointed consul by Trajan and ad­ <lb/>
            mitted to confidential intercourse with that emperor. Later zvhile <lb/>
            he was governor of Bithynia, he was in the habit of submitting <lb/>
            every point of policy to his master, and the correspondence be­ <lb/>
            tween Trajan and him, which forms the last part of the present <lb/>
            selection, is of a high degree of interest, both on account of <lb/>
            the subjects discussed and for the light thrown on the characters <lb/>
            of the two men. He is supposed to have died about 113 A. D. <lb/>
            Pliny's speeches are now lost, with the exception of one, a pane­ <lb/>
            gyric on TrOjaM delivered in thanksgiving for the consulate. This, <lb/>
            though diffuse and somewhat too complimentary for modern <lb/>
            taste, became a model for this kind of composition. The others <lb/>
            were mostly of two classes, forensic and political, many of the <lb/>
            latter being, like Cicero's speech against Verres, impeachments <lb/>
            of provincial governors for cruelty and extortion toward their <lb/>
            subjects. In these, as in his public activities in general, he appears <lb/>
            as a man of public spirit and integrity; and in his relations with <lb/>
            his native town he was a thoughtful and munificent benefactor.</p>
          <p>The letters, on which to-day his fame mainly rests, were largely <lb/>
            written with a view to publication, and were arranged by Pliny <lb/>
            himself. They thus lack the spontaneity of Cicero’s impulsive ut­ <lb/>
            terances, but to most modern readers who are not special students <lb/>
            of Roman history they are even more interesting. They deal with <lb/>
            a great variety of subjects: the description of a Roman villa; <lb/>
            the charms of country life; the reluctance of people to attend <lb/>
            authors' readings and to listen when they were present; a dinner <note type="footnote"> 7—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            party; legacy-hunting in ancient Rome; the acquisition of a <lb/>
            piece of statuary; his love for his young wife; ghost stories; <lb/>
            floating islands, a tame dolphin, and other marvels. But by <lb/>
            far the best known are those describing the great eruption of <lb/>
            Vesuvius in which his uncle perished, a martyr to scientific curi­ <lb/>
            osity, and the letter to TrOjaM on his attempts to suppress Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity in Bithynia, with Trajan's reply approving his policy. <lb/>
            Taken altogether, these letters give an absorbingly vivid picture <lb/>
            of the days of the early empire, and of the interests of a culti­ <lb/>
            vated Roman gentleman of wealth. Occasionally, as in the last <lb/>
            letters referred to, they deal with important historical events; <lb/>
            but their chief value is in bringing before us, in somewhat the <lb/>
            same manner as "The Spectator" pictures the England of the <lb/>
            age of Anne, the life of a time which is not so unlike our own as <lb/>
            its distance in years might indicate. And in this time by no <lb/>
            means the least interesting figure is that of the letter-writer <lb/>
            himself, with his vanity and self-importance, his sensibility and <lb/>
            generous affection, his pedantry and his loyalty.</p>

            their proper order of time, for I was not compiling a history; <lb/>
            but just as each came to hand. And now I have only to <lb/>

            nor I of my compliance: in that case, I may probably en­ <lb/>

          <p>I FORESEE your journey in my direction is likely to be de­ <lb/>
            layed, and therefore send you the speech which I promised in <lb/>
            my former; requesting you, as usual, to revise and correct it. <lb/>
            I desire this the more earnestly as I never, I think, wrote <lb/>
            with the same empressement in any of my former speeches; <lb/>
            for I have endeavoured to imitate your old favourite Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes and Calvus, who is lately become mine, at least in the <lb/>
            rhetorical forms of the speech; for to catch their sublime <lb/>
            spirit, is given, alone, to the " inspired few." My subject, <lb/>
            indeed, seemed naturally to lend itself to this (may I venture <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            to call it?) emulation; consisting, as it did, almost entirety <lb/>
            in a vehement style of address, even to a degree sufficient <lb/>
            to have awakened me (if only I am capable of being awak­ <lb/>
            ened) out of that indolence in which I have long reposed. <lb/>
            I have not however altogether neglected the flowers of <lb/>
            rhetoric of my favourite Marc-Tully, wherever I could with <lb/>
            propriety step out of my direct road, to enjoy a more flowery <lb/>
            path: for it was energy, not austerity, at which I aimed. I <lb/>
            would not have you imagine by this that I am bespeaking <lb/>
            your indulgence: on the contrary, to make your correcting <lb/>
            pen more vigorous, I will confess that neither my friends <lb/>
            nor myself are averse from the publication of this piece, <lb/>
            if only you should join in the approval of what is perhaps <lb/>
            my folly. The truth is, as I must publish something, I wish <lb/>
            it might be this performance rather than any other, because <lb/>
            it is already finished: (you hear the wish of laziness.) At <lb/>
            all events, however, something I must publish, and for many <lb/>
            reasons; chiefly because of the tracts which I have already <lb/>
            sent in to the world, though they have long since lost all <lb/>
            their recommendation from novelty, are still, I am told, in <lb/>
            request; if, after all, the booksellers are not tickling my <lb/>
            ears. And let them; since, by that innocent deceit, I am <lb/>
            encouraged to pursue my studies. Farewell.</p>

          <p>DID you ever meet with a more abject and mean-spirited <lb/>
            creature than Marcus Regulus since the death of Domitian, <lb/>
            during whose reign his conduct was no less infamous, though <lb/>
            more concealed, than under Nero's? He began to be afraid <lb/>
            I was angry with him, and his apprehensions were per­ <lb/>
            fectly correct; I was angry. He had not only done his <lb/>
            best to increase the peril of the position in which Rusticus <lb/>
            Arulenus1 stood, but had exulted in his death; insomuch that <lb/>
            he actually recited and published a libel upon his memory, <note type="footnote"> 1 A pupil and intimate friend of Paetus Tbrasea, the distinguished Stoic <lb/>
            philosopher. Arulenus was put to death by Domitian for writing a pane­ <lb/>
            gyric upon Thrasea. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            in which he styles him " The Stoics' Ape ": adding, " stig­ <lb/>
            mated* with the Vitellian scar."3 You recognize Regulus' <lb/>
            eloquent strain! He fell with such fury upon the character <lb/>
            of Herennius Senecio that Metius Carus said to him, one <lb/>
            day, " What business have you with my dead ? Did I ever <lb/>
            interfere in the affair of Crassus* or Camerinus5? " Victims, <lb/>
            you know, to Regulus, in Nero's time. For these reasons <lb/>
            he imagined I was highly exasperated, and so at the recita­ <lb/>
            tion of his last piece, I got no invitation. Besides, he had <lb/>
            not forgotten, it seems, with what deadly purpose he had <lb/>
            once attacked me in the Court of the Hundred." Rusticus <lb/>
            had desired me to act as counsel for Arionilla, Timon's wife: <lb/>
            Regulus was engaged against me. In one part of the case <lb/>
            I was strongly insisting upon a particular judgment given <lb/>
            by Metius Modestus, an excellent man, at that time in ban­ <lb/>
            ishment by Domitian's order. Now then for Regulus. <lb/>
            " Pray," says he, " what is your opinion of Modestus ?” <lb/>
            You see what a risk I should have run had I answered that <lb/>
            I had a high opinion of him, how I should have disgraced <lb/>
            myself on the other hand if I had replied that I had a bad <lb/>
            opinion of him. But some guardian power, I am persuaded, <lb/>
            must have stood by me to assist me in this emergency. " I <lb/>
            will tell you my opinion," I said, "if that is a matter to <lb/>
            be brought before the court." " I ask you," he repeated, <lb/>
            it what is your opinion of Modestus ? " I replied that it was <lb/>
            customary to examine witnesses to the character of an <lb/>
            accused man, not to the character of one on whom sentence <lb/>
            had already been passed. He pressed me a third time. "I <lb/>
            do not now enquire, said he, "your opinion of Modestus in <lb/>
            general, I only ask your opinion of his loyalty." " Since <note type="footnote"> 2 The impropriety of this expression, in the original, seems to lie in the <lb/>
            word stigmosum, which Regulus, probably either coined through affectation <lb/>
            or used through ignorance. It is a word, at least, which does not occur in <lb/>
            any author of authority: the translator has endeavoured, therefore, to pre­ <lb/>
            serve the same sort of impropriety, by using an expression of like un­ <lb/>

            you will have my opinion then," I rejoined, "I think it illegal <lb/>
            even to ask a question concerning a person who stands con­ <lb/>
            victed." He sat down at this, completely silenced; and I <lb/>
            received applause and congratulation on all sides, that with­ <lb/>
            out injuring my reputation by an advantageous, perhaps, <lb/>
            though ungenerous answer, I had not entangled myself in <lb/>
            the toils of so insidious a catch-question. Thoroughly fright­ <lb/>
            ened upon this then, he first seizes upon Caecilius Celer, next <lb/>
            he goes and begs of Fabius Justus, that they would use their <lb/>
            joint interest to bring about a reconciliation between us. <lb/>
            And lest this should not be sufficient, he sets off to Spurinna <lb/>
            as well; to whom he came in the humblest way (for he is <lb/>
            the most abject creature alive, where he has anything to be <lb/>
            afraid of) and says to him, " Do, I entreat of you, call on <lb/>
            Pliny to-morrow morning, certainly in the morning, no later <lb/>
            (for I cannot endure this anxiety of mind longer), and en­ <lb/>
            deavour by any means in your power to soften his resent­ <lb/>
            ment." I was already up, the next day, when a message <lb/>
            arrived from Spurinna, "I am coming to call on you." I <lb/>
            sent word back, "Nay, I will wait upon you;" however, <lb/>
            both of us setting out to pay this visit, we met under Livia's <lb/>
            portico. He acquainted me with the commission he had <lb/>
            received from Regulus, and interceded for him as became <lb/>
            so worthy a man in behalf of one so totally dissimilar, with­ <lb/>
            out greatly pressing the thing. "I will leave it to you," <lb/>
            was my reply, " to consider what answer to return Regulus; <lb/>
            you ought not to be deceived by me. I am waiting for <lb/>
            Mauricus’7 return" (for he had not yet come back out of <lb/>
            exile), " so that I cannot give you any definite answer <lb/>
            either way, as I mean to be guided entirely by his decision, <lb/>
            for he ought to be my leader here, and I simply to do as <lb/>
            he says." Well, a few days after this, Regulus met me as <lb/>
            I was at the praetor's; he kept close to me there and begged <lb/>
            a word in private, when he said he was afraid I deeply re­ <lb/>
            sented an expression he had once made use of in his reply <lb/>
            to Satrius and myself, before the Court of the Hundred, <lb/>
            to this effect, " Satrius Rufus, who does not endeavour to <note type="footnote"> 7 Junius Mauricus, the brother of Rusticus Arulenus. Both brothers <lb/>
            were sentenced on the same day, Arulenus to execution and Mauricus <lb/>

            rival Cicero, and who is content with the eloquence of our <lb/>
            own day." I answered, now I perceived indeed, upon his <lb/>
            own confession, that he had meant it ill-naturedly; other­ <lb/>
            wise it might have passed for a compliment. " For I am <lb/>
            free to own,” I said, " that I do endeavour to rival Cicero, <lb/>
            and am not content with the eloquence of our own day. <lb/>
            For I consider it the very height of folly not to copy the <lb/>
            best models of every kind. But, how happens it that you, <lb/>
            who have so good a recollection of what passed upon this <lb/>
            occasion, should have forgotten that other, when you asked <lb/>
            me my opinion of the loyalty of Modestus?" Pale as he <lb/>
            always is, he turned simply pallid at this, and stammered <lb/>
            out, "I did not intend to hurt you when I asked this ques­ <lb/>
            tion, but Modestus." Observe the vindictive cruelty of the <lb/>
            fellow, who made no concealment of his willingness to in­ <lb/>
            jure a banished man. But the reason he alleged in justifi­ <lb/>
            cation of his conduct is pleasant. Modestus, he explained, <lb/>
            in a letter of his, which was read to Domitian, had used <lb/>
            the following expression, " Regulus, the biggest rascal that <lb/>
            walks upon two feet:" and what Modestus had written was <lb/>
            the simple truth, beyond all manner of controversy. Here, <lb/>
            about, our conversation came to an end., for I did not wish <lb/>
            to proceed further, being desirous to keep matters open until <lb/>
            Mauricus returns. It is no easy matter, I am well aware <lb/>
            of that, to destroy Regulus; he is rich, and at the head of <lb/>
            a party; courted8 by many, feared by more: a passion that <lb/>
            will sometimes prevail even beyond friendship itself. But, <lb/>
            after all, ties of this sort are not so strong but they may <lb/>
            be loosened; for a bad man's credit is as shifty as himself. <lb/>
            However (to repeat), I am waiting until Mauricus comes <lb/>
            back. He is a man of sound judgment and great sagacity <lb/>
            formed upon long experience, and who, from his obser­ <lb/>
            vations of the past, well knows how to judge of the future. <lb/>
            I shall talk the matter over with him, and consider myself <lb/>
            justified either in pursuing or dropping this affair, as he <note type="footnote"> 8 There seems to have been a cast of uncommon blackness in the char­ <lb/>
            acter of this Regulus; otherwise the benevolent Pliny would scarcely have <lb/>
            singled him out, as he has in this and some following letters, for the <lb/>
            subject of his warmest contempt and indignation. Yet, infamous as he <lb/>
            was, he had his flatterers and admirers; and a contemporary poet fre­ <lb/>
            quently represents him as one of the most finished characters of the age, <lb/>
            both in eloquence and virtue. M. </note> <lb/>

          <p>You will laugh (and you are quite welcome) when I tell <lb/>
            you that your old acquaintance is turned sportsman, and <lb/>
            has taken three noble boars. " What!" you exclaim, <lb/>

            my beloved inactivity; and, whilst I sat at my nets, you <lb/>
            would have found me, not with boar spear or javelin, but <lb/>
            pencil and tablet, by my side. I mused and wrote, being <lb/>

            with my memorandums full. Believe me, this way of study­ <lb/>

          <p>NOTHING could be more seasonable than the letter which <lb/>
            I received from you, in which you so earnestly beg me to <lb/>
            send you some of my literary efforts: the very thing I was <lb/>
            intending to do. So you have only put spurs into a willing <lb/>
            horse and at once saved yourself the excuse of refusing the <lb/>
            trouble, and me the awkwardness of asking the favour. <lb/>
            Without hesitation then I avail myself of your offer; as you <lb/>
            must now take the consequence of it without reluctance. <lb/>
            But you are not to expect anything new from a lazy fellow, <lb/>
            for I am going to ask you to revise again the speech I made <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            to my fellow-townsmen when I dedicated the public library <lb/>
            to their use. You have already, I remember, obliged me <lb/>
            with some annotations upon this piece, but only in a general <lb/>
            way; and so I now beg of you not only to take a general <lb/>
            view of the whole speech, but, as you usually do, to go over <lb/>
            it in detail. When you have corrected it, I shall still be at <lb/>
            liberty to publish or suppress it: and the delay in the <lb/>
            meantime will be attended with one of these alternatives; <lb/>
            for, while we are deliberating whether it is fit for publishing, <lb/>
            a frequent revision will either make it so, or convince me <lb/>
            that it is not. Though indeed my principal difficulty re­ <lb/>
            specting the publication of this harangue arises not so much <lb/>
            from the composition as out of the subject itself, which has <lb/>
            something in it, I am afraid, that will look too like osten­ <lb/>
            tation and self-conceit. For, be the style ever so plain and <lb/>
            unassuming, yet, as the occasion necessarily led me to speak <lb/>
            not only of the munificence of my ancestors, but of my own <lb/>
            as well, my modesty will be seriously embarrassed. A dan­ <lb/>
            gerous and slippery situation this, even when one is led <lb/>
            into it by plea of necessity! For, if mankind are not very <lb/>
            favourable to panegyric, even when bestowed upon others, <lb/>
            how much more difficult is it to reconcile them to it when <lb/>
            it is a tribute which we pay to ourselves or to our ancestors? <lb/>
            Virtue, by herself, is generally the object of envy, but par­ <lb/>
            ticularly so when glory and distinction attend her; and the <lb/>
            world is never so little disposed to detract from the rectitude <lb/>
            of your conduct as when it passes unobserved and unap­ <lb/>
            plauded. For these reasons, I frequently ask myself whether <lb/>
            I composed this harangue, such as it is, merely from a <lb/>
            personal consideration, or with a view to the public as well; <lb/>
            and I am sensible that what may be exceedingly useful and <lb/>
            proper in the prosecution of any affair may lose all its grace <lb/>
            and fitness the moment the business is completed: for in­ <lb/>
            stance, in the case before us, what could be more to my pur­ <lb/>
            pose than to explain at large the motives of my intended <lb/>
            bounty? For, first, it engaged my mind in good and en­ <lb/>
            nobling thoughts; next, it enabled me, by frequent dwelling <lb/>
            upon them, to receive a perfect impression of their loveli­ <lb/>
            ness, while it guarded at the same time against that re­ <lb/>
            pentance which is sure to follow on an impulsive act of <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            generosity. There arose also a further advantage from this <lb/>
            method, as it fixed in me a certain habitual contempt of <lb/>
            money. For, while mankind seem to be universally gov­ <lb/>
            erned by an innate passion to accumulate wealth, the culti­ <lb/>
            vation of a more generous affection in my own breast taught <lb/>
            me to emancipate myself from the slavery of so predominant <lb/>
            a principle: and I thought that my honest intentions would <lb/>
            be the more meritorious as they should appear to proceed, <lb/>
            not from sudden impulse, but from the dictates of cool and <lb/>
            deliberate reflection. I considered, besides, that I was not <lb/>
            engaging myself to exhibit public games or gladiatorial <lb/>
            combats, but to establish an annual fund for the support <lb/>
            and education of young men of good families but scanty <lb/>
            means. The pleasures of the senses are so far from wanting <lb/>
            the oratorical arts to recommend them that we stand in <lb/>
            need of all the powers of eloquence to moderate and re­ <lb/>
            strain rather than stir up their influence. But the work of <lb/>
            getting anybody to cheerfully undertake the monotony and <lb/>
            drudgery of education must be effected not by pay merely, <lb/>
            but by a skilfully worked-up appeal to the emotions as well. <lb/>
            If physicians find it expedient to use the most insinuating <lb/>
            address in recommending to their patients a wholesome <lb/>
            though, perhaps, unpleasant regimen, how much more occa­ <lb/>
            sion had he to exert all the powers of persuasion who, out <lb/>
            of regard to the public welfare, was endeavouring to recon­ <lb/>
            cile it to a most useful though not equally popular bene­ <lb/>
            faction? Particularly, as my aim was to recommend an <lb/>
            institution, calculated solely for the benefit of those who <lb/>
            were parents to men who, at present, had no children; and <lb/>
            to persuade the greater number to wait patiently until they <lb/>
            should be entitled to an honour of which a few only could <lb/>
            immediately partake. But as at that time, when I attempted <lb/>
            to explain and enforce the general design and benefit of <lb/>
            my institution, I considered more the general good of my <lb/>
            countrymen, than any reputation which might result to my­ <lb/>
            self; so I am apprehensive lest, if I publish that piece, it <lb/>
            may perhaps look as if I had a view rather to my own per­ <lb/>
            sonal credit than the benefit of others. Besides, I am very <lb/>
            sensible how much nobler it is to place the reward of virtue <lb/>
            in the silent approbation of one's own breast than in the <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            applause of the world. Glory ought to be the consequence, <lb/>
            not the motive, of our actions; and although it happen not <lb/>
            to attend the worthy deed, yet it is by no means the less fair <lb/>
            for having missed the applause it deserved. But the world <lb/>
            is apt to suspect that those who celebrate their own benefi­ <lb/>
            cent acts performed them for no other motive than to <lb/>
            have the pleasure of extolling them. Thus, the splendour <lb/>
            of an action which would have been deemed illustrious if <lb/>
            related by another is totally extinguished when it becomes <lb/>
            the subject of one's own applause. Such is the disposition <lb/>
            of mankind, if they cannot blast the action, they will censure <lb/>

            ticular notice, or set forth yourself what does, either way <lb/>
            you incur reproach. In my own case there is a peculiar <lb/>
            circumstance that weighs much with me: this speech was <lb/>
            delivered not before the people, but the Decurii not in the <lb/>
            forum, but the senate; I am afraid therefore it will look in­ <lb/>
            consistent that I, who, when I delivered it, seemed to avoid <lb/>
            popular applause, should now, by publishing this perform­ <lb/>
            ance, appear to court it: that I, who was so scrupulous as not <lb/>
            to admit even these persons to be present when I delivered <lb/>
            this speech, who were interested in my benefaction, lest it <lb/>
            might be suspected I was actuated in this affair by any am­ <lb/>
            bitious views, should now seem to solicit admiration, by <lb/>
            forwardly displaying it to such as have no other concern in <lb/>
            my munificence than the benefit of example. These are the <lb/>
            scruples which have occasioned my delay in giving this <lb/>
            piece to the public; but I submit them entirely to your <lb/>
            judgment, which I shall ever esteem as a sufficient sanc­ <lb/>

          <p>IF ever polite literature flourished at Rome, it certainly <lb/>

            Euphrates,1 the philosopher. I first became acquainted with <lb/>
            this excellent person in my youth, when I served in the <lb/>
            army in Syria. I had an opportunity of conversing with <lb/>
            him familiarly, and took some pains to gain his affection: <lb/>
            though that, indeed, was not very difficult, for he is easy <lb/>
            of access, unreserved, and actuated by those social principles <lb/>
            he professes to teach. I should think myself extremely <lb/>
            happy if I had as fully answered the expectations he, at <lb/>
            that time, conceived of me, as he exceeds everything I had <lb/>
            imagined of him. But, perhaps, I admire his excellencies <lb/>
            more now than I did then, because I know better how to <lb/>
            appreciate them; not that I sufficiently appreciate them <lb/>
            even now. For as none but those who are skilled in <lb/>
            painting, statuary, or the plastic art, can form a right <lb/>
            judgment of any performance in those respective modes <lb/>
            of representation, so a man must, himself, have made great <lb/>
            advances in philosophy before he is capable of forming a <lb/>
            just opinion of a philosopher. However, as far as I am <lb/>
            qualified to determine, Euphrates is possessed of so many <lb/>
            shining talents that he cannot fail to attract and impress <lb/>
            the most ordinarily educated observer. He reasons with <lb/>
            much force, acuteness, and elegance; and frequently rises <lb/>
            into all the sublime and luxuriant eloquence of Plato. His <lb/>
            style is varied and flowing, and at the same time so won­ <lb/>
            derfully captivating that he forces the reluctant attention <lb/>
            of the most unwilling hearer. For the rest, a fine stature, <lb/>
            a comely aspect, long hair, and a large silver beard; circum­ <lb/>
            stances which, though they may probably be thought trifling <lb/>
            and accidental, contribute, however, to gain him much <lb/>
            reverence. There is no affected negligence in his dress <lb/>
            and appearance; his countenance is grave but not austere; <lb/>
            and his approach commands respect without creating awe. <lb/>
            Distinguished as he is by the perfect blamelessness of his <lb/>
            life, he is no less so by the courtesy and engaging sweetness <lb/>
            of his manner. He attacks vices, not persons, and, without <lb/>
            severity, reclaims the wanderer from the paths of virtue. <lb/>
            You follow his exhortations with rapt attention, hanging, <note type="footnote"> 1“Euphrates was a native of Tyre, or, according to others, of Byzan­ <lb/>

            as it were, upon his lips; and even after the heart is con­ <lb/>
            vinced, the ear still wishes to listen to the harmonious <lb/>
            reasoner. His family consists of three children (two of <lb/>
            which are sons), whom he educates with the utmost care. <lb/>
            His father-in-law, Pompeius Julianus, as he greatly dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished himself in every other part of his life, so par­ <lb/>
            ticularly in this, that though he was himself of the highest <lb/>
            rank in his province, yet, among many considerable matches, <lb/>
            he preferred Euphrates for his son-in-law, as first in merit, <lb/>
            though not in dignity. But why do I dwell any longer <lb/>
            upon the virtues of a man whose conversation I am so <lb/>
            unfortunate as not to have time sufficiently to enjoy? Is <lb/>
            it to increase my regret and vexation that I cannot enjoy <lb/>
            it? My time is wholly taken up in the execution of a very <lb/>
            honourable, indeed, but equally troublesome, employment; in <lb/>
            hearing cases, signing petitions, making up accounts, and writ­ <lb/>
            ing a vast amount of the most illiterate literature. I some­ <lb/>
            times complain to Euphrates (for I have leisure at least to <lb/>
            complain) of these unpleasing occupations. He endeavours <lb/>
            to console me, by affirming that, to be engaged in the public <lb/>
            service, to hear and determine cases, to explain the laws, and <lb/>
            administer justice, is a part, and the noblest part, too, of <lb/>
            philosophy; as it is reducing to practice what her professors <lb/>
            teach in speculation. But even his rhetoric will never be <lb/>
            able to convince me that it is better to be at this sort of <lb/>
            work than to spend whole days in attending his lectures and <lb/>
            learning his precepts. I cannot therefore but strongly <lb/>
            recommend it to you, who have the time for it, when next <lb/>
            you come to town (and you will come, I daresay, so much <lb/>
            the sooner for this), to take the benefit of his elegant and <lb/>
            refined instructions. For I do not (as many do) envy others <lb/>
            the happiness I cannot share with them myself: on the <lb/>
            contrary, it is a very sensible pleasure to me when I find <lb/>
            my friends in possession of an enjoyment from which I <lb/>
            have the misfortune to be excluded. Farewell</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE suffered the heaviest loss; if that word be sum­ <lb/>
            ciently strong to express the misfortune which has deprived <lb/>
            me of so excellent a man. Corellius Rufus is dead; and <lb/>
            dead, too, by his own act! A circumstance of great aggra­ <lb/>
            vation to my affliction: as that sort of death which we <lb/>
            cannot impute either to the course of nature, or the hand of <lb/>
            Providence, is, of all others, the most to be lamented. It <lb/>
            affords some consolation in the loss of those friends whom <lb/>
            disease snatches from us that they fall by the general destiny <lb/>
            of mankind; but those who destroy themselves leave us <lb/>
            under the inconsolable reflection, that they had it in their <lb/>
            power to have lived longer. It is true, Corellius had many <lb/>
            inducements to be fond of life; a blameless conscience, high <lb/>
            reputation, and great dignity of character, besides a daugh­ <lb/>
            ter, a wife, a grandson, and sisters, and, amidst these <lb/>
            numerous pledges of happiness, faithful friends. Still, it <lb/>
            must be owned he had the highest motive (which to a wise <lb/>
            man will always have the force of destiny) urging him to <lb/>
            this resolution. He had long been tortured by so tedious <lb/>
            and painful a complaint that even these inducements to <lb/>
            living on, considerable as they are, were over-balanced by <lb/>
            the reasons on the other side. In his thirty-third year (as <lb/>
            I have frequently heard him say) he was seized with the <lb/>
            gout in his feet. This was hereditary; for diseases, as well <lb/>
            as possessions, are sometimes handed down by a sort of in­ <lb/>
            heritance. A life of sobriety and continence had enabled <lb/>
            him to conquer and keep down the disease while he was <lb/>
            still young, latterly as it grew upon him with advancing <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            years, he had to manfully bear it, suffering meanwhile the <lb/>
            most incredible and undeserved agonies; for the gout was <lb/>
            nov not only in his feet, but had spread itself over his <lb/>
            whole body. I remember, in Domitian's reign, paying him <lb/>
            a visit at his villa, near Rome. As soon as I entered his <lb/>
            chamber, his servants went out: for it was his rule, never <lb/>
            to allow them to be in the room when any intimate friend <lb/>
            was with him; nay, even his own wife, though she could <lb/>
            have kept any secret, used to go too. Casting his eyes round <lb/>
            the room, " Why," he exclaimed, " do you suppose I endure <lb/>
            life so long under these cruel agonies? It is with the hope <lb/>
            that I may outlive, at least for one day, that villain." Had <lb/>
            his bodily strength been equal to his resolution, he would <lb/>
            have carried his desire into practical effect. God heard <lb/>
            and answered his prayer; and when he felt that he should <lb/>
            now die a free, un-enslaved, Roman, he broke through those <lb/>
            other great, but now less forcible, attachments to the world. <lb/>
            His malady increased; and, as it now grew too violent to <lb/>
            admit of any relief from temperance, he resolutely deter­ <lb/>
            mined to put an end to its uninterrupted attacks, by an effort <lb/>
            of heroism. He had refused all sustenance during four days <lb/>
            when his wife Hispulla sent our common friend Geminius <lb/>
            to me, with the melancholy news, that Corellius was re­ <lb/>
            solved to die; and that neither her own entreaties nor her <lb/>
            daughter's could move him from his purpose; I was the only <lb/>
            person left who could reconcile him to life. I ran to his <lb/>
            house with the utmost precipitation. As I approached it, <lb/>
            I met a second messenger from Hispulla, Julius Atticus, who <lb/>
            informed me there was nothing to be hoped for now, even <lb/>
            from me, as he seemed more hardened than ever in his <lb/>
            purpose. He had said, indeed to his physician, who pressed <lb/>
            him to take some nourishment, "'Tis resolved": an ex­ <lb/>
            pression which, as it raised my admiration of the greatness <lb/>
            of his soul, so it does my grief for the loss of him. I keep <lb/>
            thinking what a friend, what a man, I am deprived of. <lb/>
            That he had reached his sixty-seventh year, an age which <lb/>
            even the strongest seldom exceed, I well know; that he is <lb/>
            released from a life of continual pain; that he has left his <lb/>
            dearest friends behind him, and (what was dearer to him <lb/>
            than all these) the state in a prosperous condition: all this <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            I know. Still I cannot forbear to lament him, as if he had <lb/>
            been in the prime and vigour of his days; and I lament him <lb/>
            (shall I own my weakness?) on my account. And-to <lb/>
            confess to you as I did to Calvisius, in the first transport <lb/>
            of my grief-I sadly fear, now that I am no longer under <lb/>
            his eye, I shall not keep so strict a guard over my con­ <lb/>
            duct. Speak comfort to me then, not that he was old, he <lb/>
            was infirm; all this I know: but by supplying me with some <lb/>
            reflections that are new and resistless, which I have never <lb/>
            heard, never read, anywhere else. For all that I have heard, <lb/>
            and all that I have read, occur to me of themselves; but <lb/>
            all these are by far too weak to support me under so <lb/>
            severe an affliction. Farewell.</p>

          <p>THIS year has produced a plentiful crop of poets: during <lb/>
            the whole month of April scarcely a day has passed on <lb/>
            which we have not been entertained with the recital of some <lb/>
            poem. It is a pleasure to me to find that a taste for polite <lb/>
            literature still exists, and that men of genius do come for­ <lb/>
            ward and make themseves known, notwithstanding the lazy <lb/>
            attendance they got for their pains. The greater part of <lb/>
            the audience sit in the lounging-places, gossip away their <lb/>
            time there, and are perpetually sending to enquire whether <lb/>
            the author has made his entrance yet, whether he has got <lb/>
            through the preface, or whether he has almost finished the <lb/>
            piece. Then at length they saunter in with an air of the <lb/>
            greatest indifference, nor do they condescend to stay through <lb/>
            the recital, but go out before it is over, some slyly and <lb/>
            stealthily, others again with perfect freedom and unconcern. <lb/>
            And yet our fathers can remember how Claudius Caesar <lb/>
            walking one day in the palace, and hearing a great shout­ <lb/>
            ing, enquired the cause: and being informed that Nonianus1 <lb/>
            was reciting a composition of his, went immediately to the <lb/>
            place, and agreeably surprised the author with his presence. <note type="footnote"> 1 A pleader and historian of some distinction, mentioned by Tacitus, <lb/>

            But now, were one to bespeak the attendance of the idlest <lb/>
            man living, and remind him of the appointment ever so <lb/>
            often, or ever so long beforehand; either he would not come <lb/>
            at all, or if he did would grumble about having " lost a <lb/>
            day!” for no other reason but because he had not lost it. <lb/>
            So much the more do those authors deserve our encourage­ <lb/>
            ment and applause who have resolution to persevere in their <lb/>
            studies, and to read out their compositions in spite of this <lb/>
            apathy or arrogance on the part of their audience. Myself <lb/>
            indeed, I scarcely ever miss being present upon any occa­ <lb/>
            sion; though, to tell the truth, the authors have generally <lb/>
            been friends of mine, as indeed there are few men of lit­ <lb/>
            erary tastes who are not. It is this which has kept me <lb/>
            in town longer than I had intended. I am now, however, <lb/>
            at liberty to go back into the country, and write something <lb/>
            myself; which I do not intend reciting, lest I should seem <lb/>
            rather to have lent than given my attendance to these reci­ <lb/>
            tations of my friends, for in these, as in all other good <lb/>

            same time, with all the deference due to age; and, in a <lb/>
            word, he is no less desirous to model himself by my in­ <lb/>
            structions than I was by those of yourself and your <lb/>

          <p>He is a native of Brixia, one of those provinces in <lb/>

            simplicity, and even rusticity, of manner. He is the son <lb/>
            of Minutius Macrinus, whose humble desires were satisfied <lb/>
            with standing at the head of the equestrian order: for <lb/>
            though he was nominated by Vespasian in the number of <lb/>
            those whom that prince dignified with the praetorian office, <lb/>
            yet, with an inflexible greatness of mind, he resolutely <lb/>

            call them, or exalted, pursuits, in which we public men <lb/>
            are engaged. His grandmother, on the mother's side, is <lb/>
            Serrana Procula, of Patavium:1 you are no stranger to <lb/>
            the character of its citizens; yet Serrana is looked upon, <lb/>
            even among these correct people, as an exemplary in­ <lb/>
            stance of strict virtue. Acilius, his uncle, is a man of <lb/>
            almost exceptional gravity, wisdom, and integrity. In <lb/>
            short, you will find nothing throughout his family un­ <lb/>
            worthy of yours. Minutius himself has plenty of vivacity, <lb/>
            as well as application, together with a most amiable and <lb/>
            becoming modesty. He has already, with considerable <lb/>
            credit, passed through the offices of quaestor, tribune, and <lb/>
            praetor; so that you will be spared the trouble of solicit­ <lb/>
            ing for him those honourable employments. He has a <lb/>
            fine, well-bred, countenance, with a ruddy, healthy com­ <lb/>
            plexion, while his whole person is elegant and comely and <lb/>
            his mien graceful and senatorian: advantages, I think, by <lb/>
            no means to be slighted, and which I consider as the <lb/>
            proper tribute to virgin innocence. I think I may add <lb/>
            that his father is very rich. When I contemplate the <lb/>
            character of those who require a husband of my choosing, <lb/>
            I know it is unnecessary to mention wealth; but when I <lb/>
            reflect upon the prevailing manners of the age, and even <lb/>
            the laws of Rome, which rank a man according to his <lb/>
            possessions, it certainly claims some regard; and, indeed, <lb/>
            in establishments of this nature, where children and many <note type="footnote"> 1 Padua. </note> <lb/>

            other circumstances are to be duly weighed, it is an article <lb/>
            that well deserves to be taken into the account. You will <lb/>
            be inclined, perhaps, to suspect that affection has had too <lb/>
            great a share in the character I have been drawing, and <lb/>
            that I have heightened it beyond the truth: but I will <lb/>
            stake all my credit, you will find everything far beyond <lb/>
            what I have represented. I love the young fellow indeed <lb/>
            (as he justly deserves) with all the warmth of a most ardent <lb/>
            affection; but for that very reason I would not ascribe <lb/>

          <p>You tell me in your letter that you are extremely <lb/>
            alarmed by a dream; apprehending that it forebodes some <lb/>
            ill success to you in the case you have undertaken to <lb/>
            defend; and, therefore, desire that I would get it adjourned <lb/>
            for a few days, or, at least, to the next. This will be no <lb/>
            easy matter, but I will try: <lb/>
            .... "For dreams descend from Jove." <lb/>
            Meanwhile, it is very material for you to recollect whether <lb/>
            your dreams generally represent things as they after­ <lb/>
            wards fall out, or quite the reverse. But if I may judge <lb/>
            of yours by one that happened to myself, this dream <lb/>
            that alarms you seems to portend that you will acquit <lb/>
            yourself with great success. I had promised to stand coun­ <lb/>
            sel for Junius Pastor; when I fancied in my sleep that my <lb/>
            mother-in-law came to me, and, throwing herself at my feet, <lb/>
            earnestly entreated me not to plead. I was at that time a <lb/>
            very young man; the case was to be argued in the four <lb/>
            centumviral courts; my adversaries were some of the most <lb/>
            important personages in Rome, and particular favourites <lb/>
            of Caesar ;1 any of which circumstances were sufficient, after <lb/>
            such an inauspicious dream, to have discouraged me. Not­ <lb/>
            withstanding this, I engaged in the cause, reflecting that, <lb/>
            "Without a sign, his sword the brave man draws, <lb/>
            And asks no omen but his country's cause."2 <lb/>
            for I looked upon the promise I had given to be as sacred <lb/>
            to me as my country, or, if that were possible, more so. <lb/>
            The event happened as I wished; and it was that very case <lb/>
            which first procured me the favourable attention of the <lb/>
            public, and threw open to me the gates of Fame. Consider <lb/>
            then whether your dream, like this one I have related, may <lb/>
            not pre-signify success. But, after all, perhaps you will think <note type="footnote"> 1 Domitian. </note> <note type="footnote"> a Iliad, xii. 243. Pope. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            it safer to pursue this cautious maxim: "Never do a thing <lb/>
            concerning the rectitude of which you are in doubt;" if so, <lb/>
            write me word. In the interval, I will consider of some ex­ <lb/>
            cuse, and will so plead your cause that you may be able to <lb/>
            plead it your self any day you like best. In this respect, you <lb/>
            are in a better situation than I was: the court of the cen­ <lb/>
            tumviri, where I was to plead, admits of no adjournment: <lb/>
            whereas, in that where your case is to be heard, though <lb/>
            no easy matter to procure one, still, however, it is possible. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">XIV To CORNELIUS TACITUS</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE frequent debates with a certain acquaintance of <lb/>
            mine, a man of skill and learning, who admires nothing <lb/>
            so much in the eloquence of the bar as conciseness. I agree <lb/>
            with him, that where the case will admit of this precision, <lb/>
            it may with propriety be adopted; but insist that, to leave <lb/>
            out what is material to be mentioned, or only briefly and <lb/>
            cursorily to touch upon those points which should be incul­ <lb/>
            cated, impressed, and urged well home upon the minds of <lb/>
            the audience, is a downright fraud upon one's client. In <lb/>
            many cases, to deal with the subject at greater length adds <lb/>
            strength and weight to our ideas, which frequently produce <lb/>
            their impression upon the mind, as iron does upon solid <lb/>
            bodies, rather by repeated strokes than a single blow. In <lb/>
            answer to this, he usually has recourse to authorities, and <lb/>
            produces Lysias1 amongst the Grecians, together with Cato <lb/>
            and the two Gracchi, among our own countrymen, many of <lb/>
            whose speeches certainly are brief and curtailed. In return, <lb/>
            I name Demosthenes, Aeschines, Hyperides,' and many <lb/>
            others, in opposition to Lysias; while I confront Cato and <lb/>
            the Gracchi with Caesar, Pollio,' Caelius,4 but, above all, <lb/>
            Cicero, whose longest speech is generally considered his best. <lb/>
            Why, no doubt about it, in good compositions, as in every­ <lb/>
            thing else that is valuable, the more there is of them, the <lb/>
            better. You may observe in statues, basso-relievos, pic­ <lb/>
            tures, and the human form, and even in animals and trees, <lb/>
            that nothing is more graceful than magnitude, if accom­ <lb/>
            panied with proportion. The same holds true in pleading; <note type="footnote"> 1 An elegant Attic orator, remarkable for the grace and lucidity of his <lb/>

            and even in books a large volume carries a certain beauty <lb/>
            and authority in its very size. My antagonist, who is ex­ <lb/>
            tremely dexterous at evading an argument, eludes all this, <lb/>
            and much more, which I usually urge to the same purpose, <lb/>
            by insisting that those very individuals, upon whose works <lb/>
            I found my opinion, made considerable additions to their <lb/>
            speeches when they published them. This I deny; and ap­ <lb/>
            peal to the harangues of numberless orators, particularly to <lb/>
            those of Cicero, for Murena and Varenus, in which a short, <lb/>
            bare notification of certain charges is expressed under mere <lb/>
            heads. Whence it appears that many things which he en­ <lb/>
            larged upon at the time he delivered those speeches were <lb/>
            retrenched when he gave them to the public. The same excel­ <lb/>
            lent orator informs us that, agreeably to the ancient cus­ <lb/>
            tom, which allowed only of one counsel on a side, Cluentius <lb/>
            had no other advocate than himself; and he tells us further <lb/>
            that he employed four whole days in defence of Cornelius; <lb/>
            by which it plainly appears that those speeches which, when <lb/>
            delivered at their full length, had necessarily taken up so <lb/>
            much time at the bar were considerably cut down and <lb/>
            pruned when he afterwards compressed them into a single <lb/>
            volume, though, I must confess, indeed, a large one. But <lb/>
            good pleading, it is objected, is one thing, just composition <lb/>
            another. This objection, I am aware, has had some favour­ <lb/>
            ers; nevertheless, I am persuaded (though I may, perhaps, <lb/>
            be mistaken) that, as it is possible you may have a good <lb/>
            pleading which is not a good speech, so a good speech can­ <lb/>
            not be a bad pleading; for the speech on paper is the model <lb/>
            and, as it were, the archetype of the speech that was de­ <lb/>
            livered. It is for this reason we find, in many of the best <lb/>
            speeches extant, numberless extemporaneous turns of ex­ <lb/>
            pression; and even in those which we are sure were never <lb/>
            spoken; as, for instance, in the following passage from the <lb/>
            speech against Verres:—“A certain mechanic-what’s his <lb/>
            name? Oh, thank you for helping me to it: yes, I mean <lb/>
            Polyclitus." It follows, then, that the nearer approach a <lb/>
            speaker makes to the rules of just composition, the more <lb/>
            perfect will be be in his art; always supposing, however, <lb/>
            that he has his due share of time allowed him; for, if he be <lb/>
            limited of that article, no blame can justly be fixed upon the <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            advocate, though much certainly upon the judge. The sense <lb/>
            of the laws, I am sure, is on my side, which are by no means <lb/>
            sparing of the orator's time; it is not conciseness, but ful­ <lb/>
            ness, a complete representation of every material circum­ <lb/>
            stance, which they recommend. Now conciseness cannot <lb/>
            effect this, unless in the most insignificant cases. Let me <lb/>
            add what experience, that unerring guide, has taught me: <lb/>
            it has frequently been my province to act both as an advo­ <lb/>
            cate and a judge; and I have often also attended as an <lb/>
            assessor.5 Upon those occasions, I have ever found the <lb/>
            judgments of mankind are to be influenced by different <lb/>
            modes of application, and that the slightest circumstances <lb/>
            frequently produce the most important consequences. The <lb/>
            dispositions and understandings of men vary to such an <lb/>
            extent that they seldom agree in their opinions concerning <lb/>
            any one point in debate before them; or, if they do, it is <lb/>
            generally from different motives. Besides, as every man <lb/>
            is naturally partial to his own discoveries, when he hears <lb/>
            an argument urged which had previously occurred to him­ <lb/>
            self, he will be sure to embrace it as extremely convincing. <lb/>
            The orator, therefore, should so adapt himself to his audi­ <lb/>
            ence as to throw out something which every one of them, <lb/>
            in turn, may receive and approve as agreeable to his own <lb/>
            particular views. I recollect, once when Regulus and <lb/>
            I were engaged on the same side, his remarking to me, <lb/>
            "You seem to think it necessary to go into every single cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance: whereas I always take aim at once at my ad­ <lb/>
            versary's throat, and there I press him closely." ('Tis true, <lb/>
            he keeps a tight hold of whatever part he has once fixed <lb/>
            upon; but the misfortune is, he is extremely apt to fix <lb/>
            upon the wrong place.) I replied, it might possibly happen <lb/>
            that what he called the throat was, in reality, the knee or <lb/>
            the ankle. As for myself, said I, who do not pretend to <lb/>
            direct my aim with so much precision, I test every part, I <lb/>
            probe every opening; in short, to use a vulgar proverb, I <lb/>
            leave no stone unturned. And as in agriculture, it is not <lb/>
            my vineyards or my woods only, but my fields as well, that I <lb/>
            look after and cultivate, and (to carry on the metaphor) as <note type="footnote"> 5 The praetor was assisted by ten assessors, five of whom were senators, <lb/>
            and the rest knights. With these he was obliged to consult before he <lb/>
            pronounced sentence. At. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            I do not content myself with sowing those fields simply <lb/>
            with corn or white wheat, but sprinkle in barley, pulse, and <lb/>
            the other kinds of grain; so, in my pleadings at the bar, I <lb/>
            scatter broadcast various arguments like so many kinds of <lb/>
            seed, in order to reap whatever may happen to come up. <lb/>
            For the disposition of your judges is as hard to fathom as <lb/>
            uncertain, and as little to be relied on as that of soils and <lb/>
            seasons. The comic writer Eupolis,' I remember, mentions <lb/>
            it in praise of that excellent orator Pericles, that <lb/>
            "On his lips Persuasion hung, <lb/>
            And powerful Reason rul'd his tongue: <lb/>
            Thus he alone could boast the art <lb/>
            To charm at once, and pierce the heart." <lb/>
            But could Pericles, without the richest variety of expres­ <lb/>
            sion, and merely by the force of the concise or the rapid <lb/>
            style, or both (for they are very different), have thus <lb/>
            charmed and pierced the heart. To delight and to persuade <lb/>
            requires time and great command of language; and to <lb/>
            leave a sting in the minds of the audience is an effect not <lb/>
            to be expected from an orator who merely pinks, but from <lb/>
            him, and him only, who thrusts in. Another comic poet," <lb/>
            speaking of the same orator, says: <lb/>
            "His mighty words like Jove's own thunder roll; <lb/>
            Greece hears, and trembles to her inmost soul." <lb/>
            But it is not the close and reserved; it is the copious, the <lb/>
            majestic, and the sublime orator, who thunders, who light­ <lb/>
            ens, who, in short, bears all before him in a confused whirl. <lb/>
            There is, undeniably, a just mean in everything; but he <lb/>
            equally misses the mark who falls short of it, as he who <lb/>
            goes beyond it; he who is too limited as he who is too <lb/>
            unrestrained. Hence it is as common a thing to hear our <lb/>
            orators condemned for being too jejune and feeble as too <lb/>
            excessive and redundant. One is said to have exceeded the <lb/>
            bounds of his subject, the other not to have reached them. <lb/>
            Both, no doubt, are equally in fault, with this difference, <lb/>
            however, that in the one the fault arises from an abundance, <lb/>
            in the other, from a deficiency; an error, in the former case, <lb/>
            which, if it be not the sign of a more correct, is certainly of <note type="footnote"> 6 . A contemporary and rival of Aristophanes. <lb/>

            a more fertile genius. When I say this, I would not be un­ <lb/>
            derstood to approve that everlasting talkerS mentioned in <lb/>
            Homer, but that otherD described in the following lines: <lb/>
            "Frequent and soft, as falls the winter snow, <lb/>
            Thus from his lips the copious periods flow." <lb/>
            Not but that I extremely admire him,10 too, of whom the <lb/>
            poet says, <lb/>
            "Few were his words, but wonderfully strong." <lb/>
            Yet, if the choice were given me, I should give the pref­ <lb/>
            erence to that style resembling winter snow, that is, to the <lb/>
            full, uninterrupted, and diffusive; in short, to that pomp of <lb/>
            eloquence which seems all heavenly and divine. But (it is <lb/>
            replied) the harangue of a more moderate length is most <lb/>
            generally admired. It is :-but only by indolent people; <lb/>
            and to fix the standard by their laziness and false delicacy <lb/>
            would be simply ridiculous. Were you to consult persons <lb/>
            of this cast, they would tell you, not only that it is best to <lb/>
            say little, but that it is best to say nothing at all. Thus, <lb/>
            my friend, I have laid before you my opinions upon this <lb/>
            subject, and I am willing to change them if not agreeable <lb/>
            to yours. But should you disagree with me, pray let me <lb/>
            know clearly your reasons why. For, though I ought to <lb/>
            yield in this case to your more enlightened judgment, yet, <lb/>
            in a point of such consequence, I had rather be convinced by <lb/>
            argument than by authority. So if I don't seem to you very <lb/>
            wide of the mark, a line or two from you in return, inti­ <lb/>
            mating your concurrence, will be sufficient to confirm me in <lb/>
            my opinion: on the other hand, if you should think me mis­ <lb/>
            taken, let me have your objections at full length. Does it <lb/>
            not look rather like bribery, my requiring only a short letter, <lb/>
            if you agree with me; but a very long one if you should be <lb/>
            of a different opinion. Farewell. <note type="footnote"> 8 Thersites. Iliad, ii. v. 212. </note> <note type="footnote"> 9 Ulysses. Iliad, iii. v. 222. </note> <note type="footnote"> 10 Menelaus. Iliad, iii. v. 214. </note> <pb n="219"/>

          <p>I AM at present (and have been a considerable time) <lb/>
            detained in Rome, under the most stunning apprehensions. <lb/>
            Titus Aristo,2 whom I have a singular admiration and <lb/>
            affection for, is fallen into a long and obstinate illness, <lb/>
            which troubles me. Virtue, knowledge, and good sense, <lb/>
            shine out with so superior a lustre in this excellent man <lb/>
            that learning herself, and every valuable endowment, seem <lb/>
            involved in the danger of his single person. How con­ <lb/>
            summate his knowledge, both in the political and civil <lb/>
            laws of his country! How thoroughly conversant is he in <lb/>
            every branch of history or antiquity? In a word, there is <lb/>
            nothing you might wish to know which he could not teach <lb/>
            you. As for me, whenever I would acquaint myself with <lb/>
            any abstruse point, I go to him as my store-house. What <lb/>
            an engaging sincerity, what dignity in his conversation! <lb/>
            how chastened and becoming is his caution! Though he <lb/>
            conceives, at once, every point in debate, yet he is as slow <lb/>
            to decide as he is quick to apprehend; calmly and delib­ <lb/>
            erately sifting and weighing every opposite reason that is <lb/>
            offered, and tracing it, with a most judicious penetration, <note type="footnote"> 1 Great-grandfather of the Emperor M. Aurelius. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 An eminent lawyer of Trajan's reign. </note> <lb/>

            from its source through all its remotest consequences. His <lb/>
            diet is frugal, his dress plain; and whenever I enter his <lb/>
            chamber, and view him reclined upon his couch, I consider <lb/>
            the scene before me as a true image of ancient simplicity, <lb/>
            to which his illustrious mind reflects the noblest ornament. <lb/>
            He places no part of his happiness in ostentation, but in <lb/>
            the secret approbation of his conscience, seeking the reward <lb/>
            of his virtue, not in the clamorous applauses of the world, <lb/>
            but in the silent satisfaction which results from having <lb/>
            acted well. In short, you will not easily find his equal, <lb/>
            even among our philosophers by outward profession. No, <lb/>
            he does not frequent the gymnasia or porticoes8 nor does <lb/>
            he amuse his own and others' leisure with endless contro­ <lb/>
            versies, but busies himself in the scenes of civil and active <lb/>
            life. Many has he assisted with his interest, still more <lb/>
            with his advice, and withal in the practice of temperance, <lb/>
            piety, justice, and fortitude, he has no superior. You would <lb/>
            be astonished, were you there to see, at the patience with <lb/>
            which he bears his illness, how he holds out against pain, <lb/>
            endures thirst, and quietly submits to this raging fever and <lb/>
            to the pressure of those clothes which are laid upon him to <lb/>
            promote perspiration. He lately called me and a few more <lb/>
            of his particular friends to his bedside, requesting us to <lb/>
            ask his physicians what turn they apprehended his dis­ <lb/>
            temper would take; that, if they pronounced it incurable, <lb/>
            he might voluntarily put an end to his life; but if there <lb/>
            were hopes of a recovery, how tedious and difficult soever <lb/>
            it might prove, he would calmly wait the event; for so <lb/>
            much, he thought, was due to the tears and entreaties of his <lb/>
            wife and daughter, and to the affectionate intercession of <lb/>
            his friends, as not voluntarily to abandon our hopes, if they <lb/>
            were not entirely desperate. A true heroes resolution this, <lb/>
            in my estimation, and worthy the highest applause. In­ <lb/>
            stances are frequent in the world, of rushing into the arms <lb/>
            of death without reflection and by a sort of blind impulse; <lb/>
            but deliberately to weigh the reasons for life or death, and <lb/>
            to be determined in our choice as either side of the scale <lb/>
            prevails, shows a great mind. We have had the satisfac- <note type="footnote"> 2 The philosophers used to hold their disputations in the gymnast and <lb/>

            may heaven favour their promises and relieve me at length <lb/>

            much of my time and thoughts are taken up in attendance <lb/>
            upon my friend, and anxiety for him, that I have neither <lb/>
            leisure nor inclination for any reading or writing whatever. <lb/>
            Thus you have my fears, my wishes, and my after-plans. <lb/>
            Write me in return, but in a gayer strain, an account not <lb/>

          <p>ROME has not for many years beheld a more magnificent <lb/>
            and memorable spectacle than was lately exhibited in the <lb/>
            public funeral of that great, illustrious, and no less fortu­ <lb/>
            nate man, Verginius Rufus. He lived thirty years after he <lb/>
            had reached the zenith of his fame. He read poems com­ <lb/>
            posed in his honour, he read histories of his achievements, <lb/>
            and was himself witness of his fame among posterity. He <lb/>
            was thrice raised to the dignity of consul, that he might <lb/>
            at least be the highest of subjects, who1 had refused to be <lb/>
            the first of princes. As he escaped the resentment of those <lb/>
            emperors to whom his virtues had given umbrage and even <lb/>
            rendered him odious, and ended his days when this best of <lb/>
            princes, this friend of mankind2 was in quiet possession of <lb/>
            the empire, it seems as if Providence had purposely preserved <lb/>
            him to these times, that he might receive the honour of a <lb/>
            public funeral. He reached his eighty-fourth year, in full <note type="footnote"> 1" Verginius Rufus was governor of Upper Germany at the time of the <lb/>

            Vindex. who perished before Vesontio. After the death of Nero, Verginius <lb/>
            supported the claims of Galba, and accompanied him to Rome. Upon Otho's <lb/>
            death, the soldiers again attempted to proclaim Verginius emperor, and in <lb/>

            tranquillity and universally revered, having enjoyed strong <lb/>
            health during his lifetime, with the exception of a trembling <lb/>
            in his hands, which, however, gave him no pain. His last <lb/>
            illness, indeed, was severe and tedious, but even that cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance added to his reputation. As he was practising <lb/>
            his voice with a view of returning his public acknowledge­ <lb/>
            ments to the emperor, who had promoted him to the consul­ <lb/>
            ship, a large volume he had taken into his hand, and which <lb/>
            happened to be too heavy for so old a man to hold standing <lb/>
            up, slid from his grasp. In hastily endeavouring to recover <lb/>
            it, his foot slipped on the smooth pavement, and he fell down <lb/>
            and broke his thigh-bone, which being clumsily set, his age <lb/>
            as well being against him, did not properly unite again. The <lb/>
            funeral obsequies paid to the memory of this great man have <lb/>
            done honour to the emperor, to the age, and to the bar. The <lb/>
            consul Cornelius Tacitus' pronounced his funeral oration and <lb/>
            thus his good fortune was crowned by the public applause <lb/>
            of so eloquent an orator. He has departed from our midst, <lb/>
            full of years, indeed, and of glory; as illustrious by the <lb/>
            honours he refused as by those he accepted. Yet still we <lb/>
            shall miss him and lament him, as the shining model of a <lb/>
            past age; I, especially, shall feel his loss, for I not only <lb/>
            admired him as a patriot, but loved him as a friend. We <lb/>
            were of the same province, and of neighbouring towns, and <lb/>
            our estates were also contiguous. Besides these accidental <lb/>
            connections, he was left my guardian, and always treated me <lb/>
            with a parent's affection. Whenever I offered myself as a <lb/>
            candidate for any office in the state, he constantly supported <lb/>
            me with his interest; and although he had long since given <lb/>
            up all such services to friends, he would kindly leave his re­ <lb/>
            tirement and come to give me his vote in person. On the <lb/>
            day on which the priests nominate those they consider most <lb/>

            his excuses, in preference to so many other friends, elderly <lb/>
            men too, and of consular rank and said to me, " Had I a son <lb/>
            of my own, I would entrust you with this matter." And so <lb/>
            I cannot but lament his death, as though it were premature, <lb/>
            and pour out my grief into your bosom; if indeed one has any <lb/>

            more celebrated by posterity, now that he is gone from our <lb/>
            sight. I had much else to write to you but my mind is full of <lb/>

          <p>THE great fame of Isaeus had already preceded him here; <lb/>
            but we find him even more wonderful than we had heard. <lb/>
            He possesses the utmost readiness, copiousness, and abun­ <lb/>
            dance of language: he always speaks extempore, and his lec­ <lb/>
            tures are as finished as though he had spent a long time over <lb/>
            their written composition. His style is Greek, or rather the <lb/>
            genuine Attic. His exordiums are terse, elegant, attractive, <lb/>
            and occasionally impressive and majestic. He suggests sev­ <lb/>
            eral subjects for discussion, allows his audience their choice, <lb/>
            sometimes to even name which side he shall take, rises, ar­ <lb/>
            ranges himself, and begins. At once he has everything al­ <lb/>
            most equally at command. Recondite meanings of things are <lb/>
            suggested to you, and words-what words they are! ex­ <lb/>
            quisitely chosen and polished. These extempore speeches <lb/>
            of his show the wideness of his reading, and how much prac­ <lb/>
            tice he has had in composition. His preface is to the point, <lb/>
            his narrative lucid, his summing up forcible, his rhetorical <lb/>
            ornament imposing. In a word, he teaches, entertains, and <lb/>
            affects you; and you are at a loss to decide which of the <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            three he does best. His reflections are frequent, his syl­ <lb/>
            logisms also are frequent, condensed, and carefully finished, <lb/>
            a result not easily attainable even with the pen. As for <lb/>
            his memory, you would hardly believe what it is capable of. <lb/>
            He repeats from a long way back what he has previously <lb/>
            delivered extempore, without missing a single word. This <lb/>
            marvellous faculty he has acquired by dint of great ap­ <lb/>
            plication and practice, for night and day he does nothing, <lb/>
            hears nothing, says nothing else. He has passed his sixtieth <lb/>
            year and is still only a rhetorician, and I know no class of <lb/>
            men more single-hearted, more genuine, more excellent than <lb/>
            this class. We who have to go through the rough work of <lb/>
            the bar and of real disputes unavoidably contract a certain <lb/>
            unprincipled adroitness. The school, the lecture-room, the <lb/>
            imaginary case, all this, on the other hand, is perfectly in­ <lb/>
            nocent and harmless, and equally enjoyable, especially to old <lb/>
            people, for what can be happier at that time of life than <lb/>
            to enjoy what we found pleasantest in our young days? I <lb/>
            consider Isaeus then, not only the most eloquent, but the <lb/>
            happiest, of men, and if you are not longing to make his <lb/>
            acquaintance, you must be made of stone and iron. So, <lb/>
            if not upon my account, or for any other reason, come, for <lb/>
            the sake of hearing this man, at least. Have you never read <lb/>
            of a certain inhabitant of Cadiz who was so impressed with <lb/>
            the name and fame of Livy that he came from the remotest <lb/>
            corner of the earth on purpose to see him, and, his curiosity <lb/>
            gratified, went straight home again. It is utter want of taste, <lb/>
            shows simple ignorance, is almost an actual disgrace to a <lb/>
            man, not to set any high value upon a proficiency in so <lb/>
            pleasing, noble, refining a science. " I have authors," you will <lb/>
            reply, "here in my own study, just as eloquent." True: but <lb/>
            then those authors you can read at any time, while you <lb/>
            cannot always get the opportunity of hearing eloquence. <lb/>
            Besides, as the proverb says, " The living voice is that <lb/>
            which sways the soul; " yes, far more. For notwithstanding <lb/>
            what one reads is more clearly understood than what one <lb/>
            hears, yet the utterance, countenance, garb, aye and the very <lb/>
            gestures of the speaker, alike concur in fixing an impression <lb/>
            upon the mind; that is, unless we disbelieve the truth of <lb/>
            Aeschines' statement, who, after he had read to the Rhodians <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            that celebrated speech of Demosthenes, upon their expressing <lb/>
            their admiration of it, is said to have added, "Ah! what would <lb/>
            you have said, could you have heard the wild beast himself?" <lb/>
            And Aeschines, if we may take Demosthenes' word for it, <lb/>
            was no mean elocutionist; yet, he could not but confess that <lb/>
            the speech would have sounded far finer from the lips of its <lb/>
            author. I am saying all this with a view to persuading you <lb/>
            to hear Isaeus, if even for the mere sake of being able to say <lb/>
            you have heard him. Farewell.</p>

          <p>IT would be a long story, and of no great importance, to <lb/>
            tell you by what accident I found myself dining the other <lb/>
            day with an individual with whom I am by no means intimate, <lb/>
            and who, in his own opinion, does things in good style and <lb/>
            economically as well, but according to mine, with meanness <lb/>
            and extravagance combined. Some very elegant dishes were <lb/>
            served up to himself and a few more of us, whilst those <lb/>
            placed before the rest of the company consisted simply of <lb/>
            cheap dishes and scraps. There were, in small bottles, three <lb/>
            different kinds of wine; not that the guest might take their <lb/>
            choice, but that they might not have any option in their <lb/>
            power; one kind being for himself, and for us; another <lb/>
            sort for his lesser friends (for it seems he has degrees of <lb/>
            friends), and the third for his own freedmen and ours. <lb/>
            My neighbour,1 reclining next me, observing this, asked me <lb/>
            if I approved the arrangement. Not at all, I told him. <lb/>
            " Pray then," he asked, "what is your method upon such oc­ <lb/>
            casions?" " Mine," I returned, " is to give all my visitors the <lb/>
            same reception; for when I give an invitation, it is to enter­ <lb/>
            tain, not distinguish, my company: I place every man upon <lb/>
            my own level whom I admit to my table." " Not excepting <lb/>
            even your freedmen?" " Not excepting even my freedmen, <note type="footnote"> 1 The ancient Greeks and Romans did not sit up at the table as we do, <lb/>
            but reclined round it on couches, three and sometimes even four occupying <lb/>
            one couch, at least this latter was the custom among the Romans. Each <lb/>
            guest lay flat upon his chest while eating, reaching out his hand from time <lb/>
            to time to the table, for what he might require. As soon as he had made <lb/>
            a sufficient meal, he turned over upon his left side, leaning on the elbow. </note> <note type="footnote"> 8—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            whom I consider on these occasions my guests, as much as <lb/>
            any of the rest." He replied, " This must cost you a great <lb/>
            deal." " Not in the least." " How can that be?" " Simply <lb/>
            because, although my freedmen don't drink the same wine <lb/>
            as myself, yet I drink the same as they do." And, no doubt <lb/>
            about it, if a man is wise enough to moderate his appetite, <lb/>
            he will not find it such a very expensive thing to share with <lb/>
            all his visitors what he takes himself. Restrain it, keep it in, <lb/>
            if you wish to be true economist. You will find temperance <lb/>
            a far better way of saving than treating other people rudely <lb/>
            can be. Why do I say all this ? Why, for fear a young man <lb/>
            of your high character and promise should be imposed upon <lb/>
            by this immoderate luxury which prevails at some tables, <lb/>
            under the specious notion of frugality. Whenever any folly <lb/>
            of this sort falls under my eye, I shall, just because I care <lb/>
            for you, point it out to you as an example you ought to shun. <lb/>
            Remember, then, nothing is more to be avoided than this <lb/>
            modern alliance of luxury with meanness; odious enough <lb/>
            when existing separate and distinct, but still more hateful <lb/>
            where you meet with them together. Farewell.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE senate decreed yesterday, on the emperor's motion, a <lb/>
            triumphal statue to Vestricius Spurinna: not as they would <lb/>
            to many others, who never were in action, or saw a camp, <lb/>
            or heard the sound of a trumpet, unless at a show; but as it <lb/>
            would be decreed to those who have justly bought such a <lb/>
            distinction with their blood, their exertions, and their deeds. <lb/>
            Spurinna forcibly restored the king of the Bructeri1 to his <lb/>
            throne; and this by the noblest kind of victory; for he subdued <lb/>
            that warlike people by the terror of the mere display of his <lb/>
            preparation for the campaign. This is his reward as a hero, <lb/>
            while, to console him for the loss of his son Cottius, who <lb/>
            died during his absence upon that expedition, they also voted <lb/>
            a statue to the youth; a very unusual honour for one so <lb/>
            young; but the services of the father deserved that the pain <note type="footnote"> 2 A people of Germany. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            of so severe a wound should be soothed by no common balm. <lb/>
            Indeed Cottius himself evinced such remarkable promise of <lb/>
            the highest qualities that it is but fitting his short limited <lb/>
            term of life should be extended, as it were, by this kind of <lb/>
            immortality. He was so pure and blameless, so full of dignity, <lb/>
            and commanded such respect, that he might have challenged <lb/>
            in moral goodness much older men, with whom he now shares <lb/>
            equal honours. Honours, if I am not mistaken, conferred <lb/>
            not only to perpetuate the memory of the deceased youth, <lb/>
            and in consolation to the surviving father, but for the sake <lb/>
            of public example also. This will rouse and stimulate our <lb/>
            young men to cultivate every worthy principle, when they see <lb/>
            such rewards bestowed upon one of their own years, provided <lb/>
            he deserve them: at the same time that men of quality will <lb/>
            be encouraged to beget children and to have the joy and <lb/>
            satisfaction of leaving a worthy race behind, if their children <lb/>
            survive them, or of so glorious a consolation, should they <lb/>
            survive their children. Looking at it in this light then, I <lb/>
            am glad, upon public grounds, that a statue is decreed Cottius: <lb/>
            and for my own sake too, just as much; for I loved this <lb/>
            most favoured, gifted, youth, as ardently as I now grievously <lb/>
            miss him amongst us. So that it will be a great satisfaction <lb/>
            to me to be able to look at this figure from time to time as I <lb/>
            pass by, contemplate it, stand underneath, and walk to and <lb/>
            fro before it. For if having the pictures of the departed <lb/>
            placed in our homes lightens sorrow, how much more those <lb/>
            public representations of them which are not only memorials <lb/>
            of their air and countenance, but of their glory and honour <lb/>
            besides ? Farewell.</p>

          <p>As I know you eagerly embrace every opportunity of <lb/>
            obliging me, so there is no man whom I had rather be under <lb/>
            an obligation to. I apply to you, therefore, in preference to <lb/>
            anyone else, for a favour which I am extremely desirous of <lb/>
            obtaining. You, who are commander-in-chief of a very <lb/>
            considerable army, have many opportunities of exercising <lb/>
            your generosity; and the length of time you have enjoyed that <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            post must have enabled you to provide for all your own <lb/>
            friends. I hope you will now turn your eyes upon some <lb/>
            of mine: as indeed they are but a few Your generous dis­ <lb/>
            position, I know, would be better pleased if the number <lb/>
            were greater, but one or two will suffice my modest desires; <lb/>
            at present I will only mention Voconius Romanus. His <lb/>
            father was of great distinction among the Roman knights, <lb/>
            and his father-in-law, or, I might more properly call him, <lb/>
            his second father, (for his affectionate treatment of Voconius <lb/>
            entitles him to that appellation) was still more conspicuous. <lb/>
            His mother was one of the most considerable ladies of Upper <lb/>
            Spain: you know what character the people of that province <lb/>
            bear, and how remarkable they are for their strictness of <lb/>
            their manners. As for himself, he lately held the post of <lb/>
            flamen.1 Now, from the time when we were first students to­ <lb/>
            gether, I have felt very tenderly attached to him. We lived <lb/>
            under the same roof, in town and country, we joked to­ <lb/>
            gether, we shared each other's serious thoughts: for where <lb/>
            indeed could I have found a truer friend or pleasanter com­ <lb/>
            panion than he? In his conversation, and even in his very <lb/>
            voice and countenance, there is a rare sweetness; as at the <lb/>
            bar he displays talents of a high order; acuteness, elegance, <lb/>
            ease, and skill: and he writes such letters too that. were you <lb/>
            to read them you would imagine they had been dictated by <lb/>
            the Muses themselves. I have a very great affection for him, <lb/>
            as he has for me. Even in the earlier part of our lives, <lb/>
            I warmly embraced every opportunity of doing him all the <lb/>
            good services which then lay in my power, as I have lately <lb/>
            obtained for him from our most gracious prince' the privilege. <lb/>
            granted to those who have three children: a favour which, <lb/>
            though Caesar very rarely bestows, and always with great <lb/>
            caution, yet he conferred, at my request, in such a matter <lb/>
            as to give it the air and grace of being his own choice. <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Any Roman priest devoted to the service of one particular god was <lb/>
            designated Flamen, receiving a distinguishing epithet from the deity to <lb/>
            whom he ministered. The office was understood to last for life; but a <lb/>
            flamen might be compelled to resign for a breach of duty, or even on <lb/>
            account of the occurrence of an ill-omened accident while discharging his <lb/>
            functions." Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Trajan. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 By a law passed A. U. 762, it was enacted that every citizen of Rome <lb/>

            who were not legally entitled to it. </note> <lb/>

            The best way of showing that I think he deserves the kind­ <lb/>
            nesses he has already received from me is by increasing them, <lb/>
            especially as he always accepts my services so gratefully as <lb/>
            to deserve more. Thus I have shown you what manner of <lb/>
            man Romanus is, how thoroughly I have proved his worth, <lb/>
            and how much I love him. Let me entreat you to honour <lb/>
            him with your patronage in a way suitable to the generosity <lb/>
            of your heart, and the eminence of your station. But above <lb/>
            all let him have your affection; for though you were to con­ <lb/>
            fer upon him the utmost you have in your power to bestow, <lb/>
            you can give him nothing more valuable than your friendship, <lb/>
            That you may see he is worthy of it, even to the closest degree <lb/>
            of intimacy, I send you this brief sketch of his tastes, <lb/>
            character, his whole life, in fact. I should continue my <lb/>
            intercessions in his behalf, but that I know you prefer not <lb/>
            being pressed, and I have already repeated them in every <lb/>
            line of this letter: for, to show a good reason for what one <lb/>
            asks is true intercession, and of the most effectual kind. <lb/>

          <p>You guessed correctly: I am much engaged in pleading <lb/>
            before the Hundred. The business there is more fatiguing <lb/>
            than pleasant. Trifling, inconsiderable cases, mostly; it is <lb/>
            very seldom that anything worth speaking of, either from <lb/>
            the importance of the question or the rank of the persons <lb/>
            concerned, comes before them. There are very few lawyers <lb/>
            either whom I take any pleasure in working with. The <lb/>
            rest, a parcel of impudent young fellows, many of whom one <lb/>
            knows nothing whatever about, come here to get some prac­ <lb/>
            tice in speaking, and conduct themselves so forwardly and <lb/>
            with such utter want of deference that my friend Attilius <lb/>
            exactly hit it, I think, when he made the observation that <lb/>
            " boys set out at the bar with cases in the Court of the Hun­ <lb/>
            dred as they do at school with Homer," intimating that at both <lb/>
            places they begin where they should end. But in former <lb/>
            times (so my elders tell me) no youth, even of the best <lb/>
            families, was allowed in unless introduced by some person <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            of consular dignity. As things are now, since every fence <lb/>
            of modesty and decorum is broken down, and all distinctions <lb/>
            are levelled and confounded, the present young generation, <lb/>
            so far from waiting to be introduced, break in of their own <lb/>
            free will. The audience at their heels are fit attendants upon <lb/>
            such orators; a low rabble of hired mercenaries, supplied by <lb/>
            contract. They get together in the middle of the court, <lb/>
            where the dole is dealt round to them as openly as if they <lb/>
            were in a dining-room: and at this noble price they run from <lb/>
            court to court. The Greeks have an appropriate name in their <lb/>
            language for this sort of people, importing that they are <lb/>
            applauders by profession, and we stigmatize them with the <lb/>
            opprobrious title of table-flatterers: yet the dirty business al­ <lb/>
            luded to increases every day. It was only yesterday two of <lb/>
            my domestic officers, mere striplings, were hired to cheer <lb/>
            somebody or other, at three denarii apiece:1 that is what the <lb/>
            highest eloquence goes for. Upon these terms we fill as <lb/>
            many benches as we please, and gather a crowd; this is how <lb/>
            those rending shouts are raised, as soon as the individual <lb/>
            standing up in the middle of the ring gives the signal. For, <lb/>
            you must know, these honest fellows, who understand nothing <lb/>
            of what is said, or, if they did, could not hear it, would be at <lb/>
            a loss without a signal, how to time their applause: for many <lb/>
            of them don't hear a syllable, and are as noisy as any of the <lb/>
            rest. If, at any time, you should happen to be passing <lb/>
            by when the court is sitting, and feel at all interested to know <lb/>
            how any speaker is acquitting himself, you have no occasion <lb/>
            to give yourself the trouble of getting up on the judge's plat­ <lb/>
            form, no need to listen; it is easy enough to find out, for <lb/>
            you may be quite sure he that gets most applause deserves it <lb/>
            the least. Largius Licinus was the first to introduce this <lb/>
            fashion; but then he went no farther than to go round and <lb/>
            solicit an audience. I know, I remember hearing this from <lb/>
            my tutor Quinctilian. "I used," he told me, "to go and hear <lb/>
            Domitius Afer, and as he was pleading once before the <lb/>
            Hundred in his usual slow and impressive manner, hearing, <lb/>
            close to him, a most immoderate and unusual noise, and be­ <lb/>
            ing a good deal surprised at this, he left off: the noise ceased, <lb/>
            and he began again: he was interrupted a second time, and <note type="footnote"> 1 About 54 cents. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            a third. At last he enquired who it was that was speaking? <lb/>
            He was told, Licinus. Upon which, he broke off the case, <lb/>
            exclaiming, ' Eloquence is no more!' " The truth is it had <lb/>
            only begun to decline then, when in Afer's opinion it no <lb/>
            longer existed: whereas now it is almost extinct. I am <lb/>
            ashamed to tell you of the mincing and affected pronunci­ <lb/>
            ation of the speakers, and of the shrill-voiced applause with <lb/>
            which their effusions are received; nothing seems wanting <lb/>
            to complete this sing-song performance except claps, or <lb/>
            rather cymbals and tambourines. Howlings indeed (for I <lb/>
            can call such applause, which would be indecent even in the <lb/>
            theatre, by no other name) abound in plenty. Up to this <lb/>
            time the interest of my friends and the consideration of my <lb/>
            early time of life have kept me in this court, as I am afraid <lb/>
            they might think I was doing it to shirk work rather than <lb/>
            to avoid these indecencies, were I to leave it just yet: how­ <lb/>
            ever, I go there less frequently than I did, and am thus <lb/>
            effecting a gradual retreat. Farewell.</p>

          <p>You are surprised that I am so fond of my Laurentine, <lb/>
            or (if you prefer the name) my Laurens: but you will cease <lb/>
            to wonder when I acquaint you with the beauty of the villa, <lb/>
            the advantages of its situation, and the extensive view of <lb/>
            the sea-coast. It is only seventeen miles from Rome: so <lb/>
            that when I have finished my business in town, I can pass <lb/>
            my evenings here after a good satisfactory day's work. <lb/>
            There are two different roads to it: if you go by that of <lb/>
            Laurentum, you must turn off at the fourteenth mile-stone; <lb/>
            if by Astia, at the eleventh. Both of them are sandy in places, <lb/>
            which makes it a little heavier and longer by carriage, <lb/>
            but short and easy on horseback. The landscape affords plenty <lb/>
            of variety, the view in some places being closed in by woods, <lb/>
            in others extending over broad meadows, where numerous <lb/>
            flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, which the severity of the <lb/>
            winter has driven from the mountains, fatten in the spring <lb/>
            warmth, and on the rich pasturage. My villa is of a con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            venient size without being expensive to keep up. The court­ <lb/>
            yard in front is plain, but not mean, through which you <lb/>
            enter porticoes shaped into the form of the letter D, enclosing <lb/>
            a small but cheerful area between. These make a capital <lb/>
            retreat for bad weather, not only as they are shut in with <lb/>
            windows, but particularly as they are sheltered by a pro­ <lb/>
            jection of the roof. From the middle of these porticoes you <lb/>
            pass into a bright pleasant inner court, and out of that into <lb/>
            a handsome hall running out towards the sea-shore; so that <lb/>
            when there is a south-west breeze, it is gently washed with <lb/>
            the waves, which spend themselves at its base. On every <lb/>
            side of this hall there are either folding-doors or windows <lb/>
            equally large, by which means you have a view from the <lb/>
            front and the two sides of three different seas, as it were: <lb/>
            from the back you see the middle court, the portico, and <lb/>
            the area; and from another point you look through the <lb/>
            portico into the courtyard, and out upon the woods and dis­ <lb/>
            tant mountains beyond. On the left hand of this hall, a <lb/>
            little farther from the sea, lies a large drawing-room, and <lb/>
            beyond that, a second of a smaller size, which has one window <lb/>
            to the rising and another to the setting sun: this as well has <lb/>
            a view of the sea, but more distant and agreeable. The angle <lb/>
            formed by the projection of the dining-room with this draw­ <lb/>
            in--room retains and intensifies the warmth of the sun, and <lb/>
            this forms our winter quarters and family gymnasium, which <lb/>
            is sheltered from all the winds except those which bring <lb/>
            on clouds, but the clear sky comes out again before the <lb/>
            warmth has gone out of the place. Adjoining this angle is <lb/>
            a room forming the segment of a circle, the windows of <lb/>
            which are so arranged as to get the sun all through the day: <lb/>
            in the walls are contrived a sort of cases, containing a <lb/>
            collection of authors who can never be read too often. <lb/>
            Next to this is a bed-room, connected with it by a raised <lb/>
            passage furnished with pipes, which supply, at a wholesome <lb/>
            temperature, and distribute to all parts of this room, the heat <lb/>
            they receive. The rest of this side of the house is appropriated <lb/>
            to the use of my slaves and freedmen; but most of the <lb/>
            rooms in it are respectable enough to put my guests into. <lb/>
            In the opposite wing is a most elegant, tastefully fitted up <lb/>
            bed-room; next to which lies another, which you may call <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            either a large bed-room or a modified dining-room; it is very <lb/>
            warm and light, not only from the direct rays of the sun, but <lb/>
            by their reflection from the sea. Beyond this is a bed-room <lb/>
            with an ante-room, the height of which renders it cool in <lb/>
            summer, its thick walls warm in winter, for it is sheltered, <lb/>
            every way from the winds. To this apartment another ante- <lb/>
            room is joined by one common wall. From thence you <lb/>
            enter into the wide and spacious cooling-room belonging to <lb/>
            the bath, from the opposite walls of which two curved basins <lb/>
            are thrown out, so to speak; which are more than large <lb/>
            enough if you consider that the sea is close at hand. Ad­ <lb/>
            jacent to this is the anointing-room, then the sweating­ <lb/>
            room, and beyond that the bath-heating room: adjoining are <lb/>
            two other little bath-rooms, elegantly rather than sumptu­ <lb/>
            ously fitted up: annexed to them is a warm bath of wonder­ <lb/>
            ful construction, in which one can swim and take a view <lb/>
            of the sea at the same time. Not far from this stands the <lb/>
            tennis-court, which lies open to the warmth of the afternoon <lb/>
            sun. From thence you go up a sort of turret which has <lb/>
            two rooms below, with the same number above, besides a <lb/>
            dining-room commanding a very extensive look-out on to <lb/>
            the sea, the coast, and the beautiful villas scattered along the <lb/>
            shore line. At the other end is a second turret, containing <lb/>
            a room that gets the rising and setting sun. Behind this <lb/>
            is a large store-room and granary, and underneath, a <lb/>
            spacious dining-room, where only the murmur and break of <lb/>
            the sea can be heard, even in a storm: it looks out upon the <lb/>
            garden, and the gestatio,1 running round the garden. The <lb/>
            gestatio is bordered round with box, and, where that is de­ <lb/>
            cayed, with rosemary: for the box, wherever sheltered by <lb/>
            the buildings, grows plentifully, but where it lies open and <lb/>
            exposed to the weather and spray from the sea, though at <lb/>
            some distance from the latter, it quite withers up. Next <lb/>
            the gestatio, and running along inside it, is a shady vine­ <lb/>
            plantation, the path of which is so soft and easy to the tread <lb/>
            that you may walk bare-foot upon it. The garden is chiefly <lb/>
            planted with fig and mulberry trees, to which this soil is as <lb/>
            favourable as it is averse from all others. Here is a dining- <lb/>
            room, which, though it stands away from the sea enjoys <note type="footnote"> 1 Avenue. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            the garden view which is just as pleasant: two apartments run <lb/>
            round the back part of it, the windows of which look out <lb/>
            upon the entrance of the villa, and into a fine kitchen-garden. <lb/>
            From here extends an enclosed portico which, from its <lb/>
            great length, you might take for a public one. It has a range <lb/>
            of windows on either side, but more on the side facing the <lb/>
            sea, and fewer on the garden side, and these, single windows <lb/>
            and alternate with the opposite rows. In calm, clear, <lb/>
            weather these are all thrown open; but if it blows, those on <lb/>
            the weather side are closed, whilst those away from the <lb/>
            wind can remain open without any inconvenience. Before <lb/>
            this enclosed portico lies a terrace fragrant with the scent <lb/>
            of violets, and warmed by the reflection of the sun from the <lb/>
            portico, which, while it retains the rays, keeps away the <lb/>
            north-east wind; and it is as warm on this side as it is cool <lb/>
            on the side opposite: in the same way it is a protection <lb/>
            against the wind from the south-west; and thus, in short, <lb/>
            by means of its several sides, breaks the force of the winds, <lb/>
            from whatever quarter they may blow. These are some <lb/>
            of its winter advantages, they are still more appreciable in <lb/>
            the summer time; for at that season it throws a shade upon <lb/>
            the terrace during the whole of the forenoon, and upon the <lb/>
            adjoining portion of the gestatio and garden in the after­ <lb/>
            noon, casting a greater or less shade on this side or on that <lb/>
            as the day increases or decreases. But the portico itself is <lb/>
            coolest just at the time when the sun is at its hottest, that <lb/>
            is, when the rays fall directly upon the roof. Also, by open­ <lb/>
            ing the windows you let in the western breezes in a free <lb/>
            current, which prevents the place getting oppressive with close <lb/>
            and stagnant air. At the upper end of the terrace and por­ <lb/>
            tico stands a detached garden building, which I call my <lb/>
            favourite; my favourite indeed, as I put it up myself. It <lb/>
            contains a very warm winter-room, one side of which looks <lb/>
            down upon the terrace, while the other has a view of the sea, <lb/>
            and both lie exposed to the sun. The bed-room opens on to <lb/>
            the covered portico by means of folding-doors, while its win­ <lb/>
            dow looks out upon the sea. On that side next the sea, and <lb/>
            facing the middle wall, is formed a very elegant little recess, <lb/>
            which, by means of transparent2 windows, and a curtain <note type="footnote"> 2 " Windows made of a transparent stone called lapis specularis (mica), </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            drawn to or aside, can be made part of the adjoining room, <lb/>
            or separated from it. It contains a couch and two chairs: as <lb/>
            you lie upon this couch, from where your feet are you get <lb/>
            a peep of the sea; looking behind you see the neighbouring <lb/>
            villas, and from the head you have a view of the woods: these <lb/>
            three views may be seen either separately, from so many dif­ <lb/>
            ferent windows, or blended together in one. Adjoining this <lb/>
            is a bed-room, which neither the servants' voices, the murmur­ <lb/>
            ing of the sea, the glare of lightning, nor daylight itself can <lb/>
            penetrate, unless you open the windows. This profound tran­ <lb/>
            quillity and seclusion are occasioned by a passage sepa­ <lb/>
            rating the wall of this room from that of the garden, and <lb/>
            thus, by means of this intervening space, every noise is <lb/>
            drowned. Annexed to this is a tiny stove-room, which, by <lb/>
            opening or shutting a little aperture, lets out or retains the <lb/>
            heat from underneath, according as you require. Beyond <lb/>
            this lie a bed-room and ante-room, which enjoy the sun, <lb/>
            though obliquely indeed, from the time it rises, till the after­ <lb/>
            noon. When I retire to this garden summer-house, I fancy <lb/>
            myself a hundred miles away from my villa, and take especial <lb/>
            pleasure in it at the feast of the Saturnalia,' when, by the <lb/>
            licence of that festive season, every other part of my house <lb/>
            resounds with my servants' mirth: thus I neither interrupt <lb/>
            their amusement nor they my studies. Amongst the pleasures <lb/>
            and conveniences of this situation, there is one drawback, <lb/>
            and that is, the want of running water; but then there are <lb/>
            wells about the place, or rather springs, for they lie close <lb/>
            to the surface. And, altogether, the quality of this coast is <lb/>
            remarkable; for dig where you may, you meet, upon the <lb/>
            first turning up of the ground, with a spring of water, quite <lb/>
            pure, not in the least salt, although so near the sea. The <lb/>
            neighbouring woods supply us with all the fuel we require, <lb/>
            the other necessaries Ostia furnishes. Indeed, to a moderate <lb/>
            man, even the village (between which and my house there is <lb/>
            only one villa) would supply all ordinary requirements. It has <note type="footnote"> which was first found in Hispania Citerior, and afterwards in Cyprus, <lb/>

            three public baths, which are a great convenience if it happen <lb/>
            that friends come in unexpectedly, or make too short a stay <lb/>
            to allow time in preparing my own. The whole coast is <lb/>
            very pleasantly sprinkled with villas either in rows or de­ <lb/>
            tached, which whether looking at them from the sea or the <lb/>
            shore, present the appearance of so many different cities. <lb/>
            The strand is, sometimes, after a long calm, perfectly smooth, <lb/>
            though, in general, through the storms driving the waves upon <lb/>
            it, it is rough and uneven. I cannot boast that our sea is <lb/>
            plentiful in choice fish; however, it supplies us with capital <lb/>
            soles and prawns; but as to other kinds of provisions, my <lb/>
            villa aspires to excel even inland countries, particularly in <lb/>
            milk: for the cattle come up there from the meadows in <lb/>
            large numbers, in pursuit of water and shade. Tell me, now, <lb/>
            have I not good reason for living in, staying in, loving, such <lb/>
            a retreat, which, if you feel no appetite for, you must be <lb/>
            morbidly attached to town ? And I only wish you would feel <lb/>
            inclined to come down to it, that to so many charms with <lb/>
            which my little villa abounds, it might have the very con­ <lb/>
            siderable addition of your company to recommend it. Fare­ <lb/>

          <p>You advise me to read my late speech before an assem­ <lb/>
            blage of my friends. I shall do so, as you advise it, though <lb/>
            I have strong scruples. Compositions of this sort lose, I <lb/>
            well know, all their force and fire, and even their very <lb/>
            name almost, by a mere recital. It is the solemnity of <lb/>
            the tribunal, the concourse of advocates, the suspense of <lb/>
            the event, the fame of the several pleaders concerned, the <lb/>
            different parties formed amongst the audience; add to this <lb/>
            the gestures, the pacing, aye the actual running, to and fro, <lb/>
            of the speaker, the body working1 in harmony with every <lb/>
            inward emotion, that conspire to give a spirit and a grace <note type="footnote"> 1 Cicero and Quintilian have laid down rules how far, and in what in­ <lb/>
            stances, this liberty was allowable, and both agree it ought to be used with <lb/>
            great sagacity and judgment. The latter of these excellent critics mentions <lb/>
            a witticism of Flavius Virginius, who asked one of these orators, " Quot <lb/>
            millia passuum declamasset?” How many miles he had declaimed. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            to what he delivers. This is the reason that those who <lb/>
            plead sitting, though they retain most of the advantages <lb/>
            possessed by those who stand up to plead, weaken the <lb/>
            whole force of their oratory. The eyes and hands of the <lb/>
            reader, those important instruments of graceful elocution, <lb/>
            being engaged, it is no wonder that the attention of the <lb/>
            audience droops, without anything extrinsic to keep it up, <lb/>
            no allurements of gesture to attract, no smart, stinging <lb/>
            impromptus to enliven. To these general considerations <lb/>
            I must add this particular disadvantage which attends the <lb/>
            speech in question, that it is of the argumentative kind; <lb/>
            and it is natural for an author to infer that what he wrote <lb/>
            with labour will not be read with pleasure. For who is <lb/>
            there so unprejudiced as not to prefer the attractive and <lb/>
            sonorous to the sombre and unornamented in style? It is <lb/>
            very unreasonable that there should be any distinction; <lb/>
            however, it is certain the judges generally expect one style <lb/>
            of pleading, and the audience another; whereas an auditor <lb/>
            ought to be affected only by those parts which would espe­ <lb/>
            cially strike him, were he in the place of the judge. Never­ <lb/>
            the less it is possible the objections which lie against this <lb/>
            piece may be surmounted in consideration of the novelty it <lb/>
            has to recommend it: the novelty I mean with respect to <lb/>
            us; for the Greek orators have a method of reasoning upon <lb/>
            a different occasion, not altogether unlike that which I <lb/>
            have employed. They, when they would throw out a law, <lb/>
            as contrary to some former one unrepealed, argue by com­ <lb/>
            paring those together; so I, on the contrary, endeavour to <lb/>
            prove that the crime, which I was insisting upon as falling <lb/>
            within the intent and meaning of the law relating to <lb/>
            public extortions, was agreeable, not only to that law, but <lb/>
            likewise to other laws of the same nature. Those who are <lb/>
            ignorant of the jurisprudence of their country can have <lb/>
            no taste for reasonings of this kind, but those who are not <lb/>
            ought to be proportionably the more favourable in the <lb/>
            judgments they pass upon them. I shall endeavour, there­ <lb/>
            fore, if you persist in my reciting it, to collect as learned <lb/>
            an audience as I can. But before you determine this <lb/>
            point, do weigh impartially the different considerations I <lb/>
            have laid before you, and then decide as reason shall direct; <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            for it is reason that must justify you; obedience to your <lb/>
            commands will be a sufficient apology for me. Farewell.</p>

          <p>GIVE me a penny, and I will tell you a story "worth <lb/>
            gold," or, rather, you shall hear two or three; for one <lb/>
            brings to my mind another. It makes no difference with <lb/>
            which I begin. Verania, the widow of Piso, the Piso, I <lb/>
            mean, whom Galba adopted, lay extremely ill, and Regulus <lb/>
            paid her a visit. By the way, mark the assurance of the <lb/>
            man, visiting a lady who detested him herself, and to whose <lb/>
            husband he was a declared enemy! Even barely to enter <lb/>
            her house would have been bad enough, but he actually <lb/>
            went and seated himself by her bed-side and began <lb/>
            enquiring on what day and hour she was born. Being <lb/>
            informed of these important particulars, he composes his <lb/>
            countenance, fixes his eyes, mutters something to himself, <lb/>
            counts upon his fingers, and all this merely to keep the poor <lb/>
            sick lady in suspense. When he had finished, "You are," <lb/>
            he says, "in one of your climacterics; however, you will <lb/>
            get over it. But for your greater satisfaction, I will con­ <lb/>
            sult with a certain diviner, whose skill I have frequently <lb/>
            experienced." Accordingly off he goes, performs a sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, and returns with the strongest assurances that the <lb/>
            omens confirmed what he had promised on the part of the <lb/>
            stars. Upon this the good woman, whose danger made <lb/>
            her credulous, calls for her will and gives Regulus a <lb/>
            legacy. She grew worse shortly after this; and in her <lb/>
            last moments exclaimed against this wicked, treacherous, <lb/>
            and worse than perjured wretch, who had sworn falsely to <lb/>
            her by his own son's life. But imprecations of this sort <lb/>
            are as common with Regulus as they are impious; and he <lb/>
            continually devotes that unhappy youth to the curse of <lb/>
            those gods whose vengeance his own frauds every day <lb/>
            provoke.</p>
          <p>Velleius Blaesus, a man of consular rank, and remark­ <lb/>
            able for his immense wealth, in his last illness was anxious <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            to make some alterations in his will. Regulus, who had <lb/>
            lately endeavoured to insinuate himself into his good <lb/>
            graces, hoped to get something from the new will, and <lb/>
            accordingly addresses himself to his physicians, and <lb/>
            conjures them to exert all their skill to prolong the poor <lb/>
            man's life. But after the will was signed, he changes his <lb/>
            character, reversing his tone: "How long," says he to <lb/>
            these very same physicians, "do you intend keeping this <lb/>
            man in misery? Since you cannot preserve his life, why <lb/>
            do you grudge him the happy release of death?" Blaesus <lb/>
            dies, and, as if he had overheard every word that Regulus <lb/>
            had said, has not left him one farthing.-And now have <lb/>
            you had enough ? or are you for the third, according <lb/>
            to rhetorical canon? If so, Regulus will supply you. <lb/>
            You must know, then, that Aurelia, a lady of remarkable <lb/>
            accomplishments, purposing to execute her will,1 had put <lb/>
            on her smartest dress for the occasion. Regulus, who was <lb/>
            present as a witness, turned to the lady, and "Pray," says <lb/>
            he, "leave me these fine clothes.” Aurelia thought the <lb/>
            man was joking: but he insisted upon it perfectly <lb/>
            seriously, and, to be brief, obliged her to open her will, <lb/>
            and insert the dress she had on as a legacy to him, watch­ <lb/>
            ing as she wrote, and then looking over it to see that <lb/>
            it was all down correctly. Aurelia, however, is still alive: <lb/>
            though Regulus, no doubt, when he solicited this bequest, <lb/>
            expected to enjoy it pretty soon. The fellow gets estates, <lb/>
            he gets legacies, conferred upon him, as if he really <lb/>
            deserved them! But why should I go on dwelling upon <lb/>
            this in a city where wickedness and knavery have, for <lb/>
            this time past, received, the same, do I say, nay, even <lb/>
            greater encouragement, than modesty and virtue? Regulus <lb/>
            is a glaring instance of this truth, who, from a state of <lb/>
            poverty, has by a train of villainies acquired such immense <lb/>
            riches that he once told me, upon consulting the omens to <lb/>
            know how soon he should be worth sixty millions of ses­ <lb/>
            terces,2 he found them so favourable as to portend he <lb/>
            should possess double that sum. And possibly he may, if <note type="footnote"> 1 This was an act of great ceremony; and if Aurelia's dress was of the <lb/>
            kind which some of the Roman ladies used, the legacy must have been <lb/>
            considerable which Regulus had the impudence to ask. At. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 $2,350,000. </note> <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>I NEVER, I think, spent any time more agreeably than my <lb/>
            time lately with Spurinna. So agreeably, indeed, that if <lb/>
            ever I should arrive at old age, there is no man whom I <lb/>
            would sooner choose for my model, for nothing can be <lb/>
            more perfect in arrangement than his mode of life. I look <lb/>
            upon order in human actions, especially at that advanced <lb/>
            age, with the same sort of pleasure as I behold the settled <lb/>
            course of the heavenly bodies. In young men, indeed, a <lb/>
            little confusion and disarrangement is all well enough: but <lb/>
            in age, when business is unseasonable, and ambition in­ <lb/>
            decent, all should be composed and uniform. This rule <lb/>
            Spurinna observes with the most religious consistency. <lb/>
            Even in those matters which one might call insignificant, <lb/>
            were they not of every-day occurrence, he observes a <lb/>
            certain periodical season and method. The early morning <lb/>
            he passes on his couch; at eight he calls for his slippers, <lb/>
            and walks three miles, exercising mind and body together. <lb/>
            On his return, if he has any friends in the house with him, <lb/>
            he gets upon some entertaining and interesting topic of <lb/>
            conversation; if by himself, some book is read to him, <lb/>
            sometimes when visitors are there even, if agreeable to the <lb/>
            company. Then he has a rest, and after that either takes <lb/>
            up a book or resumes his conversation in preference to <lb/>
            reading. By-and-by he goes out for a drive in his carriage, <lb/>
            either with his wife, a most admirable woman, or with <lb/>
            some friend: a happiness which lately was mine.-How <lb/>
            agreeable, how delightful it is getting a quiet time alone <lb/>
            with him in this way! You could imagine you were <lb/>
            listening to some worthy of ancient times! What deeds, <lb/>
            what men you hear about, and with what noble precepts <lb/>
            you are imbued! Yet all delivered with so modest an air <lb/>
            that there is not the least appearance of dictating. When <lb/>
            he has gone about seven miles, he gets out of his chariot <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            and walks a mile more, after which he returns home, and <lb/>
            either takes a rest or goes back to his couch and writing. <lb/>
            For he composes most elegant lyrics both in Greek and <lb/>
            Latin. So wonderfully soft, sweet, and gay they are, <lb/>
            while the author's own unsullied life lends them additional <lb/>
            :harm. When the baths are ready, which in winter is <lb/>
            about three o'clock, and in summer about two, he un­ <lb/>
            dresses himself and, if their happen to be no wind, walks <lb/>
            for some time in the sun. After this he has a good brisk <lb/>
            game of tennis: for by this sort of exercise too, he com­ <lb/>
            bats the effects of old age. When he has bathed, he <lb/>
            throws himself upon his couch, but waits a little before he <lb/>
            begins eating, and in the meanwhile has some light and <lb/>
            entertaining author read to him. In this, as in all the rest, <lb/>
            his friends are at full liberty to share; or to employ them­ <lb/>
            selves in any other way, just as they prefer. You sit down <lb/>
            to an elegant dinner, without extravagant display, which <lb/>
            is served up in antique plate of pure silver. He has <lb/>
            another complete service in Corinthian metal, which, <lb/>
            though he admires as a curiosity, is far from being his <lb/>
            passion. During dinner he is frequently entertained with <lb/>
            the recital of some dramatic piece, by way of seasoning <lb/>
            his very pleasures with study; and although he continues <lb/>
            at the table, even in summer, till the night is somewhat <lb/>
            advanced, yet he prolongs the entertainment with so much <lb/>
            affability and politeness that none of his guests ever finds <lb/>
            it tedious. By this method of living he has preserved all <lb/>
            his senses entire, and his body vigorous and active to his <lb/>
            seventy-eighth year, without showing any sign of old age <lb/>
            except wisdom. This is the sort of life I ardently aspire <lb/>
            after; as I purpose enjoying it when I shall arrive at <lb/>
            those years which will justify a retreat from active life. <lb/>
            Meanwhile I am embarrassed with a thousand affairs, in <lb/>
            which Spurinna is at once my support and my example: <lb/>
            for he too, so long as it became him, discharged his profes­ <lb/>
            sional duties, held magistracies, governed provinces, and <lb/>
            by toiling hard earned the repose he now enjoys. I pro­ <lb/>
            pose to myself the same career and the same limits: and <lb/>
            I here give it to you under my hand that I do so. If an <lb/>
            ill-timed ambition should carry me beyond those bounds, <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            produce this very letter of mine in court against me; and <lb/>
            condemn me to repose, whenever I enjoy it without being <lb/>
            reproached with indolence. Farewell.</p>

          <p>IT gives me great pleasure to find you such a reader of <lb/>
            my uncle's works as to wish to have a complete collection <lb/>
            of them, and to ask me for the names of them all. I will <lb/>
            act as index then, and you shall know the very order in <lb/>
            which they were written, for the studious reader likes to <lb/>
            know this. The first work of his was a treatise in one vol­ <lb/>
            ume, "On the Use of the Dart by Cavalry"; this he wrote <lb/>
            when in command of one of the cavalry corps of our allied <lb/>
            troops, and is drawn up with great care and ingenuity. <lb/>
            "The Life of Pomponius Secundus,”1 in two volumes. Pom­ <lb/>
            ponius had a great affection for him, and he thought he <lb/>
            owed this tribute to his memory. " The History of the <lb/>
            Wars in Germany," in twenty books, in which he gave an <lb/>
            account of all the battles we were engaged in against that <lb/>
            nation. A dream he had while serving in the army in <lb/>
            Germany first suggested the design of this work to him. <lb/>
            He imagined that Drusus Nero3 (who extended his con­ <lb/>
            quest very far into that country, and there lost his life) <lb/>
            appeared to him in his sleep, and entreated him to rescue <lb/>
            his memory from oblivion. Next comes a work entitled <lb/>
            “ The Student," in three parts, which from their length <lb/>
            spread into six volumes: a work in which is discussed the <lb/>
            earliest training and subsequent education of the orator. <lb/>
            " Questions of Grammar and Style," in eight books, written <lb/>
            in the latter part of Nero's reign, when the tyranny of the <lb/>
            times made it dangerous to engage in literary pursuits <lb/>
            requiring freedom and elevation of tone. He has com- <note type="footnote"> 1 A poet to whom Quintilian assigns the highest rank, as a writer of <lb/>
            tragedies, among his contemporaries (book x. c. i. 98). Tacitus also speaks <lb/>

            pleted the history which Aufidius Bassus* left unfinished, <lb/>
            and has added to it thirty books. And lastly he has left <lb/>
            thirty-seven books on Natural History, a work of great <lb/>
            compass and learning, and as full of variety as nature her­ <lb/>
            self. You will wonder how a man as busy as he was <lb/>
            :ould find time to compose so many books, and some of <lb/>
            them too involving such care and labour. But you will <lb/>
            be still more surprised when you hear that he pleaded at <lb/>
            the bar for some time, that he died in his sixty-sixth year, <lb/>
            that the intervening time was employed partly in the exe­ <lb/>
            cution of the highest official duties, partly in attendance <lb/>
            upon those emperors who honoured him with their friend­ <lb/>
            ship. But he had a quick apprehension, marvellous power <lb/>
            of application, and was of an exceedingly wakeful tempera­ <lb/>
            ment. He always began to study at midnight at the time <lb/>
            of the feast of Vulcan, not for the sake of good luck, but <lb/>
            for learning's sake; in winter generally at one in the <lb/>
            morning, but never later than two, and often at twelve.4 <lb/>
            He was a most ready sleeper, insomuch that he would some­ <lb/>
            times, whilst in the midst of his studies, fall off and then <lb/>
            wake up again. Before day-break he used to wait upon <lb/>
            Vespasian (who also used his nights for transacting busi­ <lb/>
            ness in), and then proceed to execute the orders he had <lb/>
            received. As soon as he returned home, he gave what time <lb/>
            was left to study. After a short and light refreshment at <lb/>
            noon (agreeably to the good old custom of our ancestors) <lb/>
            he would frequently in the summer, if he was disengaged <lb/>
            from business, lie down and bask in the sun; during which <lb/>
            time some author was read to him, while he took notes and <note type="footnote"> 3 A historian under Augustus and Tiberius. He wrote part of a history <lb/>
            of Rome, which was continued by the elder Pliny; also an account of the <lb/>
            German war, to which Quintilian makes allusion (Inst. x. 103), pronouncing <lb/>
            him. as a historian, " estimable in all respects, yet in some things failing <lb/>
            to do himself justice." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The distribution of time among the Romans was very different from <lb/>
            ours. They divided the night into four equal parts, which they called <lb/>
            watches, each three hours in length; and part of these they devoted either <lb/>
            to the pleasures of the table or to study. The natural day they divided <lb/>
            into twelve hours, the first beginning with sunrise, and the last ending <lb/>
            with sunset; by which means their hours were of unequal length, varying <lb/>
            according to the different seasons of the year. The time for business began <lb/>
            with sunrise, and continued to the fifth hour, being that of dinner, which <lb/>
            with them was only a slight repast. From thence to the seventh hour was <lb/>
            a time of repose; a custom which still prevails in Italy. The eighth hour <lb/>
            was employed in bodily exercises; after which they constantly bathed, and <lb/>
            from thence went to supper. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            made extracts, for every book he read he made extracts out <lb/>
            of, indeed it was a maxim of his, that " no book was so bad <lb/>
            but some good might be got out of it." When this was over, <lb/>
            he generally took a cold bath, then some light refreshment <lb/>
            and a little nap. After this, as if it had been a new day, he <lb/>
            studied till supper-time, when a book was again read to him, <lb/>
            which he would take down running notes upon. I remem­ <lb/>
            ber once his reader having mis-pronounced a word, one of <lb/>
            my uncle's friends at the table made him go back to where <lb/>
            the word was and repeat it again; upon which my uncle said <lb/>
            to his friend, " Surely you understood it?" Upon his ac­ <lb/>
            knowledging that he did, " Why then," said he, " did you <lb/>
            make him go back again? We have lost more than ten lines <lb/>
            by this interruption." Such an economist he was of time! <lb/>
            In the summer he used to rise from supper at daylight, and <lb/>
            in winter as soon as it was dark: a rule he observed as <lb/>
            strictly as if it had been a law of the state. Such was his <lb/>
            manner of life amid the bustle and turmoil of the town: <lb/>
            but in the country his whole time was devoted to study, <lb/>
            excepting only when he bathed. In this exception I in­ <lb/>
            clude no more than the time during which he was actually <lb/>
            in the bath; for all the while he was being rubbed and <lb/>
            wiped, he was employed either in hearing some book read <lb/>
            to him or in dictating himself. In going about anywhere, <lb/>
            as though he were disengaged from all other business, he <lb/>
            applied his mind wholly to that single pursuit. A short­ <lb/>
            hand writer constantly attended him, with book and tablets, <lb/>
            who, in the winter, wore a particular sort of warm gloves, <lb/>
            that the sharpness of the weather might not occasion any <lb/>
            interruption to my uncle's studies: and for the same reason, <lb/>
            when in Rome, he was always carried in a chair. I recol­ <lb/>
            lect his once taking me to task for walking. " You need <lb/>
            not," he said, "lose these hours." For he thought every hour <lb/>
            gone that was not given to study. Through this extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary application he found time to compose the several <lb/>
            treatises I have mentioned, besides one hundred and sixty <lb/>
            volumes of extracts which he left me in his will, consisting <lb/>
            of a kind of common-place, written on both sides, in very <lb/>
            small hand, so that one might fairly reckon the number con­ <lb/>
            siderably more. He used himself to tell us that when he was <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            comptroller of the revenue in Spain, he could have sold these <lb/>
            manuscripts to Largius Licinus for four hundred thousand <lb/>
            sesterces,5 and then there were not so many of them. When <lb/>
            you consider the books he has read, and the volumes he has <lb/>
            written, are you not inclined to suspect that he never was <lb/>
            engaged in public duties or was ever in the confidence of <lb/>
            his prince? On the other hand, when you are told how in­ <lb/>
            defatigable he was in his studies, are you not inclined to <lb/>
            wonder that he read and wrote no more than he did? For, <lb/>
            on one side, what obstacles would not the business of a <lb/>
            court throw in his way? and on the other, what is it that <lb/>
            such intense application might not effect? It amuses me then <lb/>
            when I hear myself called a studious man, who in compari­ <lb/>
            son with him am the merest idler. But why do I mention <lb/>
            myself, who am diverted from these pursuits by numberless <lb/>
            affairs both public and private? Who amongst those whose <lb/>
            whole lives are devoted to literary pursuits would not blush <lb/>
            and feel himself the most confirmed of sluggards by the side <lb/>
            of him? I see I have run out my letter farther than I had <lb/>
            originally intended, which was only to let you know, as <lb/>
            you asked me, what works he had left behind him. But I <lb/>
            trust this will be no less acceptable to you than the books <lb/>
            themselves, as it may, possibly, not only excite your <lb/>
            curiosity to read his works, but also your emulation to copy <lb/>
            his example, by some attempts of a similar nature. Farewell.</p>

          <p>I HAVE lately purchased with a legacy that was left me <lb/>
            a small statue of Corinthian brass. It is small indeed, but <lb/>

            which most certainly in matters of this sort, as perhaps in <lb/>

            servable. It represents an old man, in an erect attitude. <lb/>
            The bones, muscles, veins, and the very wrinkles, give the <note type="footnote"> 5 $16,000. </note> <lb/>

            impression of breathing life. The hair is thin and failing, <lb/>
            the forehead broad, the face shrivelled, the throat lank, the <lb/>
            arms loose and hanging, the breast shrunken, and the belly <lb/>
            fallen in, as the whole turn and air of the figure behind <lb/>
            too is equally expressive of old age. It appears to be true <lb/>
            antique, judging from the colour of the brass. In short, it <lb/>
            is such a masterpiece as would strike the eyes of a connote <lb/>
            seur, and which cannot fail to charm an ordinary observer: <lb/>
            and this induced me, who am an absolute novice in this <lb/>
            art, to buy it. But I did so, not with any intention of <lb/>
            placing it in my own house (for I have nothing of the kind <lb/>
            there), but with a design of fixing it in some conspicuous <lb/>
            place in my native province; I should like it best in the <lb/>
            temple of Jupiter, for it is a gift well worthy of a temple, <lb/>
            well worthy of a god. I desire therefore you would, with <lb/>
            that care with which you always perform my requests, <lb/>
            undertake this commission and give immediate orders for a <lb/>
            pedestal to be made for it, out of what marble you please, <lb/>
            but let my name be engraved upon it, and, if you think <lb/>
            proper to add these as well, my titles. I will send the <lb/>
            statue by the first person I can find who will not mind the <lb/>
            trouble of it; or possibly (which I am sure you will like <lb/>
            better) I may myself bring it along with me: for I intend, <lb/>
            if business can spare me that is to say, to make an ex­ <lb/>
            cursion over to you. I see joy in your looks when I promise <lb/>
            to come; but you will soon change your countenance when <lb/>
            I add, only for a few days: for the same business that at <lb/>
            present keeps me here will prevent my making a longer <lb/>
            stay. Farewell.</p>

          <p>I HAVE just been informed that Silius Italicus1 has starved <lb/>
            himself to death, at his villa near Naples. Ill-health was <lb/>
            the cause. Being troubled with an incurable cancerous <note type="footnote"> 1 Born about A. D. 25. He acquired some distinction as an advocate. <lb/>
            The only poem of his which has come down to us is a heavy prosaic per­ <lb/>
            formance in seventeen books, entitled " Tunica." and containing an account <lb/>
            of the events of the Second Punic War, from the capture of Saguntum to <lb/>
            the triumph of Scipio Africanus. See Smith's Diet. of Gr. and Rom. Biog. </note> <lb/>

            humour, he grew weary of life and therefore put an end to <lb/>
            it with a determination not to be moved. He had been <lb/>
            extremely fortunate all through his life with the exception <lb/>
            of the death of the younger of his two sons; however, he <lb/>
            has left behind him the elder and the worthier man of the <lb/>
            two in a position of distinction, having even attained consu­ <lb/>
            lar rank. His reputation had suffered a little in Nero's time, <lb/>
            as he was suspected of having officiously joined in some of <lb/>
            the informations in that reign; but he used his interest with <lb/>
            Vitellius, with great discretion and humanity. He acquired <lb/>
            considerable honour by his administration of the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Asia, and, by his good conduct after his retirement <lb/>
            from business, cleared his character from that stain which <lb/>
            his former public exertions had thrown upon it. He lived <lb/>
            as a private nobleman, without power, and consequently <lb/>
            without envy. Though he was frequently confined to his <lb/>
            bed, and always to his room, yet he was highly respected, <lb/>
            and much visited; not with an interested view, but on his <lb/>
            own account. He employed his time between conversing <lb/>
            with literary men and composing verses; which he some­ <lb/>
            times read out, by way of testing the public opinion: but <lb/>
            they evidence more industry than genius. In the decline of <lb/>
            his years he entirely quitted Rome, and lived altogether in <lb/>
            Campania, from whence even the accession of the new <lb/>
            emperor3 could not draw him. A circumstance which I <lb/>
            mention as much to the honour of Caesar, who was not dis­ <lb/>
            pleased with that liberty, as of Italicus, who was not afraid <lb/>
            to make use of it. He was reproached with indulging his <lb/>
            taste for the fine arts at an immoderate expense. He had <lb/>
            several villas in the same province, and the last purchase <lb/>
            was always the especial favourite, to the neglect of all the <lb/>
            rest. These residences overflowed with books, statues, and <lb/>
            pictures, which he more than enjoyed, he even adored; par­ <lb/>
            ticularly that of Virgil, of whom he was so passionate an <lb/>
            admirer that he celebrated the anniversary of that poet's <lb/>
            birthday with more solemnity than his own, at Naples es­ <lb/>
            pecially where he used to approach his tomb as if it had <lb/>
            been a temple. In this tranquillity he passed his seventy- <lb/>
            fifth year, with a delicate rather than an infirm constitution. <note type="footnote"> 2 Traj an. </note> <lb/>

            As he was the last person upon whom Nero conferred the <lb/>
            consular office, so he was the last survivor of all those who <lb/>
            had been raised by him to that dignity. It is also remark­ <lb/>
            able that, as he was the last to die of Nero's consuls, so <lb/>
            Nero died when he was consul. Recollecting this, a feel­ <lb/>
            ing of pity for the transitory condition of mankind comes <lb/>
            over me. Is there anything in nature so short and limited <lb/>
            as human life, even at its longest? Does it not seem to <lb/>
            you but yesterday that Nero was alive? And yet not one <lb/>
            of all those who were consuls in his reign now remains! <lb/>
            Though why should I wonder at this? Lucius Piso (the <lb/>
            father of that Piso who was so infamously assassinated by <lb/>
            Valerius Festus in Africa) used to say, he did not see one <lb/>
            person in the senate whose opinion he had consulted <lb/>
            when he was consul: in so short a space is the very term <lb/>
            of life of such a multitude of beings comprised! so that <lb/>
            to me those royal tears seem not only worthy of pardon <lb/>
            but of praise. For it is said that Xerxes, on surveying <lb/>
            his immense army, wept at the reflection that so many <lb/>
            thousand lives would in such a short space of time be <lb/>
            extinct. The more ardent therefore should be our zeal to <lb/>
            lengthen out this frail and transient portion of existence, <lb/>
            if not by our deeds (for the opportunities of this are not in <lb/>
            our power) yet certainly by our literary accomplishments; <lb/>
            and since long life is denied us, let us transmit to posterity <lb/>
            some memorial that we have at least LIVED. I well know <lb/>
            you need no incitements, but the warmth of my affection for <lb/>
            you inclines me to urge you on in the course you are <lb/>
            already pursuing, just as you have so often urged me. <lb/>

          <p>I DID not tell you, when I paid you my last visit, that I <lb/>
            had composed something in praise of your son; because <note type="footnote"> 1 Spurinna's wife. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            in the first place, I wrote it not for the sake of talking <lb/>
            about my performance, but simply to satisfy my affection, <lb/>
            to console my sorrow for the loss of him. Again, as you <lb/>
            told me, my dear Spurinna, that you had heard I had been <lb/>
            reciting a piece of mine, I imagined you had also heard at <lb/>
            the same time what was the subject of the recital, and besides <lb/>
            I was afraid of casting a gloom over your cheerfulness in <lb/>
            that festive season, by reviving the remembrance of that <lb/>
            heavy sorrow. And even now I have hesitated a little <lb/>
            whether I should gratify you both, in your joint request, <lb/>
            by sending only what I recited, or add to it what I am <lb/>
            thinking of keeping back for another essay. It does not <lb/>
            satisfy my feelings to devote only one little tract to a memory <lb/>
            so dear and sacred to me, and it seemed also more to the <lb/>
            interest of his fame to have it thus disseminated by <lb/>
            separate pieces. But the consideration, that it will be <lb/>
            more open and friendly to send you the whole now, rather <lb/>
            than keep back some of it to another time, has determined <lb/>
            me to do the former, especially as I have your promise <lb/>
            that it shall not be communicated by either of you to any­ <lb/>
            one else, until I shall think proper to publish it. The <lb/>
            only remaining favour I ask is, that you will give me a <lb/>
            proof of the same unreserve by pointing out to me what <lb/>
            you shall judge would be best altered, omitted, or added. <lb/>
            It is difficult for a mind in affliction to concentrate itself <lb/>
            upon such little cares. However, as you would direct a <lb/>
            painter or sculptor who was representing the figure of <lb/>
            your son what parts he should retouch or express, so I <lb/>
            hope you will guide and inform my hand in this more <lb/>
            durable or (as you are pleased to think it) this immortal <lb/>
            likeness which I am endeavouring to execute: for the <lb/>
            truer to the original, the more perfect and finished it is, <lb/>
            so much the more lasting it is likely to prove. Farewell.</p>

          <p>IT is just like the generous disposition of Artemidorus <lb/>
            to magnify the kindnesses of his friends; hence he praises <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            my deserts (though he is really indebted to me) beyond <lb/>
            their due. It is true indeed that when the philosophers <lb/>
            were expelled from Rome,1 I visited him at his house near the <lb/>
            city, and ran the greater risk in paying him that civility, <lb/>
            as it was more noticeable then, I being praetor at the time. <lb/>
            I supplied him too with a considerable sum to pay certain <lb/>
            debts he had contracted upon very honourable occasions, <lb/>
            without charging interest, though obliged to borrow the <lb/>
            money myself, while the rest of his rich powerful friends <lb/>
            stood by hesitating about giving him assistance. I did this <lb/>
            at a time when seven of my friends were either executed or <lb/>
            banished; Senecio, Rusticus, and Helvidius having just been <lb/>
            put to death, while Mauricus, Gratilla, Arria, and Fannia, <lb/>
            were sent into exile; and scorched as it were by so many <lb/>
            lightning-bolts of the state thus hurled and flashing round <lb/>
            me, I augured by no uncertain tokens my own impending <lb/>
            doom. But I do not look upon myself, on that account, as <lb/>
            deserving of the high praises my friend bestows upon me: <lb/>
            all I pretend to is the being clear of the infamous guilt of <lb/>
            abandoning him in his misfortunes. I had, as far as the <lb/>
            differences between our ages would admit, a friendship for <lb/>
            his father-in-law Musonius, whom I both loved and es­ <lb/>
            teemed, while Artemidorus himself I entered into the closest <lb/>
            intimacy with when I was serving as a military tribune in <lb/>
            Syria. And I consider as a proof that there is some good in <lb/>
            me the fact of my being so early capable of appreciating a <lb/>
            man who is either a philosopher or the nearest resem­ <lb/>
            blance to one possible; for I am sure that, amongst all those <lb/>
            who at the present day call themselves philosophers, you <lb/>
            will find hardly any one of them so full of sincerity and <lb/>
            truth as he. I forbear to mention how patient he is of heat <lb/>
            and cold alike, how indefatigable in labour, how abstemious <lb/>
            in his food, and what an absolute restraint he puts upon <lb/>
            all his appetites; for these qualities, considerable as they <lb/>
            would certainly be in any other character, are less notice­ <lb/>
            able by the side of the rest of those virtues of his which <lb/>
            recommended him to Musonius for a son-in-law, in prefer­ <lb/>
            ence to so many others of all ranks who paid their addresses <note type="footnote"> 1 Domitian banished the philosophers not only from Rome, but Italy, as <lb/>

            of his kind feeling carry him beyond the due limits; for he, <lb/>
            who is so free from all other errors, is apt to fall into just <lb/>

            in Socratic discourse, while even that in moderation. There <lb/>
            are certain necessary visits of ceremony, bringing people <lb/>
            out before daylight, which Cato himself could not safely <lb/>
            fall in with; though I must confess that Julius Caesar re­ <lb/>
            proaches him with that circumstance in such a manner as <lb/>
            redounds to his praise; for he tells us that the persons who <lb/>
            met him reeling home blushed at the discovery, and adds, <lb/>
            "You would have thought that Cato had detected them, and <lb/>
            not they Cato." Could he place the dignity of Cato in a <lb/>
            stronger light than by representing him thus venerable even <lb/>
            in his cups ? But let our supper be as moderate in regard to <lb/>
            hours as in the preparation and expense: for we are not of <lb/>

          <p>THE atrocious treatment that Largius Macedo, a man of <lb/>
            praetorian rank, lately received at the hands of his slaves <lb/>
            is so extremely tragical that it deserves a place rather in <lb/>
            public history than in a private letter; though it must at <lb/>
            the same time be acknowledged there was a haughtiness and <lb/>
            severity in his behaviour towards them which shewed that <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            he little remembered, indeed almost entirely forgot, the <lb/>
            fact that his own father had once been in that station of <lb/>
            life. He was bathing at his Formian Villa, when he found <lb/>
            himself suddenly surrounded by his slaves; one seizes him <lb/>
            by the throat, another strikes him on the mouth, whilst <lb/>
            others trampled upon his breast, stomach, and even other <lb/>
            parts which I need not mention. When they thought the <lb/>
            breath must be quite out of his body, they threw him down <lb/>
            upon the heated pavement of the bath, to try whether he <lb/>
            were still alive, where he lay outstretched and motionless, <lb/>
            either really insensible or only feigning to be so, upon <lb/>
            which they concluded him to be actually dead. In this con­ <lb/>
            dition they brought him out, pretending that he had got <lb/>
            suffocated by the heat of the bath. Some of his more <lb/>
            trusty servants received him, and his mistresses came about <lb/>
            him shrieking and lamenting. The noise of their cries and <lb/>
            the fresh air, together, brought him a little to himself; he <lb/>
            opened his eyes, moved his body, and shewed them (as <lb/>
            he now safely might) that he was not quite dead. The <lb/>
            murderers immediately made their escape; but most of them <lb/>
            have been caught again, and they are after the rest. He <lb/>
            was with great difficulty kept alive for a few days, and then <lb/>
            expired, having however the satisfaction of finding himself <lb/>
            as amply revenged in his lifetime as he would have been <lb/>
            after his death. Thus you see to what affronts, indignities, <lb/>
            and dangers we are exposed. Lenity and kind treatment <lb/>
            are no safeguard; for it is malice and not reflection that <lb/>
            arms such ruffians against their masters. So much for this <lb/>
            piece of news. And what else? What else? Nothing else, <lb/>
            or you should hear it, for I have still paper, and time too <lb/>
            (as it is holiday time with me) to spare for more, and I <lb/>
            can tell you one further circumstance relating to Macedo, <lb/>
            which now occurs to me. As he was in a public bath once, <lb/>
            at Rome, a remarkable, and (judging from the manner <lb/>
            of his death) an ominous, accident happened to him. A <lb/>
            slave of his, in order to make way for his master, laid his <lb/>
            hand gently upon a Roman knight, who, turning suddenly <lb/>
            round, struck, not the slave who had touched him, but <lb/>
            Macedo, so violent a blow with his open palm that he <lb/>
            almost knocked him down. Thus the bath by a kind of <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            gradation proved fatal to him; being first the scene of an <lb/>
            indignity he suffered, afterwards the scene of his death. <lb/>

            really greater, although less talked about; and I am con­ <lb/>
            firmed in this opinion by a conversation I had yesterday <lb/>
            with Fannia. This lady is a grand-daughter to that cele­ <lb/>
            brated Arria, who animated her husband to meet death, <lb/>
            by her own glorious example. She informed me of several <lb/>
            particulars relating to Arria, no less heroic than this <lb/>
            applauded action of hers, though taken less notice of, and <lb/>
            I think you will be as surprised to read the account of <lb/>
            them as I was to hear it. Her husband Caecinna Paetus, <lb/>
            and her son, were both attacked at the same time with a <lb/>
            fatal illness, as was supposed; of which the son died, a <lb/>
            youth of remarkable beauty, and as modest as he was <lb/>
            comely, endeared indeed to his parents no less by his many <lb/>
            graces than from the fact of his being their son. His <lb/>
            mother prepared his funeral and conducted the usual cere­ <lb/>
            monies so privately that Paetus did not know of his death. <lb/>
            Whenever she came into his room, she pretended her son <lb/>
            was alive and actually better: and as often as he enquired <lb/>
            after his health, would answer, “He has had a good rest, <lb/>
            and eaten his food with quite an appetite." Then when <lb/>
            she found the tears, she had so long kept back, gushing forth <lb/>
            in spite of herself, she would leave the room, and having <lb/>
            given vent to her grief, return with dry eyes and a serene <lb/>
            countenance, as though she had dismissed every feeling of <lb/>
            bereavement at the door of her husband's chamber. I must <lb/>
            confess it was a brave action1 in her to draw the steel, <note type="footnote"> 1 The following is the story, as related by several of the ancient his. <lb/>
            torians. Paetus, having joined Scribonianus, who was in arms, in Illyria, <lb/>
            against Claudius, was taken after the death of Scribonianus, and con­ <lb/>
            demned to death. Arria having, in vain, solicited his life, persuaded him <lb/>
            to destroy himself, rather than suffer the ignominy of falling by the exe­ </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            plunge it into her breast, pluck out the dagger, and present <lb/>
            it to her husband with that ever memorable, I had almost <lb/>
            said that divine, expression, " Paetus, it is not painful." <lb/>
            But when she spoke and acted thus, she had the prospect of <lb/>
            glory and immortality before her; how far greater, without <lb/>
            the support of any such animating motives, to hide her tears, <lb/>
            to conceal her grief, and cheerfully to act the mother, when <lb/>
            a mother no more!</p>
          <p>Scribonianus had taken up arms in Illyria against Clau­ <lb/>
            dius, where he lost his life, and Paetus, who was of his party, <lb/>
            was brought a prisoner to Rome. When they were going <lb/>
            to put him on board ship, Arria besought the soldiers that <lb/>
            she might be permitted to attend him: " For surely," she <lb/>
            urged, "you will allow a man of consular rank some ser­ <lb/>
            vants to dress him, attend to him at meals, and put his <lb/>
            shoes on for him; but if you will take me, I alone will per­ <lb/>
            form all these offices." Her request was refused; upon <lb/>
            which she hired a fishing-boat, and in that small vessel fol­ <lb/>
            lowed the ship. On her return to Rome, meeting the wife <lb/>
            of Scribonianus in the emperors palace, at the time when <lb/>
            this woman voluntarily gave evidence against the conspir­ <lb/>
            ators—“What," she exclaimed, " shall I hear you even <lb/>
            speak to me, you, on whose bosom your husband Scribon­ <lb/>
            ianus was murdered, and yet you survive him ? "-an ex­ <lb/>
            pression which plainly shews that the noble manner in <lb/>
            which she put an end to her life was no unpremeditated <lb/>
            effect of sudden passion. Moreover, when Thrasea, her <lb/>
            son-in-law, was endeavouring to dissuade her from her <lb/>
            purpose of destroying herself, and, amongst other argu­ <lb/>
            ments which he used, said to her, " Would you then advise <lb/>
            your daughter to die with me if my life were to be taken <lb/>
            from me?" "Most certainly I would," she replied, "if <lb/>
            she had lived as long, and in as much harmony with you, <lb/>
            as I have with my Paetus." This answer greatly increased <lb/>
            the alarm of her family, and made them watch her for the <lb/>
            future more narrowly; which, when she perceived, " It is <lb/>
            of no use," she said, " you may oblige me to effect my death <lb/>
            in a more painful way, but it is impossible you should pre­ <note type="footnote"> cutioner's hands; and, in order to encourage him to an act, to which, it <lb/>
            seems, he was not particularly inclined, she set him the example in the <lb/>
            manner Pliny relates. At. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            vent it." Saying this, she sprang from her chair, and run­ <lb/>
            ning her head with the utmost violence against the wall, <lb/>
            fell down, to all appearance, dead; but being brought to <lb/>
            herself again, " I told you," she said, " if you would not <lb/>
            suffer me to take an easy path to death, I should find a way <lb/>
            to it, however hard." Now, is there not, my friend, some­ <lb/>
            thing much greater in all this than in the so-much-talked-of <lb/>
            " Paetus, it is not painful," to which these led the way ? <lb/>
            And yet this last is the favourite topic of fame, while all <lb/>
            the former are passed over in silence. Whence I cannot <lb/>
            but infer, what I observed at the beginning of my letter, <lb/>
            that some actions are more celebrated, whilst others are <lb/>
            really greater.</p>

          <p>I WAS obliged by my consular office to compliment the <lb/>
            emperor1 in the name of the republic; but after I had per­ <lb/>
            formed that ceremony in the senate in the usual manner, <lb/>
            and as fully as the time and place would allow, I thought <lb/>
            it agreeable to the affection of a good subject to enlarge <lb/>
            those general heads, and expand them into a complete dis­ <lb/>
            course. My principal object in doing so was, to confirm the <lb/>
            emperor in his virtues, by paying them that tribute of ap­ <lb/>
            plause which they so justly deserve; and at the same time <lb/>
            to direct future princes, not in the formal way of lecture, <lb/>
            but by his more engaging example, to those paths they must <lb/>
            pursue if they would attain the same heights of glory. To <lb/>
            instruct princes how to form their conduct, is a noble, but <lb/>
            difficult task, and may, perhaps, be esteemed an act of <lb/>
            presumption: but to applaud the character of an accom­ <lb/>
            plished prince, and to hold out to posterity, by this means, a <lb/>
            beacon-light as it were, to guide succeeding monarchs, is a <lb/>
            method equally useful, and much more modest. It afforded <lb/>
            me a very singular pleasure that when I wished to recite <lb/>
            this panegyric in a private assemby, my friends gave me <lb/>
            their company, though I did not solicit them in the usual <lb/>
            form of notes or circulars, but only desired their attendance, <note type="footnote">1 Trajan. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            “should it be quite convenient to thorny and " if they should <lb/>
            happen to have no other engagement." You know the ex­ <lb/>
            cuses generally made at Rome to avoid invitations of this <lb/>
            kind; how prior invitations are usually alleged; yet, in spite <lb/>
            of the worst possible weather, they attended the recital for <lb/>
            two days together; and when I thought it would be un­ <lb/>
            reasonable to detain them any longer, they insisted upon my <lb/>
            going through with it the next day. Shall I consider this <lb/>
            as an honour done to myself or to literature? Rather let <lb/>
            me suppose to the latter, which, though well-nigh extinct, <lb/>
            seems to be now again reviving amongst us. Yet what was <lb/>
            the subject which raised this uncommon attention? No <lb/>
            other than what formerly, even in the senate, where we <lb/>
            had to submit to it, we used to grudge even a few moments' <lb/>
            attention to. But now, you see, we have patience to recite <lb/>
            and to attend to the same topic for three days together; and <lb/>
            the reason of this is, not that we have more eloquent writing <lb/>
            now than formerly, but we write under a fuller sense of <lb/>
            individual freedom, and consequently more genially than <lb/>
            we used to. It is an additional glory therefore to our <lb/>
            present emperor that this sort of harangue, which was once <lb/>
            as disgusting as it was false, is now as pleasing as it is <lb/>
            sincere. But it was not only the earnest attention of my audi­ <lb/>
            ence which afforded me pleasure; I was greatly delighted <lb/>
            too with the justness of their taste: for I observed, that the <lb/>
            more nervous parts of my discourse gave them peculiar <lb/>
            satisfaction. It is true, indeed, this work, which was written <lb/>
            for the perusal of the world in general, was read only to <lb/>
            a few; however, I would willingly look upon their par­ <lb/>
            ticular judgment as an earnest of that of the public, and <lb/>
            rejoice at their manly taste as if it were universally spread. <lb/>
            It was just the same in eloquence as it was in music, the <lb/>
            vitiated ears of the audience introduced a depraved style; <lb/>
            but now, I am inclined to hope, as a more refined judgment <lb/>
            prevails in the public, our compositions of both kinds will <lb/>
            improve too; for those authors whose sole object is to please <lb/>
            will fashion their works according to the popular taste. I <lb/>
            trust, however, in subjects of this nature the florid style <lb/>
            is most proper; and am so far from thinking that the vivid <lb/>
            colouring I have used will be esteemed foreign and un­ <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            natural that I am most apprehensive that censure will fall <lb/>
            upon those parts where the diction is most simple and un­ <lb/>
            ornate. Nevertheless, I sincerely wish the time may come, <lb/>
            and that it now were, when the smooth and luscious, which <lb/>
            has affected our style, shall give place, as it ought, to <lb/>
            severe and chaste composition.-Thus have I given you an <lb/>
            account of my doings of these last three days, that your <lb/>
            absence might not entirely deprive you of a pleasure which, <lb/>
            from your friendship to me, and the part you take in <lb/>
            everything that concerns the interest of literature, I know <lb/>
            you would have received, had you been there to hear. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">XXXVI To CALVISIUS RUFUS</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I MUST have recourse to you, as usual, in an affair which <lb/>
            concerns my finances. An estate adjoining my land, and <lb/>
            indeed running into it, is for sale. There are several con­ <lb/>
            siderations strongly inclining me to this purchase, while <lb/>
            there are others, no less weighty deterring me from it. Its <lb/>
            first recommendation is, the beauty which will result from <lb/>
            uniting this farm to my own lands; next, the advantage <lb/>
            as well as pleasure of being able to visit it without additional <lb/>
            trouble and expense; to have it superintended by the same <lb/>
            steward, and almost by the same sub-agents, and to have one <lb/>
            villa to support and embellish, the other just to keep in com­ <lb/>
            mon repair. I take into this account furniture, housekeepers, <lb/>
            fancy-gardeners, artificers, and even hunting-apparatus, as <lb/>
            it makes a very great difference whether you get these <lb/>
            altogether into one place or scatter them about in several. <lb/>
            On the other hand, I don't know whether it is prudent to <lb/>
            expose so large a property to the same climate, and the <lb/>
            same risks of accident happening; to distribute one's posses­ <lb/>
            sions about seems a safer way of meeting the caprice of <lb/>
            fortune, besides, there is something extremely pleasant in <lb/>
            the change of air and place, and the going about between <lb/>
            one's properties. And now, to come to the chief considera­ <lb/>
            tion:—the lands are rich, fertile, and well-watered, con­ <lb/>
            sisting chiefly of meadow-ground, vineyard, and wood, while <note type="footnote"> 9—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            the supply of building timber and its returns, though mod­ <lb/>
            erate, still, keep at the same rate. But the soil, fertile as <lb/>
            it is, has been much impoverished by not having been <lb/>
            properly looked after. The person last in possession used <lb/>
            frequently to seize and sell the stock, by which means, al­ <lb/>
            though he lessened his tenants' arrears for the time being, <lb/>
            yet he left them nothing to go on with and the arrears rail <lb/>
            up again in consequence. I shall be obliged, then, to pro­ <lb/>
            vide them with slaves, which I must buy, and at a higher <lb/>
            than the usual price, as these will be good ones; for I keep <lb/>
            no fettered slaves1 myself, and there are none upon the <lb/>
            estate. For the rest, the price, you must know, is three <lb/>
            millions of sesterces.' It has formerly gone over five mil­ <lb/>
            lions: but owing, partly to the general hardness of the <lb/>
            times, ana partly to its being thus stripped of tenants, the <lb/>
            income of this estate is reduced, and consequently its <lb/>
            value. You will be inclined perhaps to enquire whether I <lb/>
            can easily raise the purchase-money? My estate, it is true, <lb/>
            is almost entirely in land, though I have some money out <lb/>
            at interest; but I shall find no difficulty in borrowing any <lb/>
            sum I may want. I can get it from my wife's mother, whose <lb/>
            purse I may use with the same freedom as my own; so <lb/>
            that you need not trouble yourself at all upon that point, <lb/>
            should you have no other objections, which I should like you <lb/>
            very carefully to consider: for, as in everything else, so, <lb/>
            particularly in matters of economy, no man has more judg­ <lb/>
            ment and experience than yourself. Farewell.</p>

          <p>I HAVE just heard of Valerius Martial's death, which <lb/>
            gives me great concern. He was a man of an acute and <lb/>
            lively genius, and his writings abound in equal wit, satire, <lb/>
            and kindliness. On his leaving Rome I made him a present <lb/>
            to defray his travelling expenses, which I gave him, not <lb/>
            only as a testimony of friendship, but also in return for <note type="footnote"> 1 The Romans used to employ their criminals in the lower offices of <lb/>

            the verses with which he had complimented me. It was <lb/>
            the custom of the ancients to distinguish those poets with <lb/>
            honours or pecuniary rewards, who had celebrated par­ <lb/>
            ticular individuals or cities in their verses; but this good <lb/>
            custom, along with every other fair and noble one, has <lb/>
            grown out of fashion now; and in consequence of our <lb/>
            having ceased to act laudably, we consider praise a folly <lb/>
            and impertinence. You may perhaps be curious to see the <lb/>
            verses which merited this acknowledgment from me, and I <lb/>
            believe I can, from memory, partly satisfy your curiosity, <lb/>
            without referring you to his works: but if you should be <lb/>
            pleased with this specimen of them, you must turn to his <lb/>
            poems for the rest. He addresses himself to his muse, <lb/>
            whom he directs to go to my house upon the Esquiline,1 <lb/>
            but to approach it with respect. <lb/>
            "Go, wanton muse, but go with care, <lb/>
            Nor meet, ill-tim'd, my Pliny's ear; <lb/>
            He, by sage Minerva taught, <lb/>
            Gives the day to studious thought, <lb/>
            And plans that eloquence divine, <lb/>
            Which shall to future ages shine, <lb/>
            And rival, wondrous Tully! thine. <lb/>
            Then, cautious, watch the vacant hour, <lb/>
            When Bacchus reigns in all his pow'r; <lb/>
            When, crowned with rosy chaplets gay, <lb/>
            Catos might read my frolic lay."2 <lb/>
            Do you not think that the poet who wrote of me in such <lb/>
            terms deserved some friendly marks of my bounty then, and <lb/>
            of my sorrow now? For he gave me the very best he had <lb/>
            to bestow, and would have given more had it been in his <lb/>
            power. Though indeed what can a man have conferred on <lb/>
            him more valuable than the honour of never-fading praise? <lb/>
            But his poems will not long survive their author, at least <lb/>
            I think not, though he wrote them in the expectation of <lb/>
            their doing so. Farewell. <note type="footnote"> 1 One of the famous seven hills upon which Rome was situated. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Mart. Ix. 19. </note> <pb n="260"/>

            rejoicings whenever they hear of my preferments. By way <lb/>
            of requiting their kindnesses (for what generous mind can <lb/>
            bear to be excelled in acts of friendship?) I have built a <lb/>
            temple in this place, at my own expense, and as it is finished, <lb/>
            it would be a sort of impiety to put off its dedication any <lb/>
            longer. So we shall be there on the day on which that cere­ <lb/>
            mony is to be performed, and I have resolved to celebrate <lb/>
            it with a general feast. We may possibly stay on there for <lb/>
            all the next day, but shall make so much the greater haste <lb/>
            in our journey afterwards. May we have the happiness to <lb/>
            find you and your daughter in good health! In good spirits <lb/>
            I am sure we shall, should we get to you all safely. Fare­ <lb/>

          <p>REGULUS has lost his son; the only undeserved misfor­ <lb/>
            tune which could have befallen him, in that I doubt <lb/>
            whether he thinks it a misfortune. The boy had quick parts, <note type="footnote"> 1 Calpurnia, Pliny's wife. </note> <note type="footnote"> I Now Citta di Castello. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            but there was no telling how he might turn out; however, <lb/>
            be seemed capable enough of going right, were he not to <lb/>
            grow up like his father. Regulus gave him his freedom,1 <lb/>
            in order to entitle him to the estate left him by his mother; <lb/>
            and when he got into possession of it, (I speak of the cur­ <lb/>
            rent rumours, based upon the character of the man,) fawned <lb/>
            upon the lad with a disgusting shew of fond affection which <lb/>
            in a parent was utterly out of place. You may hardly think <lb/>
            this credible; but then consider what Regulus is. However, <lb/>
            he now expresses his concern for the loss of this youth in <lb/>
            . a most extravagant manner. The boy had a number of ponies <lb/>
            for riding and driving, dogs both big and little, together with <lb/>
            nightingales, parrots, and blackbirds in abundance. All these <lb/>
            Regulus slew round the funeral pile. It was not grief, but <lb/>
            an ostentatious parade of grief. He is visited upon this occa­ <lb/>
            sion by a surprising number of people, who all hate and detest <lb/>
            the man, and yet are as assiduous in their attendance upon <lb/>
            him as if they really esteemed and loved him, and, to give <lb/>
            you my opinion in a word, in endeavouring to do Regulus a <lb/>
            kindness, make themselves exactly like him. He keeps him­ <lb/>
            self in his park on the other side the Tiber, where he has <lb/>
            covered a vast extent of ground with his porticoes, and <lb/>
            crowded all the shore with his statues; for he unites pro­ <lb/>
            digality with excessive covetousness, and vain-glory with the <lb/>
            height of infamy. At this very unhealthy time of year he is <lb/>
            boring society, and he feels pleasure and consolation in being <lb/>
            a bore. He says he wishes to marry,-a piece of perversity, <lb/>
            like all his other conduct. You must expect, therefore, to <lb/>
            hear shortly of the marriage of this mourner, the marriage <lb/>
            of this old man; too early in the former case, in the latter, <lb/>
            too late. You ask me why I conjecture this? Certainly not <lb/>
            because he says so himself (for a greater liar never stepped), <lb/>
            but because there is no doubt that Regulus will do whatever <lb/>
            ought not to be done. Farewell. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Romans had an absolute power over their children, of which no <lb/>

          <p>I OFTEN tell you that there is a certain force of character <lb/>
            about Regulus: it is wonderful how he carries through what <lb/>
            he has set his mind to. He chose lately to be extremely <lb/>
            concerned for the loss of his son: accordingly he mourned <lb/>
            for him as never man mourned before. He took it into his <lb/>
            head to have an immense number of statues and pictures <lb/>
            of him; immediately all the artisans in Rome are set to <lb/>
            work. Canvas, wax, brass, silver, gold, ivory, marble, all ex­ <lb/>
            hibit the figure of the young Regulus. Not long ago he read, <lb/>
            before a numerous audience, a memoir of his son: a memoir <lb/>
            of a mere boy! However he read it. He wrote likewise a <lb/>
            sort of circular letter to the several Decurii desiring them to <lb/>
            choose out one of their order who had a strong clear voice, <lb/>
            to read this eulogy to the people; it has been actually done. <lb/>
            Now had this force of character or whatever else you may <lb/>
            call a fixed determination in obtaining whatever one has a <lb/>
            mind for, been rightly applied, what infinite good it might <lb/>
            have effected! The misfortune is, there is less of this <lb/>
            quality about good people than about bad people, and as ig­ <lb/>
            norance begets rashness, and thoughtfulness produces delib­ <lb/>
            eration, so modesty is apt to cripple the action of virtue, <lb/>
            whilst confidence strengthens vice. Regulus is a case in <lb/>
            point: he has a weak voice, an awkward delivery, an indis­ <lb/>
            tinct utterance, a slow imagination, and no memory; in a <lb/>
            word, he possesses nothing but a sort of frantic energy: and <lb/>
            yet, by the assistance of a flighty turn and much impu­ <lb/>
            dence, he passes as an orator. Herennius Senecio admirably <lb/>
            reversed Cato's definition of an orator, and applied it to <lb/>
            Regulus: " An orator," he said, " is a bad man, unskilled in <lb/>
            the art of speaking." And really Cato's definition Is not a <lb/>
            more exact description of a true orator than Senecio's is of <lb/>
            the character of this man. Would you make me a suitable <lb/>
            return for this letter? Let me know if you, or any of my <lb/>
            friends in your town, have, like a stroller in the market­ <lb/>
            place, read this doleful production of Regulus's, "raising," as <lb/>
            Demosthenes says, "your voice most merrily, and straining <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            every muscle in your throat." For so absurd a performance <lb/>
            must excite laughter rather than compassion; and indeed <lb/>
            the composition is as puerile as the subject. Farewell.</p>

          <p>My advancement to the dignity of augur1 is an honour <lb/>

            peculiar privilege annexed to it, that it is for life. Other <lb/>
            saeerdotal offices, though they may; perhaps, be almost equal <lb/>

            actually proved so in the event, I am willing to look upon <lb/>
            it as something more than mere accident. But the circum­ <lb/>
            stance, it seems, that most pleases you in this affair, is, that <lb/>

          <p>YOUR letter informs me that Sabina, who appointed you <lb/>
            and me her heirs, though she has nowhere expressly directed <lb/>
            that Modestus shall have his freedom, yet has left him a <lb/>
            legacy in the following words, "I give, &amp;c.—To Modestus, <lb/>
            whom I have ordered to have his freedom": upon which <lb/>
            you desire my opinion. I have consulted skilful lawyers <lb/>
            upon the point, and they all agree Modestus is not entitled <lb/>
            to his liberty, since it is not expressly given, and conse­ <lb/>
            quently that the legacy is void, as being bequeathed to a <lb/>

            Let Modestus then enjoy his freedom and his legacy as <lb/>

          <p>HAVE you heard—I suppose, not yet, for the news has <lb/>
            but just arrived-that Valerius Licinianus has become a pro­ <lb/>
            fessor in Sicily ? This unfortunate person, who lately enjoyed <lb/>
            the dignity of praetor, and was esteemed the most eloquent <lb/>
            of our advocates, is now fallen from a senator to an exile, <lb/>
            from an orator to a teacher of rhetoric. Accordingly in his <note type="footnote"> 1 A slave was incapable of property; and, therefore, whatever he acquired <lb/>
            became the right of his master. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            inaugural speech he uttered, sorrowfully and solemnly, the <lb/>
            following words: "Oh! Fortune, how capriciously dost thou <lb/>
            sport with mankind! Thou makest rhetoricians of senators, <lb/>
            and senators of rhetoricians!" A sarcasm so poignant and <lb/>
            full of gall that one might almost imagine he fixed upon <lb/>
            this profession merely for the sake of an opportunity of <lb/>
            applying it. And having made his first appearance in <lb/>
            school, clad in the Greek cloak (for exiles have no right to <lb/>
            wear the toga), after arranging himself and looking down <lb/>
            upon his attire, "I am, however," he said, "going to declaim <lb/>
            in Latin." You will think, perhaps, this situation, wretched <lb/>
            and deplorable as it is, is what he well deserves for having <lb/>
            stained the honourable profession of an orator with the <lb/>
            crime of incest. It is true, indeed, he pleaded guilty to the <lb/>
            charge; but whether from a consciousness of his guilt, or <lb/>
            from an apprehension of worse consequences if he denied it, <lb/>
            is not clear; for Domitian generally raged most furiously <lb/>
            where his evidence failed him most hopelessly. That em­ <lb/>
            peror had determined that Cornelia, chief of the Vestal <lb/>
            Virgins,1 should be buried alive, from an extravagant notion <lb/>
            that exemplary severities of this kind conferred lustre upon <lb/>
            his reign. Accordingly, by virtue of his office as supreme <lb/>
            pontiff, or, rather, in the exercise of a tyrant's cruelty, a <lb/>
            despot's lawlessness, he convened the sacred college, not in <lb/>
            the pontifical court where they usually assemble, but at his <lb/>
            villa near Alba; and there, with a guilt no less heinous than <lb/>
            that which he professed to be punishing, he condemned <lb/>
            her, when she was not present to defend herself, on the <lb/>
            charge of incest, while he himself bad been guilty, not only <lb/>
            of debauching his own brother's daughter, but was also ac- <note type="footnote"> 1" Their office was to attend upon the rites of Vesta, the chief part of <lb/>

            out, it was considered impiety to light it at any common name, but they <lb/>
            made use of the pure and unpolluted rays of the sun for that purpose. <lb/>
            There were various other duties besides connected with their office. The <lb/>
            chief rules prescribed them were, to vow the strictest chastity for the <lb/>
            space of thirty years. After this term was completed, they had liberty to <lb/>
            leave the order. If they broke their vow of virginity, they were buried <lb/>
            alive in a place allotted to that peculiar use." Kennet'sAntiq. Their <lb/>
            reputation for sanctity was so high that Livy mentions the fact of two of <lb/>

            destruction to the Roman state. Lib. xxii. c. 57. And Suetonius informs <lb/>

            to conceal her shame, endeavoured to procure an abortion, <lb/>
            and by that means lost her life. However, the priests were <lb/>
            directed to see the sentence immediately executed upon Cor­ <lb/>
            nelia. As they were leading her to the place of execution, <lb/>
            she called upon Vesta, and the rest of the gods, to attest <lb/>
            her innocence; and, amongst other exclamations, frequently <lb/>
            cried out, "Is it possible that Caesar can think me polluted, <lb/>
            under the influence of whose sacred functions he has con­ <lb/>
            quered and triumphed ?"2 Whether she said this in flattery <lb/>
            or derision; whether it proceeded from a consciousness of <lb/>
            her innocence, or contempt of the emperor, is uncertain; <lb/>
            but she continued exclaiming in this manner, till she came <lb/>
            to the place of execution, to which she was led, whether <lb/>
            innocent or guilty I cannot say, at all events with every <lb/>
            appearance and demonstration of innocence. As she was <lb/>
            being lowered down into the subterranean vault, her robe <lb/>
            happening to catch upon something in the descent, she <lb/>
            turned round and disengaged it, when, the executioner offer­ <lb/>
            ing his assistance, she drew herself back with horror, re­ <lb/>
            fusing to be so much as touched by him, as though it were a <lb/>
            defilement to her pure and unspotted chastity: still preserv­ <lb/>
            ing the appearance of sanctity up to the last moment; and, <lb/>
            among all the other instances of her modesty, <lb/>
            "She took great care to fall with decency.”2 <lb/>
            Celer likewise, a Roman knight, who was accused of an <lb/>
            intrigue with her, while they were scourging him with <lb/>
            rods4 in the Forum, persisted in exclaiming, "What have I <lb/>
            done?—I have done nothing." These declarations of inno­ <lb/>
            cence had exasperated Domitian exceedingly, as imputing <lb/>
            to him acts of cruelty and injustice, accordingly Licinianus <lb/>
            being seized by the emperor's orders for having concealed <lb/>
            a freedwoman of Cornelia's in one of his estates, was ad­ <lb/>
            vised, by those who took him in charge, to confess the <lb/>
            fact, if he hoped to obtain a remission of his punishment, <note type="footnote"> 2 It was usual with Domitian to triumph, not only without a victory, <lb/>
            but even after a defeat. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Euripides' Hecuba. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The punishment inflicted upon the violators of Vestal chastity was to <lb/>

             <pb n="267"/>
            and he complied with their advice. Herennius Senecio <lb/>
            spoke for him in his absence, in some such words as Homer's <lb/>
            "Patroclus lies in death." <lb/>
            "Instead of advocate," said he, "I must turn informer; <lb/>
            Licinianus has fled." This news was so agreeable to <lb/>
            Domitian that he could not help betraying his satisfaction: <lb/>
            "Then," he exclaimed, "has Licinianus acquitted us of injus­ <lb/>
            tice;" adding that he would not press too hard upon him in <lb/>
            his disgrace. He accordingly allowed him to carry off such <lb/>
            of his effects as he could secure before they were seized <lb/>
            for the public use, and in other respects softened the sen­ <lb/>
            tence of banishment by way of reward for his voluntary <lb/>
            confession. Licinianus was afterwards, through the clem­ <lb/>
            ency of the emperor Nerva, permitted to settle in Sicily, <lb/>
            where he now professes rhetoric, and avenges himself upon <lb/>

            but your own, and that of the republic as well; for litera­ <lb/>

            circumstance to add further, that a young nobleman, having <lb/>
            had his tunic torn, an ordinary occurrence in a crowd, stood <lb/>
            with his gown thrown over him, to hear me, and that during <lb/>
            the seven hours I was speaking, whilst my success more than <lb/>
            counterbalanced the fatigue of so long a speech. So let us <lb/>
            set to and not screen our own indolence under pretence of <lb/>
            that of the public. Never, be very sure of that, will there be <lb/>

          <p>You advise me, nay you entreat me, to undertake, in her <lb/>
            absence, the cause of Corellia, against C. Caecilius, consul <lb/>
            elect. For your advice I am grateful, of your entreaty I <lb/>
            really must complain; without the first, indeed, I should have <lb/>
            been ignorant of this affair, but the last was unnecessary, as <lb/>
            I need no solicitations to comply, where it would be ungen­ <lb/>
            erous in me to refuse; for can I hesitate a moment to take <lb/>
            upon myself the protection of a daughter of Corellius? It <lb/>
            is true, indeed, though there is no particular intimacy be­ <lb/>
            tween her adversary and myself, still we are upon good <lb/>
            enough terms. It is also true that he is a person of rank, <lb/>
            and one who has a high claim upon my especial regard, as <lb/>
            destined to enter upon an office which I have had the honour <lb/>
            to fill; and it is natural for a man to be desirous those <lb/>
            dignities should be held in the highest esteem which he him­ <lb/>
            self once possessed. Yet all these considerations appear in­ <lb/>
            different and trifling when I reflect that it is the daughter of <lb/>
            Corellius whom I am to defend. The memory of that excel­ <lb/>
            lent person, than whom this age has not produced a man of <lb/>
            greater dignity, rectitude, and acuteness, is indelibly imprinted <lb/>
            upon my mind. My regard for him sprang from my admira­ <lb/>
            tion of the man, and contrary to what is usually the case, <lb/>
            my admiration increased upon a thorough knowledge of him, <lb/>
            and indeed I did know him thoroughly, for he kept nothing <lb/>
            back from me, whether gay or serious, sad or joyous. When he <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            was but a youth, he esteemed, and (I will even venture to <lb/>
            say) revered, me as if I had been his equal. When I solicited <lb/>
            any post of honour, he supported me with his interest, and <lb/>
            recommended me with his testimony; when I entered upon <lb/>
            it, he was my introducer and my companion; when I exer­ <lb/>
            cised it, he was my guide and my counsellor. In a word, <lb/>
            whenever my interest was concerned, he exerted himself, in <lb/>
            spite of his weakness and declining years, with as much <lb/>
            alacrity as though he were still young and lusty. In private, <lb/>
            in public, and at court, how often has he advanced and sup­ <lb/>
            ported my credit and interest! It happened once that the <lb/>
            conversation, in the presence of the emperor Nerva, turned <lb/>
            upon the promising young men of that time, and several of <lb/>
            the company present were pleased to mention me with ap­ <lb/>
            plause; he sat for a little while silent, which gave what he <lb/>
            said the greater weight; and then, with that air of dignity, <lb/>
            to which you are no stranger, "I must be reserved," said he, <lb/>
            "in my praises of Pliny, because he does nothing without <lb/>
            advice." By which single sentence he bestowed upon me <lb/>
            more than my most extravagant wishes could aspire to, as <lb/>
            he represented my conduct to be always such as wisdom must <lb/>
            approve, since it was wholly under the direction of one of <lb/>
            the wisest of men. Even in his last moments he said to his <lb/>
            daughter (as she often mentions), "I have in the course of <lb/>
            a long life raised up many friends to you, but there are none <lb/>
            in whom you may more assuredly confide than Pliny and <lb/>
            Cornutus." A circumstance I cannot reflect upon without <lb/>
            being deeply sensible how incumbent it is upon me to en­ <lb/>
            deavour not to disappoint the confidence so excellent a judge <lb/>
            of human nature reposed in me. I shall therefore most <lb/>
            readily give my assistance to Corellia in this affair, and will­ <lb/>
            ingly risk any displeasure I may incur by appearing in her <lb/>
            behalf. Though I should imagine, if in the course of my <lb/>
            pleadings I should find an opportunity to explain and enforce <lb/>
            more fully and at large than the limits of a letter allow of <lb/>
            the reasons I have here mentioned, upon which I rest at once <lb/>
            my apology and my glory; her adversary (whose suit may <lb/>
            perhaps, as you say, be entirely without precedent, as it is <lb/>
            against a woman) will not only excuse, but approve, my con­ <lb/>

          <p>As you are a model of all virtue, and loved your late <lb/>
            excellent brother, who had such a fondness for you, with <lb/>
            an affection equal to his own; regarding too his daughter <lb/>
            as your child, not only shewing her an aunt's tenderness <lb/>
            but supplying the place of the parent she had lost; I know <lb/>
            it will give you the greatest pleasure and joy to hear that <lb/>
            she proves worthy of her father, her grandfather, and your­ <lb/>
            self. She possesses an excellent understanding together with <lb/>
            a consummate prudence, and gives the strongest evidence of <lb/>
            the purity of her heart by her fondness of her husband. Her <lb/>
            affection for me, moreover, has given her a taste for books, <lb/>
            and my productions, which she takes a pleasure in reading, <lb/>
            and even in getting by heart, are continually in her hands. <lb/>
            How full of tender anxiety is she when I am going to speak <lb/>
            in any case, how rejoiced she feels when it is got through. <lb/>
            While I aID pleading, she stations persons to inform her <lb/>
            from time to time how I am heard, what applauses I receive, <lb/>
            and what success attends the case. When I recite my works <lb/>
            at any time, she conceals herself behind some curtain, and <lb/>
            drinks in my praises with greedy ears. She sings my verses <lb/>
            too, adapting them to her lyre, with no other master but love, <lb/>
            that best of instructors, for her guide. From these happy <lb/>
            circumstances I derive my surest hopes, that the harmony <lb/>
            between us will increase with our days, and be as lasting as <lb/>
            our lives. For it is not my youth or person, which time <lb/>
            gradually impairs; it is my honour and glory that she cares <lb/>
            for. But what less could be expected from one who was <lb/>
            trained by your hands, and formed by your instructions; who <lb/>
            was early familiarized under your roof with all that is pure <lb/>
            and virtuous, and who learnt to love me first through your <lb/>
            praises? And as you revered my mother with all the respect <lb/>
            due even to a parent, so you kindly directed and encouraged <lb/>
            my tender years, presaging from that early period all that <lb/>
            my wife now fondly imagines I really am. Accept therefore <lb/>
            of our mutual thanks, mine, for your giving me her, hers for <note type="footnote"> 1 Calpurnia, Pliny's wife. </note> <lb/>

          <p>I HAVE brought you as a little present out of the country <lb/>
            a query which well deserves the consideration of your ex­ <lb/>
            tensive knowledge. There is a spring which rises in a <lb/>
            neighbouring mountain, and running among the rocks is <lb/>
            received into a little banqueting-room, artificially formed <lb/>
            for that purpose, from whence, after being detained a short <lb/>
            time, it falls into the Larian lake. The nature of this spring <lb/>
            is extremely curious; it ebbs and flows regularly three times <lb/>
            a day. The increase and decrease is plainly visible, and <lb/>
            exceedingly interesting to observe. You sit down by the <lb/>
            side of the fountain, and while you are taking a repast and <lb/>
            drinking its water, which is extremely cool, you see it <lb/>
            gradually rise and fall. If you place a ring, or anything else <lb/>
            at the bottom, when it is dry, the water creeps gradually <lb/>
            up, first gently washing, finally covering it entirely, and then <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            little by little subsides again. If you wait long enough, you <lb/>
            may see it thus alternately advance and recede three suc­ <lb/>
            cessive times. Shall we say that some secret current of air <lb/>
            stops and opens the fountain-head, first rushing in and check­ <lb/>
            ing the flow and then, driven back by the counter-resistance <lb/>
            of the water, escaping again; as we see in bottles, and other <lb/>
            vessels of that nature, where, there not being a free and open <lb/>
            passage, though you turn their necks perpendicularly or <lb/>
            obliquely downwards, yet, the outward air obstructing the <lb/>
            vent, they discharge their contents as it were by starts? Or, <lb/>
            may not this small collection of water be successively con­ <lb/>
            tracted and enlarged upon the same principle as the ebb and <lb/>
            flow of the sea? Or, again, as those rivers which discharge <lb/>
            themselves into the sea, meeting with contrary winds and <lb/>
            the swell of the ocean, are forced back in their channels, <lb/>
            so, in the same way, may there not be something that checks <lb/>
            this fountain, for a time, in its progress? Or is there rather <lb/>
            a certain reservoir that contains these waters in the bowels <lb/>
            of the earth, and while it is recruiting its discharges, the <lb/>
            stream in consequence flows more slowly and in less quantity, <lb/>
            but, when it has collected its due measure, runs on again in <lb/>
            its usual strength and fulness? Or lastly, is there I know <lb/>
            not what kind of subterranean counterpoise, that throws up <lb/>
            the water when the fountain is dry, and keeps it back when <lb/>
            it is full? You, who are so well qualified for the enquiry, <lb/>
            will examine into the causes of this wonderful phenomenon; <lb/>
            it will be sufficient for me if I have given you an adequate <lb/>
            description of it. Farewell.</p>

          <p>A SMALL legacy was lately left me, yet one more accept­ <lb/>

            more acceptable than a far larger one? In this way. <lb/>
            Pomponia Gratilla, having disinherited her son Assidius <lb/>
            Curianus, appointed me of one of her heirs, and Sertorius <lb/>
            Severus, of praetorian rank, together with several eminent <lb/>
            Roman knights, co-heirs along with me. The son applied <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            to me to give him my share of the inheritance, in order to <lb/>
            use my name as an example to the rest of the joint-hetrs, <lb/>
            but offered at the same time to enter into a secret agree­ <lb/>
            ment to return me my proportion. I told him, it was by <lb/>
            no means agreeable to my character to seem to act one way <lb/>
            while in reality I was acting another, besides it was not <lb/>
            quite honourable making presents to a man of his fortune, <lb/>
            who had no children; in a word, this would not at <lb/>
            all answer the purpose at which he was aiming, whereas, <lb/>
            if I were to withdraw my claim, it might be of some <lb/>
            service to him, and this I was ready and willing to do, <lb/>
            if he could clearly prove to me that he was unjustly <lb/>
            disinherited.</p>
          <p>"Do then," he said, "be my arbitrator in this case." After <lb/>
            a short pause I answered him, "I will, for I don't see why <lb/>
            I should not have as good an opinion of my own impartial <lb/>
            disinterestedness as you seem to have. But, mind, I am <lb/>
            not to be prevailed upon to decide the point in question <lb/>
            against your mother, if it should appear she had just <lb/>
            reason for what she has done." "As you please," he replied, <lb/>
            "which I am sure is always to act according to justice." I <lb/>
            called in, as my assistants, Corellius and Frontinus, two of <lb/>
            the very best lawyers Rome at that time afforded. With <lb/>
            these in attendance, I heard the case in my own chamber. <lb/>
            Curianus said everything which he thought would favour <lb/>
            his pretensions, to whom (there being nobody but myself <lb/>
            to defend the character of the deceased) I made a short <lb/>
            reply; after which I retired with my friends to deliberate, <lb/>
            and, being agreed upon our verdict, I said to him, "Curi­ <lb/>
            anus. it is our opinion that your conduct has justly drawn <lb/>
            upon you your mother's displeasure." Sometime afterwards, <lb/>
            Curianus commenced a suit in the Court of the Hundred <lb/>
            against aN the co-heirs except myself. The day appointed <lb/>
            for the trial approaching, the rest of the co-heirs were <lb/>
            anxious to compromise the affair and have done with it, <lb/>
            not out of any diffidence of their cause, but from a distrust <lb/>
            of the times. They were apprehensive of what had hap­ <lb/>
            pened to many others, happening to them, and that from a <lb/>
            civil suit it might end in a criminal one, as there were <lb/>
            some among them to whom the friendship of Gratilla and <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            Rusticus might be extremely prejudicial: they therefore <lb/>
            desired me to go and talk with Curianus. We met in the <lb/>
            temple of Concord; "Now supposing," I said, "your mother <lb/>
            had left you the fourth part of her estate, or even suppose <lb/>
            she had made you sole heir, but had exhausted so much of <lb/>
            the estate in legacies that there would not be more than <lb/>
            fourth part remaining to you, could you justly complain? <lb/>
            You ought to be content, therefore, if, being absolutely <lb/>
            disinherited as you are, the heirs are willing to relinquish <lb/>
            to you a fourth part, which however I will increase by <lb/>
            contributing my proportion. You know you did not com­ <lb/>
            mence any suit against me, and two years have now elapsed, <lb/>
            which gives me legal and indisputable possession. But to <lb/>
            induce you to agree to the proposals on the part of the <lb/>
            other co-heirs, and that you may be no sufferer by the <lb/>
            peculiar respect you shew me, I offer to advance my pro­ <lb/>
            portion with them." The silent approval of my own con­ <lb/>
            science is not the only result out of this transaction; it <lb/>
            has contributed also to the honour of my character. For <lb/>
            it is this same Curianus who has left me the legacy I have <lb/>
            mentioned in the beginning of my letter, and I received it as <lb/>
            a very notable mark of his approbation of my conduct, if I <lb/>
            do not flatter myself. I have written and told you all this, <lb/>
            because in all my joys and sorrows I am wont to look <lb/>
            upon you as myself, and I thought it would be unkind not <lb/>
            to communicate to so tender a friend whatever occasions <lb/>
            me a sensible gratification; for I am not philosopher enough <lb/>
            to be indifferent, when I think I have acted like an honour­ <lb/>
            able man, whether my actions meet with that approval which <lb/>

            did not disapprove of my poems in themselves, but at the <lb/>
            same time censured me in a free and friendly way, for <lb/>
            employing myself in composing and reciting them. I am <lb/>
            so far, however, from desiring to extenuate the charge that <lb/>
            I willingly acknowledge myself still more deserving of it, <lb/>
            and confess that I sometimes amuse myself with writing <lb/>
            verses of the gayer sort. I compose comedies, divert my­ <lb/>
            self with pantomimes, read the lyric poets, and enter into <lb/>
            the spirit of the most wanton muse, besides that, I indulge <lb/>
            myself sometimes in laughter, mirth, and frolic, and, to sum <lb/>
            up every kind of innocent relaxation in one word, I am a <lb/>
            man. I am not in the least offended, though, at their low <lb/>
            opinion of my morals, and that those who are ignorant of <lb/>
            the fact that the most learned, the wisest, and the best of <lb/>
            men have employed themselves in the same way, should be <lb/>
            surprised at the tone of my writings: but from those who <lb/>
            know what noble and numerous examples I follow, I shall, <lb/>
            I am confident, easily obtain permission to err with those <lb/>
            whom it is an honour to imitate, not only in their most <lb/>
            serious occupations but their lightest triflings. Is it unbe­ <lb/>
            coming me (I will not name any living example, lest I <lb/>
            should seem to flatter), but is it unbecoming me to practise <lb/>
            what became Tully, Calvus, Pollio, Messala, Hortensius, <lb/>
            Brutus, Sulla, Catulus, Scaevola, Sulpitius, Varro, the Tor­ <lb/>
            quati, Memmius, Gaetulicus, Seneca, Lucceius, and, within <lb/>
            our own memory, Verginius Rufus? But if the examples <lb/>
            of private men are not sufficient to justify me, I can cite <lb/>
            Julius Caesar, Augustus, Nerva, and Tiberius Caesar. I for­ <lb/>
            bear to add Nero to the catalogue, though I am aware that <lb/>
            what is practised by the worst of men does not therefore <lb/>
            degenerate into wrong: on the contrary, it still maintains <lb/>
            its credit, if frequently countenanced by the best. In that <lb/>
            number, Virgil, Cornelius Nepos, and prior to these, Ennius <lb/>
            and Attius, justly deserve the most distinguished place. <lb/>
            These last indeed were not senators, but goodness knows no <lb/>
            distinction of rank or title. I recite my works, it is true, <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            and in this instance I am not sure I can support myself by <lb/>
            their examples. They, perhaps, might be satisfied with their <lb/>
            own judgment, but I have too humble an opinion of mine <lb/>
            to suppose my compositions perfect, because they appear so <lb/>
            to my own mind. My reason then for reciting are, that, <lb/>
            for one thing, there is a certain deference for one's au­ <lb/>
            dience, which excites a somewhat more vigorous applica­ <lb/>
            tion, and then again, I have by this means an opportunity of <lb/>
            settling any doubts I may have concerning my performance, <lb/>
            by observing the general opinion of the audience. In a. <lb/>
            word, I have the advantage of receiving different hints <lb/>
            from different persons: and although they should not declare <lb/>
            their meaning in express terms, yet the expression of the <lb/>
            countenance, the movement of the head, the eyes, the motion <lb/>
            of a hand, a whisper, or even silence itself will easily dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish their real opinion from the language of politeness. <lb/>
            And so if any one of my audience should have the curiosity <lb/>
            to read over the same performance which he heard me read, <lb/>
            he may find several things altered or omitted, and perhaps <lb/>
            too upon his particular judgment, though he did not say a <lb/>
            single word to me. But I am not defending my conduct in <lb/>
            this particular, as if I had actually recited my works in <lb/>
            public, and not in my own house before my friends, a num­ <lb/>
            erous appearance of whom has upon many occasions been <lb/>
            held an honour, but never, surely, a reproach. Farewell.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>I AM deeply afflicted with the news I have received of the <lb/>
            death of Fannius; in the first place, because I loved one so <lb/>
            eloquent and refined, in the next, because I was accustomed <lb/>
            to be guided by his judgment-and indeed he possessed <lb/>
            great natural acuteness, improved by practice, rendering him <lb/>
            able to see a thing in an instant. There are some circum­ <lb/>
            stances about his death, which aggravate my concern. He <lb/>
            left behind him a will which had been made a considerable <lb/>
            time before his decease, by which it happens that his <lb/>
            estate is fallen into the hands of those who had incurred <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            his displeasure, whilst his greatest favourites are excluded. <lb/>
            But what I particularly regret is, that he has left unfinished <lb/>
            a very noble work in which he was employed. Notwith­ <lb/>
            standing his full practice at the bar, he had begun a history <lb/>
            of those persons who were put to death or banished by <lb/>
            Nero, and completed three books of it. They are written <lb/>
            with great elegance and precision, the style is pure, and <lb/>
            preserves a proper medium between the plain narrative and <lb/>
            the historical: and as they were very favourably received <lb/>
            by the public, he was the more desirous of being able to <lb/>
            finish the rest. The hand of death is ever, in my opinion, <lb/>
            too untimely and sudden when it falls upon such as are <lb/>
            employed in some immortal work. The sons of sensuality, <lb/>
            who have no outlook beyond the present hour, put an end <lb/>
            every day to all motives for living, but those who look for­ <lb/>
            ward to posterity, and endeavour to transmit their names <lb/>
            with honour to future generations by their works-to such, <lb/>
            death is always immature, as it still snatches them from <lb/>
            amidst some unfinished design. Fannius, long before his <lb/>
            death, had a presentiment of what has happened: he dreamed <lb/>
            one night that as he was lying on his couch, in an undress, <lb/>
            all ready for his work, and with his desk,1 as usual, in front <lb/>
            of him, Nero entered, and placing himself by his side, took <lb/>
            up the three first books of this history, which he read through <lb/>
            and then departed. This dream greatly alarmed him, and <lb/>
            he regarded it as an intimation, that he should not carry <lb/>
            on his history any farther than Nero had read, and so the <lb/>
            event has proved. I cannot reflect upon this accident with­ <lb/>
            out lamenting that he was prevented from accomplishing a <lb/>
            work which had cost him so many toilsome vigils, as it <lb/>
            suggests to me, at the same time, reflections on my own <lb/>
            mortality, and the fate of my writings: and I am persuaded <lb/>
            the same apprehensions alarm you for those in which you are <lb/>
            at present employed. Let us then, my friend, while life <lb/>
            permits, exert all our endeavours, that death, whenever it <lb/>
            arrives, may find as little as possible to destroy. Farewell. <note type="footnote"> 1 In the original, scrinium, a box for holding MSS. </note> <pb n="278"/>

          <p>THE kind concern you expressed on hearing of my design <lb/>
            to pass the summer at my villa in Tuscany, and your oblig­ <lb/>
            ing endeavours to dissuade me from going to a place which <lb/>
            you think unhealthy, are extremely pleasing to me. It is <lb/>
            quite true indeed that the air of that part of Tuscany which <lb/>
            lies towards the coast is thick and unwholesome; but ray <lb/>
            house stands at a good distance from the sea, under one of <lb/>
            the Apennines which are singularly healthy. But, to re­ <lb/>
            lieve you from all anxiety on my account, I will give you <lb/>
            a description of the temperature of the climate, the situation <lb/>
            of the country, and the beauty of my villa, which, I am <lb/>
            persuaded, you will hear with as much pleasure as I shall <lb/>
            take in giving it. The air in winter is sharp and frosty, so <lb/>
            that myrtles, olives, and trees of that kind which delight in <lb/>
            constant warmth, will not flourish here: but the laurel <lb/>
            thrives, and is remarkably beautiful, though now and then <lb/>
            the cold kills it-though not oftener than it does in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of Rome. The summers are extraordinarily <lb/>
            mild, and there is always a refreshing breeze, seldom high <lb/>
            winds. This accounts for the number of old men we have <lb/>
            about, you would see grandfathers and great-grandfathers of <lb/>
            those now grown up to be young men, hear old stories and <lb/>
            the dialect of our ancestors, and fancy yourself born in some <lb/>
            former age were you to come here. The character of the <lb/>
            country is exceedingly beautiful. Picture to yourself an <lb/>
            immense amphitheatre, such as nature only could create. <lb/>
            Before you lies a broad, extended plain bounded by a range <lb/>
            of mountains, whose summits are covered with tall and <lb/>
            ancient woods, which are stocked with all kinds of game. <lb/>
            The descending slopes of the mountains are planted with <lb/>
            underwood, among which are a number of little risings with <lb/>
            a rich soil, on which hardly a stone is to be found. In fruit- <lb/>
            fulness they are quite equal to a valley, and though their <lb/>
            harvest is rather later, their crops are just as good. At the <lb/>
            foot of these, on the mountain-side, the eye, wherever it <lb/>
            turns, runs along one unbroken stretch of vineyards ter­ <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            initiated by a belt of shrubs. Next you have meadows and <lb/>
            the open plain. The arable land is so stiff that it is necesr <lb/>
            sary to go over it nine times with the biggest oxen and the <lb/>
            strongest ploughs. The meadows are bright with flowers, <lb/>
            and produce trefoil and other kinds of herbage as fine and <lb/>
            tender as if it were but just sprung up, for all the soil is <lb/>
            refreshed by never failing streams. But though there is <lb/>
            plenty of water, there are no marshes; for the ground be­ <lb/>
            ing on a slope, whatever water it receives without absorbing <lb/>
            runs off into the Tiber. This river, which winds through <lb/>
            the middle of the meadows, is navigable only in the winter <lb/>
            and spring, at which seasons it transports the produce of <lb/>
            the lands to Rome: but in summer it sinks below its banks, <lb/>
            leaving the name of a great river to an almost empty channel: <lb/>
            towards the autumn, however, it begins again to renew its <lb/>
            claim to that title. You would be charmed by taking a view <lb/>
            of this country from the top of one of our neighbouring <lb/>
            mountains, and would fancy that not a real, but some im­ <lb/>
            aginary landscape, painted by the most exquisite pencil, <lb/>
            lay before you, such an harmonious variety of beautiful ob­ <lb/>
            jects meets the eye, whichever way it turns. My house, <lb/>
            although at the foot of a hill, commands as good a view <lb/>
            as if it stood on its brow, yet you approach by so gentle and <lb/>
            gradual a rise that you find yourself on high ground without <lb/>
            perceiving you have been making an ascent. Behind, but <lb/>
            at a great distance, is the Apennine range. In the calmest <lb/>
            days we get cool breezes from that quarter, not sharp and <lb/>
            cutting at all, being spent and broken by the long distance <lb/>
            they have travelled. The greater part of the house has a <lb/>
            southern aspect, and seems to invite the afternoon sun in <lb/>
            summer (but rather earlier in the winter) into a broad <lb/>
            and proportionately long portico, consisting of several rooms, <lb/>
            particularly a court of antique fashion. In front of the <lb/>
            portico is a sort of terrace, edged with box and shrubs <lb/>
            cut into different shapes. You descend, from the terrace, <lb/>
            by an easy slope adorned with the figures of animals in box, <lb/>
            facing each other, to a lawn overspread with the soft, I <lb/>
            had almost said the liquid, Acanthus: this is surrounded by <lb/>
            a walk enclosed with evergreens, shaped into a variety of <lb/>
            forms. Beyond it is the gestatio, laid out in the form of a <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            circus running round the multiform box-hedge and the <lb/>
            dwarf-trees, which are cut quite close. The whole is fenced <lb/>
            in with a wall completely covered by box cut into steps <lb/>
            all the way up to the top. On the outside of the wall lies <lb/>
            a meadow that owes as many beauties to nature as all I <lb/>
            have been describing within does to art; at the end of which <lb/>
            are open plain and numerous other meadows and copses. <lb/>
            From the extremity of the portico a large dining-room runs <lb/>
            out, opening upon one end of the terrace, while from the <lb/>
            windows there is a very extensive view over the meadows <lb/>
            up into the country, and from these you also see the terrace <lb/>
            and the projecting wing of the house together with the woods <lb/>
            enclosing the adjacent hippodrome. Almost opposite the <lb/>
            centre of the portico, and rather to the back, stands a sum­ <lb/>
            mer-house, enclosing a small area shaded by four plane-trees, <lb/>
            in the midst of which rises a marble fountain which gently <lb/>
            plays upon the roots of the plane-trees and upon the grass- <lb/>
            plots underneath them. This summer-house has a bed-room in <lb/>
            it free from every sort of noise, and which the light itself can­ <lb/>
            not penetrate, together with a common dining-room I use <lb/>
            when I have none but intimate friends with me. A second <lb/>
            portico looks upon this little area, and has the same view as <lb/>
            the other I have just been describing. There is, besides, <lb/>
            another room, which, being situate close to the nearest <lb/>
            plane-tree, enjoys a constant shade and green. Its sides are <lb/>
            encrusted with carved marble up to the ceiling, while above <lb/>
            the marble a foliage is painted with birds among the branches, <lb/>
            which has an effect altogether as agreeable as that of the <lb/>
            carving, at the foot of which a little fountain, playing <lb/>
            through several small pipes into a vase it encloses, produces <lb/>
            a most pleasing murmur. From a corner of the portico <lb/>
            you enter a very large bed-chamber opposite the large dining- <lb/>
            room, which from some of its windows has a view of the <lb/>
            terrace, and from others, of the meadow, as those in the front <lb/>
            look upon a cascade, which entertains at once both the <lb/>
            eye and the ear; for the water, dashing from a great height, <lb/>
            foams over the marble basin which receives it below. <lb/>
            This room is extremely warm in winter, lying much ex­ <lb/>
            posed to the sun, and on a cloudy day the heat of an ad­ <lb/>
            joining stove very well supplies his absence. Leaving this <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            room, you pass through a good-sized, pleasant, undressing- <lb/>
            room into the cold-bath-room, in which is a large gloomy <lb/>
            bath: but if you are inclined to swim more at large, or in <lb/>
            warmer water, in the middle of the area stands a wide basin <lb/>
            for that purpose, and near it a reservoir from which you may <lb/>
            be supplied with cold water to brace yourself again, if you <lb/>
            should find you are too much relaxed by the warm. Adjoin­ <lb/>
            ing the cold bath is one of a medium degree of heat, which <lb/>
            enjoys the kindly warmth of the sun, but not so intensely <lb/>
            as the hot bath, which projects farther. This last consists of <lb/>
            three several compartments, each of different degrees of <lb/>
            heat; the two former lie open to the full sun, the latter, <lb/>
            though not much exposed to its heat, receives an equal <lb/>
            share of its light. Over the undressing-room is built the <lb/>
            tennis-court, which admits of different kinds of games <lb/>
            and different sets of players. Not far from the baths is the <lb/>
            staircase leading to the enclosed portico, three rooms inter­ <lb/>
            vening. One of these looks out upon the little area with <lb/>
            the four plane-trees round it, the other upon the meadows, <lb/>
            and from the third you have a view of several vineyards, so <lb/>
            that each has a different one, and looks towards a different <lb/>
            point of the heavens. At the upper end of the enclosed <lb/>
            portico, and indeed taken off from it, is a room that looks <lb/>
            out upon the hippodrome, the vineyards, and the mountains; <lb/>
            adjoining is a room which has a full exposure to the sun, <lb/>
            especially in winter, and out of which runs another con­ <lb/>
            necting the hippodrome with the house. This forms the <lb/>
            front. On the side rises an enclosed portico, which not <lb/>
            only looks out upon the vineyards, but seems almost to <lb/>
            touch them. From the middle of this portico you enter a <lb/>
            dining-room cooled by the wholesome breezes from the <lb/>
            Apennine valleys: from the windows behind, which are ex­ <lb/>
            tremely large, there is a close view of the vineyards, and <lb/>
            from the folding doors through the summer portico. Along <lb/>
            that side of the dining-room where there are no windows <lb/>
            runs a private staircase for greater convenience in serving <lb/>
            up when I give an entertainment; at the farther end is a <lb/>
            sleeping-room with a look-out upon the vineyards, and (what <lb/>
            is equally agreeable) the portico. Underneath this room is <lb/>
            an enclosed portico resembling a grotto, which, enjoying in <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            the midst of summer heats its own natural coolness, neither <lb/>
            admits nor wants external air. After you have passed both <lb/>
            these porticoes, at the end of the dining-room stands a <lb/>
            third, which according as the day is more or less advanced, <lb/>
            serves either for winter or summer use. It leads to two <lb/>
            different apartments, one containing four chambers, the <lb/>
            other, three, which enjoy by turns both sun and shade. This <lb/>
            arrangement of the different parts of my house is exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly pleasant, though it is not to be compared with the <lb/>
            beauty of the hippodrome,1 lying entirely open in the middle <lb/>
            of the grounds, so that the eye, upon your first entrance, <lb/>
            takes it in entire in one view. It is set round with plane- <lb/>
            trees covered with ivy, so that, while their tops flourish with <lb/>
            their own green, towards the roots their verdure is borrowed <lb/>
            from the ivy that twines round the trunk and branches, <lb/>
            spreads from tree to tree, and connects them together. Be­ <lb/>
            tween each plane-tree are planted box-trees, and behind <lb/>
            these stands a grove of laurels which blend their shade with <lb/>
            that of the planes. This straight boundary to the hippo­ <lb/>
            drome alters its shape at the farther end, bending into a <lb/>
            semicircle, which is planted round, shut in with cypresses, <lb/>
            and casts a deeper and gloomier shade, while the inner cir­ <lb/>
            cular walks (for there are several), enjoying an open <lb/>
            exposure, are filled with plenty of roses, and correct, by a <lb/>
            very pleasant contrast, the coolness of the shade with the <lb/>
            warmth of the sun. Having passed through these several <lb/>
            winding alleys, you enter a straight walk, which breaks out <lb/>
            into a variety of others, partitioned off by box-row hedges. <lb/>
            In one place you have a little meadow, in another the box is <lb/>
            cut in a thousand different forms, sometimes into letters, <lb/>
            expressing the master's name, sometimes the artificer's, <lb/>
            whilst here and there rise little obelisks with fruit-trees alter­ <lb/>
            nately intermixed, and then on a sudden, in the midst of <lb/>
            this elegant regularity, you are surprised with an Imitation <lb/>
            of the negligent beauties of rural nature. In the centre of <lb/>
            this lies a spot adorned with a knot of dwarf plane-trees. <note type="footnote"> 1 The hippodromus, in its proper signification, was a place, among the <lb/>
            Grecians, set apart for horse-racing and other exercises or that kind. But <lb/>
            it seems here to be nothing more than a particular walk, to which Pliny <lb/>
            perhaps gave that name, from its bearing some resemblance in its form to <lb/>
            the public places so called. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            Beyond these stands art acacia, smooth and bending in <lb/>
            places, then again various other shapes and names. At the <lb/>
            upper end is an alcove of white marble, shaded with vines <lb/>
            and supported by four small Carystian columns. From this <lb/>
            semicircular couch, the water, gushing up through several <lb/>
            little pipes, as though pressed out by the weight of the <lb/>
            persons who recline themselves upon it, falls into a stone <lb/>
            cistern underneath, from whence it is received into a fine <lb/>
            polished marble basin, so skilfully contrived that it is al­ <lb/>
            ways full without ever Overflowing. When I sup here, <lb/>
            this basin serves as a table, the larger sort of dishes being <lb/>
            placed round the margin, while the smaller ones swim about <lb/>
            in the form of vessels and water-fowl. Opposite this is a <lb/>
            fountain which is incessantly emptying and filling, for the <lb/>
            water which it throws up to a great height, falling back again <lb/>
            into it, is by means of consecutive apertures returned as fast <lb/>
            as it is received. Facing the alcove (and reflecting upon <lb/>
            it as great an ornament as it borrows from it) stands a <lb/>
            summer-house of exquisite marble, the doors of which pro­ <lb/>
            ject and open into a green enclosure, while from its upper <lb/>
            and lower windows the eye falls upon a variety of different <lb/>
            greens. Next to this is a little private closet (which, <lb/>
            though it seems distinct, may form part of the same room), <lb/>
            furnished with a couch, and notwithstanding it has windows <lb/>
            on every side, yet it enjoys a very agreeable gloom, by <lb/>
            means of a spreading vine which climbs to the top, and <lb/>
            entirely overshadows it. Here you may lie and fancy your­ <lb/>
            self in a wood, with this only difference, that you are not <lb/>
            exposed to the weather as you would be there. Here too <lb/>
            a fountain rises and instantly disappears-several marble <lb/>
            seats are set in different places, which are as pleasant as the <lb/>
            summer-house itself after one is tired out with walking. <lb/>
            Near each is a little fountain, and throughout the whole <lb/>
            hippodrome several small rills run murmuring along through <lb/>
            pipes, wherever the hand of art has thought proper to con­ <lb/>
            duct them, watering here and there different plots of green, <lb/>
            and sometimes all parts at once. I should have ended before <lb/>
            now, for fear of being too chatty, had I not proposed in this <lb/>
            letter to lead you into every corner of my house and gardens. <lb/>
            Nor did I apprehend your thinking it a trouble to read the <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            description of a place which I feel sure would please you <lb/>
            were you to see it; especially as you can stop just when <lb/>
            you please, and by throwing aside my letter, sit down as it <lb/>
            were, and give yourself a rest as often as you think proper. <lb/>
            Besides, I gave my little passion indulgence, for I have <lb/>
            a passion for what I have built, or finished, myself. In a <lb/>
            word, (for why should I conceal from my friend either my <lb/>
            deliberate opinion or my prejudice?) I look upon it as the <lb/>
            first duty of every writer to frequently glance over his <lb/>
            title-page and consider well the subject he has proposed to <lb/>
            himself; and he may be sure, if he dwells on his subject, he <lb/>
            cannot justly be thought tedious, whereas if, on the contrary, <lb/>
            he introduces and drags in anything irrelevant, he will be <lb/>
            thought exceedingly so. Homer, you know, has employed <lb/>
            many verses in the description of the arms of Achilles, as <lb/>
            Virgil has also in those of Aeneas, yet neither of them <lb/>
            is prolix, because they each keep within the limits of their <lb/>
            original design. Aratus, you observe, is not considered too <lb/>
            circumstantial, though he traces and enumerates the minutest <lb/>
            stars, for he does not go out of his way for that purpose, but <lb/>
            only follows where his subject leads him. In the same way <lb/>
            (to compare small things with great), so long as, in endeav­ <lb/>
            ouring to give you an idea of my house, I have not intro­ <lb/>
            duced anything irrelevant or superfluous, it is not my letter <lb/>
            which describes, but my villa which is described, that is to <lb/>
            be considered large. But to return to where I began, lest I <lb/>
            should justly be condemned by my own law, if I continue <lb/>
            longer in this digression, you see now the reasons why I <lb/>
            prefer my Tuscan villa to those which I possess at Tus­ <lb/>
            culum, Tiber, and Praeneste.s Besides the advantages al­ <lb/>
            ready mentioned, I enjoy here a cozier, more profound and <lb/>
            undisturbed retirement than anywhere else, as I am at a <lb/>
            greater distance from the business of the town and the in­ <lb/>
            terruption of troublesome clients. All is calm and com­ <lb/>
            posed; which circumstances contribute no less than its clear <lb/>
            air and unclouded sky to that health of body and mind I <lb/>
            particularly enjoy in this place, both of which I keep <lb/>
            in full swing by study and hunting. And indeed there is no <note type="footnote"> 2 Now called Frascati, Tivoli, and Palestrina, all of them situated in <lb/>
            the Campagna di Roma, and at no great distance from Rome. M. </note> <lb/>

            sure I have not yet lost one (may the expression be allowed !3) <lb/>
            of all those I brought here with me. And may the gods <lb/>
            continue that happiness to me, and that honour to my villa. <lb/>

          <p>IT is certain the law does not allow a corporate city to <lb/>
            inherit any estate by will, or to receive a legacy. Saturninus, <lb/>
            however, who has appointed me his heir, had left a fourth <lb/>
            part of his estate to our corporation of Comum; afterwards, <lb/>
            instead of a fourth part, he bequeathed four hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand sesterces.1 This bequest, in the eye of the law, is null <lb/>
            and void, but, considered as the clear and express will of the <lb/>
            deceased, ought to stand firm and valid. Myself, I consider <lb/>
            the will of the dead (though I am afraid what I say will <lb/>
            not please the lawyers) of higher authority than the law, <lb/>
            especially when the interest of one's native country is <lb/>
            concerned. Ought I, who made them a present of eleven <lb/>
            hundred thousand sesterces2 out of my own patrimony, to <lb/>
            withhold a benefaction of little more than a third part of <lb/>
            that sum out of an estate which has come quite by a chance <lb/>
            into my hands? You, who like a true patriot have the same <lb/>
            affection for this our common country, will agree with me <lb/>
            in opinion, I feel sure. I wish therefore you would, at the <lb/>
            next meeting of the Decurii, acquaint them, just briefly and <lb/>
            respectfully, as to how the law stands in this case, and <lb/>
            then add that I offer them four hundred thousand sesterces <lb/>
            according to the direction in Saturninus' will. You will <lb/>
            represent this donation as his present and his liberality; I <lb/>
            only claim the merit of complying with his request. I did <lb/>
            not trouble to write to their senate about this, fully relying <lb/>
            as I do upon our intimate friendship and your wise dis­ <lb/>
            cretion, and being quite satisfied that you are both able and <lb/>
            willing to act for me upon this occasion as I would for my­ <lb/>

          <p>I WRITE this to you in the deepest sorrow: the youngest <lb/>
            daughter of my friend Fundanus is dead I I have never <lb/>
            seen a more cheerful and more lovable girl, or one who <lb/>
            better deserved to have enjoyed a long, I had almost said <lb/>
            an immortal, life! She was scarcely fourteen, and yet there <lb/>
            was in her a wisdom far beyond her years, a matronly <lb/>
            gravity united with girlish sweetness and virgin bashful­ <lb/>
            ness. With what an endearing fondness did she hang on <lb/>
            her father's neck! How affectionately and modestly she <lb/>
            used to greet us his friends! With what a tender and <lb/>
            deferential regard she used to treat her nurses, tutors, <lb/>
            teachers, each in their respective offices! What an eager, <lb/>
            industrious, intelligent, reader she was! She took few <lb/>
            amusements, and those with caution. How self-controlled, <lb/>
            how patient, how brave, she was, under her last illness! <lb/>
            She complied with all the directions of her physicians; she <lb/>
            spoke cheerful, comforting words to her sister and her <lb/>
            father; and when all her bodily strength was exhausted, <lb/>
            the vigour of her mind sustained her. That indeed con­ <lb/>
            tinued even to her last moments, unbroken by the pain of <lb/>
            a long illness, or the terrors of approaching death; and it <lb/>
            is a reflection which makes us miss her, and grieve that <lb/>
            she has gone from us, the more. 0 melancholy, untimely, <lb/>
            loss, too truly! She was engaged to an excellent young <lb/>
            man; the wedding-day was fixed, and we were all invited. <lb/>
            How our joy has been turned into sorrow! I cannot ex­ <lb/>
            press in words the inward pain I felt when I heard Fundanus <lb/>
            himself (as grief is ever finding out fresh circumstances <lb/>
            to aggravate its affliction) ordering the money he had in­ <lb/>
            tended laying out upon clothes, pearls, and jewels for her <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            marriage, to be employed in frankincense, ointments, and <lb/>
            perfumes for her funeral. He is a man of great learning <lb/>
            and good sense, who has applied himself from his earliest <lb/>
            youth to the deeper studies and the fine arts, but all the <lb/>
            maxims of fortitude which he has received from books, or <lb/>
            advanced himself, he now absolutely rejects, and every <lb/>
            other virtue of his heart gives place to all a parent's tender­ <lb/>
            ness. You will excuse, you will even approve, his grief, <lb/>
            when you consider what he has lost. He has lost a daughter <lb/>
            who resembled him in his manners, as well as his person, <lb/>
            and exactly copied out all her father. So, if you should <lb/>
            think proper to write to him upon the subject of so reason­ <lb/>
            able a grief, let me remind you not to use the rougher argu­ <lb/>
            ments of consolation, and such as seem to carry a sort of <lb/>
            reproof with them, but those of kind and sympathizing <lb/>
            humanity. Time will render him more open to the dictates <lb/>
            of reason: for as a fresh wound shrinks back from the hand <lb/>
            of the surgeon, but by degrees submits to, and even seeks of <lb/>
            its own accord the means of its cure, so a mind under the <lb/>
            first impression of a misfortune shuns and rejects all con­ <lb/>
            solations, but at length desires and is lulled by their gentle <lb/>

            earliest opportunity of informing you that I went to-day <lb/>
            to hear Calpurnius Piso read a beautiful and scholarly pro­ <lb/>
            duction of his, entiled the Sports of Love. His numbers, <lb/>
            which were elegiac, were tender, sweet, and flowing, at the <lb/>
            same time that they occasionally rose to all the sublimity <lb/>
            of diction which the nature of his subject required. He <lb/>
            varied his style from the lofty to the simple, from the <lb/>
            close to the copious, from the grave to the florid, with equal <lb/>
            genius and judgment. These beauties were further recom­ <lb/>
            mended by a most harmonious voice; which a very becoming <lb/>
            modesty rendered still more pleasing. A confusion and <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            concern in the countenance of a speaker imparts a grace <lb/>
            to all he utters; for diffidence, I know not how, is infinitely <lb/>
            more engaging than assurance and self-sufficiency. I might <lb/>
            mention several other circumstances to his advantage, which <lb/>
            I am the more inclined to point out, as they are exceedingly <lb/>
            striking in one of his age, and are most uncommon in a <lb/>
            youth of his quality: but not to enter into a farther detail <lb/>
            of his merit, I will only add that, when he had finished his <lb/>
            poem, I embraced him very heartily, and being persuaded <lb/>
            that nothing is a greater encouragement than applause, I <lb/>
            exhorted him to go on as he had begun, and to shine out to <lb/>
            posterity with the same glorious lustre, which was reflected <lb/>
            upon him from his ancestors. I congratulated his excellent <lb/>
            mother, and particularly his brother, who gained as much <lb/>
            honour by the generous affection he manifested upon this <lb/>
            occasion as Calpurnius did by his eloquence; so remarkable <lb/>
            a solicitude he showed for him when he began to recite his <lb/>
            poem, and so much pleasure in his success. May the gods <lb/>
            grant me frequent occasions of giving you accounts of this <lb/>
            nature! for I have a partiality to the age in which I live, <lb/>
            and should rejoice to find it not barren of merit. I ardently <lb/>
            wish, therefore, our young men of quality would have some­ <lb/>
            thing else to show of honourable memorial in their houses <lb/>
            than the images1 of their ancestors. As for those which are <lb/>
            placed in the mansion of these excellent youths, I now figure <lb/>
            them to myself as silently applauding and encouraging <lb/>
            their pursuits, and (what is a sufficient degree of honour <lb/>
            to both brothers) as recognizing their kindred. Farewell.</p>

            He is indeed endeared to me by the ties of a long affection, <lb/>
            which are strengthened by the danger he is now in. For <lb/>
            nature has so formed our hearts that nothing contributes <lb/>
            more to incite and kindle affection than the fear of losing <lb/>
            the object of it: a fear which I have suffered more than <lb/>
            once on his account. Some years ago he strained himself <lb/>
            so much by too strong an exertion of his voice, that he <lb/>
            spit blood, upon which account I sent him into Egypt ;1 from <lb/>
            whence, after a long absence, he lately returned with great <lb/>
            benefit to his health. But having again exerted himself for <lb/>
            several days together beyond his strength, he was reminded <lb/>
            of his former malady by a slight return of his cough, and <lb/>
            a spitting of blood. For this reason I intend to send him to <lb/>
            your farm at Forum-Julii,2 having frequently heard you <lb/>
            mention it as a healthy air, and recommend the milk of that <lb/>
            place as very salutary in disorders of his nature. I beg you <lb/>
            would give directions to your people to receive him into <note type="footnote"> 1 The Roman physicians used to send their patients in consumptive cases <lb/>

            your house, and to supply him with whatever he may have <lb/>
            occasion for: which will not be much, for he is so sparing <lb/>
            and abstemious as not only to abstain from delicacies, but <lb/>
            even to deny himself the necessaries his ill state of health <lb/>
            requires. I shall furnish him towards his journey with <lb/>
            what will be sufficient for one of his moderate requirements, <lb/>
            who is coming under your roof. Farewell.</p>

          <p>I WENT into the Julian court to hear those lawyers to <lb/>
            whom, according to the last adjournment, I was to reply. <lb/>
            The judges had taken their seats, the decemviri* were <lb/>
            arrived, the eyes of the audience were fixed upon the <lb/>
            counsel, and all was hushed silence and expectation, when <lb/>
            a messenger arrived from the praetor, and the Hundred <lb/>
            are at once dismissed, and the case postponed: an accident <lb/>
            extremely agreeable to me, who am never so well prepared <lb/>
            but that I am glad of gaining further time. The occasion <lb/>
            of the court's rising thus abruptly was a short edict of <lb/>
            Nepos, the praetor for criminal causes, in which he directed <lb/>
            all persons concerned as plaintiffs or defendants in any <lb/>
            cause before him to take notice that he designed strictly <lb/>
            to put in force the decree of the senate annexed to his edict. <lb/>
            Which decree was expressed in the following words: ALL <lb/>
            PERSONS WHOSOEVER THAT HAVE ANY LAW-SUITS DEPENDING <lb/>
            ARE HEREBY REQUIRED AND COMMANDED, BEFORE ANY PRO­ <lb/>
            CEEDINGS BE HAD THEREON, TO TAKE AN OATH THAT THEY <lb/>
            HAVE NOT GIVEN, PROMISED, OR ENGAGED TO GIVE, ANY FEE OR <lb/>
            REWARD TO ANY ADVOCATE, UPON ACCOUNT OF HIS UNDER­ <lb/>
            TAKING THEIR CAUSE. In these terms, and many others <lb/>
            equally full and express, the lawyers were prohibited to <lb/>
            make their professions venal. However, after the case is <note type="footnote"> 1 A court of justice erected by Julius Caesar in the forum, and opposite <lb/>

            decided, they are permitted to accept a gratuity of ten <lb/>
            thousand sesterces.1 The praetor for civil causes, being <lb/>
            alarmed at this order of Nepos, gave us this unexpected <lb/>
            holiday in order to take time to consider whether he should <lb/>
            follow the example. Meanwhile the whole town is talking, <lb/>
            and either approving or condemning this edict of Nepos, <lb/>
            We have got then at last (say the latter with a sneer) a <lb/>
            redressor of abuses. But pray was there never a praetor <lb/>
            before this man? Who is he then who sets up in this way <lb/>
            for a public reformer? Others, on the contrary, say, "He has <lb/>
            done perfectly right upon his entry into office; he has paid <lb/>
            obedience to the laws; considered the decrees of the senate, <lb/>
            repressed most indecent contracts, and will not suffer the <lb/>
            most honourable of all professions to be debased into a <lb/>
            sordid lucre traffic." This is what one hears all around <lb/>
            one; but which side may prevail, the event will shew. It <lb/>
            is the usual method of the world (though a very unequitable <lb/>
            rule of estimation) to pronounce an action either right or <lb/>
            wrong, according as it is attended with good or ill success; <lb/>
            in consequence of which you may hear the very same con­ <lb/>
            duct attributed to zeal or folly, to liberty or licentiousness, <lb/>
            upon different several occasions. Farewell.</p>

          <p>SOMETIMES I miss Regulus in our courts. I cannot say I <lb/>
            deplore his loss. The man, it must be owned, highly re­ <lb/>
            spected his profession, grew pale with study and anxiety <lb/>
            over it, and used to write out his speeches though he could <lb/>
            not get them by heart. There was a practice he had of <lb/>
            painting round his right or left eye,1 and wearing a white <lb/>
            patch2 over one side or the other of his forehead, according <note type="footnote"> 3 About $400. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This silly piece of superstition seems to have been peculiar to Regulus, <lb/>

            as he was to plead either for the plaintiff or defendant; of <lb/>
            consulting the soothsayers upon the issue of an action; <lb/>
            still, all this excessive superstition was really due to his ex­ <lb/>
            treme earnestness in his profession. And it was acceptable <lb/>
            enough being concerned in the same cause with him, as he <lb/>
            always obtained full indulgence in point of time, and never <lb/>
            failed to get an audience together; for what could be more <lb/>
            convenient than, under the protection of a liberty which you <lb/>
            did not ask yourself, and all the odium of the arrangement <lb/>
            resting with another, and before an audience which you had <lb/>
            not the trouble of collecting, to speak on at your ease, and <lb/>
            as long as you thought proper? Nevertheless Regulus did <lb/>
            well in departing this life, though he would have done much <lb/>
            better had he made his exit sooner. He might really have <lb/>
            lived now without any danger to the public, in the reign of <lb/>
            a prince under whom he would have had no opportunity of <lb/>
            doing any harm. I need not scruple therefore, I think, to <lb/>
            say I sometimes miss him: for since his death the custom <lb/>
            has prevailed of not allowing, nor indeed of asking more <lb/>
            than an hour or two to plead in, and sometimes not above <lb/>
            half that time. The truth is, our advocates take more <lb/>
            pleasure in finishing a cause than in defending it; and our <lb/>
            judges had rather rise from the bench than sit upon it: such <lb/>
            is their indolence, and such their indifference to the honour <lb/>
            of eloquence and the interest of justice! But are we wiser <lb/>
            than our ancestors? are we more equitable than the laws <lb/>
            which grant so many hours and days of adjournments to a <lb/>
            case? were our forefathers slow of apprehension, and dull <lb/>
            beyond measure? and are we clearer of speech, quicker in <lb/>
            our conceptions, or more scrupulous in our decisions, be­ <lb/>
            cause we get over our causes in fewer hours than they <lb/>
            took days ? 0 Regulus! it was by zeal in your profession <lb/>
            that you secured an advantage which is but rarely given <lb/>
            to the highest integrity. As for myself, whenever I sit <lb/>
            upon the bench (which is much oftener than I appear at <lb/>
            the bar), I always give the advocates as much time as they <lb/>
            require: for I look upon it as highly presuming to pre­ <lb/>
            tend to guess, before a case is heard, what time it will re­ <lb/>
            quire, and to set limits to an affair before one is acquainted <lb/>
            with its extent; especially as the first and most sacred duty <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            of a judge is patience, which constitutes an important part <lb/>
            of justice. But this, it is objected, would give an opening <lb/>
            to much superfluous matter: I grant it may; yet is it not <lb/>
            better to hear too much than not to hear enough ? Besides, <lb/>
            how shall you know that what an advocate has farther to <lb/>
            offer will be superfluous, until you have heard him? But <lb/>
            this, and many other public abuses, will be best reserved for <lb/>
            a conversation when we meet; for I know your affection to <lb/>
            the commonwealth inclines you to wish that some means <lb/>
            might be found out to check at least those grievances, which <lb/>
            would now be very difficult absolutely to remove. But to <lb/>
            return to affairs of private concern: I hope all goes well in <lb/>
            your family; mine remains in its usual situation. The good <lb/>
            which I enjoy grows more acceptable to me by its con­ <lb/>

          <p>You know Attilius Crescens, and you love him; who is <lb/>
            there, indeed, of any rank or worth, that does not? For <lb/>
            myself, I profess to have a friendship for him far exceeding <lb/>
            ordinary attachments of the world. Our native towns are <lb/>
            separated only by a day's journey; and we got to care for <lb/>
            each other when we were very young; the season for pas­ <lb/>
            sionate friendships. Ours improved by years; and so far <lb/>
            from being chilled, it was confirmed by our riper judgments, <lb/>
            as those who know us best can witness. He takes pleasure <lb/>
            in boasting everywhere of my friendship; as I do to let the <lb/>
            world know that his reputation, his ease, and his interest are <lb/>
            my peculiar concern. Insomuch that upon his expressing to <lb/>
            me some apprehension of insolent treatment from a certain <lb/>
            person who was entering upon the tribuneship of the people, <lb/>
            I could not forbear answering, <lb/>
            "Long as Achilles breathes this vital air, <lb/>
            To touch thy head no impious hand shall dare."1 <lb/>
            What is my object in telling you these things? Why, to <lb/>
            shew you that I look upon every injury offered to Attilius <note type="footnote"> 1 Hom. II. lib. i. v. 88. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            as done to myself. "But what is the object of all this?" you <lb/>
            repeat. You must know then, Valerius Varus, at his death, <lb/>
            owed Attilius a sum of money. Though I am on friendly <lb/>
            terms with Maximus, his heir, yet there is a closer friend­ <lb/>
            ship between him and you. I beg therefore, and entreat you <lb/>
            by the affection you have for me, to take care that Attilius <lb/>
            is not only paid the capital which is due to him, but all the <lb/>
            long arrears of interest too. He neither covets the property <lb/>
            of others nor neglects the care of his own; and as he is <lb/>
            not engaged in any lucrative profession, he has nothing to <lb/>
            depend upon but his own frugality: for as to literature, in <lb/>
            which he greatly distinguishes himself, he pursues this <lb/>
            merely from motives of pleasure and ambition. In such <lb/>
            a situation, the slightest loss presses hard upon a man, <lb/>
            and the more so because he has no opportunities of repairing <lb/>
            any injury done to his fortune. Remove then, I entreat you, <lb/>
            our uneasiness, and suffer me still to enjoy the pleasure of <lb/>
            his wit and bonhommie; for I cannot bear to see the cheer­ <lb/>
            fulness of my friend over-clouded, whose mirth and good <lb/>
            humour dissipates every gloom of melancholy in myself. In <lb/>
            short, you know what a pleasant entertaining fellow he is, <lb/>
            and I hope you will not suffer any injury to engloom and <lb/>
            embitter his disposition. You may judge by the warmth <lb/>
            of his affection how severe his resentments would prove; for <lb/>
            a generous and great mind can ill brook an injury when <lb/>
            coupled with contempt. But though he could pass it over, <lb/>
            yet cannot I: on the contrary, I shall regard it as a wrong <lb/>
            and indignity done to myself, and resent it as one offered <lb/>
            to my friend; that is, with double warmth. But, after all, <lb/>
            why this air of threatening? rather let me end in the same <lb/>
            style in which I began, namely, by begging, entreating you <lb/>
            so to act in this affair that neither Attilius may have reason <lb/>
            to imagine (which I am exceedingly anxious he should not) <lb/>
            that I neglect his interest, nor that I may have occasion to <lb/>
            charge you with carelessness of mine: as undoubtedly I <lb/>
            shall not if you have the same regard for the latter as I <lb/>
            have for the former. Farewell.</p><pb n="296"/>

          <p>I WAS lately at Alsium,1 where my mother-in-law has a <lb/>

            renewed in my mind the sorrowful remembrance of that <lb/>
            great and excellent man. He was extremely fond of this <lb/>
            retirement, and used to call it the nest of his old age. Which­ <lb/>
            ever way I looked, I missed him, I felt his absence. I had <lb/>
            an inclination to visit his monument; but I repented having <lb/>
            seen it, afterwards: for I found it still unfinished, and this, <lb/>
            not from any difficulty residing in the work itself, for it is <lb/>
            very plain, or rather indeed slight; but through the neglect <lb/>
            of him to whose care it was entrusted. I could not see <lb/>
            without a concern, mixed with indignation, the remains of <lb/>
            a man, whose fame filled the whole world, lie for ten years <lb/>
            after his death without an inscription, or a name. He had <lb/>
            however directed that the divine and immortal action of his <lb/>
            life should be recorded upon his tomb in the following lines: <lb/>
            "Here Rufus lies, who Vindex' arms withstood, <lb/>
            Not for himself, but for his country's good." <lb/>
            But faithful friends are so rare, and the dead so soon for­ <lb/>
            gotten, that we shall be obliged ourselves to build even our <lb/>
            very tombs, and anticipate the office of our heirs. For who <lb/>
            is there that has no reason to fear for himself what we see <lb/>
            has happened to Verginius, whose eminence and distinction, <lb/>

             <pb n="297"/>
            sides: their worth is equal, and each of them will one day, <lb/>
            I am persuaded, prove an ornament not only to the present <lb/>
            age, but to literature itself. They evinced upon this occa­ <lb/>
            sion an admirable probity, supported by inflexible courage: <lb/>
            their dress was decent, their elocution distinct, their tones <lb/>
            were manly, their memory retentive, their genius elevated, <lb/>
            and guided by an equal solidity of judgment. I took infinite <lb/>
            pleasure in observing them display these noble qualities; <lb/>
            particularly as I had the satisfaction to see that, while they <lb/>
            looked upon me as their guide and model, they appeared to <lb/>
            the audience as my imitators and rivals. It was a day (I <lb/>
            cannot but repeat it again) which afforded me the most ex­ <lb/>
            quisite happiness, and which I shall ever distinguish with <lb/>
            the fairest mark. For what indeed could be either more <lb/>
            pleasing to me on the public account than to observe two <lb/>
            such noble youths building their fame and glory upon the <lb/>
            polite arts; or more desirable upon my own than to be marked <lb/>
            out as a worthy example to them in their pursuits of virtue ? <lb/>
            May the gods still grant me the continuance of that pleas­ <lb/>
            ure ! And I implore the same gods, you are my witness, to <lb/>
            make all these who think me deserving of imitation far better <lb/>
            than I am. Farewell.</p>

          <p>You were not present at a very singular occurrence here <lb/>
            lately: neither was I, but the story reached me just after <lb/>
            it had happened. Passienus Paulus, a Roman knight, of good <lb/>
            family, and a man of peculiar learning and culture besides, <lb/>
            composes elegies, a talent which runs in the family, for <lb/>
            Propertius is reckoned by him amongst his ancestors, as <lb/>
            well as being his countryman. He was lately reciting a <lb/>
            poem which began thus: <lb/>
            "Priscus, at thy command"— <lb/>
            Whereupon Javolenus Priscus, who happened to be present <lb/>
            as a particular friend of the poet's, cried out—" But he is <lb/>
            mistaken, I did not command him." Think what laughter <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            and merriment this occasioned. Priscus's wits, you must <lb/>
            know, are reckoned rather unsound,1 though he takes a share <lb/>
            in public business, is summoned to consultations, and even <lb/>
            publicly acts as a lawyer, so that this behaviour of his was <lb/>
            the more remarkable and ridiculous: meanwhile Paulus was <lb/>
            a good deal disconcerted by his friend's absurdity. You <lb/>
            see how necessary it is for those who are anxious to recite <lb/>
            their works in public to take care that the audience as well <lb/>
            as the author are perfectly sane. Farewell.</p>

          <p>YOUR request that I would send you an account of my <lb/>
            uncle's death, in order to transmit a more exact relation of <lb/>
            it to posterity, deserves my acknowledgments; for, if this <lb/>
            accident shall be celebrated by your pen, the glory of it, <lb/>
            I am well assured, will be rendered forever illustrious. <lb/>
            And notwithstanding he perished by a misfortune, which, <lb/>
            as it involved at the same time a most beautiful country in <lb/>
            ruins, and destroyed so many populous cities, seems to <lb/>
            promise him an everlasting remembrance; notwithstanding <lb/>
            he has himself composed many and lasting works; yet I <lb/>
            am persuaded, the mentioning of him in your immortal <lb/>
            writings, will greatly contribute to render his name im­ <lb/>
            mortal. Happy I esteem those to be to whom by provision <lb/>
            of the gods has been granted the ability either to do such <lb/>
            actions as are worthy of being related or to relate them in <lb/>
            a manner worthy of being read; but peculiarly happy are <lb/>
            they who are blessed with both these uncommon talents: <lb/>
            in the number of which my uncle, as his own writings and <lb/>
            your history will evidently prove, may justly be ranked. It <lb/>
            is with extreme willingness, therefore, that I execute your <lb/>
            commands.; and should indeed have claimed the task if you <lb/>
            had not enjoined it. He was at that time with the fleet <lb/>
            under his command at Misenum.2 On the 24th of August, <lb/>
            about one in the afternoon, my mother desired him to ob­ <note type="footnote">1 Nevertheless, Javolenus Priscus was one of the most eminent lawyers <lb/>

            serve a cloud which appeared of a very unusual size and <lb/>
            shape. He had just taken a turn in the sun,' and, after <lb/>
            bathing himself in cold water, and making a light luncheon, <lb/>
            gone back to his books: he immediately arose and went out <lb/>
            upon a rising ground from whence he might get a better <lb/>
            sight of this very uncommon appearance. A cloud, from <lb/>
            which mountain was uncertain, at this distance (but it was <lb/>
            found afterwards to come from Mount Vesuvius), was <lb/>
            ascending, the appearance of which I cannot give you a more <lb/>
            exact description of than by likening it to that of a pine tree, <lb/>
            for it shot up to a great height in the form of a very tall <lb/>
            trunk, which spread itself out at the top into a sort of <lb/>
            branches; occasioned, I imagine, either by a sudden gust <lb/>
            of air that impelled it, the force of which decreased as it <lb/>
            advanced upwards-, or the cloud itself being pressed back <lb/>
            again by its own weight, expanded in the manner I have <lb/>
            mentioned; it appeared sometimes bright and sometimes dark <lb/>
            and spotted, according as it was either more or less im­ <lb/>
            pregnated with earth and cinders. This phenomenon <lb/>
            seemed to a man of such learning and research as my uncle <lb/>
            extraordinary and worth further looking into. He ordered <lb/>
            a light vessel to be got ready, and gave me leave, if I liked, <lb/>
            to accompany him. I said I had rather go on with my <lb/>
            work; and it so happened, he had himself given me some­ <lb/>
            thing to write out. As he was coming out of the house, he <lb/>
            received a note from Rectina, the wife of Bassus, who was <lb/>
            in the utmost alarm at the imminent danger which threat­ <lb/>
            ened her; for her villa lying at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, <lb/>
            there was no way of escape but by sea; she earnestly en­ <lb/>
            treated him therefore to come to her assistance. He ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly changed his first intention, and what he had begun <lb/>
            from a philosophical, he now carries out in a noble and <lb/>
            generous spirit. He ordered the galleys to be put to sea, <lb/>
            and went himself on board with an intention of assisting <note type="footnote"> 2 The Romans used to lie or walk naked in the sun, after anointing their <lb/>
            bodies with oil, which was esteemed as greatly contributing to health, and <lb/>
            therefore daily practised by them. This custom, however, of anointing <lb/>
            themselves, is inveighed against by the satirists as in the number of their <lb/>
            luxurious indulgences: but since we find the elder Pliny here, and the <lb/>
            amiable Spurinna in a former letter, practising this method, we can not <lb/>
            suppose the thing itself was esteemed unmanly, but only when it was at­ <lb/>
            tended with some particular circumstances of an over-refined delicacy. M. </note> <lb/>

            not only Rectina, but the several other towns which lay <lb/>
            thickly strewn along that beautiful coast. Hastening then <lb/>
            to the place from whence others fled with the utmost terror, <lb/>
            he steered his course direct to the point of danger, and with <lb/>
            so much calmness and presence of mind as to be able to <lb/>
            make and dictate his observations upon the motion and all <lb/>
            the phenomena of that dreadful scene. He was now so <lb/>
            close to the mountain that the cinders, which grew thicker <lb/>
            and hotter the nearer he approached, fell into the ships, <lb/>
            together with pumice-stones, and black pieces of burning <lb/>
            rock: they were in danger too not only of being a-ground <lb/>
            by the sudden retreat of the sea, but also from the vast <lb/>
            fragments which rolled down from the mountain, and <lb/>
            obstructed all the shore. Here he stopped to consider <lb/>
            whether he should turn back again; to which the pilot ad­ <lb/>
            vising him, "Fortune," said he, "favours the brave; steer <lb/>
            to where Pomponianus is." Pomponianus was then at Sta­ <lb/>
            biae,3 separated by a bay, which the sea, after several in­ <lb/>
            sensible windings, forms with the shore. He had already <lb/>
            sent his baggage on board; for though he was not at that <lb/>
            time in actual danger, yet being within sight of it, and in­ <lb/>
            deed extremely near, if it should in the least increase, he <lb/>
            was determined to put to sea as soon as the wind, which <lb/>
            was blowing dead in-shore, should go down. It was favour­ <lb/>
            able, however, for carrying my uncle to Pomponianus, whom <lb/>
            he found in the greatest consternation: he embraced him <lb/>
            tenderly, encouraging and urging him to keep up his spirits, <lb/>
            and, the more effectually to soothe his fears by seeming <lb/>
            unconcerned himself, ordered a bath to be got ready, and <lb/>
            then, after having bathed, sat down to supper with great <lb/>
            cheerfulness, or at least (what is just as heroic) with every <lb/>
            appearance of it. Meanwhile broad flames shone out in <lb/>
            several places from Mount Vesuvius, which the darkness of <lb/>
            the night contributed to render still brighter and clearer. <lb/>
            But my uncle, in order to soothe the apprehensions of his <lb/>
            friend, assured him it was only the burning of the villages, <lb/>
            which the country people had abandoned to the flames: after <lb/>
            this he retired to rest, and it is most certain he was so <lb/>
            little disquieted as to fall into a sound sleep: for his breath­ <note type="footnote"> a Now called Castelamare, in the Bay of Naples. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            ing, which, on account of his corpulence, was rather heavy <lb/>
            and sonorous, was heard by the attendants outside. The <lb/>
            court which led to his apartment being now almost filled <lb/>
            with stones and ashes, if he had continued there any time <lb/>
            longer, it would have been impossible for him to have made <lb/>
            his way out. So he was awoke and got up, and went to <lb/>
            Pomponianus and the rest of his company, who were feeling <lb/>
            too anxious to think of going to bed. They consulted to­ <lb/>
            gether whether it would be most prudent to trust to the <lb/>
            houses, which now rocked from side to side with frequent <lb/>
            and violent concuss-ions as though shaken from their very <lb/>
            foundations; or fly to the open fields, where the calcined <lb/>
            stones and cinders, though light indeed, yet fell in large <lb/>
            showers, and threatened destruction. In this choice of dan­ <lb/>
            gers they resolved for the fields: a resolution which, while <lb/>
            the rest of the company were hurried into by their fears, my <lb/>
            uncle embraced upon cool and deliberate consideration. <lb/>
            They went out then, having pillows tied upon their heads <lb/>
            with napkins; and this was their whole defence against the <lb/>
            storm of stones that fell round them. It was now day every­ <lb/>
            where else, but there a deeper darkness prevailed than in <lb/>
            the thickest night; which however was in some degree alle­ <lb/>
            viated by torches and other lights of various kinds. They <lb/>
            thought proper to go farther down upon the shore to see <lb/>
            if they might safely put out to sea, but found the waves still <lb/>
            running extremely high, and boisterous. There my uncle, <lb/>
            laying himself down upon a sail cloth, which was spread <lb/>
            for him, called twice for some cold water, which he drank, <lb/>
            when immediately the flames, preceded by a strong whiff of <lb/>
            sulphur, dispersed the rest of the party, and obliged him <lb/>
            to rise. He raised himself up with the assistance of two <lb/>
            of his servants, and instantly fell down dead; suffocated, <lb/>
            as I conjecture, by some gross and noxious vapour, having <lb/>
            always had a weak throat, which was often inflamed. As <lb/>
            soon as it was light again, which was not till the third day <lb/>
            after this melancholy accident, his body was found entire, <lb/>
            and without any marks of violence upon it, in the dress in <lb/>
            which he fell, and looking more like a man asleep than dead. <lb/>
            During all this time my mother and I, who were at Mise­ <lb/>
            num—but this has no connection with your history, and you <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            did not desire any particulars besides those of my uncle's <lb/>
            death; so I will end here, only adding that I have faithfully <lb/>
            related to you what I was either an eye-witness of myself <lb/>
            or received immediately after the accident happened, and <lb/>
            before there was time to vary the truth. You will pick <lb/>
            out of this narrative whatever is most important: for a let­ <lb/>

          <p>THE letter which, in compliance with your request, I <lb/>
            wrote to you concerning the death of my uncle has raised, <lb/>
            it seems, your curiosity to know what terrors and dangers <lb/>
            attended me while I continued at Misenum; for there, I <lb/>
            think, my account broke off: <lb/>
            "Though my shock'd soul recoils, my tongue shall tell." <lb/>
            My uncle having left us, I spent such time as was left on <lb/>
            my studies (it was on their account indeed that I had <lb/>
            stopped behind), till it was time for my bath. After which <lb/>
            I went to supper, and then fell into a short and uneasy <lb/>
            sleep. There had been noticed for many days before a <lb/>
            trembling of the earth, which did not alarm us much, as this <lb/>
            is quite an ordinary occurrence in Campania; but it was so <lb/>
            particularly violent that night that it not only shook but <lb/>
            actually overturned, as it would seem, everything about us. <lb/>
            My mother rushed into my chamber, where she found me <lb/>
            rising, in order to awaken her. We sat down in the open <lb/>
            court of the house, which occupied a small space between the <lb/>
            buildings and the sea. As I was at that time but eighteen <lb/>
            years of age, I know not whether I should call my be­ <lb/>
            haviour, in this dangerous juncture, courage or folly; but I <lb/>
            took up Livy, and amused myself with turning over that au­ <lb/>
            thor, and even making extracts from him, as if I had been per­ <lb/>
            fectly at my leisure. Just then, a friend of my uncle's, who <lb/>
            had lately come to him from Spain, joined us, and observing <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            me sitting by my mother with a book in my hand, reproved <lb/>
            her for her calmness, and me at the same time for my <lb/>
            careless security: nevertheless I went on with my author. <lb/>
            Though it was now morning, the light was still exceedingly <lb/>
            faint and doubtful; the buildings all around us tottered, and <lb/>
            though we stood upon open ground, yet as the place was <lb/>
            narrow and confined, there was no remaining without im­ <lb/>
            minent danger: we therefore resolved to quit the town. A <lb/>
            panic-stricken crowd followed us, and (as to a mind dis­ <lb/>
            tracted with terror every suggestion seems more prudent <lb/>
            than its own) pressed on us in dense array to drive us <lb/>
            forward as we came out. Being at a convenient distance <lb/>
            from the houses, we stood still, in the midst of a most dan­ <lb/>
            gerous and dreadful scene. The chariots, which we had <lb/>
            ordered to be drawn out, were so agitated backwards and <lb/>
            forwards, though upon the most level ground, that we could <lb/>
            not keep them steady, even by supporting them with large <lb/>
            stones. The sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be <lb/>
            driven from its banks by the convulsive motion of the <lb/>
            earth; it is certain at least the shore was considerably en­ <lb/>
            larged, and several sea animals were left upon it. On the <lb/>
            other side, a black and dreadful cloud, broken with rapid, <lb/>
            zigzag flashes, revealed behind it variously shaped masses <lb/>
            of flame: these last were like sheet-lightning, but much <lb/>
            larger. Upon this our Spanish friend, whom I mentioned <lb/>
            above, addressing himself to my mother and me with great <lb/>
            energy and urgency: " If your brother," he said, " if your <lb/>
            uncle be safe, he certainly wishes you may be so too; but if <lb/>
            he perished, it was his desire, no doubt, that you might both <lb/>
            survive him: Why therefore do you delay your escape a <lb/>
            moment? " We could never think of our own safety, we <lb/>
            said, while we were uncertain of his. Upon this our friend <lb/>
            left us, and withdrew from the danger with the utmost pre­ <lb/>
            cipitation. Soon afterwards, the cloud began to descend, <lb/>
            and cover the sea. It had already surrounded and concealed <lb/>
            the island of Capreae and the promontory of Misenum. My <lb/>
            mother now besought, urged, even commanded me to make <lb/>
            my escape at any rate, which, as I was young, I might easily <lb/>
            do; as for herself, she said, her age and corpulency rendered <lb/>
            all attempts of that sort impossible; however, she would <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            willingly meet death if she could have the satisfaction of <lb/>
            seeing that she was not the occasion of mine. But I abso­ <lb/>
            lutely refused to leave her, and, taking her by the hand, <lb/>
            compelled her to go with me. She complied with great re­ <lb/>
            luctance, and not without many reproaches to herself for <lb/>
            retarding my flight. The ashes now began to fall upon us, <lb/>
            though in no great quantity. I looked back; a dense dark <lb/>
            mist seemed to be following us, spreading itself over the <lb/>
            country like a cloud. " Let us turn out of the high-road," <lb/>
            I said, " while we can still see, for fear that, should we <lb/>
            fall in the road, we should be pressed to death in the dark, <lb/>
            by the crowds that are following us." We had scarcely sat <lb/>
            down when night came upon us, not such as we have when <lb/>
            the sky is cloudy, or when there is no moon, but that of a <lb/>
            room when it is shut up, and all the lights put out. You <lb/>
            might hear the shrieks of women, the screams of children, <lb/>
            and the shouts of men; some calling for their children, <lb/>
            others for their parents, others for their husbands, and seek­ <lb/>
            ing to recognise each other by the voices that replied; one <lb/>
            lamenting his own fate, another that of his family; some <lb/>
            wishing to die, from the very fear of dying; some lifting <lb/>
            their hands to the gods; but the greater part convinced that <lb/>
            there were now no gods at all, and that the final endless <lb/>
            night of which we have heard had come upon the world.1 <lb/>
            Among these there were some who augmented the real <lb/>
            terrors by others imaginary or wilfully invented. I re­ <lb/>
            member some who declared that one part of Misenum had <lb/>
            fallen, that another was on fire; it was false, but they found <lb/>
            people to believe them. It now grew rather lighter, which <lb/>
            we imagined to be rather the forerunner of an approaching <lb/>
            burst of flames (as in truth it was) than the return of <lb/>
            day: however, the fire fell at a distance from us: then again <lb/>
            we were immersed in thick darkness, and a heavy shower <lb/>
            of ashes rained upon us, which we were obliged every now <lb/>
            and then to stand up to shake off, otherwise we should have <lb/>
            been crushed and buried in the heap. I might boast that, <lb/>
            during all this scene of horror, not a sigh, or expression of <note type="footnote"> 1 The Stoic and Epicurean philosophers held that the world was to be <lb/>
            destroyed by fire, and all things fall again into original chaos; not except­ <lb/>

            fear, escaped me, had not my support been grounded in <lb/>
            that miserable, though mighty, consolation, that all mankind <lb/>
            were involved in the same calamity, and that I was per­ <lb/>
            ishing with the world itself. At last this dreadful darkness <lb/>
            was dissipated by degrees, like a cloud or smoke; the real <lb/>
            day returned, and even the sun shone out, though with a <lb/>
            lurid light, like when an eclipse is coming on. Every object <lb/>
            that presented itself to our eyes (which were extremely <lb/>
            weakened) seemed changed, being covered deep with ashes <lb/>
            as if with snow. We returned to Misenum, where we re­ <lb/>
            freshed ourselves as well as we could, and passed an anxious <lb/>
            night between hope and fear; though, indeed, with a much <lb/>
            larger share of the latter: for the earthquake still con­ <lb/>
            tinued, while many frenzied persons ran up and down <lb/>
            heightening their own and their friends' calamities by ter­ <lb/>
            rible predictions. However, my mother and I, notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the danger we had passed, and that which still <lb/>
            threatened us, had no thoughts of leaving the place, till we <lb/>
            could receive some news of my uncle.</p>

            of inserting it in your history, of which it is not in the <lb/>

          <p>How much does the fame of human actions depend upon <lb/>
            the station of those who perform them! The very same <lb/>

            overlooked, just as it may happen to proceed from a person <lb/>
            of conspicuous or obscure rank. I was sailing lately upon <lb/>
            our lake,1 with an old man of my acquaintance, who desired <lb/>
            me to observe a villa situated upon its banks, which had a <lb/>
            chamber overhanging the water. " From that room," said <lb/>
            he, " a woman of our city threw herself and her husband." <lb/>
            Upon enquiring into the cause, he informed me, " That her <lb/>
            husband having been long afflicted with an ulcer in those <note type="footnote"> 1 The lake Larius. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            parts which modesty conceals, she prevailed with him at <lb/>
            last to let her inspect the sore, assuring him at the same <lb/>
            time that she would most sincerely give her opinion whether <lb/>
            there was a possibility of its being cured. Accordingly, <lb/>
            upon viewing the ulcer, she found the case hopeless, and <lb/>
            therefore advised him to put an end to his life: she herself <lb/>
            accompanying him, even leading the way by her example, <lb/>
            and being actually the means of his death; for tying herself <lb/>
            to her husband, she plunged with him into the lake." <lb/>
            Though this happened in the very city where I was born, <lb/>
            I never heard it mentioned before; and yet that this action <lb/>
            is taken less notice of than that famous one of Arria's, is <lb/>
            not because it was less remarkable, but because the person <lb/>
            who performed it was more obscure. Farewell.</p>

          <p>I AM extremely glad to hear that you intend your daughter <lb/>

          <p>You desire me to consider what turn you should give to <lb/>
            your speech in honour of the emperor,1 upon your being <lb/>
            appointed consul elect.2 It is easy to find copies, not so <lb/>
            easy to choose out of them; for his virtues afford such <lb/>
            abundant material. However, I will write and give you <lb/>
            my opinion, or (what I should prefer) I will let you have <lb/>
            it in person, after having laid before you the difficulties <lb/>
            which occur to me. I am doubtful, then, whether I should <lb/>
            advise you to pursue the method which I observed myself <lb/>
            on the same occasion. When I was consul elect, I avoided <lb/>
            running into the usual strain of compliment, which, how­ <lb/>
            ever far from adulation, might yet look like it. Not that <lb/>
            I affected firmness and independence; but, as well knowing <lb/>
            the sentiments of our amiable prince, and being thoroughly <lb/>
            persuaded that the highest praise I could offer to him would <lb/>
            be to show the world I was under no necessity of paying <lb/>
            him any. When I reflected what profusion of honours had <lb/>
            been heaped upon the very worst of his predecessors, noth­ <lb/>
            ing, I imagined, could more distinguish a prince of his real <lb/>
            virtues from those infamous emperors than to address him <lb/>
            in a different manner. And this I thought proper to ob­ <lb/>
            serve in my speech, lest it might be suspected I passed over <lb/>
            his glorious acts, not out of judgment, but inattention. <lb/>
            Such was the method I then observed; but I am sensible <lb/>
            the same measures are neither agreeable nor indeed suitable <lb/>
            to all alike. Besides the propriety of doing or omitting a <lb/>
            thing depends not only upon persons, but time and cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances; and as the late actions of our illustrious prince <lb/>
            afford materials for panegyric, no less just than recent and <lb/>
            glorious, I doubt (as I said before) whether I should per­ <lb/>
            suade you in the present instance to adopt the same plan <note type="footnote"> 1 Trajan. </note><note type="footnote"> I The consuls, though they were chosen in August, did not enter upon <lb/>

          <p>I RECEIVED lately the most exquisite satisfaction at Cen­ <lb/>
            tumcellae2 (as it is now called), being summoned thither <lb/>
            by Caesar8 to attend a council. Could anything indeed <lb/>
            afford a higher pleasure than to see the emperor exercising <lb/>
            his justice, his wisdom, and his affability, even in retire­ <lb/>
            ment, where those virtues are most observable? Various <lb/>
            were the points brought in judgment before him, and which <note type="footnote"> 1 So called, because it formerly belonged to Camillus. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Civita Vecchia.</note> <note type="footnote">3 Trajan. </note> <lb/>

            proved, in so many different instances, the excellence of the <lb/>
            judge. The cause of Claudius Ariston came on first. He is <lb/>
            an Ephesian nobleman, of great munificence and unam­ <lb/>
            bitious popularity, whose virtues have rendered him obnox­ <lb/>
            ious to a set of people of far different characters; they had <lb/>
            instigated an informer against him, of the same infamous <lb/>
            stamp with themselves; but he was honourably acquitted. <lb/>
            The next day, the case of Galitta, accused of adultery, was <lb/>
            heard. Her husband, who is a military tribune, was upon <lb/>
            the point of offering himself as a candidate for certain <lb/>
            honours at Rome, but she had stained her own good name <lb/>
            and his by an intrigue with a centurion.' The husband in­ <lb/>
            formed the consul's lieutenant, who wrote to the emperor <lb/>
            about it. Caesar, having thoroughly sifted the evidence, <lb/>
            cashiered the centurion, and sentenced him to banishment. <lb/>
            It remained that some penalty should be inflicted likewise <lb/>
            upon the other party, as it is a crime of which both must <lb/>
            necessarily be equally guilty. But the husband's affection <lb/>
            for his wife inclined him to drop that part of the prosecu­ <lb/>
            tion, not without some reflections on his forbearance; for he <lb/>
            continued to live with her even after he had commenced <lb/>
            this prosecution, content, it would seem, with having re­ <lb/>
            moved his rival. But he was ordered to proceed in the suit: <lb/>
            and, though he complied with great reluctance, it was neces­ <lb/>
            sary, nevertheless, that she should be condemned. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, she was sentenced to the punishment directed by the <lb/>
            Julian law.' The emperor thought proper to specify, in his <lb/>
            decree, the name and office of the centurion, that it might <lb/>
            appear he passed it in virtue of military discipline; lest it <lb/>
            should be imagined he claimed a particular cognizance in <lb/>
            every cause of the same nature. The third day was em­ <lb/>
            ployed in examining into an affair which had occasioned a <lb/>
            good deal of talk and various reports; it was concerning <lb/>
            the codicils of Julius Tiro, part of which was plainly genu­ <lb/>
            ine, while the other part, it was alleged, was forged. The <lb/>
            persons accused of this fraud were Sempronius Senecio, a <lb/>
            Roman knight, and Eurythmus, Caesar's freedman and pro- <note type="footnote"> 3 An officer in the Roman legions, answering in some sort to a captain <lb/>
            in our companies. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 This law was made by Augustus Caesar; but it nowhere clearly appears <lb/>

            curator.' The heirs jointly petitioned the emperor, when <lb/>
            he was in Dacia,* that he would reserve to himself the trial <lb/>
            of this cause; to which he consented. On his return from <lb/>
            that expedition, he appointed a day for the hearing; and <lb/>
            when some of the heirs, as though out of respect to Euryth­ <lb/>
            mus, offered to withdraw the suit, the emperor nobly replied, <lb/>
            " He is not Polycletus,'7 nor am I Nero." However, he in­ <lb/>
            dulged the petitioners with an adjournment, and the time <lb/>
            being expired, he now sat to hear the cause. Two of the <lb/>
            heirs appeared, and desired that either their whole number <lb/>
            might be compelled to plead, as they had all joined in <lb/>
            the information, or that they also might have leave to with­ <lb/>
            draw. Caesar delivered his opinion with great dignity and <lb/>
            moderation; and when the counsel on the part of Senecio <lb/>
            and Eurythmus had represented that unless their clients were <lb/>
            heard, they would remain under the suspicion of guilt,­ <lb/>
            " I am not concerned," said the emperor, " what suspicions <lb/>
            they may lie under, it is I that am suspected;" and then <lb/>
            turning to us, " Advise me," said he, " how to act in this <lb/>
            affair, for you see they complain when allowed to withdraw <lb/>
            their suit." At length, by the advice of the counsel, he <lb/>
            ordered notice to be given to the heirs that they should <lb/>
            either proceed with the case or each of them justify their <lb/>
            reasons for not doing so; otherwise that he would pass <lb/>
            sentence upon them as calumniators.8 Thus you see how <lb/>
            usefully and seriously we spent our time, which however <lb/>
            was diversified with amusements of the most agreeable <lb/>
            kind. We were every day invited to Caesar's table, which, <lb/>
            for so great a prince, was spread with much plainness and <lb/>
            simplicity. There we were either entertained with inter­ <lb/>
            ludes or passed the night in the most pleasing conversation. <lb/>
            When we took our leave of him the last day, he made each <lb/>
            of us presents; so studiously polite is CaesarI As for <note type="footnote"> 5 An officer employed by the emperor to receive and regulate the public <lb/>

            breaks the force of the waves, and affords a safe passage <lb/>

            worth seeing: stones of a most enormous size are transported <lb/>

            when the fit was a little abated, and I had been anointed,1 <lb/>
            my physician offered me something to drink; I held out <lb/>
            my hand, desiring he would first feel my pulse, and upon <lb/>
            his not seeming quite satisfied, I instantly returned the <lb/>
            cup, though it was just at my lips. Afterwards, when I was <lb/>

            " What need is there," said I, " of my taking a bath at all? " <lb/>
            And so, with perfect calmness and tranquillity, I gave up <lb/>
            a pleasure I was upon the point of enjoying, and abstained <lb/>
            from the bath as serenely and composedly as though I were <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>A VERY singular and remarkable accident has happened <lb/>
            in the affair of Varenus,2 the result of which is yet doubtful. <lb/>
            The Bithynians, it is said, have dropped their prosecution <lb/>
            of him being convinced at last that it was rashly under­ <lb/>
            taken. A deputy from that province is arrived, who has <note type="footnote"> l His wife. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 See book v. letter xx. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            brought with him a decree of their assembly; copies of <lb/>
            which he has delivered to Caesar,2 and to several of the <lb/>
            leading men in Rome, and also to us, the advocates for <lb/>
            Varenus. Magnus,1 nevertheless, whom I mentioned in <lb/>
            my last letter to you, persists in his charge, to support <lb/>
            which he is incessantly teazing the worthy Nigrinus. This <lb/>
            excellent person was counsel for him in his former peti­ <lb/>
            tion to the consuls, that Varenus might be compelled to <lb/>
            produce his accounts. Upon this occasion, as I attended <lb/>
            Varenus merely as a friend, I determined to be silent. I <lb/>
            thought it highly imprudent for me, as I was appointed <lb/>
            his counsel by the senate, to attempt to defend him as an <lb/>
            accused person, when it was his business to insist that <lb/>
            there was actually no charge subsisting against him. How­ <lb/>
            ever, when Nigrinus had finished his speech, the consuls <lb/>
            turning their eyes upon me, I rose up, and, " When you shall <lb/>
            hear," I said, " what the real deputies from the province <lb/>
            have to object against the motion of Nigrinus, you will see <lb/>
            that my silence was not without just reason." Upon this <lb/>
            Nigrinus asked me, " To whom are these deputies sent? " I <lb/>
            replied, " To me among others; I have the decree of the <lb/>
            province in my hands." He returned, " That is a point <lb/>
            which, though it may be clear to you, I am not so well <lb/>
            satisfied of." To this I answered, " Though it may not <lb/>
            be so evident to you, who are concerned to support the <lb/>
            accusation, it may be perfectly clear to me, who am on <lb/>
            the more favourable side." Then Polyaenus, the deputy <lb/>
            from the province, acquainted the senate with the reasons <lb/>
            for superseding the prosecution, but desired it might be with­ <lb/>
            out prejudice to Caesar's determination. Magnus answered <lb/>
            him; Polyaenus replied; as for myself, I only now and then <lb/>
            threw in a word, observing in general a complete silence. <lb/>
            For I have learned that upon some occasions it is as much an <lb/>
            orator's business to be silent as to speak, and I remember, <lb/>
            in some criminal cases, to have done even more service to <lb/>
            my clients by a discreet silence than I could have expected <lb/>
            from the most carefully prepared speech. To enter into <lb/>
            the subject of eloquence is indeed very foreign to the pur- <note type="footnote"> 2 Trajan. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 One of the Bithynians employed to manage the trial. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            pose of my letter, yet allow me to give you one instance <lb/>
            in proof of my last observation. A certain lady having <lb/>
            lost her son suspected that his freedmen, whom he had <lb/>
            appointed coheirs with her, were guilty of forging the will <lb/>
            and poisoning him. Accordingly she charged them with the <lb/>
            fact before the emperor, who directed Julianus Suburanus <lb/>
            to try the cause. I was counsel for the defendants, and the <lb/>
            case being exceedingly remarkable, and the counsel en­ <lb/>
            gaged on both sides of eminent ability, it drew together <lb/>
            a very numerous audience. The issue was, the servants <lb/>
            being put to the torture, my clients were acquitted. But <lb/>
            the mother applied a second time to the emperor, pretend­ <lb/>
            ing she had discovered some new evidence. Suburanus was <lb/>
            therefore directed to hear the cause, and see if she could <lb/>
            produce any fresh proofs. Julius Africanus was counsel <lb/>
            for the mother, a young man of good parts, but slender <lb/>
            experience. He is grandson to the famous orator of that <lb/>
            name, of whom it is reported that Passienus Crispus, <lb/>
            hearing him one day plead, archly said, " Very fine, I must <lb/>
            confess, very fine; but is all this fine speaking to the <lb/>
            purpose?" Julius Africanus, I say, having made a long <lb/>
            harangue, and exhausted the portion of time allotted to <lb/>
            him, said, " I beg you, Suburanus, to allow me to add one <lb/>
            word more." When he had concluded, and the eyes of the <lb/>
            whole assembly had been fixed a considerable time upon <lb/>
            me, I rose up. " I would have answered Africanus," said I, <lb/>
            "if he had added that one word he begged leave to do, in <lb/>
            which I doubt not he would have told us all that we had <lb/>
            not heard before." I do not remember to have gained so <lb/>
            much applause by any speech that I ever made as I did in <lb/>
            this instance by making none. Thus the little that I had <lb/>
            hitherto said for Varenus was received with the same gen­ <lb/>
            eral approbation. The consuls, agreeably to the request of <lb/>
            Polyaenus, reserved the whole affair for the determination <lb/>
            of the emperor, whose resolution I impatiently wait for; as <lb/>
            that will decide whether I may be entirely secure and easy <lb/>
            with respect to Varenus, or must again renew all my trouble <lb/>
            and anxiety upon his account. Farewell.</p><pb n="316"/>

          <p>You desire my opinion as to the method of study you <lb/>
            should pursue, in that retirement to which you have long <lb/>
            since withdrawn. In the first place, then, I look upon it <lb/>
            as a very advantageous practice (and it is what many rec­ <lb/>
            ommend) to translate either from Greek into Latin or <lb/>
            from Latin into Greek. By this means you acquire pro­ <lb/>
            priety and dignity of expression, and a variety of beautiful <lb/>
            figures, and an ease and strength of exposition, and in the <lb/>
            imitation of the best models a facility of creating such <lb/>
            models for yourself. Besides, those things which you may <lb/>
            possibly have overlooked in an ordinary reading over can­ <lb/>
            not escape you in translating: and this method will also en­ <lb/>
            large your knowledge, and improve your judgment. It may <lb/>
            not be amiss, after you have read an author, to turn, as it <lb/>
            were, to his rival, and attempt something of your own upon <lb/>
            the same topic, and then make a careful comparison between <lb/>
            your performance and his, in order to see in what points <lb/>
            either you or he may be the happier. You may congratulate <lb/>
            yourself indeed if you shall find in some things that you have <lb/>
            the advantage of him, while it will be a great mortification <lb/>
            if he is always superior. You may sometimes select very <lb/>
            famous passages and compete with what you select. The <lb/>
            competition is daring enough, but, as it is private, cannot be <lb/>
            called impudent. Not but that we have seen instances of <lb/>
            persons who have publicly entered this sort of lists with <lb/>
            great credit to themselves, and, while they did not despair of <lb/>
            overtaking, have gloriously outstripped those whom they <lb/>
            thought it sufficient honour to follow. A speech no longer <lb/>
            fresh in your memory, you may take up again. You will <lb/>
            find plenty in it to leave unaltered, but still more to reject; <lb/>
            you will add a new thought here, and alter another there. <lb/>
            It is a laborious and tedious task, I own, thus to re-enflame <lb/>
            the mind after the first heat is over, to recover an impulse <lb/>
            when its force has been checked and spent, and, worse than <lb/>
            all, to put new limbs into a body already complete without <lb/>
            disturbing the old; but the advantage attending this method <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            will overbalance the difficulty. I know the bent of your <lb/>
            present attention is directed towards the eloquence of the <lb/>
            bar; but I would not for that reason advise you never to <lb/>
            quit the polemic, if I may so call it, and contentious style. <lb/>
            As land is improved by sowing it with various seeds, con­ <lb/>
            stantly changed, so is the mind by exercising it now with <lb/>
            this subject of study, now with that. I would recommend <lb/>
            you, therefore, sometimes to take a subject from history, and <lb/>
            you might give more care to the composition of your letters. <lb/>
            For it frequently happens that in pleading one has occasion <lb/>
            to make use not only of historical, but even poetical, styles <lb/>
            of description; and then from letters you acquire a concise <lb/>
            and simple mode of expression. You will do quite right <lb/>
            again in refreshing yourself with poetry: when I say so, I <lb/>
            do not mean that species of poetry which turns upon subjects <lb/>
            of great length and continuity (such being suitable only for <lb/>
            persons of leisure), but those little pieces of the sprightly <lb/>
            kind of poesy, which serve as proper reliefs to, and are con­ <lb/>
            sistent with, employments of every sort. They commonly <lb/>
            go under the title of poetical amusements; but these amuse­ <lb/>
            ments have sometimes gained their authors as much repu­ <lb/>
            tation as works of a more serious nature; and thus (for <lb/>
            while I am exhorting you to poetry, why should I not turn <lb/>
            poet myself?) <lb/>
            "As yielding wax the artist's skill commands, <lb/>
            Submissive shap'd beneath his forming hands; <lb/>
            Now dreadful stands in arms a Mars contest; <lb/>
            Or now with Venus's softer air imprest; <lb/>
            A wanton Cupid now the mould belies; <lb/>
            Now shines, severely chaste, a Pallas wife: <lb/>
            As not alone to quench the raging flame, <lb/>
            The sacred fountain pours her friendly stream; <lb/>
            But sweetly gliding through the flow'ry green, <lb/>
            Spreads glad refreshment o'er the smiling scene: <lb/>
            So, form'd by science, should the ductile mind <lb/>
            Receive, distinct, each various art refin'd." <lb/>
            In this manner the greatest men, as well as the greatest <lb/>
            orators, used either to exercise or amuse themselves, or <lb/>
            rather indeed did both. It is surprising how much the <lb/>
            mind is enlivened and refreshed by these little poetical <lb/>
            compositions, as they turn upon love, hatred, satire, tender­ <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            ness, politeness, and everything, in short, that concerns life <lb/>
            and the affairs of the world. Besides, the same advantage <lb/>
            attends these, as every other sort of poems, that we turn <lb/>
            from them to prose with so muck the more pleasure after <lb/>
            having experienced the difficulty of being constrained and <lb/>
            fettered by metre. And now, perhaps, I have troubled you <lb/>
            upon this subject longer than you desired; however, there <lb/>
            is one thing I have left out: I have not told you what kind <lb/>
            of authors you should read; though indeed that was suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently implied when I told you on what you should write. <lb/>
            Remember to be careful in your choice of authors of every <lb/>
            kind: for, as it has been well observed, " though we should <lb/>
            read much, we should not read many books." Who those <lb/>
            authors are, is so clearly settled, and so generally known, <lb/>
            that I need not particularly specify them; besides, I have <lb/>
            already extended this letter to such an immoderate length <lb/>
            that, while suggesting how you ought to study, I have, I <lb/>

            highest esteem for Corellia, both as the sister of Rufus, <lb/>
            whose memory will always be a sacred one to me, and as <lb/>
            my mother's intimate friend. Besides, that excellent man <lb/>
            Minutius Tuscus, her husband, has every claim to my affec­ <lb/>
            tion that a long friendship can give him; as there was like­ <lb/>
            wise the closest intimacy between her son and me, so much <lb/>
            so indeed that I fixed upon him to preside at the games <lb/>
            which I exhibited when I was elected praetor. This lady, <lb/>
            when I was last in the country, expressed a strong desire for <lb/>
            some place upon the borders of our lake of Comum; I <lb/>
            therefore made her an offer, at her own price, of any part <lb/>
            of my land there, except what came to me from my father <lb/>
            and mother; for that I could not consent to part with, even <lb/>
            to Corellia, and accordingly when the inheritance in question <lb/>
            fell to me, I wrote to let her know it was to be sold. This <lb/>
            letter I sent by Hermes, who, upon her requesting him that <lb/>
            he would immediately make over to her my proportion of it, <lb/>
            consented. Am I not then obliged to confirm what my freed­ <lb/>
            man has thus done in pursuance of my inclinations ? I have <lb/>
            only to entreat my fellow-coheirs that they will not take it <lb/>
            ill at my hands that I have made a separate sale of what I <lb/>
            had certainly a right to dispose of. They are not bound in <lb/>
            any way to follow my example, since they have not the same <lb/>
            connections with Corellia. They are at full liberty therefore <lb/>
            to be guided by interest, which in my own case I chose to <lb/>
            sacrifice to friendship. Farewell.</p>

          <p>You are truly generous to desire and insist that I take <lb/>
            for my share of the estate you purchased of me, not after <lb/>
            the rate of seven hundred thousand sesterces for the whole, <lb/>
            as my freedman sold it to you; but in the proportion of nine <lb/>

            insist in my turn that you would consider not only what is <lb/>
            suitable to your character, but what is worthy of mine; and <lb/>
            that you would suffer me to oppose your inclination in this <lb/>

          <p>EVERY author has his particular reasons for reciting his <lb/>
            works; mine, I have often said, are, in order, if any error <lb/>
            should have escaped my own observation (as no doubt they <lb/>
            do escape it sometimes), to have it pointed out to me. I <lb/>
            cannot therefore but be surprised to find (what your letter <lb/>
            assures me) that there are some who blame me for reciting <lb/>
            my speeches: unless, perhaps, they are of opinion that this <lb/>
            is the single species of composition that ought to be held <lb/>
            exempt from any correction. If so, I would willingly ask <lb/>
            them why they allow (if indeed they do allow) that his­ <lb/>
            tory may be recited, since it is a work which ought to be <lb/>
            devoted to truth, not ostentation? or why tragedy, as it is <lb/>
            composed for action and the stage, not for being read to a <lb/>
            private audience? or lyric poetry, as it is not a reader, <lb/>
            but a chorus of voices and instruments that it requires? <lb/>
            They will reply, perhaps, that in the instances referred to <lb/>
            custom has made the practice in question usual: I should <lb/>
            be glad to know, then, if they think the person who first <lb/>
            introduced this practice is to be condemned? Besides the <lb/>
            rehearsal of speeches is no unprecedented thing either with <lb/>
            us or the Grecians. Still, perhaps, they will insist that it <lb/>
            can answer no purpose to recite a speech which has already <lb/>
            been delivered. True; if one were immediately to repeat <lb/>
            the very same speech word for word, and to the very same <lb/>
            audience; but if you make several additions and altera­ <lb/>
            tions; if your audience is composed partly of the same, <lb/>
            and partly of different persons, and the recital is at some <lb/>
            distance of time, why is there less propriety in rehearsing <lb/>
            your speech than in publishing it? " But it is difficult," <lb/>
            the objectors urge, " to give satisfaction to an audience by <lb/>
            the mere recital of a speech"; that is a consideration which <lb/>
            concerns the particular skill and pains of the person who <lb/>
            rehearses, but by no means holds good against recitation in <lb/>
            general. The truth is, it is not whilst I am reading, but <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            when I am read, that I aim at approbation; and upon this <lb/>
            principle I omit no sort of correction. In the first place, I <lb/>
            frequently go carefully over what I have written, by my­ <lb/>
            self, after this I read it out to two or three friends, and <lb/>
            then give it to others to make their remarks. If after <lb/>
            this I have any doubt concerning the justness of their <lb/>
            observations, I carefully weigh them again with a friend <lb/>
            or two; and, last of all, I recite them to a larger audience, <lb/>
            then is the time, believe me, when I correct most ener­ <lb/>
            getically and unsparingly; for my care and attention rise <lb/>
            in proportion to my anxiety; as nothing renders the judg­ <lb/>
            ment so acute to detect error as that deference, modesty, <lb/>
            and diffidence one feels upon those occasions. For tell me, <lb/>
            would you not be infinitely less affected were you to speak <lb/>
            before a single person only, though ever so learned, than <lb/>
            before a numerous assembly, even though composed of <lb/>
            none but illiterate people? When you rise up to plead, <lb/>
            are you not at that juncture, above all others, most self­ <lb/>
            distrustful? and do you not wish, I will not say some par­ <lb/>
            ticular parts only, but that the whole arrangement of your <lb/>
            intended speech were altered? especially if the concourse <lb/>
            should be large in which you are to speak? for there is <lb/>
            something even in a low and vulgar audience that strikes <lb/>
            one with awe. And if you suspect you are not well re­ <lb/>
            ceived at the first opening of your speech, do you not find <lb/>
            all your energy relaxed, and feel yourself ready to give <lb/>
            way? The reason I imagine to be that there is a certain <lb/>
            weight of collective opinion in a multitude, and although <lb/>
            each individual judgment is, perhaps, of little value, yet <lb/>
            when united it becomes considerable. Accordingly, Pom­ <lb/>
            ponius Secundus, the famous tragic poet, whenever some <lb/>
            very intimate friend and he differed about the retaining or <lb/>
            rejecting anything in his writings, used to say, " I appeal to <lb/>
            the people "; and thus, by their silence or applause, adopted <lb/>
            either his own or his friend's opinion; such was the defer­ <lb/>
            ence he paid to the popular judgment! Whether justly <note type="footnote"> 1 There is a kind of witticism in this expression, which will be lost to <lb/>
            the mere English reader, unless he be informed that the Romans had a <lb/>
            privilege, confirmed to them by several laws which passed in the earlier <lb/>
            ages of the republic, of appealing from the decisions of the magistrates to <lb/>
            the General assembly of the people: and they did so in the form of words <lb/>
            which Pomponius here applies to a different purpose. M. </note> <note type="footnote"> 11—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <lb/>

            or not, is no concern of mine, as I am not in the habit of <lb/>
            reciting my works publicly, but only to a select circle, <lb/>
            whose presence I respect, and whose judgment I value; in <lb/>
            a word, whose opinions I attend to as if they were so many <lb/>
            individuals I had separately consulted, at the same time <lb/>
            that I stand in as much awe before them as I should before <lb/>
            the most numerous assembly. What Cicero says of com­ <lb/>
            posing will, in my opinion, hold true of the dread we have <lb/>
            of the public: " Fear is the most rigid critic imaginable." <lb/>
            The very thought of reciting, the very entrance into an <lb/>
            assembly, and the agitated concern when one is there; each <lb/>
            of these circumstances tends to improve and perfect an <lb/>
            author's performance. Upon the whole, therefore, I cannot <lb/>
            repent of a practice which I have found by experience so <lb/>
            exceedingly useful; and am so far from being discouraged <lb/>
            by the trifling objections of these censors that I request <lb/>
            you would point out to me if there is yet any other kind of <lb/>
            correction, that I may also adopt it; for nothing can suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently satisfy my anxiety to render my compositions <lb/>
            perfect. I reflect what an undertaking it is resigning any <lb/>
            work into the hands of the public; and I cannot but be <lb/>
            persuaded that frequent revisals, and many consultations, <lb/>
            must go to the perfecting of a performance, which one <lb/>
            desires should universally and forever please. Farewell.</p>

          <p>THE illness of my friend Fannia gives me great concern. <lb/>
            She contracted it during her attendance on Junia, one <lb/>
            of the Vestal virgins, engaging in this good office at first <lb/>
            voluntarily, Junia being her relation, and afterwards being <lb/>
            appointed to it by an order from the college of priests: <lb/>
            for these virgins, when excessive ill-health renders it neces­ <lb/>
            sary to remove them from the temple of Vesta, are always <lb/>
            delivered over to the care and custody of some venerable <lb/>
            matron. It was owing to her assiduity in the execution of <lb/>
            this charge that she contracted her present dangerous dis­ <lb/>
            order, which is a continual fever, attended with a cough <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            that increases daily. She is extremely emaciated, and every <lb/>
            part of her seems in a total decay except her spirits: those, <lb/>
            indeed, she fully keeps up; and in a way altogether worthy <lb/>
            the wife of Helvidius, and the daughter of Thrasea. In all <lb/>
            other respects there is such a falling away that I am more <lb/>
            than apprehensive upon her account; I am deeply afflicted. <lb/>
            I grieve, my friend, that so excellent a woman is going to <lb/>
            be removed from the eyes of the world, which will never, <lb/>
            perhaps, again behold her equal. So pure she is, so pious, <lb/>
            so wise and prudent, so brave and steadfast! Twice she <lb/>
            followed her husband into exile, and the third time she was <lb/>
            banished herself upon his account. For Senecio, when ar­ <lb/>
            raigned for writing the life of Helvidius, having said in <lb/>
            his defence that he composed that work at the request of <lb/>
            Fannia, Metius Carus, with a stern and threatening air, <lb/>
            asked her whether she had made that request, and she re­ <lb/>
            plied, " I made it." Did she supply him likewise with ma­ <lb/>
            terials for the purpose? "I did." Was her mother privy to <lb/>
            this transaction ? " She was not." In short, throughout her <lb/>
            whole examination, not a word escaped her which betrayed <lb/>
            the smallest fear. On the contrary, she had preserved a <lb/>
            copy of those very books which the senate, over-awed by <lb/>
            the tyranny of the times, had ordered to be suppressed, and <lb/>
            at the same time the effects of the author to be confiscated, <lb/>
            and carried with her into exile the very cause of her exile. <lb/>
            How pleasing she is, how courteous, and (what is granted <lb/>
            to few) no less lovable than worthy of all esteem and <lb/>
            admiration! Will she hereafter be pointed out as a model <lb/>
            to all wives; and perhaps be esteemed worthy of being set <lb/>
            forth as an example of fortitude even to our sex; since, <lb/>
            while we still have the pleasure of seeing and conversing <lb/>
            with her, we contemplate her with the same admiration, as <lb/>
            those heroines who are celebrated in ancient story? For <lb/>
            myself, I confess, I cannot but tremble for this illustrious <lb/>
            house, which seems shaken to its very foundations, and ready <lb/>
            to fall; for though she will leave descendants behind her, <lb/>
            yet what a height of virtue must they attain, what glorious <lb/>
            deeds must they perform, ere the world will be persuaded <lb/>
            that she was not the last of her family! It is an additional <lb/>
            affliction and anguish to me that by her death I seem to <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            lose her mother a second time; that worthy mother ( and <lb/>
            what can I say higher in her praise?) of so noble a woman! <lb/>
            who, as she was restored to me in her daughter, so she <lb/>
            will now again be taken from me, and the loss of Fannia <lb/>
            will thus pierce my heart at once with a fresh, and at the <lb/>
            same -time re-opened, wound. I so truly loved and honoured <lb/>
            them both, that I know not which I loved the best; a point <lb/>
            they desired might ever remain undetermined. In their <lb/>
            prosperity and their adversity I did them every kindness in <lb/>
            my power, and was their comforter in exile, as well as their <lb/>
            avenger at their return. But I have not yet paid them what <lb/>
            I owe, and am so much the more solicitous for the recovery <lb/>
            of this lady, that I may have time to discharge my debt to <lb/>
            her. Such is the anxiety and sorrow under which I write <lb/>
            this letter! But if some divine power should happily turn <lb/>
            it into joy, I shall not complain of the alarms I now suffer. <lb/>

          <p>NUMIDIA QUADRATILLA is dead, having almost reached her <lb/>
            eightieth year. She enjoyed, up to her last illness, unin­ <lb/>
            terrupted good health, and was unusually stout and robust <lb/>
            for one of her sex. She has left a very prudent will, having <lb/>
            disposed of two-thirds of her estate to her grandson, and <lb/>
            the rest to her grand-daughter. The young lady I know <lb/>
            very slightly, but the grandson is one of my most intimate <lb/>
            friends. He is a remarkable young man, and his merit en­ <lb/>
            titles him to the affection of a relation, even where his blood <lb/>
            does not. Notwithstanding his remarkable personal beauty, <lb/>
            he escaped every malicious imputation both whilst a boy <lb/>
            and when a youth: he was a husband at four-and-twenty, <lb/>
            and would have been a father if Providence had not disap­ <lb/>
            pointed his hopes. He lived in the family with his grand­ <lb/>
            mother, who was exceedingly devoted to the pleasures of the <lb/>
            town, yet observed great severity of conduct himself, while <lb/>
            always perfectly deferential and submissive to her. She re­ <lb/>
            tained a set of pantomimes, and was an encourager of this <lb/>
            class of people to a degree inconsistent with one of her sex <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            and rank. But Quadratus never appeared at these enter­ <lb/>
            tainments, whether she exhibited them in the theatre or in <lb/>
            her own house; nor indeed did she require him to be present. <lb/>
            I once heard her say, when she was recommending to me <lb/>
            the supervision of her grandson's studies, that it was her <lb/>
            custom, in order to pass away some of those unemployed <lb/>
            hours with which female life abounds, to amuse herself with <lb/>
            playing at chess, or seeing the mimicry of her pantomimes; <lb/>
            but that, whenever she engaged in either of those amuse­ <lb/>
            ments, she constantly sent away her grandson to his studies: <lb/>
            she appeared to me to act thus as much out of reverence <lb/>
            for the youth as from affection. I was a good deal sur­ <lb/>
            prised, as I am sure you will be too, at what he told me <lb/>
            the last time the Pontifical games1 were exhibited. As <lb/>
            we were coming out of the theatre together, where we <lb/>
            had been entertained with a show of these. pantomimes, <lb/>
            " Do you know," said he, " to-day is the first time I ever saw <lb/>
            my grandmother's freedman dance ? " Such was the grand­ <lb/>
            son's speech! while a set of men of a far different stamp, in <lb/>
            order to do honour to Quadratilla (am ashamed to call it <lb/>
            honour), were running up and down the theatre, pretend­ <lb/>
            ing to be struck with the utmost admiration and rapture <lb/>
            at the performances of those pantomimes, and then imi­ <lb/>
            tating in musical chant the mien and manner of their lady <lb/>
            patroness. But now all the reward they have got, in return <lb/>
            for their theatrical performances, is just a few trivial <lb/>
            legacies, which they have the mortification to receive from <lb/>
            an heir who was never so much as present at these shows.- <lb/>
            I send you this account, knowing you do not dislike hearing <lb/>

            honour done therein to that excellent youth her grandson, <lb/>
            has afforded me a very sensible satisfaction; as I extremely <lb/>

          <p>THE lingering disorder of a friend of mine gave me <lb/>
            occasion lately to reflect that we are never so good as when <lb/>
            oppressed with illness. Where is the sick man who is either <lb/>
            solicited by avarice or inflamed with lust? At such a season <lb/>
            he is neither a slave of love nor the fool of ambition; wealth <lb/>
            he utterly disregards, and is content with ever so small a <lb/>
            portion of it, as being upon the point of leaving even that <lb/>
            little. It is then he recollects there are gods, and that he <lb/>
            himself is but a man: no mortal is then the object of his <lb/>
            envy, his admiration, or his contempt; and the tales of <lb/>
            slander neither raise his attention nor feed his curiosity: his <lb/>
            dreams are only of baths and fountains. These are the su­ <lb/>
            preme objects of his cares and wishes, while he resolves, <lb/>
            if he should recover, to pass the remainder of his days in <lb/>
            ease and tranquillity, that is, to live innocently and happily. <lb/>
            I may therefore lay down to you and myself a short rule, <lb/>
            which the philosophers have endeavoured to inculcate at the <lb/>
            expense of many words, and even many volumes; that " we <lb/>
            should try and realise in health those resolutions we form in <lb/>
            sickness." Farewell.</p>

          <p>THE present recess from business we are now enjoying <lb/>
            affords you leisure to give, and me to receive, instruction. <lb/>
            I am extremely desirous therefore to know whether you <lb/>
            believe in the existence of ghosts, and that they have a <lb/>
            real form, and are a sort of divinities, or only the visionary <lb/>
            impressions of a terrified imagination. What particularly <lb/>
            inclines me to believe in their existence is a story which <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            I heard of Curtius Rufus. When he was in low circum­ <lb/>
            stances and unknown in the world, he attended the governor <lb/>
            of Africa into that province. One evening, as he was walk­ <lb/>
            ing in the public portico, there appeared to him the figure <lb/>
            of a woman, of unusual size and of beauty more than human. <lb/>
            And as he stood there, terrified and astonished, she told him <lb/>
            she was the tutelary power that presided over Africa, and <lb/>
            was come to inform him of the future events of his life: <lb/>
            that he should go back to Rome, to enjoy high honours <lb/>
            there, and return to that province invested with the pro­ <lb/>
            consular dignity, and there should die. Every circumstance <lb/>
            of this prediction actually came to pass. It is said farther <lb/>
            that upon his arrival at Carthage, as he was coming out of <lb/>
            the ship, the same figure met him upon the shore. It is <lb/>
            certain, at least, that being seized with a fit of illness, though <lb/>
            there were no symptoms in his case that led those about him <lb/>
            to despair, he instantly gave up all hope of recovery; judg­ <lb/>
            ing, apparently, of the truth of the future part of the pre­ <lb/>
            diction by what had already been fulfilled, and of the <lb/>
            approaching misfortune from his former prosperity. Now <lb/>
            the following story, which I am going to tell you just as I <lb/>
            heard it, is it not more terrible than the former, while quite <lb/>
            as wonderful? There was at Athens a large and roomy <lb/>
            house, which had a bad name, so that no one could live <lb/>
            there. In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the <lb/>
            clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened <lb/>
            more attentively, sounded like the rattling of chains, distant <lb/>
            at first, but approaching nearer by degrees: immediately af­ <lb/>
            terwards a spectre appeared in the form of an old man, of <lb/>
            extremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long <lb/>
            beard and dishevelled hair, rattling the chains on his feet <lb/>
            and hands. The distressed occupants meanwhile passed <lb/>
            their wakeful nights under the most dreadful terrors imag­ <lb/>
            inable. This, as it broke their rest, ruined their health, and <lb/>
            brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them, and <lb/>
            death ensued. Even in the day time, though the spirit did <lb/>
            not appear, yet the impression remained so strong upon their <lb/>
            imaginations that it still seemed before their eyes, and kept <lb/>
            them in perpetual alarm. Consequently the house was at <lb/>
            length deserted, as being deemed absolutely uninhabitable; <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost. How­ <lb/>
            ever, in hopes that some tenant might be found who was <lb/>
            ignorant of this very alarming circumstance, a bill was put <lb/>
            up, giving notice that it was either to be let or sold. It <lb/>
            happened that Athenodorus1 the philosopher came to Athens <lb/>
            at this time, and, reading the bill, enquired the price. The <lb/>
            extraordinary cheapness raised his suspicion; nevertheless, <lb/>
            when he heard the whole story, he was so far from being <lb/>
            discouraged that he was more strongly inclined to hire it, <lb/>
            and, in short, actually did so. When it grew towards even­ <lb/>
            ing, he ordered a couch to be prepared for him in the front <lb/>
            part of the house, and, after calling for a light, together <lb/>
            with his pencil and tablets, directed all his people to retire. <lb/>
            But that his mind might not, for want of employment, be <lb/>
            open to the vain terrors of imaginary noises and spirits, he <lb/>
            applied himself to writing with the utmost attention. The <lb/>
            first part of the night passed in entire silence, as usual; at <lb/>
            length a clanking of iron and rattling of chains was heard: <lb/>
            however, he neither lifted up his eyes nor laid down his <lb/>
            pen, but in order to keep calm and collected tried to pass the <lb/>
            sounds off to himself as something else. The noise in­ <lb/>
            creased and advanced nearer, till it seemed at the door, and <lb/>
            at last in the chamber. He looked up, saw, and recognized <lb/>
            the ghost exactly as it had been described to him: it stood <lb/>
            before him, beckoning with the finger, like a person who <lb/>
            calls another. Athenodorus in reply made a sign with his <lb/>
            hand that it should wait a little, and threw his eyes again <lb/>
            upon his papers; the ghost then rattled its chains over the <lb/>
            bead of the philosopher, who looked up upon this, and seeing <lb/>
            it beckoning as before, immediately arose, and, light in <lb/>
            hand, followed it. The ghost slowly stalked along, as if <lb/>
            encumbered with its chains, and, turning into the area of <lb/>
            the house, suddenly vanished. Athenodorus, being thus <lb/>
            deserted, made a mark with some grass and leaves on the <lb/>
            spot where the spirit left him. The next day he gave in­ <lb/>
            formation to the magistrates, and advised them to order <lb/>
            that spot to be dug up. This was accordingly done, and <lb/>
            the skeleton of a man in chains was found there; for the <note type="footnote"> 1 A Stoic philosopher and native of Tarsus. He was tutor for some time <lb/>

            body, having lain a considerable time in the ground, was <lb/>
            putrefied and mouldered away from the fetters. The bones <lb/>
            being collected together were publicly buried, and thus after <lb/>
            the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies, the house <lb/>
            was haunted no more. This story I believe upon the credit <lb/>
            of others; what I am going to mention, I give you upon <lb/>
            my own. I have a freedman named Marcus, who is by no <lb/>
            means illiterate. One night, as he and his younger brother <lb/>
            were lying together, he fancied he saw somebody upon his <lb/>
            bed, who took out a pair of scissors, and cut off the hair <lb/>
            from the top part of his own head, and in the morning, it <lb/>
            appeared his hair was actually cut, and the clippings lay <lb/>
            scattered about the floor. A short time after this, an event <lb/>
            of a similar nature contributed to give credit to the former <lb/>
            story. A young lad of my family was sleeping in his apart­ <lb/>
            ment with the rest of his companions, when two persons <lb/>
            clad in white came in, as he says, through the windows, cut <lb/>
            off his hair as he lay, and then returned the same way they <lb/>
            entered. The next morning it was found that this boy had <lb/>
            been served just as the other, and there was the hair again, <lb/>
            spread about the room. Nothing remarkable indeed fol­ <lb/>
            lowed these events, unless perhaps that I escaped a pro­ <lb/>
            secution, in which, if Domitian (during whose reign this <lb/>
            happened) had lived some time longer, I should certainly <lb/>
            have been involved. For after the death of that emperor, <lb/>
            articles of impeachment against me were found in his <lb/>
            scrutore, which had been exhibited by Carus. It may there­ <lb/>
            fore be conjectured, since it is customary for persons under <lb/>
            any public accusation to let their hair grow, this cutting off <lb/>
            the hair of my servants was a sign I should escape the im­ <lb/>
            minent danger that threatened me. Let me desire you then <lb/>
            to give this question your mature consideration. The sub­ <lb/>
            ject deserves your examination; as, I trust, I am not myself <lb/>
            altogether unworthy a participation in the abundance of <lb/>
            your superior knowledge. And though you should, as usual, <lb/>
            balance between two opinions, yet I hope you will lean more <lb/>
            on one side than on the other, lest, whilst I consult you in <lb/>
            order to have my doubt settled, you should dismiss me in the <lb/>
            same suspense and indecision that occasioned you the present <lb/>
            application. Farewell.</p><pb n="330"/>

          <p>You tell me certain persons have blamed me in your com­ <lb/>

            that your histories will be immortal. I frankly own there­ <lb/>
            fore I so much the more earnestly wish to find a place in <lb/>

            may be celebrated by an author of your distinguished abili­ <lb/>

            ter, which, though it cannot have escaped your notice, as it <lb/>
            is mentioned in the public journals, still I call your atten­ <lb/>
            tion to, that you may the more readily believe how agreeable <lb/>
            it will be to me that this action, greatly heightened by the <lb/>
            risk which attended it, should receive additional lustre from <lb/>
            the testimony of a man of your powers. The senate ap­ <lb/>

            ince of Baetica, in their impeachment of Boebius Massa. He <lb/>
            was condemned, and the house ordered his effects to be <lb/>
            seized into the hands of the public officer. Shortly after, <lb/>
            Senecio, having learnt that the consuls intended to sit to <lb/>
            hear petitions, came and said to me, "Let us go together, and <lb/>
            petition them with the same unanimity in which we executed <lb/>
            the office which had been enjoined us, not to suffer Massa's <lb/>
            effects to be dissipated by those who were appointed to pre­ <lb/>
            serve them." I answered, As we were counsel in this <lb/>
            affair by order of the senate, I recommend it to your consid­ <lb/>
            eration whether it would be proper for us, after sentence <lb/>
            passed, to interpose any farther." "You are at liberty," said <lb/>
            he, "to prescribe what bounds you please to yourself, who <lb/>
            have no particular connections with the province, except what <lb/>
            arise from your late services to them; but then I was born <lb/>
            there, and enjoyed the post of quaestor among them." "If <lb/>
            such," I replied, "is your determined resolution, I am ready <lb/>
            to accompany you, that whatever resentment may be the <lb/>
            consequence of this affair, it may not fall singly upon your­ <lb/>
            self." We accordingly proceeded to the consuls, where <lb/>
            Senecio said what was pertinent to the affair, and I added <lb/>
            a few words to the same effect. Scarcely had we ended when <lb/>
            Massa, complaining that Senecio had not acted against him <lb/>
            with the fidelity of an advocate, but the bitterness of an <lb/>
            enemy, desired he might be at liberty to prosecute him for <lb/>
            treason. This occasioned general consternation. Whereupon <lb/>
            I rose up; "Most noble consuls," said I, "I am afraid it <lb/>
            should seem that Massa has tacitly charged me with having <lb/>
            favoured him in this cause, since he did not think proper <lb/>
            to join me with Senecio in the desired prosecution." This <lb/>
            short speech was immediately received with applause, and <lb/>
            afterwards got much talked about everywhere. The late <lb/>
            emperor Nerva (who, though at that time in a private sta­ <lb/>
            tion, yet interested himself in every meritorious action per­ <lb/>
            formed in public) wrote a most impressive letter to me upon <lb/>
            the occasion, in which he not only congratulated me, but the <lb/>
            age which had produced an example so much in the spirit <lb/>
            (as he was pleased to call it) of the good old days. But, <lb/>
            whatever be the actual fact, it lies in your power to raise it <lb/>
            into a grander and more conspicuously illustrious position, <lb/>

            though I am far from desiring you in the least to exceed the <lb/>

            would have been much the easiest, though not so equitable a <lb/>

            And if every deviation from rectitude is equally criminal,1 <lb/>
            every approach to it must be equally praiseworthy. So ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly I remitted to all in general one-eighth part of the <lb/>

            turned (over and above that which I may call the general <lb/>
            and common eighth) a tenth part of what they had paid be­ <lb/>
            yond that sum. I fear I do not express myself sufficiently <lb/>
            clearly; I will endeavour to explain my meaning more fully: <lb/>
            for instance, suppose a man had purchased of me to the <lb/>
            value of fifteen thousand sesterces,8 I remitted to him one- <lb/>
            eighth part of that whole sum, and likewise one-tenth of five <lb/>
            thousand.' Besides this, as several had deposited, in different <lb/>
            proportions, part of the price they had agreed to pay, whilst <lb/>
            others had advanced nothing, I thought it would not be at <lb/>
            all fair that all these should be favoured with the same un­ <lb/>
            distinguished remission. To those, therefore, who had made <lb/>
            any payments, I returned a tenth part upon the sums so paid. <lb/>
            By this means I made a proper acknowledgment to each, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to their respective deserts, and likewise encouraged <lb/>
            them, not only to deal with me for the future, but to be <lb/>
            prompt in their payments. This instance of my good-nature <lb/>
            or my judgment (call it which you please) was a consider­ <lb/>
            able expense to me. However, I found my account in it; for <lb/>
            all the country greatly approved both of the novelty of these <lb/>
            abatements and the manner in which I regulated them. Even <lb/>
            those whom I did not "mete" (as they say) " by the same <lb/>
            measure," but distinguished according to their several de­ <lb/>
            grees, thought themselves obliged to me, in proportion to the <note type="footnote"> 1 It was a doctrine maintained by the Stoics that all crimes are equal At. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 About $400.</note> <note type="footnote">3 About $600.</note> <note type="footnote">4 About $9.3. </note> <lb/>

          <p>HAVE you ever seen the source of the river Clitumnus? <lb/>
            If you have not (and I hardly think you can have seen it <lb/>
            yet, or you would have told me), go there as soon as pos­ <lb/>
            sible. I saw it yesterday, and I blame myself for not having <lb/>
            seen it sooner. At the foot of a little hill, well wooded with <lb/>
            old cypress trees, a spring gushes out, which, breaking up <lb/>
            into different and unequal streams, forms itself, after several <lb/>
            windings, into a large, broad basin of water, so transparently <lb/>
            clear that you may count the shining pebbles, and the <lb/>
            little pieces of money thrown into it, as they lie at the <lb/>
            bottom. From thence it is carried off not so much by the <lb/>
            declivity of the ground as by its own weight and exuber­ <lb/>
            ance. A mere stream at its source, immediately, on quitting <lb/>
            this, you find it expanded into a broad river, fit for large <lb/>
            vessels even, allowing a free passage by each other, accord­ <lb/>
            ing as they sail with or against the stream. The current <lb/>
            runs so strong, though the ground is level, that the large <lb/>
            barges going down the river have no occasion to make use <lb/>
            of their oars; while those going up find it difficult to make <lb/>
            headway even with the assistance of oars and poles: and <lb/>
            this alternate interchange of ease and toil, according as you <lb/>
            turn, is exceedingly amusing when one sails up and down <lb/>
            merely for pleasure. The banks are well covered with ash <lb/>
            and poplar, the shape and colour of the trees being as clearly <lb/>
            and distinctly reflected in the stream as if they were actually <lb/>
            sunk in it. The water is cold as snow, and as white too. <lb/>
            Near it stands an ancient and venerable temple, in which is <lb/>
            placed the river-god Clitumnus clothed in the usual robe <lb/>
            of state; and indeed the prophetic oracles here delivered suffi­ <lb/>
            ciently testify the immediate presence of that divinity. Sev­ <lb/>
            eral little chapels are scattered round, dedicated to particular <note type="footnote"> 5 Horn. Il. lib. ix. v. 319-</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            gods, distinguished each by his own peculiar name and form <lb/>
            of worship, and some of them, too, presiding over different <lb/>
            fountains. For, besides the principal spring, which is, as <lb/>
            it were, the parent of all the rest, there are several other <lb/>
            lesser streams, which, taking their rise from various sources, <lb/>
            lose themselves in the river; over which a bridge is built <lb/>
            that separates the sacred part from that which lies open to <lb/>
            common use. Vessels are allowed to come above this bridge, <lb/>
            but no person is permitted to swim except below it. The <lb/>
            Hispellates, to whom Augustus gave this place, furnish a <lb/>
            public bath, and likewise entertain all strangers, at their own <lb/>
            expense. Several villas, attracted by the beauty of this <lb/>
            river, stand about on its borders. In short, every surround­ <lb/>
            ing object will afford you entertainment. You may also <lb/>
            amuse yourself with numberless inscriptions upon the pil­ <lb/>
            lars and walls, by different persons, celebrating the virtues <lb/>
            of the fountain, and the divinity that presides over it. <lb/>
            Many of them you will admire, while some will make you <lb/>
            laugh; but I must correct myself when I say so; you are too <lb/>
            humane, I know, to laugh upon such an occasion. Farewell.</p>

          <p>As you are no less acquainted with the political laws of <lb/>
            your country (which include the customs and usages of the <lb/>
            senate) than with the civil, I am particularly desirous to have <lb/>
            your opinion whether I was mistaken in an affair which <lb/>
            lately came before the house, or not. This I request, not <lb/>
            with a view of being directed in my judgment as to what <lb/>
            is passed (for that is now too late), but in order to know <lb/>
            how to act in any possible future case of the kind. You will, <lb/>
            ask, perhaps, "Why do you apply for information concerning <lb/>
            a point on which you ought to be well instructed ?" Because <lb/>
            the tyranny of former reigns,1 as it introduced a neglect and <lb/>
            ignorance of all other parts of useful knowledge, so par­ <lb/>
            ticularly of what relates to the customs of the senate; for <lb/>
            who is there so tamely industrious as to desire to learn what <lb/>
            he can never have an opportunity of putting in practice? <note type="footnote"> 1 Those of Nero and Domitian. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            Besides, it is not very easy to retain even the knowledge <lb/>
            one has acquired where no opportunity of employing it <lb/>
            occurs. Hence it was that Liberty, on her return' found us <lb/>
            totally ignorant and inexperienced; and thus in the warmth <lb/>
            of our eagerness to taste her sweets, we are sometimes hur­ <lb/>
            ried on to action, ere we are well instructed how we ought <lb/>
            to act. But by the institution of our ancestors, it was wisely <lb/>
            provided that the young should learn from the old, not only <lb/>
            by precept, but by their own observation, how to behave in <lb/>
            that sphere in which they were one day themselves to move; <lb/>
            while these, again, in their turn, transmitted the same mode <lb/>
            of instruction to their children. Upon this principle it was <lb/>
            that the youth were sent early into the army, that by being <lb/>
            taught to obey they might learn to command, and, whilst <lb/>
            they followed others, might be trained by degrees to become <lb/>
            leaders themselves. On the same principle, when they were <lb/>
            candidates for any office, they were obliged to stand at the <lb/>
            door of the senate-house, and were spectators of the public <lb/>
            council before they became members of it. The father of <lb/>
            each youth was his instructor upon these occasions, or if <lb/>
            he had none, some person of years and dignity supplied the <lb/>
            place of a father. Thus they were taught by that surest <lb/>
            method of discipline, Example; how far the right of propos­ <lb/>
            ing any law to the senate extended; what privileges a sen­ <lb/>
            ator had in delivering his opinion in the house; the power of <lb/>
            the magistrates in that assembly, and the rights of the rest <lb/>
            of the members; where it is proper to yield, and where to <lb/>
            insist; when and how long to speak, and when to be silent; <lb/>
            how to make necessary distinctions between contrary opin­ <lb/>
            ions, and how to improve upon a former motion: in a word, <lb/>
            they learnt by this means every senatorial usage. As for <lb/>
            myself, it is true indeed, I served in the army when I was <lb/>
            a youth; but it was at a time when courage was suspected, <lb/>
            and want of spirit rewarded; when generals were without <lb/>
            authority, and soldiers without modesty; when there was <lb/>
            neither discipline nor obedience, but all was riot, disorder, <lb/>
            and confusion; in short, when it was happier to forget than <lb/>
            to remember what one learnt. I attended likewise in my youth <lb/>
            the senate, but a senate shrinking and speechless; where it <note type="footnote"> 2 When Nerva and Trajan received the empire. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            was dangerous to utter one's opinion, and mean and pitiable <lb/>
            to be silent. What pleasure was there in learning, or indeed <lb/>
            what could be learnt, when the senate was convened either <lb/>
            to do nothing whatever or to give their sanction to some <lb/>
            consummate infamy! when they were assembled either for <lb/>
            cruel or ridiculous purposes, and when their deliberations <lb/>
            were never serious, though often sad! But I was not only <lb/>
            a witness to this scene of wretchedness, as a spectator; I bore <lb/>
            my share of it too as a senator, and both saw and suffered <lb/>
            under it for many years; which so broke and damped my <lb/>
            spirits that they have not even yet been able fully to recover <lb/>
            themselves. It is within quite recently (for all time seems <lb/>
            short in proportion to its happiness) that we could take any <lb/>
            pleasure in knowing what relates to or in setting about the <lb/>
            duties of our station. Upon these considerations, therefore, <lb/>
            I may the more reasonably entreat you, in the first place, <lb/>
            to pardon my error (if I have been guilty of one), and, in <lb/>
            the next, to lead me out of it by your superior knowledge: <lb/>
            for you have always been diligent to examine into the con­ <lb/>
            stitution of your country, both with respect to its public and <lb/>
            private, its ancient and modern, its general and special laws. <lb/>
            I am persuaded indeed the point upon which I am going to <lb/>
            consult you is such an unusual one that even those whose <lb/>
            great experience in public business must have made them, one <lb/>
            would have naturally supposed, acquainted with everything <lb/>
            were either doubtful or absolutely ignorant upon it. I shall <lb/>
            be more excusable, therefore, if I happen to have been mis­ <lb/>
            taken; as you will earn the higher praise if you can set me <lb/>
            right in an affair which it is not clear has ever yet fallen <lb/>
            within your observation. The enquiry then before the house <lb/>
            was concerning the freedmen of Afranius Dexter, who be­ <lb/>
            ing found murdered, it was uncertain whether he fell by his <lb/>
            own hands, or by those of his household; and if the latter, <lb/>
            whether they committed the fact in obedience to the com­ <lb/>
            mands of Afranius, or were prompted to it by their own vil­ <lb/>
            lainy. After they had been put to the question, a certain <lb/>
            senator (it is of no importance to mention his name, but <lb/>
            if you are desirous to know, it was myself) was for acquit­ <lb/>
            ting them; another proposed that they should be banished <lb/>
            for a limited time; and a third that they should suffer death. <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            These several opinions were so extremely different that it <lb/>
            was impossible either of them could stand with the other. <lb/>
            For what have death and banishment in common with one <lb/>
            another? Why, no more than banishment and acquittal <lb/>
            have together. Though an acquittal approaches rather nearer <lb/>
            a sentence of exile than a sentence of death does: for <lb/>
            both the former agree at least in this that they spare life, <lb/>
            whereas the latter takes it away. In the meanwhile, those <lb/>
            senators who were for punishing with death, and those who <lb/>
            proposed banishment, sate together on the same side of the <lb/>
            house: and thus by a present appearance of unanimity sus­ <lb/>
            pended their real disagreement. I moved, therefore, that <lb/>
            the votes for each of the three opinions should be separately <lb/>
            taken, and that two of them should not, under favour of a <lb/>
            short truce between themselves, join against the third? I <lb/>
            insisted that such of the members who were for capital <lb/>
            punishment should divide from the others who voted for <lb/>
            banishment; and that these two distinct parties should not be <lb/>
            permitted to form themselves into a body, in opposition to <lb/>
            those who declared for acquittal, when they would immedi­ <lb/>
            ately after disunite again: for it was not material that they <lb/>
            agreed in disliking one proposal, since they differed with re­ <lb/>
            spect to the other two. It seemed very extraordinary that he <lb/>
            who moved the freedmen should be banished, and the slaves <lb/>
            suffer death, should not be allowed to join these two in one <lb/>
            motion, but that each question should be ordered to be put to <lb/>
            the house separately; and yet that the votes of one who was <lb/>
            for inflicting capital punishment upon the freedmen should <lb/>
            be taken together with that of one who was for banishing <lb/>
            them. For if, in the former instance, it was reasonable that <lb/>
            the motion should be divided, because it comprehended two <lb/>
            distinct propositions, I could not see why, in the latter case, <lb/>
            suffrages so extremely different should be thrown into the <lb/>
            same scale. Permit me, then, notwithstanding the point is <lb/>
            already settled, to go over it again as if it were still unde­ <lb/>
            cided, and to lay before you those reasons at my ease, which <lb/>
            I offered to the house in the midst of much interruption <lb/>
            and clamour. Let us suppose there had been only three <lb/>
            judges appointed to hear this cause, one of whom was <lb/>
            of opinion that the parties in question deserved death; the <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            other that they should only be banished; and the third that <lb/>
            they ought to be acquitted: should the two former unite their <lb/>
            weight to overpower the latter, or should each be separately <lb/>
            balanced? For the first and second are no more compatible <lb/>
            than the second and third. They ought therefore in the <lb/>
            same manner to be counted in the senate as contrary opin­ <lb/>
            ions, since they were delivered as different ones. Suppose <lb/>
            the same person had moved that they should both have been <lb/>
            banished and put to death, could they possibly, in pursuance <lb/>
            of this opinion, have suffered both punishments? Or could <lb/>
            it have been looked upon as one consistent motion when it <lb/>
            united two such different decisions? Why then should the <lb/>
            same opinion, when delivered by distinct persons, be con­ <lb/>
            sidered as one and entire, which would not be deemed so <lb/>
            if it were proposed by a single man? Does not the law <lb/>
            manifestly imply that a distinction is to be made between <lb/>
            those who are for a capital conviction, and those who are <lb/>
            for banishment, in the very form of words made use of <lb/>
            when the house is ordered to divide? You who are of such <lb/>
            an opinion, come to this side; you who are of any other, go <lb/>
            over to the side of him whose opinion you follow. Let us <lb/>
            examine this form, and weigh every sentence: You who <lb/>
            are of this opinion: that is, for instance, you who are for <lb/>
            banishment, come on this side; namely, on the side of him <lb/>
            who moved for banishment. From whence it is clear he <lb/>
            cannot remain on this side of those who are for death. You <lb/>
            who are for any other: observe, the law is not content with <lb/>
            barely saying another, but it adds any. Now can there be <lb/>
            a doubt as to whether they who declare for a capital convic­ <lb/>
            tion are of any other opinion than those who propose exile! <lb/>
            Go over to the side of him whose opinion you follow: does <lb/>
            not the law seem, as it were, to call, compel, drive over, <lb/>
            those who are of different opinions, to contrary sides? Does <lb/>
            not the consul himself point out, not only by this solemn <lb/>
            form of words, but by his band and gesture, the place in <lb/>
            which every man is to remain, or to which he is to go <lb/>
            over? " But," it is objected, " if this separation is made be­ <lb/>
            tween those who vote for inflicting death, and those who <lb/>
            are on the side of exile, the opinion for acquitting the pris­ <lb/>
            oners must necessarily prevail." But how does that affect the <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            parties who vote ? Certainly it does not become them to con­ <lb/>
            tend by every art, and urge every expediment, that the <lb/>
            milder sentence may not take place. " Still," say they, " those <lb/>
            who are for condemning the accused either capitally or to <lb/>
            banishment should be first set in opposition to those who <lb/>
            are for acquitting them, and afterwards weighed against <lb/>
            each other." Thus, as, in certain public games, some par­ <lb/>
            ticular combatant is set apart by lot and kept to engage <lb/>
            with the conqueror; so, it seems, in the senate there is a <lb/>
            first and second combat, and of two different opinions, the <lb/>
            prevailing one has still a third to contend with. What? <lb/>
            when any particular opinion is received, do not all the rest <lb/>
            fall of course? Is it reasonable, then, that one should be <lb/>
            thrown into the scale merely to weigh down another? To <lb/>
            express my meaning more plainly: unless the two parties <lb/>
            who are respectively for capital punishment and exile im­ <lb/>
            mediately separate upon the first division of the house it <lb/>
            would be to no purpose afterwards to dissent from those <lb/>
            with whom they joined before. But I am dictating instead <lb/>
            of receiving instruction.- Ten me then whether you think <lb/>
            these votes should have been taken separately? My mo­ <lb/>
            tion, it is true, prevailed; nevertheless I am desirous to <lb/>
            know whether you think I ought to have insisted upon <lb/>
            this point, or have yielded as that member did who de­ <lb/>
            clared for capital punishment? For convinced, I will not <lb/>
            say of the legality, but at least of the equity of my propo­ <lb/>
            sal, he receded from his opinion, and went over to the <lb/>
            party for exile: fearing perhaps, if the votes were taken <lb/>
            separately (which he saw would be the case), the freed­ <lb/>
            men would be acquitted: for the numbers were far greater on <lb/>
            that side than on either of the other two, separately counted. <lb/>
            The consequence was that those who had been influenced by <lb/>
            his authority, when they saw themselves forsaken by his <lb/>
            going over to the other party, gave up a motion which they <lb/>
            found abandoned by the first proposer, and deserted, as it <lb/>
            were, with their leader. Thus the three opinions were re­ <lb/>
            solved at length into two; and of those two, one prevailed, <lb/>
            and the other was rejected; while the third, as it was not <lb/>
            powerful enough to conquer both the others, had only to <lb/>
            choose to which of the two it would yield. Farewell.</p><pb n="341"/>

          <p>THE sickness lately in my family, which has carried off <lb/>
            several of my servants, some of them, too, in the prime of <lb/>
            their years, has been a great affliction to me. I have two <lb/>
            consolations, however, which, though by no means equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to such a grief, still are consolations. One is, that as <lb/>
            I have always readily manumitted my slaves, their death <lb/>
            does not seem altogether immature, if they lived long enough <lb/>
            to receive their freedom: the other, that I have allowed <lb/>
            them to make a kind of will,1 which I observe as religiously <lb/>
            as if they were legally entitled to that privilege. I receive <lb/>
            and obey their last requests and injunctions as so many <lb/>
            authoritative commands, suffering them to dispose of their <lb/>
            effects to whom they please; with this single restriction, <lb/>
            that they leave them to some one in my household, for <lb/>
            to slaves the house they are in is a kind of state and com­ <lb/>
            monwealth, so to speak. But though I endeavor to ac­ <lb/>
            quiesce under these reflections, yet the same tenderness <lb/>
            which led me to show them these indulgences weakens and <lb/>
            gets the better of me. However, I would not wish on that <lb/>
            account to become harder: though the generality of the world, <lb/>
            I know, look upon losses of this kind in no other view than <lb/>
            as a diminution of their property, and fancy, by cherishing <lb/>
            such an unfeeling temper, they show a superior fortitude <lb/>
            and philosophy. Their fortitude and philosophy I will not <lb/>
            dispute. But humane, I am sure, they are not; for it is the <lb/>
            very criterion of true manhood to feel those impressions of <lb/>
            sorrow which it endeavors to resist, and to admit not to <lb/>
            be above the want of consolation. But perhaps I have de­ <lb/>
            tained you too long upon this subject, though not so long <lb/>
            as I would. There is a certain pleasure even in giving <lb/>
            vent to one's grief; especially when we weep on the bosom <lb/>
            of a friend who will approve, or, at least, pardon, our tears. <lb/>
            Farewell. <note type="footnote"> 1 A slave could acquire no property, and consequently was incapable by <lb/>

          <p>Is the weather with you as rude and boisterous as it is <lb/>
            with us? All here is in tempest and inundation. The Ti­ <lb/>
            ber has swelled its channel, and overflowed its banks far <lb/>
            and wide. Though the wise precaution of the emperor <lb/>
            had guarded against this evil, by cutting several outlets <lb/>
            to the river, it has nevertheless flooded all the fields and <lb/>
            valleys and entirely overspread the whole face of the flat <lb/>
            country. It seems to have gone out to meet those rivers <lb/>
            which it used to receive and carry off in one united stream, <lb/>
            and has driven them back to deluge those countries it could <lb/>
            not reach itself. That most delightful of rivers, the Anio, <lb/>
            which seems invited and detained in its course by the villas <lb/>
            built along its banks, has almost entirely rooted up and <lb/>
            carried away the woods which shaded its borders. It has <lb/>
            overthrown whole mountains, and, in endeavouring to find <lb/>
            a passage through the mass of ruins that obstructed its way, <lb/>
            has forced down houses, and risen and spread over the de­ <lb/>
            solation it has occasioned. The inhabitants of the hill COWl­ <lb/>
            tries, who are situated above the reach of this inundation, <lb/>
            have been the melancholy spectators of its dreadful effects, <lb/>
            having seen costly furniture, instruments of husbandry, <lb/>
            ploughs, and oxen with their drivers, whole herds of cattle, <lb/>
            together with the trunks of trees, and beams of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring villas, floating about in different parts. Nor indeed <lb/>
            have these higher places themselves, to which the waters <lb/>
            could not reach up, escaped the calamity. A continued <lb/>
            heavy rain and tempestuous hurricane, as destructive as <lb/>
            the river itself, poured down upon them, and has destroyed <lb/>
            all the enclosures which divided that fertile country. It <lb/>
            has damaged likewise, and even overturned, some of the <lb/>
            public buildings, by the fall of which great numbers have <lb/>
            been maimed, smothered, bruised. And thus lamentation <lb/>
            over the fate of friends has been added to losses. I am <lb/>
            extremely uneasy lest this extensive ruin should have spread <lb/>
            to you: I beg therefore, if it has not, you will immediately <lb/>
            relieve my anxiety; and indeed I desire you would inform <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            me though it should have done so; for the difference is <lb/>
            not great between fearing a danger, and feeling it; except <lb/>
            that the evil one feels has some bounds, whereas one's ap­ <lb/>
            prehensions have none. For we can suffer no more than <lb/>
            what actually has happened but we fear all that possibly <lb/>
            could happen. Farewell.</p>

          <p>THE common notion is certainly quite a false one, that <lb/>
            a man's will is a kind of mirror in which we may clearly <lb/>
            discern his real character, for Domitius Tullus appears a <lb/>
            much better man since his death than he did during his <lb/>
            lifetime. After having artfully encouraged the expectations <lb/>
            of those who paid court to him, with a view to being his <lb/>
            heirs, he has left his estate to his niece whom he adopted. <lb/>
            He has given likewise several very considerable legacies <lb/>
            among his grandchildren, and also to his great-grandson. <lb/>
            In a word, he has shown himself a most kind relation <lb/>
            throughout his whole will; which is so much the more to <lb/>
            be admired as it was not expected of him. This affair has <lb/>
            been very much talked about, and various opinions ex­ <lb/>
            pressed: some call him false, ungrateful, and forgetful, and, <lb/>
            while thus railing at him in this way as if they were actually <lb/>
            disinherited kindred, betray their own dishonest designs: <lb/>
            others, on the contrary, applaud him extremely for having <lb/>
            disappointed the hopes of this infamous tribe of men, whom, <lb/>
            considering the disposition of the times, it is but prudence to <lb/>
            deceive. They add that he was not at liberty to make any <lb/>
            other will, and that he cannot so properly be said to have <lb/>
            bequeathed, as returned, his estate to his adopted daughter, <lb/>
            since it was by her means it came to him. For Curtilius <lb/>
            Mancia, whose daughter Domitius Lucanus, brother to this <lb/>
            Tullus, married, having taken a dislike to his son-in-law, <lb/>
            made this young lady (who was the issue of that marriage) <lb/>
            his heiress, upon condition that Lucanus her father would <lb/>
            emancipate her. He accordingly did so, but she being after­ <lb/>
            wards adopted by Tullus, her uncle, the design of Mancia's <lb/>
            will was entirely frustrated. For these two brothers having <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            never divided their patrimony, but living together as joint- <lb/>
            tenants of one common estate, the daughter of Lucanus, not­ <lb/>
            withstanding the act of emancipation, returned back again, <lb/>
            together with her large fortune, under the dominion of her <lb/>
            father, by means of this fraudulent adoption. It seems in­ <lb/>
            deed to have been the fate of these two brothers to be en­ <lb/>
            riched by those who had the greatest aversion to them. For <lb/>
            Domitius Afer, by whom they were adopted, left a will in <lb/>
            their favour, which he had made eighteen years before his <lb/>
            death; though it was plain he had since altered his opinion <lb/>
            with regard to the family, because he was instrumental in <lb/>
            procuring the confiscation of their father's estate. There is <lb/>
            something extremely singular in the resentment of Afer, and <lb/>
            the good fortune of the other two; as it was very extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary, on the one hand, that Domitius should endeavour to <lb/>
            extirpate from the privileges of society a man whose chil­ <lb/>
            dren he had adopted, and, on the other, that these brothers <lb/>
            should find a parent in the very person that ruined their <lb/>
            father. But Tullus acted justly, after having been appointed <lb/>
            sole heir by his brother, in prejudice to his own daughter, to <lb/>
            make her amends by transferring to her this estate, which <lb/>
            came to him from Afer, as well as all the rest which he had <lb/>
            gained in partnership with his brother. His will there­ <lb/>
            fore deserves the higher praise, having been dictated by <lb/>
            nature, justice, and sense of honour; in which he has <lb/>
            returned his obligations to his several relations, according <lb/>
            to their respective good offices towards him, not forgetting <lb/>
            his wife, having bequeathed to that excellent woman, who <lb/>
            patiently endured much for his sake, several delightful <lb/>
            villas, besides a large sum of money. And indeed she de­ <lb/>
            served so much the more at his hands, in proportion to the <lb/>
            displeasure she incurred on her marriage with him. It was <lb/>
            thought unworthy a person of her birth and repute, so long <lb/>
            left a widow by her former husband, by whom she had issue, <lb/>
            to marry, in the decline of her life, an old man, merely for <lb/>
            his wealth, and who was so sickly and infirm that, even had <lb/>
            he passed the best years of his youth and health with her, <lb/>
            she might well have been heartily tired of him. He had <lb/>
            so entirely lost the use of all his limbs that he could not <lb/>
            move himself in bed without assistance; and the only enjoy­ <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            ment he had of his riches was to contemplate them. He <lb/>
            was even (sad and disgusting to relate) reduced to the <lb/>
            necessity of having his teeth washed and scrubbed by others: <lb/>
            in allusion to which he used frequently to say, when he was <lb/>
            complaining of the indignities which his infirmities obliged <lb/>
            him to suffer, that he was every day compelled to lick his <lb/>
            servant's fingers. Still, however, he lived on, and was will­ <lb/>
            ing to accept of life upon such terms. That he lived so long <lb/>
            as he did was particularly owing, indeed, to the care of his <lb/>
            wife, who, whatever reputation she might lose at first by her <lb/>
            marriage, acquired great honour by her unwearied devotion <lb/>
            as his wife.- Thus I have given you all the news of the <lb/>
            town, where nothing is talked of but Tullus. It is expected <lb/>
            his curiosities will shortly be sold by auction. He had such <lb/>
            an abundant collection of very old statues that he actually <lb/>
            filled an extensive garden with them, the very same day he <lb/>
            purchased it; not to mention numberless other antiques, <lb/>
            lying neglected in his lumber-room. If you have anything <lb/>
            worth telling me in return, I hope you will not refuse the <lb/>
            trouble of writing to me: not only as we are all of us natu­ <lb/>

            very beneficial influence upon our own conduct. Farewell.</p>

          <p>THOSE works of art or nature which are usually the <lb/>
            motives of our travels are often overlooked and neglected if <lb/>
            they lie within our reach: whether it be that we are nat­ <lb/>
            urally less inquisitive concerning those things which are near <lb/>
            us, while our curiosity is excited by remote objects; or because <lb/>
            the easiness of gratifying a desire is always sure to damp it; <lb/>
            or, perhaps, that we put off from time to time going and <lb/>
            seeing what we know we have an opportunity of seeing when <lb/>
            we please. Whatever the reason be, it is certain there are <lb/>
            numberless curiosities in and near Rome which we have not <lb/>
            only never seen, but even never so much as heard of: and <lb/>
            yet had they been the produce of Greece, or Egypt, or Asia, <lb/>
            or any other country which we admire as fertile and pro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            ductive of belief in wonders, we should long since have <lb/>
            heard of them, read of them, and enquired into them. For <lb/>
            myself at least, I confess, I have lately been entertained with <lb/>
            one of these curiosities, to which I was an entire stranger <lb/>
            before. My wife's grandfather desired I would look over <lb/>
            his estate near Ameria.1 As I was walking over his grounds, <lb/>
            I was shown a lake that lies below them, called Vadimon,2 <lb/>
            about which several very extraordinary things are told. I <lb/>
            went up to this lake. It is perfectly circular in form, like a <lb/>
            wheel lying on the ground; there is not the least curve or <lb/>
            projection of the shore, but all is regular, even, and just as <lb/>
            if it had been hollowed and cut out by the hand of art. The <lb/>
            water is of a clear sky-blue, though with somewhat of a <lb/>
            greenish tinge; its smell is sulphurous, and its flavour has <lb/>
            medicinal properties, and is deemed of great efficacy in all <lb/>
            fractures of the limbs, wh.ch it is supposed to heal. Though <lb/>
            of but moderate extent, yet the winds have a great effect upon <lb/>
            it, throwing it into violent agitation. No vessels are suffered <lb/>
            to sail here, as its waters are held sacred; but several float­ <lb/>
            ing islands swim about it, covered with reeds and rushes, <lb/>
            and with whatever other plants the surrounding marshy <lb/>
            ground and the edge itself of the lake produce in greater <lb/>
            abundance. Each island has its peculiar shape and size, but <lb/>
            the edges of all of them are worn away by their frequent <lb/>
            collision with the shore and one another. They are all of <lb/>
            the same height and motion; as their respective roots, which <lb/>
            are formed like the keel of a boat, may be seen hanging not <lb/>
            very far down in the water, and at an equal depth, on <lb/>
            whichever side you stand. Sometimes they move in a <lb/>
            cluster, and seem to form one entire little continent; some­ <lb/>
            times they are dispersed into different quarters by the wind; <lb/>
            at other times, when it is calm, they float up and down <lb/>
            separately. You may frequently see one of the larger <lb/>
            islands sailing along with a lesser joined to it, like a ship <lb/>
            with its long boat; or, perhaps, seeming to strive which <lb/>
            shall out-swim the other: then again they are all driven to <lb/>
            the same spot, and by joining themselves to the shore, <lb/>
            sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, lessen <note type="footnote"> 1 Now called Amelia, a town in Ombria. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Now Laghetto di Bassano. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            or restore the size of the lake in this part or that, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, till at last uniting in the centre they restore it to its <lb/>
            usual size. The sheep which graze upon the borders of this <lb/>
            lake frequently go upon these islands to feed, without per­ <lb/>
            ceiving that they have left the shore, until they are alarmed <lb/>
            by finding themselves surrounded with water; as though <lb/>
            they had been forcibly conveyed and placed there. After­ <lb/>
            wards, when the wind drives them back again, they as little <lb/>
            perceive their return as their departure. This lake empties <lb/>
            itself into a river, which, after running a little way, sinks <lb/>
            under ground, and, if anything is thrown in, it brings it up <lb/>
            again where the stream emerges.—I have given you this <lb/>
            account because I imagined it would not be less new, nor <lb/>
            less agreeable, to you than it was to me; as I know you <lb/>

          <p>NOTHING, in my opinion, gives a more amiable and be­ <lb/>
            coming grace to our studies, as well as manners, than to <lb/>
            temper the serious with the gay, lest the former should <lb/>
            degenerate into melancholy, and the latter run up into <lb/>
            levity. Upon this plan it is that I diversify my graver <lb/>
            works with compositions of a lighter nature. I had chosen <lb/>
            a convenient place and season for some productions of that <lb/>
            sort to make their appearance in; and designing to ac­ <lb/>
            custom them early to the tables of the idle, I fixed upon <lb/>
            the month of July, which is usually a time of vacation to <lb/>

            I took occasion to preface my recital with an apology. I <lb/>
            entreated my audience not to impute it to me as any want <lb/>
            of due regard for the business to which I had invited them <lb/>
            that on the very day I had appointed for reading my per­ <lb/>
            formances to a small circle of my friends I did not refuse <lb/>
            my services to others in their law affairs. I assured them <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            I would observe the same rule in my writings, and should <lb/>
            always give the preference to business, before pleasure; <lb/>
            to serious engagements before amusing ones; and to my <lb/>
            friends before myself. The poems I recited consisted of a <lb/>
            variety of subjects in different metres. It is thus that we <lb/>
            who dare not rely for much upon our abilities endeavour <lb/>
            to avoid satiating our readers. In compliance with the <lb/>
            earnest solicitation of my audience, I recited for two days <lb/>
            successively; but not in the manner that several practise, <lb/>
            by passing over the feebler passages, and making a merit <lb/>
            of so doing: on the contrary, I omitted nothing, and freely <lb/>
            confessed it. I read the whole, that I might correct the <lb/>
            whole; which it is impossible those who only select particu­ <lb/>
            lar passages can do. The latter method, indeed, may have <lb/>
            more the appearance of modesty, and perhaps respect; but <lb/>
            the former shows greater simplicity, as well as a more affec­ <lb/>
            tionate disposition towards the audience. For the belief <lb/>
            that a man's friends have so much regard for him as not <lb/>
            to be weary on these occasions, is a sure indication of the <lb/>
            love he bears them. Otherwise, what good do friends do <lb/>
            you who assemble merely for their own amusement? He <lb/>
            who had rather find his friend's performance correct, than <lb/>
            make it so, is to be regarded as a stranger, or one who is <lb/>
            too lackadaisical to give himself any trouble. Your affection <lb/>
            for me leaves me no room to doubt that you are impatient <lb/>
            to read my book, even in its present very imperfect condi­ <lb/>
            tion. And so you shall, but not until I have made those <lb/>
            corrections which were the principal inducement of my <lb/>
            recital. You are already acquainted with some parts of it; <lb/>
            but even those, after they have been improved (or perhaps <lb/>
            spoiled, as is sometimes the case by the delay of excessive <lb/>
            revision) will seem quite new to you. For when a piece <lb/>
            has undergone various changes, it gets to look new, even <lb/>
            in those very parts which remain unaltered. Farewell.</p><pb n="349"/>

          <p>My affection for you obliges me, not indeed to direct <lb/>
            you (for you are far above the want of a guide), but to <lb/>
            admonish you carefully to observe and resolutely to put in <lb/>
            practice what you already know, that is, in other words, <lb/>
            to know it to better purpose. Consider that you are sent <lb/>
            to that noble province, Achaia, the real and genuine Greece, <lb/>
            where politeness, learning, and even agriculture itself, are <lb/>
            supposed to have taken their first rise; sent to regulate the <lb/>
            condition of free cities; sent, that is, to a society of men <lb/>
            who breathe the spirit of true manhood and liberty; who <lb/>
            Irave maintained the rights they received from Nature, by <lb/>
            courage, by virtue, by alliances; in a word, by civil and <lb/>
            religious faith. Revere the gods their founders; their <lb/>
            ancient glory, and even that very antiquity itself which, <lb/>
            venerable in men, is sacred in states. Honour them there­ <lb/>
            fore for their deeds of old renown, nay, their very legendary <lb/>
            traditions. Grant to every one his full dignity, privileges, <lb/>
            yes, and the indulgence of his very vanity. Remember it <lb/>
            was from this nation we derived our laws; that she did <lb/>
            not receive ours by conquest, but gave us hers by favour. <lb/>
            Remember, it is Athens to which you go; it is Lacedaemon <lb/>
            you govern; and to deprive such a people of the declining <lb/>
            shadow, the remaining name of liberty, would be cruel, in­ <lb/>
            human, barbarous. Physicians, you see, though in sickness <lb/>
            there is no difference between freedom and slavery, yet treat <lb/>
            persons of the former rank with more tenderness than those <lb/>
            of the latter. Reflect what these cities once were; but so <lb/>
            reflect as not to despise them for what they are now. Far <lb/>
            be pride and asperity from my friend; nor fear, by a proper <lb/>
            condescension, to lay yourself open to contempt. Can he <lb/>
            who is vested with the power and bears the ensigns of <lb/>
            authority, can he fail of meeting with respect, unless by <lb/>
            pursuing base and sordid measures, and first breaking <lb/>
            through that reverence he owes to himself? Ill, believe <lb/>
            me, is power proved by insult; ill can terror command <lb/>
            veneration, and far more effectual is affection in obtaining <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            one's purpose than fear. For terror operates no longer <lb/>
            than its object is present, but love produces its effects with <lb/>
            its object at a distance: and as absence changes the former <lb/>
            into hatred, it raises the latter into respect. And therefore <lb/>
            you ought ( and I cannot but repeat it too often), you <lb/>
            ought to well consider the nature of your office, and to <lb/>
            represent to yourself how great and important the task is <lb/>
            of governing a free state. For what can be better for society <lb/>
            than such government, what can be more precious than <lb/>
            freedom? How ignominious then must his conduct be who <lb/>
            turns good government into anarchy, and liberty into <lb/>
            slavery? To these considerations let me add, that you <lb/>
            have an established reputation to maintain: the fame you <lb/>
            acquired by the administration of the quaestorship in <lb/>
            Bithynia,1 the good opinion of the emperor, the credit you <lb/>
            obtained when you were tribune and praetor, in a word, <lb/>
            this very government, which may be looked upon as the <lb/>
            reward of your former services, are all so many glorious <lb/>
            weights which are incumbent upon you to support with <lb/>
            suitable dignity. The more strenuously therefore you ought <lb/>
            to endeavour that it may not be said you showed greater <lb/>
            urbanity, integrity, and ability in a province remote from <lb/>
            Rome, than in one which lies so much nearer the capital; <lb/>
            in the midst of a nation of slaves, than among a free peo­ <lb/>
            ple; that it may not be remarked, that it was chance, and <lb/>
            not judgment, appointed you to this office; that your char­ <lb/>
            acter was unknown and unexperienced, not tried and ap­ <lb/>
            proved. For (and it is a maxim which your reading and <lb/>
            conversation must have often suggested to you) it is a far <lb/>
            greater disgrace losing the name one has once acquired <lb/>
            than never to have attained it. I again beg you to be per­ <lb/>
            suaded that I did not write this letter with a design of <lb/>
            instruction, but of reminder. Though indeed, if I had, it <lb/>
            would have only been in consequence of the great affection <lb/>
            I bear you: a sentiment which I am in no fear of carrying <lb/>
            beyond its just bounds: for there can be no danger of excess <lb/>
            where one cannot love too well. Farewell. <note type="footnote"> 1 A province in Anatolia, or Asia Minor. M. </note> <pb n="351"/>

          <p>OTHERS may think as they please; but the happiest man, <lb/>
            in my opinion, is he who lives in the conscious anticipa­ <lb/>
            tion of an honest and enduring name, and secure of future <lb/>
            glory in the eyes of posterity. I confess, if I had not the <lb/>

            a life of uninterrupted ease and indolent retirement to any <lb/>

            attention: endless fame, or the short duration of life. <lb/>
            Those who are actuated by the former motive ought to <lb/>
            exert themselves to the very utmost of their power; while <lb/>
            such as are influenced by the latter should quietly resign <lb/>
            themselves to repose, and not wear out a short life in <lb/>
            perishable pursuits, as we see so many doing-and then <lb/>

          <p>I HAVE spent these several days past, in reading and <lb/>
            writing, with the most pleasing tranquillity imaginable. You <lb/>
            will ask, " How that can possibly be in the midst of Rome ? " <lb/>
            It was the time of celebrating the Circensian games; an <lb/>
            entertainment for which I have not the least taste. They <lb/>
            have no novelty, no variety to recommend them, nothing, in <lb/>
            short, one would wish to see twice. It does the more sur­ <lb/>
            prise me therefore that so many thousand people should be <lb/>
            possessed with the childish passion of desiring so often to <lb/>
            see a parcel of horses gallop, and men standing upright in <lb/>
            their chariots. If, indeed, it were the swiftness of the <lb/>
            horses, or the skill of the men that attracted them, there <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            might be some pretence of reason for it. But it is the <lb/>
            dress1 they like; it is the dress that takes their fancy. And <lb/>
            if, in the midst of the course and contest, the different <lb/>
            parties were to change colours, their different partisans <lb/>
            would change sides, and instantly desert the very same men <lb/>
            and horses whom just before they were eagerly following <lb/>
            with their eyes, as far as they could see, and shouting out <lb/>
            their names with all their might. Such mighty charms, <lb/>
            such wondrous power reside in the colour of a paltry tunic! <lb/>
            And this not only with the common crowd (more con­ <lb/>
            temptible than the dress they espouse), but even with <lb/>
            serious-thinking people. When I observe such men thus in­ <lb/>
            satiably fond of so silly, so low, so uninteresting, so common <lb/>
            an entertainment, I congratulate myself on my indifference <lb/>
            to these pleasures: and am glad to employ the leisure of <lb/>

          <p>I AM pleased to find by your letter that you are engaged <lb/>
            in building; for I may now defend my own conduct by <lb/>
            your example. I am myself employed in the same sort of <lb/>
            work; and since I have you, who shall deny I have reason <lb/>
            on my side? Our situations too are not dissimilar; your <lb/>
            buildings are carried on upon the sea-coast, mine are <lb/>
            rising upon the side of the Larian lake. I have several <lb/>
            villas upon the borders of this lake, but there are two <lb/>
            particularly in which, as I take most delight, so they give <lb/>
            me most employment. They are both situated like those at <lb/>
            Baiae:2 one of them stands upon a rock, and overlooks the <note type="footnote"> 1 The performers at these games were divided into companies, distin­ <lb/>
            guished by the particular colour of their habits; the principal of which <lb/>
            were the white, the red, the blue, and the green. Accordingly the spec­ <lb/>
            tators favoured one or the other colour, as humour and caprice inclined <lb/>
            them. In the reign of Justinian a tumult arose in Constantinople, occa­ <lb/>
            sioned merely by a contention among the partisans of these several colours, <lb/>
            wherein no less than 30.000 men lost their lives. At. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Now called Castello di Baia, in Terra di Lavoro. It was the place the <lb/>
            Romans chose for their winter retreat; and which they frequented upon <lb/>
            account of its warm baths. Some few ruins of the beautiful villas that <lb/>

            lake; the other actually touches it. The first, supported as <lb/>
            it were by the lofty buskin,' I call my tragic; the other, <lb/>
            as resting upon the humble rock, my comic villa. Each <lb/>
            has its own peculiar charm, recommending it to its pos­ <lb/>
            sessor so much more on account of this very difference. <lb/>
            The former commands a wider, the latter enjoys a nearer <lb/>
            view of the lake. One, by a gentle curve, embraces a little <lb/>
            bay; the other, being built upon a greater height, forms two. <lb/>
            Here you have a strait walk extending itself along the banks <lb/>
            of the lake; there, a spacious terrace that falls by a gentle <lb/>
            descent towards it. The former does not feel the force of <lb/>
            the waves; the latter breaks them; from that you see the <lb/>
            fishing-vessels; from this you may fish yourself, and throw <lb/>
            your line out of your room, and almost from your bed, as <lb/>
            from off a boat. It is the beauties therefore these agreeable <lb/>
            villas possess that tempt me to add to them those which are <lb/>
            wanting.-But I need not assign a reason to you; who, <lb/>

            which deserved your father's correction? Did you never? <lb/>

            my own reputation. But amidst an infinite variety of the <lb/>
            blackest crimes, none appeared to me more atrocious <lb/>
            than that a senator, of praetorian dignity, and invested <lb/>

            very senate itself, lay violent hands upon a member' of that <lb/>
            body, one of consular rank, and who then stood arraigned <lb/>
            before him. Besides this general consideration, I also hap­ <lb/>
            pened to be on terms of particular intimacy with Helvidius, <lb/>
            as far as this was possible with one who, through fear of the <lb/>

            her daughter Fannia, who was mother-in-law to Helvidius, <lb/>
            were in the number of my friends. But it was not so much <lb/>
            private attachments as the honour of the public, a just in­ <lb/>

            Should pass unpunished, that animated me upon the occa­ <lb/>
            sion. At the first restoration of liberty' every man singled <lb/>
            out his own particular enemy (though it must be confessed, <lb/>
            those only of a lower rank), and, in the midst of much <lb/>
            clamour and confusion, no sooner brought the charge than <lb/>
            procured the condemnation. But for myself, I thought it <lb/>
            would be more reasonable and more effectual, not to take ad­ <lb/>
            vantage of the general resentment of the public, but to crush <lb/>
            this criminal with the single weight of his own enormous guilt. <lb/>
            When therefore the first heat of public indignation began <lb/>
            to cool, and declining passion gave way to justice, though <lb/>
            I was at that time under great affliction for the loss of my <lb/>
            wife,4 I sent to Anteia, the widow of Helvidius, and desired <lb/>
            her to come to me, as my late misfortune prevented me <lb/>
            from appearing in public. When she arrived, I said to her, <lb/>
            "I am resolved not to suffer the injuries your husband has <lb/>
            received, to pass unrevenged; let Arria and Fannia" (who <lb/>
            were just returned from exile) "know this; and consider <lb/>
            together whether you would care to join with me in the <lb/>
            prosecution. Not that I want an associate, but I am not <lb/>
            so jealous of my own glory as to refuse to share it with <note type="footnote"> 2 Helvidius. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Upon the accession of Nerva to the empire, after the death of Domi­ <lb/>

            you in this affair." She accordingly carried this message; <lb/>
            and they all agreed to the proposal without the least hesita­ <lb/>
            tion. It happened very opportunely that the senate was to <lb/>
            meet within three days. It was a general rule with me to <lb/>
            consult, in all my affairs, with Corellius, a person of the <lb/>
            greatest far-sightedness and wisdom this age has produced. <lb/>
            However, in the present case, I relied entirely upon my own <lb/>
            discretion, being apprehensive he would not approve of my <lb/>
            design, as he was very cautious and deliberate. But though <lb/>
            I did not previously take counsel with him ( experience <lb/>
            having taught me, never to do so with a person concerning <lb/>
            a question we have already determined, where he has a <lb/>
            right to expect that one shall be decided by his judgment), <lb/>
            yet I could not forbear acquainting him with my resolution <lb/>
            at the time I intended to carry it into execution. The <lb/>
            senate being assembled, I came into the house, and begged <lb/>
            I might have leave to make a motion; which I did in few <lb/>
            words, and with general assent. When I began to touch <lb/>
            upon the charge, and point out the person I intended to <lb/>
            accuse (though as yet without mentioning him by name), <lb/>
            I was attacked on all sides. "Let us know," exclaims one, <lb/>
            "who is the subject of this informal motion?" "Who is it" <lb/>
            (asked another) "that is thus accused, without acquainting <lb/>
            the house with his name, and his crime?" "Surely" (added <lb/>
            a third) "we who have survived the late dangerous times <lb/>
            may expect now, at least, to remain in security." I heard <lb/>
            all this with perfect calmness, and without being in the <lb/>
            least alarmed. Such is the effect of conscious integrity; <lb/>
            and so much difference is there with respect to inspiring <lb/>
            confidence or fear, whether the world had only rather one <lb/>
            should forbear a certain act, or absolutely condemn it. It <lb/>
            would be too tedious to relate all that was advanced, by <lb/>
            different parties, upon this occasion. At length the consul <lb/>
            said, "You will be at liberty, Secundus, to propose what you <lb/>
            think proper when your turn comes to give your opinion <lb/>
            upon the order of the day."5 I replied, "You must allow <lb/>
            me a liberty which you never yet refused to any;" and so sat <note type="footnote"> 5 It is very remarkable that, when any senator was asked his opinion in <lb/>
            the house, he had the privilege of speaking as long as he pleased upon <lb/>
            any other affair before he came to the point in question. Aul. Gell. lib. <lb/>

            down: when immediately the house went upon another busi­ <lb/>
            ness. In the meanwhile, one of my consular friends took <lb/>
            me aside, and, with great earnestness telling me he thought <lb/>
            I had carried on this affair with more boldness than pru­ <lb/>
            dence, used every method of reproof and persuasion to pre­ <lb/>
            vail with me to desist; adding at the same time that I should <lb/>
            certainly, if I persevered, render myself obnoxious to some <lb/>
            future prince. "Be it so," I returned, "should he prove a <lb/>
            bad one." Scarcely had he left me when a second came <lb/>
            up: "Whatever," said he, "are you attempting? Why ever <lb/>
            will you ruin yourself? Do you consider the risks you <lb/>
            expose yourself to? Why will you presume too much on <lb/>
            the present situation of public affairs, when it is so uncertain <lb/>
            what turn they may hereafter take? You are attacking a <lb/>
            man who is actually at the head of the treasury, and will <lb/>
            shortly be consul. Besides, recollect what credit he has, <lb/>
            and with what powerful friendships he is supported?" Upon <lb/>
            which he named a certain person, who (not without several <lb/>
            strong and suspicious rumours) was then at the head of a <lb/>
            powerful army in the east. I replied, <lb/>
            " 'All I've foreseen, and oft in thought revolv'd ; '6 <lb/>
            and am willing, if fate shall so decree, to suffer in an <lb/>
            honest cause, provided I can draw vengeance down upon a <lb/>
            most infamous one." The time for the members to give <lb/>
            their opinions was now arrived. Domitius Apollinaris, the <lb/>
            consul elect, spoke first; after him Fabricius Vejento, then <lb/>
            Fabius Maximinus, Vettius Proculus next (who married my <lb/>
            wife's mother, and who was the colleague of Publicius <lb/>
            Certus, the person on whom the debate turned), and last of <lb/>
            all Ammius Flaccus. They all defended Certus, as if I had <lb/>
            named him (though I had not yet so much as once men­ <lb/>
            tioned him), and entered upon his justification as if I had <lb/>
            exhibited a specific charge. It is not necessary to repeat <lb/>
            in this place what they respectively said, having given it all <lb/>
            at length in their words in the speech above-mentioned. <lb/>
            Avidius Quietus and Cornutus Tertullus answered them. <lb/>
            The former observed, "that it was extremely unjust not <lb/>
            to hear the complaints of those who thought themselves in- <note type="footnote"> 6 Aeneid, lib. vi. v. 105. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            jured, and therefore that Arria and Fannia ought not to be <lb/>
            denied the privilege of laying their grievances before the <lb/>
            house; and that the point for the consideration of the <lb/>
            senate was not the rank of the person, but the merit of the <lb/>
            cause."</p>
          <p>Then Cornutus rose up and acquainted the house, "that, as <lb/>
            he was appointed guardian to the daughter of Helvidius by <lb/>
            the consuls, upon the petition of her mother and her father- <lb/>
            in-law, he felt himself compelled to fulfil the duty of his <lb/>
            trust. In the execution of which, however, he would en­ <lb/>
            deavour to set some bounds to his indignation by following <lb/>
            that great example of moderation which those excellent <lb/>
            women7 had set, who contented themselves with barely in­ <lb/>
            forming the senate of the cruelties which Certus committed <lb/>
            in order to carry on his infamous adulation; and there­ <lb/>
            fore," he said, "he would move only that, if a punishment <lb/>
            due to a crime so notoriously known should be remitted, <lb/>
            Certus might at least be branded with some mark of the <lb/>
            displeasure of that august assembly." Satrius Rufus spoke <lb/>
            next, and, meaning to steer a middle course, expressed him­ <lb/>
            self with considerable ambiguity. "I am of opinion," said <lb/>
            he, "that great injustice will be done to Certus if he is <lb/>
            not acquitted (for I do not scruple to mention his name, <lb/>
            since the friends of Arria and Fannia, as well as his own, <lb/>
            have done so too), nor indeed have we any occasion for <lb/>
            anxiety upon this account. We who think well of the man <lb/>
            shall judge him with the same impartiality as the rest; but <lb/>
            if he is innocent, as I hope he is, and shall be glad to find, I <lb/>
            think this house may very justly deny the present motion <lb/>
            till some charge has been proved against him." Thus, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the respective order in which they were called <lb/>
            upon, they delivered their several opinions. When it came <lb/>
            to my turn, I rose up, and, using the same introduction to <lb/>
            my speech as I have published in the defence, I replied to <lb/>
            them severally. It is surprising with what attention, what <lb/>
            clamorous applause I was heard, even by those who just <lb/>
            before were loudest against me: such a wonderful change <lb/>
            was wrought either by the importance of the affair, the <lb/>
            successful progress of the speech, or the resolution of the <note type="footnote"> 7 Arria and Faunis. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            advocate. After I had finished, Vejento attempted to reply; <lb/>
            but the general clamour raised against him not permitting <lb/>
            him to go on, " I entreat you, conscript fathers,"8 said he, <lb/>
            " not to oblige me to implore the assistance of the tribunes."9 <lb/>
            Immediately the tribune Murena cried out, "You have my <lb/>
            permission, most illustrious Vejento, to go on." But still <lb/>
            the clamour was renewed. In the interval, the consul <lb/>
            ordered the house to divide, and having counted the voices, <lb/>
            dismissed the senate, leaving Vejento in the midst, still <lb/>
            attempting to speak. He made great complaints of this <lb/>
            affront (as he called it), applying the following lines of <lb/>
            Homer to himself: <lb/>
            "Great perils, father, wait the unequal fight; <lb/>
            Those younger champions will thy strength o'ercome."10 <lb/>
            There was hardly a man in the senate that did not embrace <lb/>
            and kiss me, and all strove who should applaud me most, <lb/>
            for having, at the cost of private enmities, revived a custom <lb/>
            so long disused, of freely consulting the senate upon affairs <lb/>
            that concern the honour of the public; in a word, for having <lb/>
            wiped off that reproach which was thrown upon it by other <lb/>
            orders in the state, " that the senators mutually favoured <lb/>
            the members of their own body, while they were very severe <lb/>
            in animadverting upon the rest of their fellow-citizens." <lb/>
            All this was transacted in the absence of Certus; who kept <lb/>
            out of the way either because he suspected something of <lb/>
            this nature was intended to be moved, or (as was alleged in <lb/>
            his excuse) that he was really unwell. Caesar, however, <lb/>
            did not refer the examination of this matter to the senate. <lb/>
            But I succeeded, nevertheless, in my aim, another person <lb/>
            being appointed to succeed Certus in the consulship, while <lb/>
            the election of his colleague to that office was confirmed. <lb/>
            And thus, the wish with which I concluded my speech, was <lb/>
            actually accomplished: "May he be obliged," said I, "to re­ <lb/>
            nounce, under a virtuous prince,11 that reward he received <note type="footnote"> 8 The appellation by which the senate was addressed. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 The tribunes were magistrates chosen at first out of the body of the <lb/>

             <pb n="360"/>
            from an infamous one!"12 Some time after I recollected, <lb/>
            as well as I could, the speech I had made upon this oc­ <lb/>
            casion; to which I made several additions. It happened <lb/>
            (though indeed it had the appearance of being something <lb/>
            more than casual) that a few days after I had published <lb/>
            this piece, Certus was taken ill and died. I was told that <lb/>
            his imagination was continually haunted with this affair, and <lb/>
            kept picturing me ever before his eyes, as a man pursuing <lb/>
            him with a drawn sword. Whether there was any truth in <lb/>
            this rumour, I will not venture to assert; but, for the sake <lb/>
            of example, however, I could wish it might gain credit. And <lb/>
            now I have sent you a letter which (considering it is a <lb/>
            letter) is as long as the defence you say you have read: but <lb/>
            you must thank yourself for not being content with such <lb/>
            information as that piece could afford you. Farewell.</p>

          <p>I HAVE received your letter, in which you complain of <lb/>
            having been highly disgusted lately at a very splendid <lb/>
            entertainment, by a set of buffoons, mummers, and wanton <lb/>
            prostitutes, who were dancing about round the tables.1 But <lb/>
            let me advise you to smooth your knitted brow somewhat. <lb/>
            I confess, indeed, I admit nothing of this kind at my own <lb/>
            house; however, I bear with it in others. "And why, <lb/>
            then," you will be ready to ask, "not have them yourself?" <note type="footnote"> 12 Domitian; by whom he had been appointed consul elect, though he had <lb/>

            the purposes of mirth and gaiety, and constituted an essential part in all <lb/>
            polite entertainments among the Romans. It is surprising how soon this <lb/>
            great people fell off from their original severity of manners, and were <lb/>
            tainted with the stale refinements of foreign luxury. Livy dates the rise <lb/>
            of this and other unmanly delicacies from the conquest of Scipio Asiaticus <lb/>
            over Antiochus; that is, when the Roman name had scarce subsisted above <lb/>
            a hundred and threescore years. " Luxuriae peregrinae origio," says he, <lb/>
            " exercitu Asiatico in urbem invecta est." This triumphant army caught, <lb/>
            it seems, the contagious softness of the people it subdued; and, on its <lb/>
            return to Rome, spread an infection among their countrymen, which worked <lb/>
            by slow degrees, till it effected their total destruction. Thus did Eastern <lb/>
            luxury revenge itself on Roman arms. It may be wondered that Pliny <lb/>
            should keep his own temper, and check the indignation of his friends at <lb/>
            a scene which was fit only for the dissolute revels of the infamous Tri­ <lb/>
            malchio. But it will not, perhaps, be doing justice to our author to take <lb/>
            an estimate of his real sentiments upon this point from the letter before </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            The truth is, because the gestures of the wanton, the <lb/>
            pleasantries of the buffoon, or the extravagancies of the <lb/>
            mummer, give me no pleasure, as they give me no surprise. <lb/>
            It is my particular taste, you see, not my judgment, that I <lb/>
            plead against them. And indeed, what numbers are there <lb/>
            who think the entertainments with which you and I are <lb/>
            most delighted no better than impertinent follies! How <lb/>
            many are there who, as soon as a reader, a lyrist, or a <lb/>
            comedian is introduced, either take their leave of the com­ <lb/>
            pany or, if they remain, show as much dislike to this sort <lb/>
            of thing as you did to those monsters, as you call them! <lb/>
            Let us bear therefore, my friend, with others in their <lb/>
            amusements, that they, in return, may show indulgence <lb/>

          <p>YOUR freedman, whom you lately mentioned to me with <lb/>
            displeasure, has been with me, and threw himself at my <lb/>
            feet with as much submission as he could have fallen at <lb/>
            yours. He earnestly requested me with many tears, and <lb/>
            even with all the eloquence of silent sorrow, to intercede <lb/>
            for him; in short, he convinced me by his whole behaviour <lb/>
            that he sincerely repents of his fault. I am persuaded he <lb/>
            is thoroughly reformed, because he seems deeply sensible <lb/>
            of his guilt. I know you are angry with him, and I know, <lb/>
            too, it is not without reason; but clemency can never exert <lb/>
            itself more laudably than when there is the most cause <lb/>
            for resentment. You once had an affection for this man, <lb/>
            and, I hope, will have again; meanwhile, let me only prevail <lb/>
            with you to pardon him. If he should incur your displeasure <lb/>
            hereafter, you will have so much the stronger plea in <lb/>
            excuse for your anger as you show yourself more merciful <note type="footnote"> us. Genitor, it seems, was a man of strict, but rather of too austere morals <lb/>
            for the free turn of the age: " emendatus et gravis : Paulo etiam horridior <lb/>
            et durior ut in hac licentia temporum" (Ep. iii. 1. 3). But as there is a <lb/>
            certain seasonable accommodation to the manners of the times, not only <lb/>
            extremely consistent with, but highly conducive to, the interests of virtue, <lb/>
            Pliny, probably, may affect a greater latitude than he in general approved, <lb/>
            in order to draw off his friend from that stiffness and unyielding disposition <lb/>
            which might prejudice those of a gayer turn against him, and consequently <lb/>
            lessen the beneficial influence of his virtues upon the world. M. </note> <lb/>

            to him now. Concede something to his youth, to his tears, <lb/>
            and to your own natural mildness of temper: do not make <lb/>
            him uneasy any longer, and I will add too, do not make <lb/>
            yourself so; for a man of your kindness of heart cannot be <lb/>
            angry without feeling great uneasiness. I am afraid, were <lb/>
            I to join my entreaties with his, I should seem rather to <lb/>
            compel than request you to forgive him. Yet I will not <lb/>
            scruple even to write mine with his; and in so much the <lb/>
            stronger terms as I have very sharply and severely reproved <lb/>
            him, positively threatening never to interpose again in his <lb/>
            behalf. But though it was proper to say this to him, in <lb/>
            order to make him more fearful of offending, I do not say <lb/>
            so to you. I may perhaps, again have occasion to entreat <lb/>
            you upon this account, and again obtain your forgiveness; <lb/>
            supposing, I mean, his fault should be such as may become <lb/>
            me to intercede for, and you to pardon. Farewell.</p>

          <p>IT has frequently happened, as I have been pleading before <lb/>
            the Court of the Hundred, that these venerable judges, <lb/>
            after having preserved for a long period the gravity and <lb/>
            solemnity suitable to their character, have suddenly, as <lb/>
            though urged by irresistible impulse, risen up to a man and <lb/>
            applauded me. I have often likewise gained as much glory <lb/>
            in the senate as my utmost wishes could desire: but I never <lb/>
            felt a more sensible pleasure than by an account which I <lb/>
            lately received from Cornelius Tacitus. He informed me <lb/>
            that, at the last Circensian games, he sat next to a Roman <lb/>
            knight, who, after conversation had passed between them <lb/>
            upon various points of learning, asked him, "Are you an <lb/>
            Italian, or a provincial?" Tacitus replied, "Your acquaint­ <lb/>
            ance with literature must surely have informed you who I <lb/>
            am." "Pray, then, is it Tacitus or Pliny I am talking <lb/>
            with?" I cannot express how highly I am pleased to find <lb/>
            that our names are not so much the proper appellatives of <lb/>
            men as a kind of distinction for learning herself; and that <lb/>
            eloquence renders us known to those who would otherwise <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            be ignorant of us. An accident of the same kind happened to <lb/>
            me a few days ago. Fabius Rufinus, a person of distin­ <lb/>
            guished merit, was placed next to me at table; and below <lb/>
            him a countryman of his, who had just then come to Rome <lb/>
            for the first time. Rufinus, calling his friend's attention to <lb/>
            me, said to him, " You see this man? " and entered into a con­ <lb/>
            versation upon the subject of my pursuits: to whom the <lb/>
            other immediately replied, " This must undoubtedly be <lb/>
            Pliny." To confess the truth, I look upon these instances <lb/>
            as a very considerable recompense of my labours. If De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes had reason to be pleased with the old woman of <lb/>
            Athens crying out, " This is Demosthenes! " may not I, then, <lb/>
            be allowed to congratulate myself upon the celebrity my name <lb/>
            has acquired? Yes, my friend, I will rejoice in it, and with­ <lb/>
            out scruple admit that I do. As I only mention the judgment <lb/>
            of others, not my own, I am not afraid of incurring the <lb/>
            censure of vanity; especially from you, who, whilst envying <lb/>
            no man's reputation, are particularly zealous for mine. <lb/>
            Farewell.</p>

            <title type="sub">CVI To LUPERCUS</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I SAID once (and, I think, not inaptly) of a certain orator <lb/>
            of the present age, whose compositions are extremely reg­ <lb/>
            ular and correct, but deficient in grandeur and embellishment, <lb/>
            " His only fault is that he has none." Whereas he, who is <lb/>
            possessed of the true spirit of oratory, should be bold and <lb/>
            elevated, and sometimes even flame out, be hurried away, <lb/>
            and frequently tread upon the brink of a precipice: for <lb/>
            danger is generally near whatever is towering and exalted. <lb/>
            The plain, it is true, affords a safer, but for that reason a <lb/>
            more humble and inglorious, path: they who run are more <lb/>
            likely to stumble than they who creep; but the latter gain <lb/>
            no honour by not slipping, while the former even fall with <lb/>
            glory. It is with eloquence as with some other arts; she <lb/>
            is never more pleasing than when she risks most. Have you <lb/>
            not observed what acclamations our rope-dancers excite at <lb/>
            the instant of imminent danger? Whatever is most entirely <lb/>
            unexpected, or as the Greeks more strongly express it, what­ <lb/>
            ever is most perilous, most excites our admiration. The <lb/>
            pilot's skill is by no means equally proved in a calm as in <lb/>
            a storm: in the former case he tamely enters the port, un­ <lb/>
            noticed and unapplauded; but when the cordage cracks, the <lb/>
            mast bends, and the rudder groans, then it is that he shines <lb/>
            out in all his glory, and is hailed as little inferior to a sea- <lb/>
            god.</p>
          <p>The reason of my making this observation is, because, if I <lb/>
            mistake not, you have marked some passages in my writings <lb/>
            for being tumid, exuberant, and over-wrought, which, in <lb/>
            my estimation, are but adequate to the thought, or boldly <lb/>
            sublime. But it is material to consider whether your criti­ <lb/>
            cism turns upon such points as are real faults, or only <lb/>
            striking and remarkable expressions. Whatever is ele­ <lb/>
            vated is sure to be observed; but it requires a very nice <lb/>
            judgment to distinguish the bounds between true and false <lb/>
            grandeur; between loftiness and exaggeration. To give <lb/>
            an instance out of Homer, the author who can, with the <lb/>
            greatest propriety, fly from one extreme of style to another <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            "Heav'n in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound; <lb/>
            And wide beneath them groans the rending ground."1 <lb/>
            Again, <lb/>
            "Reclin'd on clouds his steed and armour lay."2 <lb/>
            So in this passage: <lb/>
            "As torrents roll, increas'd by numerous rills, <lb/>
            With rage impetuous down their echoing hills, <lb/>
            Rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain, <lb/>
            Roar through a thousand channels to the main."3 <lb/>
            It requires, I say, the nicest balance to poise these meta­ <lb/>
            phors, and determine whether they are incredible and mean­ <lb/>
            ingless, or majestic and sublime. Not that I think anything <lb/>
            which I have written, or can write, admits of comparison <lb/>
            with these. I am not quite so foolish; but what I would <lb/>
            be understood to contend for is, that we should give elo­ <lb/>
            quence free rein, and not restrain the force and impetuosity <lb/>
            of genius within too narrow a compass. But it will be said, <lb/>
            perhaps, that one law applies to orators, another to poets. As <lb/>
            if, in truth, Marc Tully were not as bold in his metaphors <lb/>
            as any of the poets ! But not to mention particular instances <lb/>
            from him, in a point where, I imagine, there can be no <lb/>
            dispute; does Demosthenes4 himself, that model and standard <lb/>
            of true oratory, does Demosthenes check and repress the fire <lb/>
            of his indignation, in that well-known passage which begins <lb/>
            thus: "These wicked men, these flatterers, and these de­ <lb/>
            stroyers of mankind," &amp;c. And again: "It is neither with <lb/>
            stones nor bricks that I have fortified this city," &amp;c.—And <lb/>
            afterwards: "I have thrown up these out-works before <lb/>
            Attica, and pointed out to you all the resources which human <lb/>
            prudence can suggest," &amp;c.—And in another place: "0 <lb/>

            sions he had employed, probably, in some oration, by instances of the same <lb/>
            warmth of colouring from those great masters of eloquence, Demosthenes <lb/>
            and his rival Aeschines. But the force of the passages which he produces <lb/>
            from these orators must necessarily be greatly weakened to a mere modern <lb/>
            reader, some of them being only hinted at, as generally well known; and <lb/>
            the metaphors in several of the others have either lost much of their orig­ <lb/>
            inal spirit and boldness, by being introduced and received in common lan­ <lb/>
            guage, or cannot, perhaps, be preserved in an English translation. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            cated with the grandeur of his own actions," &amp;c.5—But what <lb/>
            can be more daring and beautiful than that long digression, <lb/>
            which begins in this manner: "A terrible disease?"—The <lb/>
            following passage likewise, though somewhat shorter, is <lb/>
            equally boldly conceived:—"Then it was I rose up in op­ <lb/>
            position to the daring Pytho, who poured forth a torrent of <lb/>
            menaces against you," &amp;c.6—The subsequent stricture is of <lb/>
            the same stamp: "When a man has strengthened himself, <lb/>
            as Philip has, in avarice and wickedness, the first pretence, <lb/>
            the first false step, be it ever so inconsiderable, has over­ <lb/>
            thrown and destroyed all," &amp;c.7—So in the same style with <lb/>
            the foregoing is this:—"Railed off, as it were, from the <lb/>
            privileges of society, by the concurrent and just judgments <lb/>
            of the three tribunals in the city."—And in the same place: <lb/>
            "0 Aristogiton! you have betrayed that mercy which used <lb/>
            to be shown to offences of this nature, or rather, indeed, <lb/>
            you have wholly destroyed it. In vain then would you fly <lb/>
            for refuge to a port, which you have shut up, and encom­ <lb/>
            passed with rocks."—He has said before: "I am afraid, <lb/>
            therefore, you should appear in the judgment of some, to <lb/>
            have erected a public seminary of faction: for there is a <lb/>
            weakness in all wickedness which renders it apt to betray <lb/>
            itself!"—And a little lower: "I see none of these resources <lb/>
            open to him; but all is precipice gulf, and profound abyss."— <lb/>
            And again: "Nor do I imagine that our ancestors erected <lb/>
            those courts of judicature that men of his character should <lb/>
            be planted there, but on the contrary, eradicated, that none <lb/>
            may emulate their evil actions."—And afterwards: "If he <lb/>
            is then the artificer of every wickedness, if he only makes it <lb/>
            his trade and traflic," &amp;c.—And a thousand other passages <lb/>
            which I might cite to the same purpose; not to mention <lb/>
            those expressions which Aeschines calls not words, but <lb/>
            wonders.—You will tell me, perhaps, I have unwarily men­ <lb/>
            tioned Aeschines, since Demosthenes is condemned even <lb/>
            by him, for running into these figurative expressions. But <lb/>
            observe, I entreat you, how far superior the former orator <lb/>
            is to his critic, and superior too in the very passage to <lb/>
            which he objects; for in others, the force of his genius, in <note type="footnote"> 5 See ist Philippic. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 See Demosthenes' speech in defence of Cteisphon. </note><note type="footnote"> 7 See and Olynthiac. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            those above quoted, its loftiness, makes itself manifest. But <lb/>
            does Aeschines himself avoid those errors which he re­ <lb/>
            proves in Demosthenes? "The oratory says he, "Athen­ <lb/>
            ians, and the law, ought to speak the same language; but <lb/>
            when the voice of the law declares one thing, and that of <lb/>
            the orator another we should give our vote to the justice of <lb/>
            the law, not to the impudence of the orator."8—And in <lb/>
            another place: " He afterwards manifestly discovered the <lb/>
            design he had, of concealing his fraud under cover of the <lb/>
            decree, having expressly declared therein that the am­ <lb/>
            bassadors sent to the Oretae gave the five talents, not to <lb/>
            you, but to Callias. And that you may be convinced of <lb/>
            the truth of what I say (after having stripped the decree <lb/>
            of its gallies, its trim, and its arrogant ostentation), read <lb/>
            the clause itself."—And in another part: " Suffer him not <lb/>
            to break cover and escape out of the limits of the question." <lb/>
            A metaphor he is so fond of that he repeats it again. " But <lb/>
            remaining firm and confident in the assembly, drive him into <lb/>
            the merits of the question, and observe well how he doubles" <lb/>
            -Is his style more reserved and simple when he says: <lb/>
            " But you are ever wounding our ears, and are more con­ <lb/>
            cerned in the success of your daily harangues than for the <lb/>
            salvation of the city?"—What follows is conceived in a yet <lb/>
            higher strain of metaphor: " Will you not expel this man <lb/>
            as the common calamity of Greece? Will you not seize and <lb/>
            punish this pirate of the state, who sails about in quest of <lb/>
            favourable conjunctures," &amp;c.—With many other passages <lb/>
            of a similar nature. And now I expect you will make the <lb/>
            same attacks upon certain expressions in this letter as you <lb/>
            did upon those I have been endeavouring to defend. The <lb/>
            rudder that groans, and the pilot compared to a sea-god, <lb/>
            will not, I imagine, escape your criticism: for I perceive, <lb/>
            while I am suing for indulgence to my former style, I have <lb/>
            fallen into the same kind of figurative diction which you <lb/>
            condemn. But attack them if you please provided you will <lb/>
            immediately appoint a day when we may meet to discuss <lb/>
            these matters in person: you will then either teach me to <lb/>
            be less daring or I shall teach you to be more bold. Fare­ <lb/>
            well. <note type="footnote"> 8 See Aeschines' speech against Ctesiphon. </note> <pb n="368"/>

            <title type="sub">CVIl To CANINIUS</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE met with a story, which, although authenticated <lb/>
            by undoubted evidence, looks very like fable, and would <lb/>
            afford a worthy field for the exercise of so exuberant, lofty, <lb/>
            and truly poetical a genius as your own. It was related <lb/>
            to me the other day over the dinner table, where the con­ <lb/>
            versation happened to run upon various kinds of marvels. <lb/>
            The person who told the story was a man of unsuspected <lb/>
            veracity :-but what has a poet to do with truth? How­ <lb/>
            ever, you might venture to rely upon his testimony, even <lb/>
            though you had the character of a faithful historian to <lb/>
            support. There is in Africa a town called Hippo, situated <lb/>
            not far from the sea-coast: it stands upon a navigable lake, <lb/>
            communicating with an estuary in the form of a river, <lb/>
            which alternately flows into the lake, or into the ocean, <lb/>
            according to the ebb and flow of the tide. People of all <lb/>
            ages amuse themselves here with fishing, sailing, or swim­ <lb/>
            ming; especially boys, whom love of play brings to the <lb/>
            spot. With these it is a fine and manly achievement to be <lb/>
            able to swim the farthest; and he that leaves the shore and <lb/>
            his companions at the greatest distance gains the victory. <lb/>
            It happened, in one of these trials of skill, that a certain <lb/>
            boy, bolder than the rest, launched out towards the opposite <lb/>
            shore. He was met by a dolphin 9 who sometimes swam <lb/>
            before him, and sometimes behind him, then played round <lb/>
            him, and at last took him upon his back, and set him down, <lb/>
            and afterwards took him up again; and thus he carried the <lb/>
            poor frightened fellow out into the deepest part; when <lb/>
            immediately he turns back again to the shore, and lands <lb/>
            him among his companions. The fame of this remarkable <lb/>
            accident spread through the town, and crowds of people <lb/>
            flocked round the boy (whom they viewed as a kind of <lb/>
            prodigy) to ask him questions and hear him relate the story. <lb/>
            The next day the shore was thronged with spectators, all <lb/>
            attentively watching the ocean, and (what indeed is almost <lb/>
            itself an ocean) the lake. Meanwhile the boys swam as <lb/>
            usual, and among the rest, the boy I am speaking of went <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            into the lake, but with more caution than before. The <lb/>
            dolphin appeared again and came to the boy, who, together <lb/>
            with his companions, swam away with the utmost precipita­ <lb/>
            tion. The dolphin, as though to invite and call them back, <lb/>
            leaped and dived up and down, in a series of circular move­ <lb/>
            ments. This he practised the next day, the day after, and <lb/>
            for several days together, till the people (accustomed from <lb/>
            their infancy to the sea) began to be ashamed of their <lb/>
            timidity. They ventured, therefore, to advance nearer, play­ <lb/>
            ing with him and calling him to them, while he, in return, <lb/>
            suffered himself to be touched and stroked. Use rendered <lb/>
            them courageous. The boy, in particular, who first made <lb/>
            the experiment, swam by the side of him, and, leaping <lb/>
            upon his back, was carried backwards and forwards in that <lb/>
            manner, and thought the dolphin knew him and was fond of <lb/>
            him, while he too had grown fond of the dolphin. There <lb/>
            seemed, now, indeed, to be no fear on either side, the con­ <lb/>
            fidence of the one and tameness of the other mutually in­ <lb/>
            creasing ; the rest of the boys, in the meanwhile, surrounding <lb/>
            and encouraging their companion. It is very remarkable <lb/>
            that this dolphin was followed by a second, which seemed <lb/>
            only as a spectator and attendant on the former; for he <lb/>
            did not at all submit to the same familiarities as the first, <lb/>
            but only escorted him backwards and forwards, as the <lb/>
            boys did their comrade. But what is further surprising, <lb/>
            and no less true than what I have already related, is that this <lb/>
            dolphin, who thus played with the boys and carried them <lb/>
            upon his back, would come upon the shore, dry himself in <lb/>
            the sand, and, as soon as he grew warm, roll back into the <lb/>
            sea. It is a fact that Octavius Avitus, deputy governor of <lb/>
            the province, actuated by an absurd piece of superstition, <lb/>
            poured some ointment1 over him as he lay on the shore: the <lb/>
            novelty and smell of which made him retire into the ocean, <lb/>
            and it was not till several days after that he was seen again, <lb/>
            when he appeared dull and languid; however, he recov­ <lb/>
            ered his strength and continued his usual playful tricks. <lb/>
            All the magistrates round flocked hither to view this sight, <note type="footnote"> 1 It was a religious ceremony practised by the ancients to pour precious <lb/>
            ointments upon the statues of their gods: Avitus, it is probable, imagined <lb/>
            this dolphin was some sea-divinity, and therefore expressed his veneration <lb/>
            of him by the solemnity of a sacred unction. M. </note> <lb/>

            whose arrival, and prolonged stay, was an additional expense, <lb/>
            which the slender finances of this little community would <lb/>
            ill afford; besides, the quiet and retirement of the place <lb/>
            was utterly destroyed. It was thought proper, therefore, to <lb/>
            remove the occasion of this concourse, by privately killing <lb/>
            the poor dolphin. And now, with what a flow of tenderness <lb/>
            will you describe this affecting catastrophe!2 and how will <lb/>
            your genius adorn and heighten this moving story! Though, <lb/>
            indeed, the subject does not require any fictitious embel­ <lb/>
            lishments; it will be sufficient to describe the actual facts <lb/>
            of the case without suppression or diminution. FarewelL</p>

          <p>You want to know how I portion out my day, in my <lb/>
            summer villa at Tuscum? I get up just when I please; <lb/>
            generally about sunrise, often earlier, but seldom later than <lb/>
            this. I keep the shutters closed, as darkness and silence <lb/>
            wonderfully promote meditation. Thus free and abstracted <lb/>
            from these outward objects which dissipate attention, I am <lb/>
            left to my own thoughts; nor suffer my mind to wander <lb/>
            with my eyes, but keep my eyes in subjection to my mind, <lb/>
            which, when they are not distracted by a multiplicity of <lb/>
            external objects, see nothing but what the imagination <lb/>
            represents to them. If I have any work in hand, this is <lb/>
            the time I choose for thinking it out, word for word, even <note type="footnote"> 2 The overflowing humanity of Pliny's temper breaks out upon all occa­ <lb/>
            sions, but he discovers it in nothing more strongly than by the impression <lb/>
            which this little story appears to have made upon him. True benevolence, <lb/>
            indeed, extends itself through the whole compass of existence, and sym­ <lb/>
            pathises be with the distress of every creature of sensation. Little minds may <lb/>
            heapt to consider a compassion of this inferior kind as an instance of <lb/>
            weakness; but it is undoubtedly the evidence of a noble nature. Homer <lb/>
            thought it not unbecoming the character even of a hero to melt into tears <lb/>
            at a distress of this sort, and has given us a most amiable and affecting <lb/>
            picture of Ulysses weeping over his faithful dog Argus, when he expires <lb/>
            at his feet: <lb/>
            .... avrap o <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοσφιν ιδων απομορξατο δακρυ. <lb/>

            Adown his cheek the tear unbidden stole, <lb/>

            The drop humane." ... <lb/>

            to the minutest accuracy of expression. In this way I com­ <lb/>
            pose more or less, according as the subject is more or less <lb/>
            difficult, and I find myself able to retain it. I then call <lb/>
            my secretary, and, opening the shutters, dictate to him what <lb/>
            1 have put into shape, after which I dismiss him, then call <lb/>
            him in again, and again dismiss him. About ten or eleven <lb/>
            o'clock (for I do not observe one fixed hour), according <lb/>
            to the weather, I either walk upon my terrace or in the <lb/>
            covered portico, and there I continue to meditate or dictate <lb/>
            what remains upon the subject in which I am engaged. This <lb/>
            completed, I get into my chariot, where I employ myself <lb/>
            as before, when I was walking, or in my study; and find <lb/>
            this change of scene refreshes and keeps up my attention. <lb/>
            On my return home, I take a little nap, then a walk, and <lb/>
            after that repeat out loud and distinctly some Greek or <lb/>
            Latin speech, not so much for the sake of strengthening <lb/>
            my voice as my digestion;1 though indeed the voice at the <lb/>
            same time is strengthened by this practice. I then take <lb/>
            another walk, am anointed, do my exercises, and go into the <lb/>
            bath. At supper, if I have only my wife or a few friends <lb/>
            with me, some author is read to us; and after supper we <lb/>
            are entertained either with music or an interlude. When <lb/>
            that is finished, I take my walk with my family, among <lb/>
            whom I am not without some scholars. Thus we pass our <lb/>
            evenings in varied conversation; and the day, even when <lb/>
            at the longest, steals imperceptibly away. Upon some occa­ <lb/>
            sions I change the order in certain of the articles above- <lb/>
            mentioned. For instance, if I have studied longer or walked <lb/>
            more than usual, after my second sleep, and reading a <lb/>
            speech or two aloud, instead of using my chariot I get <lb/>
            on horseback; by which means I ensure as much exercise <lb/>
            and lose less time. The visits of my friends from the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring villages claim some part of the day; and sometimes, <lb/>
            by an agreeable interruption, they come in very seasonably <lb/>
            to relieve me when I am feeling tired. I now and then <lb/>
            amuse myself with hunting, but always take my tablets into <note type="footnote"> 1 By the regimen which Pliny here follows, one would imagine, if he <lb/>
            had not told us who were his physicians, that the celebrated Celsus was <lb/>
            in the number. That author expressly recommends reading aloud, and <lb/>
            afterwards walking, as beneficial in disorders of the stomach: " St quis <lb/>

            the field, that, if I should meet with no game, I may at <lb/>
            least bring home something. Part of my time too (though <lb/>
            not so much as they desire) is allotted to my tenants; whose <lb/>
            rustic complaints, along with these city occupations, make <lb/>
            my literary studies still more delightful to me. Farewell.</p>

          <p>As you are not of a disposition to expect from your <lb/>
            friends the ordinary ceremonial observances of society when <lb/>
            they cannot observe them without inconvenience to them­ <lb/>
            selves, so I love you too steadfastly to be apprehensive of <lb/>
            your taking otherwise than I wish you should my not wait­ <lb/>
            ing upon you on the first day of your entrance upon the <lb/>
            consular office, especially as I am detained here by the <lb/>
            necessity of letting my farms upon long leases. I am <lb/>
            obliged to enter upon an entirely new plan with my tenants: <lb/>
            for under the former leases, though I made them very con­ <lb/>
            siderable abatements, they have run greatly in arrear. For <lb/>
            this reason several of them have not only taken no sort of <lb/>
            care to lessen a debt which they found themselves incapable <lb/>
            of wholly discharging, but have even seized and consumed <lb/>
            all the produce of the land, in the belief that it would now <lb/>
            be of no advantage to themselves to spare it. I must there­ <lb/>
            fore obviate this increasing evil, and endeavour to find out <lb/>
            some remedy against it. The only one I can think of is, not <lb/>
            to reserve my rent in money, but in kind, and so place some <lb/>
            of my servants to overlook the tillage, and guard the stock; <lb/>
            as indeed there is no sort of revenue more agreeable to reason <lb/>
            than what arises from the bounty of the soil, the seasons, and <lb/>
            the climate. It is true, this method will require great honesty, <lb/>
            sharp eyes, and many hands. However, I must risk the ex­ <lb/>
            periment, and, as in an inveterate complaint, try every change <lb/>
            of remedy. You see, it is not any pleasurable indulgence <lb/>
            that prevents my attending you on the first day of your <lb/>
            consulship. I shall celebrate it, nevertheless, as much as if I <lb/>
            were present, and pay my vows for you here, with all the <lb/>
            warmest tokens of joy and congratulation. Farewell.</p><pb n="373"/>

          <p>THE pious affection you bore, most sacred Emperor, to <lb/>
            your august father induced you to wish it might be late ere <lb/>
            you succeeded him. But the immortal gods thought proper <lb/>
            to hasten the advancement of those virtues to the helm of <lb/>
            the commonwealth which had already shared in the steerage.:? <lb/>
            May you then, and the world through your means, enjoy <lb/>
            every prosperity worthy of your reign: to which let me add <lb/>
            my wishes, most excellent Emperor, upon a private as well <lb/>
            as public account, that your health and spirits may be pre­ <lb/>
            served firm and unbroken. <note type="footnote"> 1 The greater part of the following letters were written by Pliny during <lb/>
            his administration in the province of Bithynia. They are of a style and <lb/>
            character extremely different from those in the preceding collection; whence <lb/>
            some critics have injudiciously inferred that they are the production of <lb/>
            another hand: not considering that the occasion necessarily required a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent manner. In letters of business, as these chiefly are, turn and senti­ <lb/>
            ment would be foreign and impertinent; politeness and elegance of expres­ <lb/>
            sion being the essentials that constitute perfection in this kind: and in that <lb/>
            view, though they may be less entertaining, they have not less merit than <lb/>
            the former. But besides their particular excellence as letters, they have <lb/>
            a farther recommendation as so many valuable pieces of history, by throw­ <lb/>
            ing a strong light upon the character of one of the most amiable and <lb/>
            glorious princes in the Roman annals. Trajan appears throughout in the <lb/>
            most striking attitude that majesty can be placed in; in the exertion of <lb/>
            power to the godlike purposes of justice and benevolence: and what one <lb/>
            of the ancient historians has said of him is here clearly verified, that " he <lb/>
            rather chose to be loved than flattered by his people." To have been dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished by the favour and friendship of a monarch of so exalted a <lb/>
            character is an honour that reflects the brightest lustre upon our author; <lb/>
            as to have been served and celebrated by a courtier of Pliny's genius and <lb/>
            virtues is the noblest monument of glory that could have been raised to <lb/>
            Trajan. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Nerva, who succeeded Domitian, reigned but sixteen months and a few <lb/>
            days. Before his death he not only adopted Trajan, and named him for <lb/>

            though it was from an indulgence to the request of the <lb/>

            that you granted this favour, yet I have the satisfaction <lb/>
            to find by the words of your rescript that you complied <lb/>
            the more willingly as his application was in my behalf. I <lb/>
            cannot but look upon myself as in possession of my utmost <lb/>
            wish, after having thus received, at the beginning of your <lb/>
            most auspicious reign, so distinguishing a mark of your <lb/>
            peculiar favour; at the same time that it considerably <lb/>
            heightens my desire of leaving a family behind me. I was <lb/>
            not entirely without this desire even in the late most un­ <lb/>
            happy times: as my two marriages will induce you to be­ <lb/>
            lieve.. But the gods decreed it better, by reserving every <lb/>
            valuable privilege to the bounty of your generous dispen­ <lb/>
            sations. And indeed the pleasure of being a father will <lb/>
            be so much more acceptable to me now, that I can enjoy it <lb/>

          <p>THE experience, most excellent Emperor, I have had of <lb/>
            your unbounded generosity to me, in my own person, encour­ <lb/>
            ages me to hope I may be yet farther obliged to it, in that of <lb/>
            my friends. Voconius Romanus (who was my schoolfellow <lb/>
            and companion from our earliest years) claims the first <lb/>
            rank in that number; in consequence of which I petitioned <lb/>
            your sacred father to promote him to the dignity of the sena­ <lb/>
            torial order. But the completion of my request is reserved <lb/>
            to your goodness; for his mother had not then advanced, in <lb/>
            the manner the law directs, the liberal gift3 of four hundred <note type="footnote"> a $16,000. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            thousand sesterces, which she engaged to give him, in her <lb/>
            letter to the late emperor, your father. This, however, by my <lb/>
            advice she has since done, having made over certain estates <lb/>
            to him, as well as completed every other act necessary to <lb/>
            make the conveyance valid. The difficulties therefore being <lb/>
            removed which deferred the gratification of our wishes, it <lb/>
            is with full confidence I venture to assure you of the worth <lb/>
            of my friend Romanus, heightened and adorned as it is <lb/>
            not only by liberal culture, but by his extraordinary tender­ <lb/>
            ness to his parents as well. It is to that virtue he owes the <lb/>
            present liberality of his mother; as well as his immediate <lb/>
            succession to his late father's estate, and his adoption by <lb/>
            his father-in-law. To these personal qualifications, the <lb/>
            wealth and rank of his family give additional lustre; and <lb/>
            I persuade myself it will be some further recommendation <lb/>
            that I solicit in his behalf. Let me, then, entreat you, Sir, <lb/>
            to enable me to congratulate Romanus on so desirable an <lb/>
            occasion, and at the same time to indulge an eager and, I <lb/>
            hope, laudable ambition, of having it in my power to boast <lb/>
            that your favourable regards are extended not only to my­ <lb/>

          <p>WHEN by your gracious indulgence, Sir, I was appointed <lb/>
            to preside at the treasury of Saturn, I immediately re­ <lb/>
            nounced all engagements of the bar ( as indeed I never <lb/>
            blended business of that kind with the functions of the <lb/>
            state), that no avocations might call off my attention from <lb/>
            the post to which I was appointed. For this reason, when <lb/>
            the province of Africa petitioned the senate that I might <lb/>
            undertake their cause against Marius Priscus, I excused my­ <lb/>
            self from that office; and my excuse was allowed. But <lb/>
            when afterwards the consul elect proposed that the senate <lb/>
            should apply to us again, and endeavour to prevail with us <lb/>
            to yield to its inclinations, and suffer our names to be thrown <lb/>
            into the urn, I thought it most agreeable to that tranquillity <lb/>
            and good order which so happily distinguishes your times <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            not to oppose (especially in so reasonable an instance) the <lb/>

          <p>HAVING been attacked last year by a very severe and <lb/>
            dangerous illness, I employed a physician, whose care and <lb/>
            diligence, Sir, I cannot sufficiently reward, but by your <lb/>
            gracious assistance. I entreat you therefore to make him <lb/>
            a denizen of Rome; for as he is the freedman of a foreign <lb/>
            lady, he is, consequently, himself also a foreigner. His <lb/>
            name is Harpocras; his patroness (who has been dead a <lb/>
            considerable time) was Thermuthis, the daughter of Theon. <lb/>
            I further entreat you to bestow the full privileges of a Roman <lb/>
            citizen upon Hedia and Antonia Harmeris, the freedwomen <lb/>
            of Antonia Maximilla, a lady of great merit. It is at her <lb/>
            desire I make this request.</p>

          <p>I RETURN you thanks, Sir, for your ready compliance with <lb/>
            my desire, in granting the complete privileges of a Roman to <lb/>
            the freedwomen of a lady to whom I am allied and also for <lb/>
            making Harpocras, my physician, a denizen of Rome. But <lb/>
            when, agreeably to your directions, I gave in an account of <lb/>
            his age, and estate, I was informed by those who are better <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            skilled in the affairs than I pretend to be that, as he is an <lb/>
            Egyptian, I ought first to have obtained for him the freedom <lb/>
            of Alexandria before he was made free of Rome. I confess, <lb/>
            indeed, as I was ignorant of any difference in this case be­ <lb/>
            tween those of Egypt and other countries, I contented my­ <lb/>
            self with only acquainting you that he had been manumitted <lb/>
            by a foreign lady long since deceased. However, it is an <lb/>
            ignorance I cannot regret, since it affords me an opportunity <lb/>
            of receiving from you a double obligation in favour of the <lb/>
            same person. That I may legally therefore enjoy the bene­ <lb/>
            fit of your goodness. I beg you would be pleased to grant <lb/>
            him the freedom of the city of Alexandria, as well as that <lb/>
            of Rome. And that your gracious intentions may not meet <lb/>
            with any further obstacles, I have taken care, as you directed, <lb/>
            to send an account to your freedman of his age and <lb/>
            possessions.</p>

          <p>IT is my resolution, in pursuance of the maxim observed <lb/>
            by the princes my predecessors, to be extremely cautious in <lb/>
            granting the freedom of the city of Alexandria: however, <lb/>
            since you have obtained of me the freedom of Rome for <lb/>
            your physician Harpocras, I cannot refuse you this other <lb/>
            request. You must let me know to what district he be­ <lb/>

          <p>I CANNOT express, Sir, the pleasure your letter gave me, <lb/>
            by which I am informed that you have made my physician <lb/>
            Harpocras a denizen of Alexandria; notwithstanding your <lb/>

            Agreeably to your directions, I acquaint you that Harpocras <lb/>

          <p>I WAS greatly obliged, Sir, in my late illness, to Post­ <lb/>

            suitable return, but by the assistance of your wonted gracious <lb/>
            indulgence. I entreat you then to make Chrysippus Mith­ <lb/>
            ridates and his wife Stratonica (who are related to Marinus) <lb/>
            denizens of Rome. I entreat likewise the same privilege <lb/>
            in favour of Epigonus and Mithridates, the two sons of <lb/>
            Chrysippus; but with this restriction1 that they may remain <lb/>
            under the dominion of their father, and yet reserve their <lb/>
            right of patronage over their own freedmen. I further en­ <lb/>
            treat you to grant the full privileges of a Roman to L. <lb/>
            Satrius Abascantius, P. Caesius Phosphorus, and Pancharia <lb/>
            Soteris. This request I make with the consent of their <lb/>

          <p>AFTER your late sacred father, Sir, had, in a noble speech, <lb/>
            as well as by his own generous example, exhorted and en­ <lb/>
            couraged the public to acts of munificence, I implored his <note type="footnote"> 1 The extensive power of paternal authority was (as has been observed <lb/>
            in the notes above) peculiar to the Romans. But after Chrysippus was <lb/>
            made a denizen of Rome, he was not, it would seem, consequentially en­ <lb/>
            titled to that privilege over those children which were born before his <lb/>
            denization. On the other hand, if it was expressly granted him, his chil­ <lb/>
            dren could not preserve their right of patronage over their own freedmen, <lb/>
            because that right would of course devolve to their father, by means of <lb/>
            this acquired dominion over them. The denization therefore of his chil­ <lb/>
            dren is as expressly solicited as his own. But both parties becoming <lb/>
            quirites, the children by this creation, and not pleading in right of their <lb/>
            father, would be patres fam. To prevent which the clause is added, " ita <lb/>

            permission to remove the several statues which I had of <lb/>
            the former emperors to my corporation, and at the same <lb/>
            time requested permission to add his own to the number. <lb/>
            For as I had hitherto let them remain in the respective places <lb/>
            in which they stood when they were left to me by several <lb/>
            different inheritances, they were dispersed in distant parts <lb/>
            of my estate. He was pleased to grant my request, and at <lb/>
            the same time to give me a very ample testimony of his ap­ <lb/>
            probation. I immediately, therefore, wrote to the decurii, <lb/>
            to desire they would allot a piece of ground, upon which I <lb/>
            might build a temple at my own expense; and they, as a <lb/>
            mark of honour to my design, offered me the choice of any <lb/>
            site I might think proper. However, my own ill-health in <lb/>
            the first place, and later that of your father, together with <lb/>
            the duties of that employment which you were both pleased <lb/>
            to entrust me, prevented my proceeding with that design. <lb/>
            But I have now, I think, a convenient opportunity of mak­ <lb/>
            ing an excursion for the purpose, as my monthly attendance1 <lb/>
            ends on the ist of September, and there are several festivals <lb/>
            in the month following. My first request, then, is that you <lb/>
            would permit me to adorn the temple I am going to erect <lb/>
            with your statue, and next (in order to the execution of my <lb/>
            design with all the expedition possible) that you would in­ <lb/>
            dulge me with leave of absence. It would ill become the <lb/>
            sincerity I profess, were I to dissemble that your goodness <lb/>
            in complying with this desire will at the same time be ex­ <lb/>
            tremely serviceable to me in 'my own private affairs. It is <lb/>
            absolutely necessary I should not defer any longer the let­ <lb/>
            ting of my lands in that province; for, besides that they <lb/>
            amount to above four hundred thousand sestei ces,' the time <lb/>
            for dressing the vineyards is approaching, and that business <lb/>
            must fall upon my new tenants. The unfruitfulness of the <note type="footnote"> 1 Pliny enjoyed the office of treasurer in conjunction with Comutus <lb/>

            for which he was to give about $117,000 of our money; but whether he ever <lb/>
            completed that purchase is uncertain. This, however, we are sure of, that <lb/>
            his fortunes were but moderate, considering his high station and necessary <lb/>

          <p>You have given me many private reasons, and every public <lb/>

            any instance of your affection towards me, I shall not oppose <lb/>
            your erecting my statue in the place you desire; though in <lb/>

          <p>I CONGRATULATE both you and the public, most excellent <lb/>
            Emperor, upon the great and glorious victory you have ob­ <lb/>
            tained; so agreeable to the heroism of ancient Rome. May <lb/>
            the immortal gods grant the same happy success to'all your <lb/>
            designs, that, under the administration of so many princely <lb/>
            virtues, the splendour of the empire may shine out, not only <lb/>
            in its former, but with additional lustre.1 <note type="footnote"> forum or square which went by his name seems to have been the most <lb/>
            magnificent. It was built with the foreign spoils be had taken in war. The <lb/>
            covering of this edifice was all brass, the porticoes exceedingly beautiful <lb/>
            and magnificent, with pillars of more than ordinary height and dimensions. <lb/>
            In the centre of this forum was erected the famous pillar which has been <lb/>
            already described. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 It is probable the victory here alluded to was that famous one which <lb/>
            Trajan gained over the Dacians; some account of which has been given <lb/>
            in the notes above. It is certain, at least, Pliny lived to see his wish accom­ <lb/>
            plished, this emperor having carried the Roman splendour to its highest <lb/>
            pitch, and extended the dominions of the empire farther than any of his <lb/>
            predecessors; as after his death it began to decline. M. </note> <pb n="385"/>

          <p>My lieutenant, Servilius Pudens, came to Nicomedia,1 Sir, <lb/>
            on the 24th of November, and by his arrival freed me, at <lb/>

          <p>YOUR generosity to me, Sir, was the occasion of uniting me <lb/>
            to Rosianus Geminus, by the strongest ties; for he was my <lb/>
            quaestor when I was consul. His behaviour to me during <lb/>
            the continuance of our offices was highly respectful, and he has <lb/>
            treated me ever since with so peculiar a regard that, besides <lb/>
            the many obligations I owe him upon a public account, I am <lb/>
            indebted to him for the strongest pledges of private friend­ <lb/>
            ship. I entreat you, then, to comply with my request for <lb/>
            the advancement of one whom (if my recommendation has <lb/>
            any weight) you will even distinguish with your particular <lb/>
            favour; and whatever trust you shall repose in him, he will <lb/>
            endeavour to show himself still deserving of an higher. <lb/>
            But I am the more sparing in my praises of him, being <lb/>
            persuaded his integrity, his probity, and his vigilance are well <lb/>
            known to you, not only from those high posts which he has <lb/>
            exercised in Rome within your immediate inspection, but from <lb/>
            his behaviour when he served under you in the army. One <lb/>
            thing, however, my affection for him inclines me to think, <lb/>
            I have not yet sufficiently done; and therefore, Sir, I repeat <lb/>
            my entreaties that you will give me the pleasure, as early as <lb/>
            possible, of rejoicing in the advancement of my quaestor, or, <lb/>
            in other words, of receiving an addition to my own honours, <lb/>
            in the person of my friend. <note type="footnote"> 1The capital of Bithynia; its modern name is Izmid. </note> <note type="footnote"> 13—HC—Vol. 9 </note> <pb n="386"/>

            here on the way to Rome, that I would detain it till his <lb/>

            there are certain affairs of which you ought to be informed <lb/>
            as soon as possible. In order, therefore, to hasten the des­ <lb/>

          <p>THE ambassador from the king of Sarmatia having re­ <lb/>
            mained two days, by his own choice, at Nicea, I did not <lb/>
            think it reasonable, Sir, to detain him any longer: because, <lb/>
            in the first place, it was still uncertain when your freed­ <lb/>
            man, Lycormas, would arrive, and then again some indis­ <lb/>
            pensable affairs require my presence in a different part of <lb/>
            the province. Of this I thought it necessary that you should <lb/>
            be informed, because I lately acquainted you in a letter that <lb/>
            Lycormas had desired, if any embassy should come this way <lb/>
            from Bosporus, that I would detain it till his arrival. But <lb/>
            I saw no plausible pretext for keeping him back any longer, <lb/>
            especially as the despatches from Lycormas, which (as I <lb/>

          <p>I RECEIVED a letter, Sir, from Apuleius, a military man, <lb/>
            belonging to the garrison at Nicomedia, informing me that <note type="footnote"> 1 The first invention of public couriers is ascribed to Cyrus, who, in order <lb/>

            tances, which supplied men and horses to forward the public despatches. <lb/>
            Augustus was the first who introduced this most useful institution among <lb/>

            the purpose of political intelligence. The magistrates of every city were </note> <lb/>

            one Callidromus, being arrested by Maximus and Dionysius <lb/>
            (two bakers, to whom he had hired himself), fled for refuge <lb/>
            to your statue;1 that, being brought before a magistrate, <lb/>
            he declared he was formerly slave to Laberius Maximus, <lb/>
            but being taken prisoner by Susagus* in Moesia,8 he was <lb/>
            sent as a present from Decebalus to Pacorus, king of <lb/>
            Parthia, in whose service he continued several years, from <lb/>
            whence he made his escape, and came to Nicomedia. When <lb/>
            he was examined before me, he confirmed this account, for <lb/>
            which reason I thought it necessary to send4 him to you. <lb/>
            This I should have done sooner, but I delayed his journey <lb/>
            in order to make an inquiry concerning a seal ring which <lb/>
            he said was taken from him, upon which was engraven the <lb/>
            figure of Pacorus in his royal robes; I was desirous (if it <lb/>
            could have been found) of transmitting this curiosity to <lb/>
            you, with a small gold nugget which he says he brought <lb/>
            from out of the Parthian mines. I have affixed my seal to <lb/>

          <p>YOUR freedman and procurator,6 Maximus, behaved, Sir, <lb/>
            during all the time we were together, with great probity, <lb/>
            attention, and diligence; as one strongly attached to your <note type="footnote"> obliged to furnish horses for these messengers, upon producing a diploma, <lb/>
            or a kind of warrant, either from the emperor himself or from those who <lb/>
            had that authority under him. Sometimes, though upon very extraordinary <lb/>
            occasions, persons who travelled upon their private affairs, were allowed the <lb/>
            use of these post-chaises. It is surprising they were not sooner used for <lb/>
            the purposes of commerce and private communication. Louis XI. first es­ <lb/>
            tablished them in France, in the year 1474; but it was not till the 12th of <lb/>
            Car. II. that the post-office was settled in England by Act of Parliament. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Particular temples, altars, and statues were allowed among the Romans <lb/>

            This custom was introduced by Romulus, who borrowed it probably from <lb/>
            the Greeks; but during the free state of Rome, few of these asylums were <lb/>
            permitted. This custom prevailed most under the emperors, till it grew so <lb/>

            the advantages of your discipline that he has learned to <lb/>

            the ease of retirement, he shared, and continues to share, <lb/>

            And I will add, Sir, that I shall rejoice in any accession of <lb/>

          <p>I BEG your determination, Sir, on a point I am exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly doubtful about: it is whether I should place the public <lb/>
            slaves1 as sentries round the prisons of the several cities in <lb/>
            this province (as has been hitherto the practice) or employ <lb/>
            a party of soldiers for that purpose? On the one hand, I <lb/>
            am afraid the public slaves will not attend this duty with the <lb/>
            fidelity they ought; and on the other, that it will engage too <lb/>
            large a body of the soldiery. In the meanwhile I have <lb/>
            joined a few of the latter with the former. I am appre­ <lb/>
            hensive, however, there may be some danger that this <lb/>
            method will occasion a general neglect of duty, as it will <lb/>
            afford them a mutual opportunity of throwing the blame <lb/>

          <p>THERE is no occasion, my dearest Secundus, to draw off <lb/>
            any soldiers in order to guard the prisons. Let us rather <lb/>
            persevere in the ancient customs observed in this province, <lb/>
            of employing the public slaves for that purpose; and the <lb/>
            fidelity with which they shall execute their duty will depend <lb/>
            much upon your care and strict discipline. It is greatly to <note type="footnote"> 1 Slaves who were purchased by the public. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            be feared, as you observe, if the soldiers should be mixed <lb/>
            with the public slaves, they will mutually trust to each <lb/>
            other, and by that means grow so much the more negligent. <lb/>
            But my principal objection is that as few soldiers as possible <lb/>
            should be withdrawn from their standard.</p>

          <p>THE Prusenses, Sir, having an ancient bath which lies in <lb/>
            a ruinous state, desire your leave to repair it; but, upon <lb/>
            examination, I am of opinion it ought to be rebuilt. I <lb/>
            think, therefore, you may indulge them in this request, as <lb/>
            there will be a sufficient fund for that purpose, partly from <lb/>
            those debts which are due from private persons to the public <lb/>
            which I am now collecting in; and partly from what they <lb/>
            raise among themselves towards furnishing the bath with <lb/>
            oil, which they are willing to apply to the carrying on of <lb/>
            this building; a work which the dignity of the city and the <lb/>
            splendour of your times seem to demand.</p>

          <p>IF the erecting a public bath will not be too great a charge <lb/>
            upon the Prusenses, we may comply with their request; pro­ <lb/>
            vided, however, that no new tax be levied for this purpose, <lb/>
            nor any of those taken off which are appropriated to <lb/>
            necessary services.</p>

          <p>I AM assured, Sir, by your freedman and receiver-general <lb/>
            Maximus, that it is necessary he should have a party of <lb/>
            soldiers assigned to him, over and besides the beneficiarii, <lb/>
            which by your orders I allotted to the very worthy Gemel­ <lb/>
            linus. Those therefore which I found in his service, I <lb/>
            thought proper he should retain, especially as he was going <lb/>
             <pb n="393"/>
            into Paphlagonia, in order to procure corn. For his better <lb/>
            protection likewise, and because it was his request, I added <lb/>
            two of the cavalry. But I beg you would inform me, in <lb/>
            your next despatches, what method you would have me <lb/>
            observe for the future in points of this nature.</p>

          <p>As my freedman Maximus was going upon an extraordi­ <lb/>
            nary commission to procure corn, I approve of your having <lb/>
            supplied him with a file of soldiers. But when he- shall <lb/>
            return to the duties of his former post, I think two from <lb/>
            you and as many from his coadjutor, my receiver-general <lb/>
            Virdius Gemellinus, will be sufficient.</p>

          <p>THE very excellent young man Sempronius Caelianus, <lb/>
            having discovered two slaves2 among the recruits, has sent <lb/>
            them to me. But I deferred passing sentence till I had con­ <lb/>
            sulted you, the restorer and upholder of military discipline, <lb/>
            concerning the punishment proper to be inflicted upon them. <lb/>
            My principal doubt is that, whether, although they have <lb/>
            taken the military oath, they are yet entered into any par­ <lb/>
            ticular legion. I request you therefore, Sir, to inform me <note type="footnote"> 1 A province in Asia Minor, bounded by the Black Sea on the north, <lb/>
            Bithynia on the west, Pontus on the east, and Phrygia on the south. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Roman policy excluded slaves from entering into military service, <lb/>
            and it was death if they did so. However, upon cases of great necessity, <lb/>
            this maxim was dispensed with; but then they were first made free before <lb/>
            they were received into the army, excepting only (as Servius in his notes <lb/>
            upon Virgil) observes after the fatal battle of Cannae; when the public dis­ <lb/>
            tress was so great that the Romans recruited their army with their slaves, <lb/>
            though they had not time to give them their freedom. One reason, perhaps, <lb/>
            of this policy might be that they did not think it safe to arm so consider­ <lb/>
            able a body of men, whose numbers, in the times when the Roman luxury <lb/>
            was at its highest, we may have some idea of by the instance which Pliny <lb/>
            the naturalist mentions of Claudius Isodorus, who at the time of his death <lb/>
            was possessed of no less than 4,116 slaves, notwithstanding he had lost great <lb/>
            numbers in the civil wars. Plin. Hist. Nat. xxxiii. 10. M. </note> <lb/>

          <p>SEMPRONIUS CAELINUS has acted agreeably to my orders, <lb/>
            in sending such persons to be tried before you as appear to <lb/>
            deserve capital punishment. It is material however, in <lb/>
            the case in question, to inquire whether these slaves in­ <lb/>
            listed themselves voluntarily, or were chosen by the officers, <lb/>
            or presented as substitutes for others. If they were chosen, <lb/>
            the officer is guilty; if they are substitutes, the blame rests <lb/>
            with those who deputed them; but if, conscious of the legal <lb/>
            inabilities of their station, they presented themselves volun­ <lb/>
            tarily, the punishment must fall upon their own heads. That <lb/>
            they are not yet entered into any legion, makes no great <lb/>
            difference in their case; for they ought to have given a true <lb/>
            account of themselves immediately, upon their being ap­ <lb/>
            proved as fit for the service.</p>

          <p>As I have your permission, Sir, to address myself to you <lb/>
            in all my doubts, you will not consider it beneath your <lb/>
            dignity to descend to those humbler affairs which concern <lb/>
            my administration of this province. I find there are in <lb/>
            several cities, particularly those of Nicomedia and Nicea, <lb/>
            certain persons who take upon themselves to act as public <lb/>
            slaves, and receive an annual stipend accordingly; notwith­ <lb/>
            standing they have been condemned either to the mines, the <lb/>
            public games,1 or other punishments of the like nature. Hav­ <lb/>
            ing received information of this abuse I have been long <lb/>
            debating with myself what I ought to do. On the one <note type="footnote"> 1 A punishment among the Romans, usually inflicted upon slaves, by which <lb/>
            they were to engage with wild beasts, or perform the part of gladiator, it <lb/>

            hand, to send them back again to their respective punish­ <lb/>
            ments (many of them being now grown old, and behaving, <lb/>
            as I am assured, with sobriety and modesty) would, I <lb/>
            thought, be proceeding against them too severely; on the <lb/>
            other, to retain convicted criminals in the public service, <lb/>
            seemed not altogether decent. I considered at the same <lb/>
            time to support these people in idleness would be an use­ <lb/>
            less expense to the public; and to leave them to starve <lb/>
            would be dangerous. I was obliged therefore to suspend <lb/>
            the determination of this matter till I could consult with <lb/>
            you. You will be desirous, perhaps, to be informed how <lb/>
            -it happened that these persons escaped the punishments to <lb/>
            which they were condemned. This enquiry I have also <lb/>
            made, but cannot return you any satisfactory answer. The <lb/>
            decrees against them were indeed produced; but no record <lb/>
            appears of their having ever been reversed. It was as­ <lb/>
            serted, however, that these people were pardoned upon their <lb/>
            petition to the proconsuls, or their lieutenants; which seems <lb/>
            likely to be the truth, as it is improbable any person would <lb/>
            have dared to set them at liberty without authority.</p>

            <title type="sub">XLI TRAJAN TO PLINY</title>

          <p>You will remember you were sent into Bithynia for the <lb/>
            particular purpose of correcting those many abuses which <lb/>
            appeared in need of reform. Now none stands more so <lb/>
            than that of criminals who have been sentenced to punish­ <lb/>
            ment should not only be set at liberty (as your letter in­ <lb/>
            forms me) without authority, but even appointed to em­ <lb/>
            ployments which ought only to be exercised by persons <lb/>
            whose characters are irreproachable. Those therefore <lb/>
            among them who have been convicted within these ten <lb/>
            years, and whose sentence has not been reversed by proper <lb/>
            authority, must be sent back again to their respective punish­ <lb/>
            ments: but where more than ten years have elapsed since <lb/>
            their conviction, and they are grown old and infirm, let <lb/>
            them be disposed of in such employments as are but few <lb/>
            degrees removed from the punishments to which they were <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            sentenced; that is, either to attend upon the public baths, <lb/>
            cleanse the common sewers, or repair the streets and high­ <lb/>
            ways, the usual offices assigned to such persons.</p>

          <p>WHILE I was making a progress in a different part of the <lb/>
            province, a most extensive fire broke out at Nicomedia, <lb/>
            which not only consumed several private houses, but also <lb/>
            two public buildings; the town-house and the temple of <lb/>
            Isis, though they stood on contrary sides of the street. <lb/>
            The occasion of its spreading thus far was partly owing <lb/>
            to the violence of the wind, and partly to the indolence <lb/>
            of the people, who, manifestly, stood idle and motionless <lb/>
            spectators of this terrible calamity. The truth is. the city <lb/>
            was not furnished with either engines,1 buckets, or any <lb/>
            single instrument suitable for extinguishing fires; which <lb/>
            I have now however given directions to have prepared. <lb/>
            You will consider, Sir, whether it may not be advisable <lb/>
            to institute a company of fire-men, consisting only of one <lb/>
            hundred and fifty members. I will take care none but those <lb/>
            of that business shall be admitted into it, and that the <lb/>
            privileges granted them shall not be applied to any other <lb/>
            purpose. As this corporate body will be restricted to so <lb/>
            small a number of members, it will be easy to keep them <lb/>
            under proper regulation.</p>

          <p>You are of opinion it would be proper to establish a com­ <lb/>
            pany of fire-men in Nicomedia, agreeably to what has been <note type="footnote"> 1 It has been generally imagined that the ancients had not the art of raising <lb/>
            water by engines; but this passage seems to favour thecontrary opinion. <lb/>
            The word in the original is sipho, which Hesychius explains (as one of the <lb/>
            commentators observes) It instrumentum ad jaculandas aquas adversus in­ <lb/>
            cendia; ” “ an instrument to throw up water against fires." But there is <lb/>
            a passage in Seneca which seems to put this matter beyond conjecture, <lb/>
            though none of the critics upon this place have taken notice of it: "Sole­ <lb/>
            mus, says he, It duabus manibus inter so junctis aquam concipere, et com­ </note> <lb/>

            practised in several other cities. But it is to be remembered <lb/>
            that societies of this sort have greatly disturbed the peace <lb/>
            of the province in general, and of those cities in particular. <lb/>
            Whatever name we give them, and for whatever purposes <lb/>
            they may be founded, they will not fail to form themselves <lb/>
            into factious assemblies, however short their meetings may <lb/>
            be. It will therefore be safer to provide such machines <lb/>
            as are of service in extinguishing fires, enjoining the owners <lb/>
            of houses to assist in preventing the mischief from spread­ <lb/>
            ing, and, if it should be necessary, to call in the aid of the <lb/>

          <p>THE citizens of Nicomedia, Sir, have expended three mil­ <lb/>
            lions three hundred and twenty-nine sesterces2 in building <note type="footnote"> pressa utrinque palma in tnodum siphonis exprimere" (Q. N. 1. ii. 16); <lb/>
            where we plainly see the use of this sipho was to throw up water, and <lb/>
            consequently the Romans were acquainted with that art. The account which <lb/>
            Pliny gives of his fountains at Tuscum is likewise another evident proof. At. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This was an anniversary custom observed throughout the empire on the <lb/>

            an aqueduct; but, not being able to finish it, the works are <lb/>
            entirely falling to ruin. They made a second attempt in <lb/>
            another place, where they laid out two millions.' But this <lb/>
            likewise is discontinued; so that, after having been at an <lb/>
            immense charge to no purpose, they must still be at a <lb/>
            further expense, in order to be accommodated with water. I <lb/>
            have examined a fine spring from whence the water may <lb/>
            be conveyed over arches (as was attempted in their first <lb/>
            design) in such a manner that the higher as well as level <lb/>
            and low parts of the city may be supplied. There are still <lb/>
            remaining a very few of the old arches; and the square <lb/>
            stones, however, employed in the former building, may be <lb/>
            used in turning the new arches. I am of opinion part <lb/>
            should be raised with brick, as that will be the easier and <lb/>
            cheaper material. But that this work may not meet with <lb/>
            the same ill-success as the former, it will be necessary to <lb/>
            send here an architect, or some one skilled in the con­ <lb/>
            struction of this kind of waterworks. And I will venture <lb/>
            to say, from the beauty and usefulness of the design, it will <lb/>
            be an erection well worthy the splendour of your times.</p>

          <p>THE citizens of Nicea, Sir, are building a theatre, which, <lb/>
            though it is not yet finished, has already exhausted, as I <lb/>
            am informed (for I have not examined the account myself), <lb/>
            above ten millions of sesterces;1 and, what is worse, I fear <lb/>
            to no purpose. For either from the foundation being laid <lb/>
            in soft, marshy ground, or that the stone itself is light and <lb/>
            crumbling, the walls are sinking, and cracked from top to <lb/>
            bottom. It deserves your consideration, therefore, whether <lb/>
            it would be best to carry on this work, or entirely discon­ <lb/>
            tinue it, or rather, perhaps, whether it would not be most <lb/>
            prudent absolutely to destroy it: for the buttresses and foun­ <lb/>
            dations by means of which it is from time to time kept up <lb/>
            appear to me more expensive than solid. Several private per­ <lb/>
            sons have undertaken to build the compartment of this theatre <lb/>
            at their own expense, some engaging to erect the portico, <lb/>
            others the galleries over the pit:' but this design cannot be <lb/>
            executed, as the principal building which ought first to be <lb/>
            completed is now at a stand. This city is also rebuilding, upon <lb/>
            a far more enlarged plan, the gymnasium,3 which was burnt <lb/>
            down before my arrival in the province. They have already <lb/>
            been at some (and, I rather fear, a fruitless) expense. The <lb/>
            structure is not only irregular and ill-proportioned, but the <lb/>
            present architect (who, it must be owned, is a rival to the <lb/>
            person who was first employed) asserts that the walls, al­ <lb/>
            though twenty-two feet4 in thickness, are not strong enough <lb/>
            to support the superstructure, as the interstices are filled <lb/>
            up with quarrystones, and the walls are not overlaid with <note type="footnote"> 1 About $400,000. To those who are not acquainted with the immense <lb/>
            riches of the ancients, it may seem incredible that a city, and not the <lb/>
            capital one either, of a conquered province should expend so large a sum <lb/>
            of money upon only the shell (as it appears to be) of a theatre: but Asia <lb/>
            was esteemed the most considerable part of the world for wealth; its fer­ <lb/>
            tility and exportations (as Tully observes) exceeding that of all other <lb/>
            countries. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The word cavea, in the original, comprehends more than what we call <lb/>

            The fund appropriated for the carrying on of this work <lb/>
            arises from the money which those honorary members you <lb/>
            were pleased to add to the senate paid (or, at least, are <lb/>

            any pecuniary consideration) your bounty in that of Nico­ <lb/>

            an architect to inspect, not only the theatre, but the bath; in <lb/>
            order to consider whether, after all the expense which has <lb/>
            already been laid out, it will be better to finish them upon the <lb/>
            present plan, or alter the one, and remove the other, in as <lb/>
            far as may seem necessary: for otherwise we may perhaps <lb/>
            throw away our future cost in endeavouring not to lose what <lb/>
            we have already expended.</p>

            the theatre which the inhabitants of Nicea are building; <lb/>
            as for myself, it will be sufficient if you let me know your <lb/>
            determination. With respect to the particular parts of this <lb/>
            theatre which are to be raised at a private charge, you will <lb/>
            see those engagements fulfilled when the body of the build­ <lb/>

            These paltry Greeks1 are, I know, immoderately fond of <lb/>
            gymnastic diversions, and therefore, perhaps, the citizens of <lb/>
            Nicea have planned a more magnificent building for this <lb/>

            tion, and the magnanimity of your spirit, nothing, I am <lb/>
            persuaded, can be. more suitable to both than to point out <lb/>
            to you such works as are worthy of your glorious and <lb/>
            immortal name, as being no less useful than magnificent. <lb/>
            Bordering upon the territories of the city of Nicomedia is <lb/>
            a most extensive lake; over which marbles, fruits, woods, <lb/>
            and all kinds of materials, the commodities of the country, <lb/>
            are brought over in boats up to the high-road, at little <lb/>
            trouble and expense, but from thence are conveyed in car­ <lb/>
            riages to the sea-side, at a much greater charge and with <lb/>
            great labour. To remedy this inconvenience, many hands <lb/>
            will be in request; but upon such an occasion they cannot <lb/>
            be wanting: for the country, and particularly the city, is ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly populous; and one may assuredly hope that every <lb/>
            person will readily engage in a work which will be of uni­ <lb/>
            versal benefit. It only remains then to send hither, if you <lb/>
            shall think proper, a surveyor or an architect, in order to <lb/>
            examine whether the lake lies above the level of the sea; <lb/>
            the engineers of this province being of opinion that the <lb/>
            former is higher by forty cubits.1 I find there is in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood of this place a large canal, which was cut by <lb/>
            a king of this country; but as it is left unfinished, it is <lb/>
            uncertain whether it was for the purpose of draining the <lb/>
            adjacent fields, or making a communication between the lake <note type="footnote"> 1 A Roman cubit is equal to i foot 5.406 inches of our measure. Arbuth­ <lb/>

            and the river. It is equally doubtful too whether the death <lb/>
            of the king, or the despair of being able to accomplish the <lb/>
            design, prevented the completion of it. If this was the rea­ <lb/>
            son, I am so much the more eager and warmly desirous, <lb/>
            for the sake of your illustrious character (and I hope you <lb/>

          <p>THERE is something in the scheme you propose of opening <lb/>
            a communication between the lake and the sea, which may, <lb/>
            perhaps, tempt me to consent. But you must first carefully <lb/>
            examine the situation of this body of water, what quantity <lb/>
            it contains, and from whence it is supplied; lest, by giving <lb/>
            it an opening into the sea, it should be totally drained. <lb/>
            You may apply to Calpurnius Macer for an engineer, and I <lb/>
            will also send you from hence some one skilled in works of <lb/>
            this nature.</p>

          <p>UPON examining into the public expenses of the city of <lb/>
            Byzantium, which, I find, are extremely great, I was in­ <lb/>
            formed, Sir, that the appointments of the ambassador whom <lb/>
            they send yearly to you with their homage, and the decree <lb/>
            which passes in the senate upon that occasion, amount to <lb/>
            twelve thousand sesterces.1 But knowing the generous <lb/>
            maxims of your government, I thought proper to send the <lb/>
            decree without the ambassador, that, at the same time they <lb/>
            discharged their public duty to you, their expense incurred <lb/>
            in the manner of paying it might be lightened. This city <lb/>
            is likewise taxed with the sum of three thousand sesterces' <lb/>
            towards defraying the expense of an envoy, whom they <lb/>
            annually send to compliment the governor of Moesia: this <lb/>
            expense I have also directed to be spared. I beg, Sir, you <note type="footnote"> 1 About $480.</note> <note type="footnote">2 About $120. </note> <lb/>

            would deign either to confirm my judgment or correct my <lb/>

            sesterces in sending an ambassador to me. I shall esteem <lb/>
            their duty as sufficiently paid, though I only receive the <lb/>
            act of their senate through your hands. The governor of <lb/>

            diplomas the dates of which are expired shall continue in <lb/>
            force, and for how long? For I am apprehensive I may, <lb/>
            through ignorance, either confirm such of these instruments <lb/>

          <p>THE Nicomedians, Sir, before my arrival in this province, <lb/>
            had begun to build a new forum adjoining their former, in <lb/>
            a corner of which stands an ancient temple dedicated to <note type="footnote"> 1 A city in Bithynia. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            the mother of the gods.1 This fabric must either be re­ <lb/>
            paired or removed, and for this reason chiefly, because it <lb/>
            is a much lower building than that very lofty one which <lb/>
            is now in process of erection. Upon enquiry whether this <lb/>
            temple had been consecrated, I was informed that their <lb/>
            ceremonies of dedication differ from ours. You will be <lb/>
            pleased therefore, Sir, to consider whether a temple which <lb/>
            has not been consecrated according to our rites may be <lb/>
            removed,2 consistently with the reverence due to religion: <lb/>
            for, if there should be no objection from that quarter, the <lb/>
            removal in every other respect would be extremely con­ <lb/>

            gods, from the place where it now stands, to any other spot <lb/>
            more convenient. You need be under no difficulty with <lb/>
            respect to the act of dedication; for the ground of a foreign <lb/>

            but I am afraid the money must lie unemployed. For as <lb/>
            on one side there are few or no opportunities of purchasing <lb/>
            land, so, on the other, one cannot meet with any person <lb/>
            who is willing to borrow of the public1 (especially at 12 <lb/>
            per cent. interest) when they can raise money upon the <lb/>
            same terms from private sources. You will consider then, <lb/>
            Sir, whether it may not be advisable, in order to invite <lb/>
            responsible persons to take this money, to lower the interest; <lb/>
            or if that scheme should not succeed, to place it in the hands <lb/>
            of the decurii, upon their giving sufficient security to the <lb/>
            public. And though they should not be willing to receive <lb/>
            it, yet as the rate of interest will be diminished, the hard­ <lb/>
            ship will be so much the less.</p>

          <p>I AGREE with you, my dear Pliny, that there seems to be <lb/>
            no other method of facilitating the placing out of the public <lb/>
            money than by lowering the interest; the measure of which <note type="footnote"> 1 The reason why they did not choose to borrow of the public at the <lb/>
            same rate of interest which they paid to private persons was (as one of the <lb/>
            commentators observes) because in the former instance they were obliged <lb/>
            to give security, whereas in the latter they could raise money upon their <lb/>
            personal credit. M. </note> <lb/>

            you will determine according to the number of the borrow­ <lb/>
            ers. But to compel persons to receive it who are not dis­ <lb/>
            posed to do so, when possibly they themselves may have <lb/>
            no opportunity of employing it, is by no means consistent <lb/>

          <p>I RETURN you my warmest acknowledgments, Sir, that, <lb/>
            among the many important occupations in which you are <lb/>
            engaged you have condescended to be my guide on those <lb/>
            points on which I have consulted you: a favour which I <lb/>
            must now again beseech you to grant me. A certain <lb/>
            person presented himself with a complaint that his ad­ <lb/>
            versaries, who had been banished for three years by the <lb/>
            illustrious Servilius Calvus, still remained in the province: <lb/>
            they, on the contrary, affirmed that Calvus had revoked <lb/>
            their sentence, and produced his edict to that effect. I <lb/>
            thought it necessary therefore to refer the whole affair to <lb/>
            you. For as I have your express orders not to restore any <lb/>
            person who has been sentenced to banishment either by <lb/>
            myself or others so I have no, directions with respect to <lb/>
            those who, having been banished by some of my prede­ <lb/>
            cessors in this government, have by them also been restored. <lb/>
            It is necessary for me, therefore, to be- you would inform <lb/>
            me, Sir, how I am to act with regard to the above-mentioned <lb/>
            persons, as well as others, who, after having been con­ <lb/>
            demned to perpetual banishment, have been found in the <lb/>
            province without permission to return; for cases of that <lb/>
            nature have likewise fallen under my cognisance. A person <lb/>
            was brought before me who had been sentenced to perpetual <lb/>
            exile by the proconsul Julius Bassus, but knowing that the <lb/>
            acts of Bassus, during his administration, had been rescinded, <lb/>
            and that the senate had granted leave to all those who had <lb/>
            fallen under his condemnation of appealing from his decision <lb/>

            or whether you think some more severe and what kind of <lb/>
            punishment should be inflicted upon him, and such others who <lb/>
            may hereafter be found under the same circumstances. I <lb/>

          <p>I WILL let you know my determination concerning those <lb/>
            exiles which were banished for three years by the pro­ <lb/>
            consul P. Servilius Calvus, and soon afterwards restored to <lb/>
            the province by his edict, when I shall have informed my­ <lb/>
            self from him of the reasons of this proceeding. With <lb/>
            respect to that person who was sentenced to perpetual <lb/>
            banishment by Julius Bassus, yet continued to remain in <lb/>
            the province, without making his appeal if he thought <lb/>
            himself aggrieved (though he had two years given him for <lb/>
            that purpose), I would have sent in chains to my praetorian <lb/>
            prefects:1 for, only to remand him back to a punishment <lb/>
            which he has contumaciously eluded will by no means be <lb/>

          <p>WHEN I cited the judges, Sir, to attend me at a sessions' <lb/>
            which I was going to hold, Flavius Archippus claimed the <lb/>
            privilege of being excused as exercising the profession of <lb/>
            a philosopher.' It was alleged by some who were present <lb/>
            that he ought not only to be excused from that office, but <note type="footnote"> 1 These, in the original institution as settled by Augustus, were only <lb/>

            even struck out of the rolls of judges, and remanded back to <lb/>
            the punishment from which he had escaped, by breaking <lb/>
            his chains. At the same time a sentence of the proconsul <lb/>
            Velius Paullus was read, by which it appeared that Ar­ <lb/>
            chippus had been condemned to the mines for forgery. He <lb/>
            had nothing to produce in proof of this sentence having <lb/>
            ever been reversed. He alleged, however, in favour of his <lb/>
            restitution, a petition which he presented to Domitian, <lb/>
            together with a letter from that prince, and a decree of <lb/>
            the Prusensians in his honour. To these he subjoined a <lb/>
            letter which he had received from you; as also an edict <lb/>
            and a letter of your august father confirming the grants <lb/>
            which had been made to him by Domitian. For these <lb/>

          <p>IT is possible that Domitian might have been ignorant <lb/>
            of the circumstances in which Archippus was when he wrote <lb/>
            the letter so much to that philosopher's credit. However, <lb/>

            especially since he so often had the honour of a statue de­ <lb/>

          <p>THE apprehensions you express, Sir, that the lake will <lb/>
            be in danger of being entirely drained if a communication <lb/>
            should be opened between that and the sea, by means of <lb/>
            the river, are agreeable to that prudence and forethought <lb/>
            you so eminently possess; but I think I have found a <lb/>
            method to obviate that inconvenience. A channel may be <lb/>
            cut from the lake up to the river so as not quite to join <lb/>
            them, leaving just a narrow strip of land between, pre­ <lb/>
            serving the lake; by this means it will not only be kept <lb/>
            quite separate from the river, but all the same purposes <lb/>
            will be answered as if they were united: for it will be <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            extremely easy to convey over that little intervening ridge <lb/>
            whatever goods shall be brought down by the canal. This <lb/>
            is a scheme which may be pursued, if it should be found <lb/>
            necessary; but I hope there will be no occasion to have re­ <lb/>
            course to it. For, in the first place, the lake itself is pretty <lb/>
            deep; and in the next, by damming up the river which runs <lb/>
            from it on the opposite side and turning its course as we <lb/>
            shall find expedient, the same quantity of water may be <lb/>
            retained. Besides, there are several brooks near the place <lb/>
            where it is proposed the channel shall be cut which, if <lb/>
            skilfully collected, will supply the lake with water in pro­ <lb/>
            portion to what it shall discharge. But if you should rather <lb/>
            approve of the channel's being extended farther and cut <lb/>
            narrower, and so conveyed directly into the sea, without <lb/>
            running into the river, the reflux of the tide will return <lb/>
            whatever it receives from the lake. After all, if the nature <lb/>
            of the place should not admit of any of these schemes, the <lb/>
            course of the water may be checked by sluices. These, how­ <lb/>
            ever, and many other particulars, will be more skilfully <lb/>
            examined into by the engineer, whom, indeed, Sir, you <lb/>
            ought to send, according to your promise, for it is an enter­ <lb/>
            prise well worthy of your attention and magnificence. In <lb/>
            the meanwhile, I have written to the illustrious Calpurnius <lb/>

          <p>A VERY considerable question, Sir, in which the whole <lb/>

            the state! and maintenance of deserted children.2 I have <lb/>
            examined the constitutions of former princes upon this <lb/>
            head, but not finding anything in them relating, either in <lb/>
            general or particular, to the Bithynians, I thought it <lb/>
            necessary to apply to you for your directions: for in a point <lb/>
            which seems to require the special interposition of your <lb/>
            authority, I could not content myself with following prec­ <lb/>
            edents. An edict of the emperor Augustus (as pretended) <lb/>
            was read to me, concerning one Annia; as also a letter from <lb/>
            Vespasian to the Lacedaemonians, and another from Titus to <lb/>
            the same, with one likewise from him to the Achaeans, also <lb/>
            some letters from Domitian, directed to the proconsuls <lb/>
            Avidius Nigrinus and Armenius Brocchus, together with one <lb/>
            from that prince to the Lacedaemonians: but I have not <lb/>
            transmitted them to you, as they were not correct (and some <lb/>
            of them too of doubtful authenticity), and also because I im­ <lb/>

          <p>THE question concerning children who were exposed by <lb/>

            educated in a state of servitude, though born free, has been <lb/>
            frequently discussed; but I do not find in the constitutions <lb/>
            of the princes my predecessors any general regulation upon <lb/>
            this head, extending to all the provinces. There are, indeed, <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, whether they should be considered in a state of freedom or <lb/>

            other reasons of the same kind, I thought proper, Sir, know­ <lb/>

          <p>I HAVE enquired, Sir, at Prusa, for a proper place on <lb/>
            which to erect the bath you were pleased to allow that <lb/>
            city to build, and I have found one to my satisfaction. It <lb/>
            is upon the site where formerly, I am told, stood a very <lb/>
            beautiful mansion, but which is now entirely fallen into <lb/>
            ruins. By fixing upon that spot, we shall gain the advan­ <lb/>
            tage of ornamenting the city in a part which at present is <lb/>
            exceedingly deformed, and enlarging it at the same time <lb/>
            without removing any of the buildings; only restoring one <lb/>
            which is fallen to decay. There are some circumstances <lb/>
            attending this structure of which it is proper I should inform <lb/>
            you. Claudius Polyaenus bequeathed it to the emperor <lb/>
            Claudius Caesar, with directions that a temple should be <lb/>
            erected to that prince in a colonnade-court, and that the <lb/>
            remainder of the house should be let in apartments. The <lb/>
            city received the rents for a considerable time; but partly <lb/>
            by its having been plundered, and partly by its being neg­ <lb/>
            lected, the whole house, colonnade-court, and all, is entirely <lb/>
            gone to ruin, and there is now scarcely anything remaining <lb/>
            of it but the ground upon which it stood. If you shall think <lb/>
            proper, Sir, either to give or sell this spot of ground to the <lb/>
            city, as it lies so conveniently for their purpose, they will <lb/>
            receive it as a most particular favour. I intend, with your <lb/>
            permission, to place the bath in the vacant area, and to <lb/>
            extend a range of porticoes with seats in that part where <lb/>
            the former edifice stood. This new erection I purpose dedi­ <lb/>

          <p>THE circumstances of the city of Byzantium are such, by <lb/>
            the great confluence of strangers to it, that I held it in­ <lb/>
            cumbent upon me, and consistent with the customs of <lb/>
            former reigns, to send thither a legionary centurion's guard <lb/>
            to preserve the privileges of that state. But if we should <lb/>
            distinguish the city of Juliopolis in the same way, it will <lb/>
            be introducing a precedent for many others, whose claim <lb/>
            to that favour will rise in proportion to their want of <lb/>
            strength. I have so much confidence, however, in your <lb/>
            administration as to believe you will omit no method of <lb/>
            protecting them from injuries. If any persons shall act <lb/>
            contrary to the discipline I have enjoined, let them be <lb/>
            instantly corrected; or if they happen to be soldiers, and <lb/>
            their crimes should be too enormous for immediate chas­ <lb/>
            tisement, I would have them sent to their officers, with an <lb/>
            account of the particular misdemeanour you shall find they <lb/>
            have been guilty of; but if the delinquents should be on <lb/>

          <p>By a law of Pompey's2 concerning the Bithynians, it is <lb/>
            enacted, Sir, that no person shall be a magistrate, or be <note type="footnote"> 1 Gordium, the old capital of Phrygia. It afterwards, in the reign of <lb/>
            the Emperor Augustus, received the name of Juliopolis. (See Smith's <lb/>
            Classical Diet.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pompey the Great having subdued Mithridates, and by that means greatly </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="419"/>
            chosen into the senate, under the age of thirty. By the <lb/>
            same law it is declared that those who have exercised the <lb/>
            office of magistrate are qualified to be members of the senate. <lb/>
            Subsequent to this law, the emperor Augustus published <lb/>
            an edict, by which it was ordained that persons of the age <lb/>
            of twenty-two should be capable of being magistrates. <lb/>
            The question therefore is whether those who have exercised <lb/>
            the functions of a magistrate before the age of thirty may <lb/>
            be legally chosen into the senate by the censors?2 And <lb/>
            if so, whether, by the same kind of construction, they may <lb/>
            be elected senators, at the age which entitles them to be <lb/>
            magistrates, though they should net actually have borne <lb/>
            any office? A custom which, it seems, has hitherto been <lb/>
            observed, and is said to be expedient, as it is rather better <lb/>
            that persons of noble birth should be admitted into the <lb/>
            senate than those of plebeian rank. The censors elect having <lb/>
            desired my sentiments upon this point, I was of opinion <lb/>
            that both by the law of Pompey and the edict of Augustus <lb/>
            those who had exercised the magistracy before the age of <lb/>
            thirty might be chosen into the senate; and for this <lb/>
            reason, because the edict allows the office of magistrate to <lb/>
            be undertaken before thirty; and the law declares that <lb/>
            whoever has been a magistrate should be eligible for the <lb/>
            senate. But with respect to those who never discharged <lb/>
            any office in the state, though they were of the age required <lb/>
            for that purpose, I had some doubt: and therefore, Sir, <lb/>
            I apply to you for your directions. I have subjoined to <lb/>
            this letter the heads of the law, together with the edict of <lb/>
            Augustus.</p>

          <p>T AGREE with you, my dearest Secundus, in your con­ <lb/>
            struction, and am of opinion that the law of Pompey is so <lb/>
            far repealed by the edict of the emperor Augustus that <note type="footnote"> enlarged the Roman empire, passed several laws relating to the newly con­ <lb/>
            quered provinces, and, among others, that which is here mentioned. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The right of electing senators did not originally belong to the censors, <lb/>
            who were only, as Cicero somewhere calls them, guardians of the discipline <lb/>
            and manners of the city; but in process of time they engrossed the whole <lb/>
            privilege of conferring that honour. M. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="420"/>
            those persons who are not less than twenty-two years of <lb/>
            age may execute the office of magistrates, and, when they <lb/>
            have, may be received into the senate of their respective <lb/>
            cities. But I think that they who are under thirty years <lb/>
            of age, and have not discharged the function of a magis­ <lb/>
            trate, cannot, upon pretence that in point of years they <lb/>
            were competent to the office, legally be elected into the <lb/>
            senate of their several communities.</p>

          <p>WHILST I was despatching some public affairs, Sir, at my <lb/>
            apartments in Prusa, at the foot of Olympus, with the in­ <lb/>
            tention of leaving that city the same day, the magistrate <lb/>
            Asclepiades informed me that Eumolpus had appealed to <lb/>
            me from a motion which Cocceianus Dion made in their <lb/>
            senate. Dion, it seems, having been appointed supervisor <lb/>
            of a public building, desired that it might be assigned1 to <lb/>
            the city in form. Eumolpus, who was counsel for Flavius <lb/>
            Archippus, insisted that Dion should first be required to <lb/>
            deliver in his accounts relating to this work, before it was <lb/>
            assigned to the corporation; suggesting that he had not <lb/>
            acted in the manner he ought. He added, at the same time, <lb/>
            that in this building, in which your statue is erected, the <lb/>
            bodies of Dion's wife and son are entombed,2 and urged <lb/>
            me to hear this cause in the public court of judicature. <lb/>
            Upon my at once assenting to his request, and deferring <lb/>
            my journey for that purpose, he desired a longer day in <lb/>
            order to prepare matters for hearing, and that I would try <lb/>
            this cause in some other city. I appointed the city of Nicea; <lb/>
            where, when I had taken my seat, the same Eumolpus, pre­ <lb/>
            tending not to be yet sufficiently instructed, moved that the <note type="footnote"> 1 This, probably, was some act whereby the city was to ratify and con­ <lb/>
            firm the proceedings of Dion under the commission assigned to him. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It was a notion which generally prevailed with the ancients, in the <lb/>
            Jewish as well as heathen world, that there was a pollution in the contact <lb/>
            of dead bodies, and this they extended to the very house in which the corpse <lb/>
            lay, and even to the uncovered vessels that stood in the Same room. (Vid. <lb/>
            Pot. Antiq. v. ii. 181.) From some such opinion as this it is probable that <lb/>
            the circumstance here mentioned, of placing Trajan's statue where these <lb/>
            bodies were deposited, was esteemed as a mark of disrespect to his person. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="421"/>
            trial might be again put off: Dion, on the contrary, insisted <lb/>
            it should be heard. They debated this point very fully on <lb/>
            both sides, and entered a little into the merits of the cause; <lb/>
            when being of opinion that it was reasonable it should be <lb/>
            adjourned, and thinking it proper to consult with you in an <lb/>
            affair which was of consequence in point of precedent, I <lb/>
            directed them to exhibit the articles of their respective alle­ <lb/>
            gations in writing; for I was desirous you should judge <lb/>
            from their own representations of the state of the question <lb/>
            between them. Dion promised to comply with this direction <lb/>
            and Eumolpus also assured me he would draw up a memorial <lb/>
            of what he had to allege on the part of the community. But <lb/>
            he added that, being only concerned as advocate on behalf <lb/>
            of Archippus, whose instructions he had laid before me, <lb/>
            he had no charge to bring with respect to the sepulchres. <lb/>
            Archippus, however, for whom Eumolpus was counsel here, <lb/>
            as at Prusa, assured me he would himself present a charge <lb/>
            in form upon this head. But neither Eumolpus nor Archip­ <lb/>
            pus (though I have waited several days for that purpose) <lb/>
            have yet performed their engagement: Dion indeed has; <lb/>
            and I have annexed his memorial to this letter. I have <lb/>
            inspected the buildings in question, where I find your statue <lb/>
            is placed in a library, and as to the edifice in which the <lb/>
            bodies of Dion's wife and son are said to be deposited, it <lb/>
            stands in the middle of a court, which is enclosed with a <lb/>
            colonnade. Deign, therefore, I entreat you, Sir, to direct <lb/>
            my judgment in the determination of this cause above all <lb/>
            others as it is a point to which the public is greatly atten­ <lb/>
            tive, and necessarily so. since the fact is not only acknowl­ <lb/>
            edged, but countenanced by many precedents.</p>

            slight offence into an act of treason; you had no reason, <lb/>

             <pb n="422"/>
            which you thought proper to consult me. Without entering <lb/>
            therefore into the merits of that question (to which I would <lb/>
            by no means give any attention, though there were ever <lb/>
            so many instances of the same kind), I recommend to your <lb/>
            care the examination of Dion's accounts relating to the <lb/>
            public works which he has finished; as it is a case in which <lb/>
            the interest of the city is concerned, and as Dion neither <lb/>

            fully examining whether the ground you suspect is firm <lb/>
            enough to support an aqueduct. For I have no manner of <lb/>

            water; provided their finances will bear the expense of a <lb/>
            work so conducive to their health and pleasure. <note type="footnote"> 1 A thriving Greek colony in the territory of Sinopis, on the Euxine. </note> <pb n="424"/>

            removing my scruples, or informing my ignorance? Hav­ <lb/>

            nature of their crimes, or the measure of their punish­ <lb/>
            ment, but how far it is proper to enter into an examina­ <lb/>
            tion concerning them. Whether, therefore, any difference <lb/>
            is usually made with respect to ages, or no distinction is <lb/>
            to be observed between the young and the adult; whether <lb/>
            repentance entitles them to a pardon; or if a man has been <lb/>
            once a Christian, it avails nothing to desist from his error; <lb/>
            whether the very profession of Christianity, unattended with <lb/>
            any criminal act, or only the crimes themselves inherent in <lb/>
            the profession are punishable; on all these points I am in <lb/>
            great doubt. In the meanwhile, the method I have observed <lb/>
            towards those who have been brought before me as Chris­ <lb/>
            tians is this: I asked them whether they were Christians; <lb/>
            if they admitted it, I repeated the question twice, and threat­ <lb/>
            ened them with punishment; if they persisted, I ordered <lb/>
            them to be at once punished: for I was persuaded, what­ <lb/>
            ever the nature of their opinions might be, a contumacious <lb/>
            and inflexible obstinacy certainly deserved correction. <lb/>
            There were others also brought before me possessed with <lb/>
            the same infatuation, but being Roman citizens,2 I directed <lb/>
            them to be sent to Rome. But this crime spreading (as is <lb/>
            usually the case) while it was actually under prosecution, <lb/>
            several instances of the same nature occurred. An anony­ <lb/>
            mous information was laid before me containing a charge <lb/>
            against several persons, who upon examination denied they <lb/>
            were Christians, or had ever been so. They repeated after <lb/>
            me an invocation to the gods, and offered religious rites <lb/>
            with wine and incense before your statue (which for that <lb/>
            purpose I had ordered to be brought, together with those <lb/>
            of the gods), and even reviled the name of Christ: whereas <lb/>
            there is no forcing, it is said, those who are really Chris­ <lb/>
            tians into any of these compliances: I thought it proper, <lb/>
            therefore, to discharge them. Some among those who were <lb/>
            accused by a witness in person at first confessed themselves <lb/>
            Christians, but immediately after denied it; the rest owned <lb/>
            indeed that they had been of that number formerly, but had <note type="footnote"> 2 It was one of the privileges of a Roman citizen, secured by the Sempro­ <lb/>
            nian law, that he could not be capitally convicted but by the suffrage of the <lb/>
            people; which seems to have been still so far in force as to make it neces- <lb/>
            Dry to send the persons here mentioned to Rome. M. </note> <lb/>

            now (some above three, others more, and a few above twenty <lb/>
            years ago) renounced that error. They all worshipped <lb/>
            your statue and the images of the gods, uttering impreca­ <lb/>
            tions at the same time against the name of Christ. They <lb/>
            affirmed the whole of their guilt, or their error, was, that <lb/>
            they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed <lb/>
            a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity, binding them­ <lb/>
            selves by a solemn oath, not for the purposes of any wicked <lb/>
            design, but never to commit any fraud, theft, or adultery, <lb/>
            never to falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they <lb/>
            should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their <lb/>
            custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common <lb/>
            a harmless meal. From this custom, however, they de­ <lb/>
            sisted after the publication of my edict, by which, according <lb/>
            to your commands, I forbade the meeting of any assemblies. <lb/>
            After receiving this account, I judged it so much the more <lb/>
            necessary to endeavor to extort the real truth, by putting <lb/>
            two female slaves to the torture, who were said to offici­ <lb/>
            ate8 in their religious rites: but all I could discover was <lb/>
            evidence of an absurd and extravagant superstition. I <lb/>
            deemed it expedient, therefore, to adjourn all further pro­ <lb/>
            ceedings, in order to consult you. For it appears to be a <lb/>
            matter highly deserving your consideration, more espe­ <lb/>
            cially as great numbers must be involved in the danger of <lb/>
            these prosecutions, which have already extended, and are <lb/>
            still likely to extend, to persons of all ranks and ages, and <lb/>
            even of both sexes. In fact, this contagious superstition <lb/>
            is not confined to the cities only, but has spread its infec­ <lb/>
            tion among the neighbouring villages and country. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, it still seems possible to restrain its progress. <lb/>
            The temples, at least, which were once almost deserted, <lb/>
            begin now to be frequented; and the sacred rites, after a <lb/>
            long intermission, are again revived; while there is a gen­ <lb/>
            eral demand for the victims, which till lately found very few <lb/>
            purchasers. From all this it is easy to conjecture what <lb/>
            numbers might be reclaimed if a general pardon were granted <lb/>
            to those who shall repent of their error. <note type="footnote"> 3 These women, it is supposed, exercised the same office as Phoebe men­ <lb/>
            tioned by St. Paul, whom he styles deaconess of the church of Cenchrea. <lb/>
            Their business was to tend the poor and sick, and other charitable offices; <lb/>
            as also to assist at the ceremony of female baptism, for the more decent <lb/>
            performance of that rite: as Vossius observes upon this passage. M. </note> <pb n="428"/>

            in investigating the charges against the Christians who <lb/>

            way to look for them. If indeed they should be brought <lb/>
            before you, and the crime is proved, they must be punished ;l <lb/>
            with the restriction, however, that where the party denies <lb/>
            he is a Christian, and shall make it evident that he is not, <lb/>
            by invoking our gods, let him (notwithstanding any former <lb/>
            suspicion) be pardoned upon his repentance. Anonymous <lb/>
            informations ought not to be received in any sort of prose­ <lb/>

          <p>THE elegant and beautiful city of Amastris,' Sir, has, <lb/>

            what is called indeed a river, but in fact is no other than a <lb/>

            the same time very pestilential on account of its noxious <lb/>

            health, as well as decency, to have it covered; which shall <note type="footnote"> 1 If we impartially examine this prosecution of theChristians, we shall <lb/>
            find it to have been grounded on the ancient constitution of the state, and <lb/>
            not to have proceeded from a cruel or arbitrary temper in Trajan. The <lb/>
            Roman legislature appears to have been early jealous of any innovation in <lb/>
            pointof public worship; and we find the magistrates, during the old republic, <lb/>
            frequently interposing in cases of that nature. Valerius Maximus has col­ <lb/>
            lected some instances to that purpose (L. i. c. 3), and Livy mentions it as <lb/>
            an established principle of the earlier ages of the commonwealth, to guard <lb/>
            against the introduction of foreign ceremonies of religion. It was an old <lb/>
            and fixed maxim likewise of the Roman government not to suffer any nn­ <lb/>
            licensed assemblies of the people. From hence it seems evident that the <lb/>
            Christians had rendered themselves obnoxious not so much to TraJan as to <lb/>
            the ancient and settled laws of the state, by introducing a foreign worship, <lb/>
            and assembling themselves without authority. M. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 On the coast of Paphlagonia. </note> <lb/>

          <p>I REQUEST, Sir, your directions with respect to the recover­ <lb/>
            ing those debts which are due to the cities of Bithynia and <lb/>
            Pontus, either for rent, or goods sold, or upon any other <lb/>
            consideration. I find they have a privilege conceded to <lb/>
            them by several proconsuls, of being preferred to other <lb/>
             <pb n="432"/>
            creditors; and this custom has prevailed as if it had been <lb/>
            established by law. Your prudence, I imagine, will think <lb/>
            it necessary to enact some settled rule, by which their rights <lb/>
            may always be secured. For the edicts of others, how wisely <lb/>
            soever founded, are but feeble and temporary ordinances, <lb/>
            unless confirmed and sanctioned by your authority.</p>

          <p>THE right which the cities either of Pontus or Bithynia <lb/>
            claim relating to the recovery of debts of whatever kind, <lb/>
            due to their several communities, must be determined agree­ <lb/>
            ably to their respective laws. Where any of these com­ <lb/>
            munities enjoy the privilege of being preferred to other <lb/>
            creditors, it must be maintained; but, where no such privi­ <lb/>

            dice of private property.</p>

          <p>THE solicitor to the treasury of the city of Amisis insti­ <lb/>
            tuted a claim, Sir, before me against Julius Piso of about <lb/>
            forty thousand denarii,1 presented to him by the public above <lb/>
            twenty years ago, with the consent of the general council <lb/>
            and assembly of the city: and he founded his demand upon <lb/>
            certain of your edicts, by which donations of this kind are <lb/>
            prohibited. Piso, on the other hand, asserted that he had <lb/>
            conferred large sums of money upon the community, and, <lb/>
            indeed, had thereby expended almost the whole of his estate. <lb/>
            He insisted upon the length of time which had intervened <lb/>
            since this donation, and hoped that he should not be com­ <lb/>
            pelled, to the ruin of the remainder of his fortunes, to refund <lb/>
            a present which had been granted him long since, in return <lb/>
            for many good offices he had done the city. For this reason, <lb/>
            Sir, I thought it necessary to suspend giving any judgment <lb/>
            in this cause till I shall receive your directions. <note type="footnote"> 1 About $7,000. </note> <pb n="433"/>

          <p>THOUGH by my edicts I have ordained that no largesses <lb/>

            private persons may not be disturbed in the secure pos­ <lb/>
            session of their fortunes, those donations which have been <lb/>
            made long since ought not to be called in question or revoked. <lb/>
            We will not therefore enquire into anything that has been <lb/>
            transacted in this affair so long ago as twenty years; for <lb/>
            I would be no less attentive to secure the repose of every <lb/>

          <p>THE Pompeian law, Sir, which is observed in Pontus and <lb/>
            Bithynia, does not direct that any money for their admission <lb/>
            shall be paid in by those who are elected into the senate by <lb/>
            the censors. It has, however, been usual for such members <lb/>
            as have been admitted into those assemblies, in pursuance of <lb/>
            the privilege which you were pleased to grant to some par­ <lb/>
            ticular cities, of receiving above their legal number, to pay <lb/>
            one or two thousand denarii* on their election. Subsequent <lb/>
            to this, the proconsul Anicius Maximus ordained (though in­ <lb/>
            deed his edict related to some few cities only) that those who <lb/>
            were elected by the censors should also pay into the treasury <lb/>
            a certain sum, which varied in different places. It remains, <lb/>
            therefore, for your consideration whether it would not be <lb/>
            proper to settle a certain sum for each member who is elected <lb/>
            into the councils to pay upon his entrance; for it well be­ <lb/>
            comes you, whose every word and action deserves to be im­ <lb/>
            mortalized, to establish laws that shall endure for ever. <note type="footnote"> 1 About $175.</note> <note type="footnote">2 About $350. </note> <pb n="434"/>

          <p>I CAN give no general directions applicable to all the cities <lb/>
            of Bithynia, in relation to those who are elected members <lb/>
            of their respective councils, whether they shall pay an hon­ <lb/>
            orary fee upon their admittance or not. I think that the <lb/>
            safest method which can be pursued is to follow the particu­ <lb/>
            lar laws of each city; and I also think that the censors ought <lb/>
            to make the sum less for those who are chosen into the <lb/>
            senate contrary to their inclinations than for the rest.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CXV To THE EMPEROR TRAJAN</title>

          <p>THE Pompeian law, Sir, allows the Bithynians to give the <lb/>
            freedom of their respective cities to any person they think <lb/>
            proper, provided he is not a foreigner, but native of some <lb/>
            of the cities of this province. The same law specifies the par­ <lb/>
            ticular causes for which the censors may expel any member <lb/>
            the senate, but makes no mention of foreigners. Certain of <lb/>
            the censors therefore have desired my opinion whether they <lb/>
            ought to expel a member if he should happen to be a for­ <lb/>
            eigner. But I thought it necessary to receive your instruc­ <lb/>
            tions in this case; not only because the law, though it for­ <lb/>
            bids foreigners to be admitted citizens, does not direct that <lb/>
            a senator shall be expelled for the same reason, but because <lb/>
            I am informed that in every city in the province a great <lb/>
            number of the senators are foreigners. If, therefore, this <lb/>
            clause of the law, which seems to be antiquated by a long <lb/>
            custom to the contrary, should be enforced, many cities, as <lb/>
            well as private persons, must be injured by it. I have an­ <lb/>
            nexed the heads of this law to my letter.</p><pb n="435"/>

          <p>You might well be doubtful, my dearest Secundus, what <lb/>
            reply to give to the censors, who consulted you concerning <lb/>
            their right to elect into the senate foreign citizens, though <lb/>
            of the same province. The authority of the law on one side, <lb/>
            and long custom prevailing against it on the other, might <lb/>
            justly occasion you to hesitate. The proper mean to observe <lb/>
            in this case will be to make no change in what is past, but <lb/>
            to allow those senators who are already elected, though con­ <lb/>
            trary to law, to keep their seats, to whatever city they may <lb/>
            belong; in all future elections, however, to pursue the direc­ <lb/>
            tions of the Pompeian law: for to give it a retrospective <lb/>
            operation would necessarily introduce great confusion.</p>

          <p>IT is customary here upon any person taking the manly <lb/>

            denarii.1 I request you to inform me whether you think <lb/>
            proper this ceremony should be observed, or how far you <lb/>
            approve of it. For myself, though I am of opinion that <lb/>
            upon some occasions, especially those of public festivals, this <lb/>
            kind of invitation may be permitted, yet, when carried so far <lb/>
            as to draw together a thousand persons, and sometimes more, <lb/>
            it seems to be going beyond a reasonable number, and has <lb/>
            somewhat the appearance of ambitious largesses. <note type="footnote"> 1 The denarius=17 cents. The sum total, then, distributed among one <lb/>
            thousand persons at the rate of, say, two denarii a piece would amount to <lb/>

          <p>THE athletic victors, Sir, in the Iselastic1 games, conceive <lb/>
            that the stipend you have established for the conquerors be­ <lb/>
            comes due from the day they are crowned: for it is not at <lb/>
            all material, they say, what time they were triumphantly <lb/>
            conducted into their country, but when they merited that <lb/>
            honour. On the contrary, when I consider the meaning of <lb/>
            the term Iselastic, I am strongly inclined to think that it is <lb/>
            intended the stipend should commence from the time of their <lb/>
            public entry. They likewise petition to be allowed the treat <lb/>
            you give at those combats which you have converted into <lb/>
            Iselastic, though they were conquerors before the appoint­ <lb/>
            ment of that institution: for it is but reasonable, they assert, <lb/>
            that they should receive the reward in this instance, as they <lb/>
            are deprived of it at those games which have been divested <lb/>
            of the honour of being Iselastic, since their victory. But I <lb/>
            am very doubtful, whether a retrospect should be admitted in <lb/>
            the case in question, and a reward given, to which the claim- <note type="footnote"> 1 These games are called Iselastic from the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰσελαυνω</foreign>, invehor, <lb/>
            because the victors, drawn by white horses, and wearing crowns on their <lb/>
            heads, were conducted with great pomp into their respective cities, which <lb/>
            they entered through a breach in the walls made for that purpose; inti­ <lb/>
            mating, as Plutarch observes, that a city which produced such able and <lb/>
            victorious citizens, had little occasion for the defence of walls (Cata­ <lb/>

            the public. M. </note> <lb/>

            ants had no right at the time they obtained the victory. I <lb/>
            beg, therefore, you would be pleased to direct my judgment <lb/>

          <p>THE stipend appointed for the conqueror in the Iselastic <lb/>
            games ought not, I think, to commence till he makes his <lb/>
            triumphant entry into his city. Nor are the prizes, at those <lb/>
            combats which I thought proper to make Iselastic, to be ex­ <lb/>
            tended backwards to those who were victors before that <lb/>
            alteration took place. With regard to the plea which these <lb/>
            athletic combatants urge, that they ought to receive the <lb/>
            Iselastic prize at those combats which have been made Ise­ <lb/>
            lastic subsequent to their conquests, as they are denied it in <lb/>
            the same case where the games have ceased to be so, it <lb/>
            proves nothing in their favour; for notwithstanding any new <lb/>
            arrangements which has been made relating to these games, <lb/>
            they are not called upon to return the recompense which <lb/>
            they received prior to such alteration.</p>
