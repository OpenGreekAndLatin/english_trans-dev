            <title type="main">REMARKS ON THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE ANABASIS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>A BIOGRAPHICAL Notice of Xenophon is prefixed to the <lb/>
            second volume of this translation. Some remarks are here <lb/>
            offered on the authorship of the " Anabasis."</p>
          <p>A passage of the “Hellenica,” in which it is said that a <lb/>
            narrative of the Expedition of Cyrus was written by Themis­ <lb/>
            togenes of Syracuse, has given rise to the question1 whether <lb/>
            the account of that expedition which we now have is that of <lb/>
            Xenophon or that of Themistogenes.</p>
          <p>When Xenophon, in the course of his narrative of events <lb/>
            relating to Greece, comes to the time at which the expedition <lb/>
            ot' Cyrus took place, he says,2 " How Cyrus collected an army, <lb/>
            how he marched up the country with it against his brother, <lb/>
            how the battle was fought, how Cyrus was killed, and how <lb/>
            the Greeks afterwards effected a safe retreat to the sea, has <lb/>
            been written by Themistogenes the Syracusan."</p>
          <p>Suidas3 also says that " Themistogenes, a Syracusan his­ <lb/>
            torian, wrote the Anabasis of Cyrus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦτις ἐν το</foreign> IS <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ξενοφω̃ντος</foreign> <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελληνικοῑς φέϱεται</foreign>, and some other things concerning his own <lb/>
            country." What sense is to be given to the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέϱεται</foreign> in <lb/>
            this passage, has been a subject of much doubt. If the <lb/>
            phrase containing it be translated, with Morus, quæ nomina­ <lb/>
            tur aut laudatur in Historiâ Græcâ, a sense is given to the <lb/>
            verb for which there is no authority; and if it be rendered, <lb/>
            with most interpreters, quæ inserta legitur historiis Græcis, <lb/>
            that is said which is not true. Kuster4 and Dindorf,5 there­ <lb/>
            fore, suggest that the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">̔Ελληνικοῑς</foreign>, which is not found in <note type="footnote"> 1 Morus in Dissert. Hellenicis præmiss. c 6. Kühner Prolegom. <lb/>
            in Anab. p. XVIII. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hellen. iii. 1, 2. </note><note type="footnote">3 v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεμιστογενης</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Ad Suidam. v. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεμιστογευηι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote">5 Præf. in Anab. p. vii. ed. 1825 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            the Paris manuscripts, should be struck out. The sense will <lb/>
            then be, “which is inserted among the writings of Xenophon."</p>
          <p>Suidas being thus interpreted, the two passages will concur <lb/>
            in showing that a narrative of the "Anabasis" was written by <lb/>
            Themistogenes. The next point to be considered is, whether <lb/>
            that narrative which we now have is, or is not, the work of <lb/>
            Themistogenes.</p>
          <p>Plutarch, in his Considerations whether the Athenians were <lb/>
            more renowned in Arms or in Letters,1 observes, in alluding <lb/>
            to the historians, that “Xenophon was a subject of history for <lb/>
            himself, for lie wrote an account of the military matters which <lb/>
            lie successfully conducted, but represents that the account was <lb/>
            written by Themistogenes the Syracusan, in order that he might <lb/>
            have more credit if he spoke of himself as another person, <lb/>
            giving to another the reputation of the work." The passage <lb/>
            is somewhat obscure, for there is a word, such as <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγει</foreign>, want­ <lb/>
            ing ; I translate it in the sense in which it is taken by Leun­ <lb/>
            clavius and Wyttenbach.</p>
          <p>In agreement with this passage of Plutarch, Tzetzes, in his <lb/>
            Chiliads,2 after observing that Phidias made two statues for a <lb/>
            young man of whom he was fond, and for whose workman­ <lb/>
            ship, it appears, they were to pass, says that " Xenophon did <lb/>
            the same with regard to the Anabasis of Cyrus ; for he set a <lb/>
            certain name to the work to please one whom he loved ; * * * <lb/>
            it is the book of Themistogenes the Syracusan, and afterwards <lb/>
            came to be commonly called the work of Xenophon ; so Plato <lb/>
            the philosopher wrote his Dialogues under the names of his <lb/>
            friends; and other writers have composed innumerable things­ <lb/>
            in a similar way.” When he says that “it is the book of <lb/>
            Themistogenes," <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ βιβλίον Θεμιστογένους ἐστι</foreign>, he can have n.; <lb/>
            other meaning but that it was given to the world by Xeno <lb/>
            phon under the name of Themistogenes. A Scholium, which <lb/>
            us appended to the passage by an unknown author, states the <lb/>
            matter more briefly and clearly: “Xenophon inscribed the <lb/>
            A nabasis of Cyrus with the name of Themistogenes, yet it <lb/>
            ame to be commonly called afterwards the work of Xeno <lb/>
            phon.”</p>
          <p>From these writers, then, Plutarch, Tzetzes, and his Scholi <lb/>
            ast. it would appear that the " Anabasis," or account of the <lb/>
            expedition of Cyrus, was written by Xenophon, and published <note type="footnote"> 1 c. i. </note><note type="footnote">2 vii. 930. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            as the work of Themistogenes. But from the passage of Xen­ <lb/>
            ophon, to which we ought to attribute more authority than to <lb/>
            any others as also from that of Suidas, we may rather conceive, <lb/>
            as Dindorf suggests, that there were two Anabases, the one writ­ <lb/>
            ten by Themistogenes, before Xenophon wrote the third book of <lb/>
            the Hellenica, and to which Xenophon was then content to re­ <lb/>
            fer, and the other written by Xenophon himself subsequently <lb/>
            to that time. Under this supposition, indeed, we must believe <lb/>
            that Xenophon published the Anabasis at a very advanced <lb/>
            period of life, while the composition seems to be that of a man <lb/>
            in the full vigour of his faculties; but Sophocles, as Kühner1 <lb/>
            observes, wrote with great spirit, after he was eighty years of <lb/>
            age; and the Anabasis might have been written some years <lb/>
            before Xenophon sent it out of his hands. If there were two, <lb/>
            that of Themistogenes, from what Xenophon says of it, may <lb/>
            have brought the Greeks only to the sea, or to Trebisond ; <lb/>
            that of Xenophon is continued to their junction with Thibron. <lb/>
            If there were but one, Xenophon may have published the first <lb/>
            four books, at an earlier period, under the name of Themisto­ <lb/>
            genes, and have afterwards added the three other books, and <lb/>
            signified that the whole was his own.</p>
          <p>One object of the author of the work which we have, <lb/>
            observes Mitford,2 was to apologize for the conduct of Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon ; in the latter part the narrative is constantly accom­ <lb/>
            panied with a studied defence of his proceedings; the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances that produced his banishment from Athens, and <lb/>
            whatever might excite jealousy against him at Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            have been carefully considered ; if. therefore, Themistogenes <lb/>
            wrote it, he may have written under the direction of Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon ; if Xenophon wrote it, there may have been good rea­ <lb/>
            sons why, at the time of its publication, he should have wished <lb/>
            it to pass under another person's name.</p>
          <p>If there were two Anabases, we maysuppose that Xenophon’s <lb/>
            superseded that of Themistogenes, and caused it to be lost. <lb/>
            The name of Themistogenes, as an author, is mentioned by no <lb/>
            writer besides those whom we have noticed ; while that of <lb/>
            Xenophon, as the author of the Anabasis, is specified, as <lb/>
            Mitford and Krüger 3 observe, by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <lb/>
            Strabo, Cicero, Diogenes Laertius, Lucian, Ælian, and Athe- <note type="footnote"> 1 Prolegom. in Anab. p. xix. </note><note type="footnote">2 Hist, of Greece, vol. v p. 335 </note><note type="footnote"> ' De Authent. Anab. p. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            næus, besides the grammarians and lexicographers, Hesychius, <lb/>
            Pollux, Harpocration, and Ammonius.</p>
          <p>But no decisive opinion can be pronounced. The statement <lb/>
            of Plutarch, which he gives, not as a conjecture of his own <lb/>
            but as a matter of general belief in his day, and which is sup­ <lb/>
            ported by Tzetzes and his Scholiast, may induce many readers, <lb/>
            if not the majority, to suppose, with Weiske1 and Kühner, that <lb/>
            there was probably but one Anabasis, that which we now <lb/>
            have, and which, though the work of Xenophon, was, for <lb/>
            whatever reasons on the part of the author, sent into the world <lb/>
            as the composition of Themistogenes. The attractions of the <lb/>
            subject, as Dr. Smith2 observes, might have induced more <lb/>
            than one or two persons to write upon it.</p>
          <p>Of the other work translated in this volume, no doubt has <lb/>
            been expressed that Xenophon was the author. It shows what <lb/>
            were the habits and conversation of him who taught that <lb/>
            To know <lb/>
            That which before us lies in daily life <lb/>
            Is the prime wisdom ; <lb/>
            who brought philosophy down from heaven to dwell with <lb/>
            men ; and who was pronounced the wisest of men by the <lb/>
            Delphic oracle, "because he judiciously made choice of human <lb/>
            nature for the object of his thoughts, an inquiry into which a? <lb/>
            much exceeds all other learning, as it is of more consequence <lb/>
            to adjust the true nature and measures of right and wrong, <lb/>
            than to settle the distances of the planets, and compute the <lb/>
            time of their circumvolutions.”3 His doctrine was, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_83_fig2.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              On life, on morals, be thy thoughts employed; <lb/>
              Leave to the schools their Atoms and their Void.</p>
          <p>He gave indeed, it may be thought, too little encourage­ <lb/>
            ment to investigations in physical science. How far he <lb/>
            recommended that mathematical studies should be pursued, <lb/>
            may be seen in B. iv. c. 7. The best specimen of Socratic <lb/>
            reasoning in the Memorabilia is the philosopher’s conversa­ <lb/>

          <p>Parentage of Cyrus the Younger. After the death of his father he is ac­ <lb/>
            cused of plotting against his brother Artaxerxes, who imprisons him, but <lb/>
            releases him on the intercession of his mother, and sends him back to his <lb/>
            province, where he secretly collects forces, of which a large proportion <lb/>
            are from Greece, to make war on his brother.</p>
          <p>1. OF Darius1 and Parysatis were born two sons,2 the elder <lb/>
            Artaxerxes,3 and the younger Cyrus. After Darius had <lb/>
            fallen sick, and suspected that the end of his life was approach­ <lb/>
            ing, he was desirous that both of his sons should attend him. <lb/>
            2. The elder then happened to be present; Cyrus he sent for <lb/>
            from the province of which he had made him satrap. He had <lb/>
            also appointed him commander of all the forces that muster <lb/>
            in the plain of Castolus.4 <note type="footnote"> I Darius II., surnamed Nothus, who reigned from B. c. 423 to <lb/>
            a. c. 404, the year in which Cyrus went up to Babylon. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Several children of his are mentioned by Plutarch, Life of Artax. <lb/>
            c. i. 27. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Afterwards Artaxerxes II., surnamed Mnemon; he began his <lb/>

            the assembly and review of troops. See i. 2. 11; 9, 7; Hellen. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> Cyrus accordingly went up, taking with him Tissaphernes as <lb/>
            a friend, and having also with him three hundred heavy-arm­ <lb/>
            ed Greeks,' and Xenias of Parrhasia,2 their captain.</p>
          <p>3. But when Darius was dead, and Artaxerxes was placed <lb/>
            upon the throne, Tissaphernes brought an accusation against <lb/>
            Cyrus before his brother, saying that he was plotting against <lb/>
            him. Artaxerxes was induced to give credit to it, and had <lb/>
            Cyrus arrested, with the intention of putting him to death; <lb/>
            but his mother, having begged his life, sent him back to his <lb/>
            province.</p>
          <p>4. When Cyrus had departed, after being thus in danger <lb/>
            and disgrace, he began to consider by what means he might <lb/>
            cease to be subject to his brother, and make himself king, if <lb/>
            he could, in his stead. Parysatis, their mother, was well dis­ <lb/>
            posed towards Cyrus,3 as she loved him better than Arta­ <lb/>
            xerxes, who was on the throne. 5. Whatever messengers from <lb/>
            the king4 came to visit him, he let none of them go till he <lb/>
            had inclined them to be friends to himself, rather than the <lb/>
            monarch.:; He also paid such attention to the Barbarians6 <lb/>
            that were with him, that they were in a condition to take the <lb/>
            field, and well inclined towards himself. 5. His Greek force <lb/>
            he collected as secretly as he could, that he might surprise the <lb/>
            king as little prepared as possible.</p>
          <p>lie collected troops in the following manner. Whatever <lb/>

            For the cities of Ionia had formerly been under the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Tissaphernes, having been assigned to him by the <lb/>
            king, but had at this time all revolted to Cyrus except Mile­ <lb/>
            tus. 7. Tissaphernes, discovering that the people of Miletus <lb/>
            were forming a similar design, [to go over to Cyrus,1] put <lb/>
            some of them to death, and sent others into banishment. Cy­ <lb/>
            rus, receiving the exiles under his protection, and assembling <lb/>
            an army, laid siege to Miletus by land and sea, and used <lb/>
            every exertion to restore these exiles ; and he had thus another <lb/>
            pretext for augmenting the number of his forces. 8. He then <lb/>
            sent to the king, and requested that, as he was his brother, <lb/>
            these cities should be given to him rather than that Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes should govern them ; and in this application his <lb/>
            mother supported him. Thus the king had no suspicion of <lb/>
            the plot against him, but supposed that Cyrus, from being at <lb/>
            war with Tissaphernes, was spending the money upon troops; <lb/>
            60 that he was not at all concerned at the strife between them, <lb/>
            especially as Cyrus remitted to him the tribute arising from <lb/>
            the cities which Tissaphernes had had.</p>
          <p>9. Another army was collected for him in the Chersonesus <lb/>
            opposite Abydos, in the following method. Clearchus, a La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonian, happened to be in exile. Cyrus, having met <lb/>
            with him, was struck with admiration for him, and made him <lb/>
            a present of ten thousand darics.2 Clearchus, on receiving the <lb/>
            gold, raised, by means of it, a body of troops, and making ex­ <lb/>
            cursions out of the Chersonesus, made war upon the Thracians <lb/>
            that are situated above the Hellespont, and was of assist­ <lb/>
            ance to the Greeks ; so that the towns on the Hellespont <lb/>
            willingly contributed money for the support of his men. This <lb/>

            of considerable magnitude. Here he halted seven days ; <lb/>
            when Menon the Thessalian joined him with a thousand heavy- <lb/>
            armed troops and five hundred peltasts, consisting of Dolo­ <lb/>
            pians, Ænianes, and Olynthians.</p>
          <p>7. Hence he proceeded in three days' march, a distance of <lb/>
            twenty parasangs, to Celænæ, a populous, large, and rich city <lb/>
            of Phrygia. Here Cyrus had a palace, and an extensive park <lb/>
            full of wild beasts, which he was accustomed to hunt on <lb/>
            horseback whenever he wished to give himself and his horses <lb/>
            exercise. Through the middle of this park flows the river <lb/>
            Mæander ; its springs issue from the palace itself; and it <lb/>
            runs also through the city of Celænæ. 8. There is also at <lb/>
            Celænæ a palace of the Great King,4 situated near the source <lb/>
            of the river Marsyas, under the citadel. This river too <lb/>
            runs through the city, and falls into the Mæander. The <lb/>
            breadth of the Marsyas is twenty-five feet. Here Apollo is <lb/>
            said to have flayed Marsyas, after conquering him in a trial <lb/>
            of musical skill, and to have hung up his skin in the cave, <lb/>
            where the source of the stream rises: and on this account <lb/>

            arranging his own men. They were accordingly drawn up four <lb/>
            deep ; Menon and his troops took the right wing; Clearchus and <lb/>
            his men the left; and the other captains occupied the centre. <lb/>
            16. First of all, then, Cyrus reviewed the Barbarians, who <lb/>
            marched past him, drawn up in troops and companies ;2 and <lb/>
            afterwards the Greeks, riding by them in his chariot, with the <lb/>
            Cilician queen in her car.3 They had all brazen helmets, scarlet <lb/>
            tunics, greaves, and polished shields. 17. When he had ridden <lb/>
            past them all, lie stopped his chariot in front of their phalanx, <lb/>
            and sent Pigres the interpreter to the Greek officers, with <lb/>
            orders for them to present arms,4 and to advance with their <lb/>
            whole phalanx. The officers communicated these orders to <note type="footnote"> I T6v <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σάτυρον</foreign>.] Silenus.

            presented arms and advanced. Then, as they proceeded with <lb/>
            a quicker pace and loud shouts, the soldiers of their own ac­ <lb/>
            cord took to running, bearing down upon the tents of the Per­ <lb/>
            sians. is. Upon this, there arose great terror among the rest <lb/>
            of the Barbarians ; the Cilician queen fled from her car ; and <lb/>
            he people in the market deserted their goods and took to their <lb/>
            heels ; while the Greeks marched up to the tents with laugh­ <lb/>
            ter. The Cilician queen, on beholding the splendour and dis­ <lb/>
            cipline of the army, was struck with admiration; and Cyrus <lb/>
            was delighted when he saw the terror with which the Greeks <lb/>
            inspired the Barbarians.</p>
          <p>19. Hence he advanced, three days' march, a distance of <lb/>
            wenty parasangs, to Iconium, the last town ofPhrygia; where <lb/>
            lie halted three days. He then went forward through Lycao­ <lb/>
            nia, five days' march, a distance of thirty parasangs; and this <lb/>
            country, as being that of an enemy, he permitted the Greeks to <lb/>
            ravage.</p>
          <p>20. From hence Cyrus despatched the Cilician queen, by the <lb/>
            shortest road, into Cilicia ; and sent with her the troops which <lb/>
            Menon had. and Menon himself. Cyrus, with the rest of the <lb/>
            army, proceeded through Cappadocia, four days' march, a dis­ <lb/>
            tance of twenty-five parasangs, to Dana, a populous, large, and <lb/>
            wealthy city. Here he stayed three days; in the course of which <lb/>
            he put to death a Persian, named Megaphernes, a wearer of the <lb/>
            royal purple,! and a certain other person in power, one of the <lb/>
            provincial governors having accused them of conspiring against <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>21. They then made an attempt to enter Cilicia; but the <lb/>
            sole entrance was a road broad enough only for a single car­ <lb/>
            riage, very steep, and impracticable for an army to pass, if <lb/>
            any one opposed them. Syennesis, besides, was said to be <lb/>
            stationed on the heights, guarding the defile; on which ac­ <lb/>
            count Cyrus halted for a day in the plain. The next day, a <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">φοινικιστὴν βασίλειον</foreign>.] Æmilius Portus, on the authority of Zo­ <lb/>

            messenger came to inform him that Syennesis had quitted the <lb/>
            heights, on receiving information that Menon's army was <lb/>
            already in Cilicia within the mountains, and hearing that <lb/>
            Tamos had a number of galleys, belonging to the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians and Cyrus himself, sailing round from Ionia to Cilicia. <lb/>
            22. Cyrus accordingly ascended the mountains without any <lb/>
            opposition, and saw the tents in which the Cilicians kept <lb/>
            guard. Hence he descended into a large and beautiful plain, <lb/>
            well watered, and abounding with all kinds of trees, as well <lb/>
            as vines. It also produced great quantities of sesamum, <lb/>
            panic, millet,2 wheat, and barley. A chain of hills, strong <lb/>
            and high, encompasses it on all sides from sea to sea. 23. De­ <lb/>
            scending through this plain, he proceeded, in four days' march, <lb/>
            a distance of twenty-five parasangs, to Tarsus, a large and <lb/>
            opulent city of Cilicia. Here was the palace of Syennesis, <lb/>
            the king of the Cilicians ; and through the midst of the city <lb/>
            runs a river, called the Cydnus, the breadth of which is two <lb/>
            plethra. 24. This city the inhabitants, with Syennesis, had <lb/>
            deserted for a strong-hold upon the mountains, except those <lb/>
            who kept shops.3 Those also remained behind, who lived <lb/>
            near the sea at Soli and at Issi.</p>
          <p>25. Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis, had arrived at Tarsus five <lb/>
            days before Cyrus. But in passing over the mountains which <lb/>
            skirt the plain, two companies of Menon's troops had perished ; <lb/>
            some said that they had been cut to pieces by the Cilicians, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἶδε</foreign>.] This seems to be the reading of all the manuscripts, and <lb/>

            behind, and unable to find the rest of the army or their road, <lb/>
            they had been destroyed while wandering about. They <lb/>
            amounted to a hundred heavy-armed men. 26. When the rest <lb/>
            of Menon's troops came up, full of resentment at the fate of their <lb/>
            comrades, they plundered both the city of Tarsus and the pa­ <lb/>
            lace in it. Cyrus, on entering the city, sent for Syennesis to <lb/>
            come to him; but Syennesis answered, that he had never yet <lb/>
            put himself in the power of one stronger than himself; <lb/>
            nor would he then consent to go to Cyrus, until his wife pre­ <lb/>
            vailed upon him, and he received solemn assurances of safety. <lb/>
            27. Afterwards, when they had met, Syennesis gave Cyrus a <lb/>
            large sum of money for the support of his army, and Cyrus in <lb/>
            return presented him with such gifts as are held in estimation <lb/>
            by a king, a horse with a golden bit, a golden chain and brace­ <lb/>

            met with them.</p>

          <p>Cyras is forced to stay twenty days at Tarsus by a mutiny of the Greek sol­ <lb/>
            diers, who, suspecting that they were led against the king, refuse to go <lb/>
            farther, and offer violence to Clearchus, who endeavours to force them to <lb/>
            proceed. But being told by Cyrus that the expedition is directed against <lb/>
            Abrocomas, and promised an increase of pay, they agree to continue their <lb/>
            march.</p>
          <p>1. HERE Cyrus and the army remained twenty days ; for <lb/>
            the soldiers refused to proceed farther, as they now began to <lb/>
            suspect that they were marching against the king, and said <lb/>
            that they had not been hired for this purpose, Clearchus, <lb/>
            first of all, endeavoured to compel his soldiers to proceed ; but, <lb/>
            as soon as he began to advance, they pelted him and his <lb/>
            baggage-cattle with stones. 2. Clearchus, indeed, on this <lb/>
            occasion, had a narrow escape of being stoned to death. At <lb/>
            length, when he saw that he should not be able to proceed by <lb/>
            force, he called a meeting of his soldiers; and at first, stand­ <lb/>
            ing before them, he continued for some time to shed tears, <lb/>
            while they, looking on, were struck with wonder, and re­ <lb/>
            mained silent. He then addressed them to this effect: <pb n="12"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> 3. " Wonder not, soldiers, that I feel distressed at the <lb/>
            present occurrences; for Cyrus engaged himself to me by ties <lb/>
            of hospitality, and honoured me, when I was an exile from my <lb/>
            country, both with other marks of esteem, and by presenting <lb/>
            me with ten thousand darics. On receiving this money, I <lb/>
            did not treasure it up for my own use, or squander it in <lb/>
            luxury, but spent it upon you. 4. First of all, I made war <lb/>
            upon the Thracians, and, in the cause of Greece, and with <lb/>
            your assistance, took vengeance upon them by expelling them <lb/>
            from the Chersonesus, when they would have taken the coun­ <lb/>
            try from its Grecian colonists. When Cyrus summoned me, <lb/>
            I set out to join him, taking you with me, that if he had need <lb/>
            of my aid, I might do him service in return for the benefits <lb/>
            that I had received from him. 5. But since you are unwill­ <lb/>
            ing to accompany him on this expedition, I am under the ob­ <lb/>
            ligation, either, by deserting you, to preserve the friendship of <lb/>
            Cyrus, or, by proving false to him, to adhere to you. Whether <lb/>
            I shall do right, I do not know ; but I shall give you the pre­ <lb/>
            ference, and will undergo with you whatever may be neces­ <lb/>
            sary. Nor shall any one ever say, that, after leading Greeks <lb/>
            into a country of Barbarians, I deserted the Greeks, and <lb/>
            adopted, in preference, the friendship of the Barbarians.</p>
          <p>6. " Since, however, you decline to obey me, or to follow <lb/>
            me, I will go with you, and submit to whatever may be des­ <lb/>
            tined for us. For I look upon you to be at once my country, <lb/>
            my friends, and my fellow-soldiers, and consider that with you <lb/>
            I shall be respected, wherever I may be: but that, if separated <lb/>
            from you, I shall be unable either to afford assistance to a <lb/>
            friend, or to avenge myself upon an enemy. Feel assured, <lb/>
            therefore, that I am resolved to accompany you wherever <lb/>
            you go."</p>
          <p>7. Thus he spoke; and the soldiers, as well those under <lb/>
            his own command as the others, on hearing these assur­ <lb/>
            ances, applauded him for saying that he would not march <lb/>
            against the king; and more than two thousand of the troops of <lb/>
            Xenias and Pasion, taking with them their arms and baggage, <lb/>
            went and encamped under Clearchus.</p>
          <p>8. Cyrus, perplexed and grieved at these occurrences, sent <lb/>
            for Clearchus; who, however, would not go, but sending a <lb/>
            messenger to Cyrus without the knowledge of the soldiers, <lb/>
            bade him be of good courage, as these matters would be ar­ <pb n="13"/>
             <note type="margin">CH.3.] <lb/>
            </note>ranged to his satisfaction. He also desired Cyrus to send for <lb/>
            him again, but, when Cyrus had done so, he again declined to <lb/>
            go.1 9. Afterwards, having assembled his own soldiers, and <lb/>
            those who had recently gone over to him, and any of the rest <lb/>
            that wished to be present, he spoke to the following effect:</p>
          <p>"It is evident, soldiers, that the situation of Cyrus with <lb/>
            regard to us is the same as ours with regard to him ; for we <lb/>
            are no longer his soldiers, since we refuse to follow him, nor is <lb/>
            he any longer our paymaster. 10. That he considers himself <lb/>
            wronged by us, however, I am well aware; so that, even <lb/>
            when he sends for me, I am unwilling to go to him, princi­ <lb/>
            pally from feeling shame, because I am conscious of having <lb/>
            been in all respects false to him ; and in addition, from being <lb/>
            afraid, that, when he has me in his power, he may take venge­ <lb/>
            ance on me for the matters in which he conceives that he <lb/>
            has been injured. 11. This, therefore, seems to me to be no <lb/>
            time for us to sleep, or to neglect our own safety; but, on the <lb/>
            contrary, to consider what we must do under these circum­ <lb/>
            stances.2 As long as we remain here, it seems necessary to <lb/>
            consider how we may best remain with safety; or, if we de­ <lb/>
            termine upon going at once, how we may depart with the <lb/>
            greatest security, and how we may obtain provisions; for <lb/>
            without these, the general and the private soldier are alike <lb/>
            inefficient.3 12. Cyrus is indeed a most valuable friend to <lb/>
            those to whom he is a friend, but a most violent enemy to <lb/>
            those to whom he is an enemy. lie has forces, too, both in­ <lb/>
            fantry and cavalry, as well as a naval power, as we all alike <lb/>
            see and know; for we seem to me to be encamped at no great <lb/>
            distance from him. It is therefore full time to say whatever <lb/>
            any one thinks to be best." Having spoken thus, he made a <lb/>
            pause.</p>
          <p>13. Upon this, several rose to speak; some, of their own <lb/>
            accord, to express what they thought; others, previously in­ <lb/>
            structed by Clearchus, to point out what difficulty there <lb/>
            would be, either in remaining or departing, without the con- <note type="footnote">1 He himself, the very person who had desired Cyrus to send for <lb/>
            him, refused to go; this refusal being given for the sake of keep­ <lb/>

            sent of Cyrus. 14. One of these, pretending to be eager to <lb/>
            proceed with all possible haste to Greece, proposed that they <lb/>
            should choose other commanders without delay, if Clearchus <lb/>
            were unwilling to conduct them back; that they should pur­ <lb/>
            chase provisions, as there was a market in the Barbarian <lb/>
            camp, and pack up their baggage; that they should go to <lb/>
            Cyrus, and ask him to furnish them with ships, in which they <lb/>
            might sail home ; and, if he should not grant them, that they <lb/>
            should beg of him a guide, to conduct them back through <lb/>
            such parts of the country as were friendly towards them. <lb/>
            But if he would not even allow them a guide, that they <lb/>
            should, without delay, form themselves in warlike order, and <lb/>
            send a detachment to take possession of the heights, in order <lb/>
            that neither Cyrus nor the Cilicians, (" of whom," said he, "we <lb/>
            have many prisoners, and much money that we have taker.,") <lb/>
            may be the first to occupy them. Such were the suggestions <lb/>
            that he offered; but after him Clearchus spoke as follows:</p>
          <p>15. "Let no one of you mention me, as likely to undertake <lb/>
            this command ; for I see many reasons why I ought not to do <lb/>
            so; but be assured, that whatever person you may elect, I <lb/>
            shall pay the greatest possible deference to him, that you may <lb/>
            see that I know how to obey as well as any other man."</p>
          <p>16. After him another arose, who pointed out the folly of <lb/>
            him who advised them to ask for ships, just as if Cyrus were <lb/>
            not about to sail back,2 and who showed, too, how foolish it <lb/>
            would be to request a guide of the very person “ whose plans," <lb/>
            said he, “ we are frustrating. And," he added, “ if we <lb/>
            should trust the guide that Cyrus might assign us, what will <lb/>
            hinder Cyrus from giving orders to occupy the heights before <lb/>

            The guide was to conduct them only through regions that were <lb/>

            to embark in any vessel that he might grant us, lest he <lb/>
            should send us and the galleys to the bottom together; I <lb/>
            should also be afraid to follow any guide that he may ap­ <lb/>
            point, lest he should conduct us into places, from whence <lb/>
            there would be no means of escape; and I had rather, if I <lb/>
            depart without the consent of Cyrus, depart without his <lb/>
            knowledge; but this is impossible. 18. I say then that such <lb/>
            proposals are absurdities; and my advice is, that certain per­ <lb/>
            sons, such as are fit for the task, should accompany Clearchus <lb/>
            to Cyrus, and ask him in what service he wishes to employ <lb/>
            us; and if the undertaking be similar to that in which he be­ <lb/>
            fore employed foreign troops, 1 that we too should follow him, <lb/>
            and not appear more cowardly than those who previously <lb/>
            went up with him. 19. But if the present design seem greater <lb/>
            and more difficult and more perilous than the former, that <lb/>
            they should ask him, in that case, either to induce us to accom­ <lb/>
            pany him by persuasion, or, yielding himself to our persuasions, <lb/>
            to give us a passage to a friendly country; for thus, if we <lb/>
            accompany him, we shall accompany him as friends and zeal­ <lb/>
            ous supporters, and if we leave him, we shall depart in <lb/>
            safety ; that they then report to us what answer he makes to <lb/>
            this application ; and that we, having heard his reply, take <lb/>
            measures in accordance with it."</p>
          <p>20. These suggestions were approved ; and, having chosen <lb/>
            certain persons, they sent them with Clearchus to ask Cyrus <lb/>
            the questions agreed upon by the army. Cyrus answered, <lb/>
            that he had heard that Abrocomas, an enemy of his, was on <lb/>
            the banks of the Euphrates, twelve days' march distant; and <lb/>
            it was against him, he said, that lie wished to march ; and if <lb/>
            Abrocomas should be there, he said that he longed to take due <lb/>
            vengeance on him ; but if he should retreat, “ we will con­ <lb/>
            sider there," he added, " how to proceed."</p>
          <p>21. The delegates, having heard this answer, reported it to <lb/>
            the soldiers, who had still a suspicion that he was leading <lb/>
            them against the king, but nevertheless resolved to accompany <lb/>
            him. They then asked for an increase of pay, and Cyrus <lb/>
            promised to give them all half as much again as they received <lb/>
            before, that is to say, instead of a daric, three half-darics a <note type="footnote"> I The reference is to the three hundred Greeks that went up with <lb/>

          <p>The army reaches Issi, the last city in Cilicia, at which the fleet then ar­ <lb/>
            rives. Cyrus proceeds into Syria, where two of the Greek captains, <lb/>
            Xenias and Pasion, desert the expedition ; the good feeling of Cyrus, in <lb/>
            forbearing to pursue them, renders the other Greeks more willing to ac­ <lb/>
            company him. He arrives at Thapsacus on the Euphrates, where he dis­ <lb/>
            closes the real object of his expedition to the Greek troops, who express <lb/>
            discontent, but are induced by fresh promises, and the example of Menon, <lb/>
            to cross the river.</p>
          <p>1. HENCE he proceeded, two days' march, a distance of ten <lb/>
            parasangs, to the river Psarus, the breadth of which was three <lb/>
            plethra. He then went forward, one day's march, five para­ <lb/>
            sangs, to the river Pyramus, the breadth of which is a sta­ <lb/>
            dium. Hence he advanced in two days' march, a distance of <lb/>
            fifteen parasangs, to Issi, the last city in Cilicia, situate upon <lb/>
            the sea-coast, a populous, large, and rich place.</p>
          <p>2. Here Cyrus remained three days, in which time the ships <lb/>
            from Peloponnesus, thirty-five in number, arrived, Pythagoras <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian being their commander. But Tamos, an <lb/>
            Egyptian, had conducted the fleet from Ephesus, who had <lb/>
            also with him five-and-twenty other ships, belonging to Cyrus, <lb/>
            with which he had blockaded Miletus when it was in the in­ <lb/>
            terest of Tissaphernes, and had fought against him on behalf <lb/>
            of Cyrus. 3. In these vessels came also Cheirisophus the <lb/>
            Lacedaemoniam, who had been sent for by Cyrus, and who <lb/>
            had with him seven hundred heavy-armed troops, which he <lb/>
            commanded as part of the army of Cyrus. The ships were <lb/>
            moored opposite Cyrus's tent. Here, too, the Greek mercen­ <lb/>
            aries, who were in the pay of Abrocomas, four hundred <lb/>
            heavy-armed men, deserted him and came over to Cyrus, and <lb/>
            joined in the expedition against the king.</p>
          <p>4. Hence he proceeded, one day's march, five parasangs, to <lb/>
            the Gates of Cilicia and Syria. These were two fortresses; <note type="footnote"> I 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ησαν δὲ ταυ̃τα δύο</foreign> As the fern. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πύλαι</foreign> precedes, and as <lb/>

            of the part within them, towards Cilicia, Syennesis and a <lb/>
            guard of Cilicians had the charge; the part without, towards <lb/>
            Syria, a garrison of the king's soldiers was reported to oc­ <lb/>
            cupy. Between the two runs a river, called Carsus, a plelh­ <lb/>
            rum in breadth. The whole space between the fortresses was <lb/>
            three stadia; and it was impossible to pass it by force ; for the <lb/>
            passage was very narrow, the walls reached down to the sea, <lb/>
            and above were inaccessible rocks. At each of the fortresses <lb/>
            were gates. 5. It was on account of this passage that Cyrus <lb/>
            had sent for the fleet, that he might disembark heavy-armed <lb/>
            troops within and without the Gates,1 who might force a pass­ <lb/>
            age through the enemy, if they still kept guard at the Syrian <lb/>
            gates ; a post which lie expected Abrocomas would hold, as <lb/>
            he had under his command a numerous army. Abrocomas <lb/>
            however did not attempt this ; but, when he heard that Cyrus <lb/>
            was in Cilicia, retreated out of Phœnicia, and proceeded to <lb/>
            join the king, having with him, as was said, three hundred <lb/>
            thousand men.</p>
          <p>6. Hence he proceeded through Syria, one day's march, <lb/>
            five parasangs, to Myriandrus, a city near the sea, inhabited <lb/>
            by Phoenicians ; this place was a public mart, and many <lb/>
            merchant-vessels lay at anchor there. 7. Here they remained <lb/>
            seven days ; and here Xenias the Arcadian captain, and <lb/>
            Pasion the Megarean, embarking in a vessel, and putting on <lb/>
            board their most valuable effects, sailed away; being actu­ <lb/>
            ated, as most thought, by motives of jealousy, because Cyrus <lb/>
            had allowed Clearchus to retain under his command their sol­ <lb/>
            diers, who had seceded to Clearchus in the expectation of re­ <lb/>
            turning to Greece, and not of marching against the king <lb/>
            Upon their disappearance, a rumour pervaded the army that <note type="footnote"> others approve, but have not admitted into the text. Kühner in­ <lb/>
            terprets <foreign xml:lang="grc">τείχη</foreign> "castella," and I have followed him. When Xeno­ <lb/>

            were gates, he appears to sIgnify that there were gates in the walls <lb/>
            attached to each of the fortresses. " At a distance of about six <lb/>
            hundred yards, corresponding with the three stadia of Xenophon, <lb/>

            Cyrus would pursue them with ships of war; and some <lb/>
            wished that they might be taken, as having acted per­ <lb/>
            fidiously; while others pitied their fate, if they should be <lb/>
            caught.</p>
          <p>8. But Cyrus, calling together the captains, said to them, <lb/>
            " Xenias and Pasion have left us: but let them be well as­ <lb/>
            sured, that they have not fled clandestinely; for I know <lb/>
            which way they are gone; nor have they escaped beyond my <lb/>
            reach ; for I have triremes that would overtake their vessel. <lb/>
            But, by the gods, I shall certainly not pursue them ; nor shall <lb/>
            any one say, that as long as a man remains with me, I make <lb/>
            use of his services, but that, when he desires to leave me, I <lb/>
            seize and ill-treat his person, and despoil him of his property. <lb/>
            But let them go, with the consciousness that they have acted <lb/>
            a worse part towards us than we towards them. I have, in­ <lb/>
            deed, their children and wives under guard at Tralles; but <lb/>
            iit even of them shall they be deprived, but shall receive <lb/>
            them back in consideration of their former service to me."</p>
          <p>9. Thus Cyrus spoke; and the Greeks, even such as had <lb/>
            been previously disinclined to the expedition, when they <lb/>
            heard of the noble conduct of Cyrus, accompanied him with <lb/>
            greater pleasure and alacrity.</p>
          <p>After these occurrences, Cyrus proceeded four days' march, <lb/>
            a distance of twenty parasangs, to the river Clialus, which is <lb/>
            a plethrum in breadth, and full of large tame fish, which the <lb/>
            Syrians looked upon as gods, and allowed no one to hurt <lb/>
            either them or the pigeons. The villages, in which they <lb/>
            fixed their quarters, belonged to Parysatis, having been given <lb/>
            her for her girdle.!</p>
          <p>10. Thence he advanced, five days' march, a distance of <lb/>
            thirty parasangs, to the source of the river Dardes, which is a <lb/>
            plethrum in breadth. Here was the palace of Belesys, the <lb/>
            governor of Syria, and a very large and beautiful garden, con­ <lb/>
            taining all that the seasons produce. But Cyrus laid it waste, <lb/>
            and burned the palace. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰς ζώνην</foreign>.] Nominally to furnish her with girdles, or to supply <lb/>

            fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, which is there four <lb/>
            stadia in breadth, and on which is situated a large and rich <lb/>
            city, named Thapsacus. The army remained there five days ; <lb/>
            and Cyrus sent for the Greek captains, and told them, that <lb/>
            his march was directed to Babylon, against the Great King; <lb/>
            and he desired them to make this announcement to the sol. <lb/>
            diers, and to persuade them to accompany him.</p>
          <p>12. The leaders, assembling their troops, communicated <lb/>
            this information to them ; and the soldiers expressed them­ <lb/>
            selves much displeased with their officers, and said that they <lb/>
            had long known this, but concealed it; and they refused to <lb/>
            go, unless such a donative was granted them, as had been <lb/>
            given to those who had before gone up with Cyrus to his <lb/>
            father, and that, too, when they did not go to fight, but <lb/>
            merely attended Cyrus when his father summoned him. 13. <lb/>
            This state of things the generals reported to Cyrus; who in <lb/>
            consequence promised to give every man five minæ of silver,1 <lb/>
            when they should arrive at Babylon, and their full pay be­ <lb/>
            sides, until he should bring back the Greeks to Ionia again. <lb/>
            The greatest part of the Grecian force was thus prevailed <lb/>
            upon to accompany him. But before it was certain what the <lb/>
            other soldiers would do, whether they would accompany Cyrus <lb/>
            or not, Menon assembled his own troops apart from the rest, <lb/>
            and spoke as follows:</p>
          <p>14. “ If you will follow my advice, soldiers, you will, with­ <lb/>
            out incurring either danger or toil, make yourselves honoured <lb/>
            by Cyrus beyond the rest of the army. What, then, would <lb/>
            I have you do? Cyrus is at this moment urgent with the <lb/>
            Greeks to accompany him against the king ; I therefore sug­ <lb/>
            gest that, before it is known how the other Greeks will an­ <lb/>
            swer Cyrus, you should cross over the river Euphrates. 15. <lb/>
            For if they should determine upon accompanying him, you will <lb/>
            appear to have been the cause of it, by being the first to pass <lb/>
            the river; and to you, as being most forward with your <lb/>
            services, Cyrus will feel and repay the obligation, as no one <lb/>
            knows how to do better than himself. But if the others should <lb/>
            determine not to go with him, we shall all of us return back <lb/>
            again ; but you, as having alone complied with his wishes, <note type="footnote">1 Reckoning the talent at £243 15s., the mina (60 = a taleat <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            and as being most worthy of his confidence, he will employ in <lb/>
            garrison duty and posts of authority; and whatever else you <lb/>
            may ask of him, I feel assured that, as the friends of Cyrus, <lb/>
            you will obtain it."</p>
          <p>16. On hearing these proposals, they at once complied with <lb/>
            them, and crossed the river before the others had given their <lb/>
            answer. And when Cyrus perceived that they had crossed, <lb/>
            he was much pleased, and despatched Glus to Menon's troops <lb/>
            with this message: " I applaud your conduct, my friends; <lb/>
            and it shall be my care that you may applaud me ; or think <lb/>
            me no longer Cyrus.” 17. The soldiers, in consequence, being <lb/>
            filled with great expectations, prayed that he might succeed; <lb/>
            and to Menon Cyrus was said to have sent most magnifi­ <lb/>
            cent presents. After these transactions, he passed the river, <lb/>
            and all the rest of the army followed him ; and, in crossing <lb/>
            the stream, no one was wetted by its waters above the breast. <lb/>
            18. The people of Thapsacus said, that this river had never, ex­ <lb/>
            cept on that occasion, been passable on foot, but only by means <lb/>
            of boats; which Abrocomas, going before, had burnt, that <lb/>
            Cyrus might not be able to cross. It seemed, therefore, that <lb/>
            this had happened by divine interposition, and that the river <lb/>
            had plainly made way for Cyrus as the future king.</p>
          <p>19. Hence he advanced through Syria, nine days' march, a <lb/>
            distance of fifty parasangs, and arrived at the rier Araxes, <lb/>
            where were a number of villages, stored with corn and wine. <lb/>
            Here the army remained three days, and collected provisions.</p>

          <p>the eriny proceeds through Arabia, having the Euphrates on the right. <lb/>
            They suffer from want of provisions, and many of the beasts of burden <lb/>
            perish ; but supplies are procured from the opposite bank of the Eu­ <lb/>

            distance of thirty-five parasangs. In this region the ground <lb/>

            trees. 2. There were wild animals, however, of various kinds ; <lb/>
            the most numerous were wild asses; there were also many <lb/>
            ostriches, as well as bustards and antelopes ; and these ani­ <lb/>
            mals the horsemen of the army sometimes hunted. The wild <lb/>
            asses, when anyone pursued them, would start forward a con­ <lb/>
            siderable distance, and then stand still; (for they ran much <lb/>
            more swiftly than the horse ;) and again, when the horse ap­ <lb/>
            proached, they did the same; and it was impossible to catch <lb/>
            them, unless the horsemen, stationing themselves at intervals, <lb/>
            kept up the pursuit with a succession of horses. The flesh of <lb/>
            those that were taken resembled venison, but was more ten­ <lb/>
            der. 3. An ostrich no one succeeded in catching ; and those <lb/>
            horsemen who hunted that bird, soon desisted from the pur­ <lb/>
            suit; for it far outstripped1 them in its flight, using its <lb/>
            feet for running, and its wings, raising them like a sail.2 The <lb/>
            bustards might be taken, if a person started them suddenly; <lb/>
            for they fly but a short distance, like partridges, and soon <lb/>
            tire. Their flesh was very delicious.</p>
          <p>4. Marching through this region, they came to the river <lb/>
            Mascas, the breadth of which is a plethrum. Here was a <lb/>
            large deserted city, of which the name was Corsote, and <lb/>
            which was entirely surrounded by the Mascas. Here they <lb/>
            stayed three days, and furnished themselves with provisions.</p>
          <p>5. Thence he proceeded, thirteen days' march through <lb/>
            the desert, a distance of ninety parasangs, still keeping the <lb/>
            Euphrates on the right, and arrived at a place called the <lb/>
            Gates.3 In this march many of the beasts of burden perished <lb/>
            of hunger ; for there was neither grass, nor any sort of tree, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Απεσπα̃το</foreign>.] "Drew itself away from " its pursuers. There are <lb/>

            but the whole country was completely bare. The inhabitants, <lb/>
            who quarried and fashioned millstones near the river, took <lb/>
            them to Babylon, and sold them, and lived upon corn which <lb/>
            they bought with the money. 6. Corn, too, failed the army, <lb/>
            and it was not possible to buy any, except in the Lydian <lb/>
            market among Cyrus's Barbarian troops, where they pur­ <lb/>
            chased a capithe1 of wheat-flour or barley-meal for four sigH. <lb/>
            The siglus is equivalent to seven Attic oboli and a half,2 and <lb/>
            the capithe contains two Attic chœnices. The soldiers <lb/>
            therefore lived entirely upon flesh.</p>
          <p>7. There were some of these marches which he made ex­ <lb/>
            tremely long, whenever he wished to get to water or forage. <lb/>
            On one occasion, when a narrow and muddy road presented <lb/>
            itself, almost impassable for the waggons, Cyrus halted on <lb/>
            the spot with the most distinguished and wealthy of his train, <lb/>
            and ordered Glus and Pigres, with a detachment of the Bar­ <lb/>
            barian forces, to assist in extricating the waggons. 8. But <lb/>
            as they appeared to him to do this too tardily, lie ordered, as <lb/>
            if in anger, the noblest Persians of his suite to assist in ex­ <lb/>
            pediting the carriages. Then might be seen a specimen of <lb/>
            their ready obedience; for, throwing off their purple cloaks, <lb/>
            in the place where each happened to be standing, they rushed <lb/>
            forward, as one would run in a race for victory, down an ex­ <lb/>
            tremely steep declivity, having on those rich vests which <lb/>
            they wear, and embroidered trowsers, some too with chains <lb/>
            about their necks and bracelets on their wrists, and, leaping <lb/>
            with these equipments straight into the mud, brought the <lb/>
            waggons up quicker than any one would have imagined.</p>
          <p>9. On the whole, Cyrus evidently used the greatest speed <lb/>
            throughout the march, and made no delay, except where <lb/>
            he halted in order to obtain a supply of provisions, or for <lb/>
            some other necessary purpose; thinking that the quicker <lb/>
            he went, the more unprepared he should find the king when <lb/>
            lie engaged him, and that the more slowly he proceeded, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καπίϑη</foreign>] A measure, as is said below, equal to two Attic chœ­ <lb/>

            the more numerous would be the force collected by the kins, <lb/>
            And an attentive observer might see that the empire of the <lb/>
            king was strong indeed in extent of territory and number of <lb/>
            inhabitants, but weak through the length of the roads, and <lb/>
            the dispersion of its forces, if an enemy invaded it with rapid <lb/>
            movements.</p>
          <p>to. On the other side of the Euphrates, over against their <lb/>
            course through the desert, was an opulent and extensive city, <lb/>
            called Charmande ; from this place the soldiers purchased <lb/>
            provisions, crossing the river on rafts in the following manner. <lb/>
            They filled the skins, which they had for the coverings of <lb/>
            their tents,1 with dry hay, and then closed and stitched them <lb/>
            together, so that the water could not touch the hay. Upon <lb/>
            these they went across, and procured necessaries, such as wine <lb/>
            made of the fruit of the palm-tree, and panic2 corn ; for this <lb/>
            was most plentiful in those parts. 11. Here the soldiers of <lb/>
            Menon and those of Clearchus falling into a dispute about <lb/>
            something, Clearchus, judging a soldier of Menon's to be in <lb/>
            the wrong, inflicted stripes upon him, and the man, coming to <lb/>
            the quarters of his own troops, told his comrades what had <lb/>
            occurred, who, when they heard it, showed great displeasure <lb/>
            and resentment towards Clearchus. 12. On the same day, <lb/>
            Clearchus, after going to the place where the river was crossed, <lb/>
            and inspecting the market there, was returning on horseback <lb/>
            to his tent through Menon's camp, with a few attendants. <lb/>
            Cyrus had not yet arrived, but was still on his way thither. <lb/>
            One of Menon's soldiers, who was employed in cleaving wood, <lb/>
            when he saw Clearchus riding through the camp, threw his <lb/>
            axe at him, but missed his aim ; another then threw a stone <lb/>
            at him, and another, and afterwards several, a great uproar <lb/>
            ensuing. 13. Clearchus sought refuge in his own camp, and <lb/>
            immediately called his men to arms, ordering his heavy-armed <lb/>
            troops to remain on the spot, resting their shields against their <lb/>
            knees, while he himself, with the Thracians, and the horse- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκεπάσματα</foreign> is the reading of Dindorf, but it ought rather to be <lb/>

            men that were in his camp, to the number of more than forty, <lb/>
            (and most of these were Thracians,) bore down towards the <lb/>
            troops of Menon, so that they and Menon himself were struck <lb/>
            with terror, and made a general rush to their arms; while <lb/>
            some stood still, not knowing how to act under the circum­ <lb/>
            stances. 14. Proxenus happened then to be coming up be­ <lb/>
            hind the rest, with a body of heavy-armed men following <lb/>
            him, and immediately led his troops into the middle space be­ <lb/>
            tween them both, and drew them up under arms, begging <lb/>
            Clearchus to desist from what he was doing. But Clearchus <lb/>
            was indignant, because, when he had narrowly escaped stoning, <lb/>
            Proxenus spoke mildly of the treatment that he had received; <lb/>
            he accordingly desired him to stand out from between them.</p>
          <p>15. At this juncture Cyrus came up, and inquired into the, <lb/>
            affair. He then instantly took his javelins in his hand, and <lb/>
            rode, with such of his confidential officers as were with him, into <lb/>
            the midst of the Greeks, and addressed them thus: 16. <lb/>
            “Clearchus and Proxenus, and you other Greeks who are <lb/>
            here present, you know not what you are doing. For if you <lb/>
            engage in any contention with one another, be assured, that <lb/>
            this very day I shall be cut off, and you also not long after me ; <lb/>
            since, if our affairs go ill, all these Barbarians, whom you see <lb/>
            before you, will prove more dangerous enemies to us than <lb/>
            even those who are with the king." IT. Clearchus, on hear­ <lb/>
            ing these remonstrances, recovered his self-possession; and <lb/>
            both parties, desisting from the strife, deposited their arms in <lb/>
            their respective encampments.</p>

          <p>Traces of the king's troops are perceived. Orontes, a Persian nol leman, a re­ <lb/>
            lation of Cyrus, offers to go forward with a body of cavalry, and lay an <lb/>
            ambush for the king's army. Before he sets out, however, he is found to <lb/>
            be in correspondence with the king, and is put to death.</p>
          <p>1. As they advanced from this place, the footsteps and dung <lb/>
            of horses were observed, and the track was conjectured to be <lb/>
            that of about two thousand cavalry. These, as they went be­ <lb/>
            fore, had burnt all the fodder, and whatever else might have <lb/>
            been of use to Cyrus. And here Orontes, a Persian, by birth <pb n="25"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            connected with the king, and reckoned one of the ablest of the <lb/>
            Persians in the field, turned traitor to Cyrus; with whom, indeed, <lb/>
            he had previously been at strife, but had been reconciled to <lb/>
            him. 2. He now told Cyrus, that if he would give him a <lb/>
            thousand horse, he would either cut off, by lying in ambush, the <lb/>
            body of cavalry that were burning all before them, or would take <lb/>
            the greater number of them prisoners, and hinder them from <lb/>
            consuming everything in their way, and prevent them from <lb/>
            ever informing the king that they had seen the army of Cyrus. <lb/>
            Cyrus, when he heard his proposal, thought it advantageous; <lb/>
            and desired him to take a certain number of men from each <lb/>
            of the different commanders.</p>
          <p>3. Orontes, thinking that lie had secured the cavalry, <lb/>
            wrote a letter to the king, saying that he would come to <lb/>
            him with as many horse as he could obtain ; and he de­ <lb/>
            sired him to give directions to his own cavalry to receive <lb/>
            him as a friend. There were also in the letter expressions <lb/>
            reminding the king of his former friendship and fidelity <lb/>
            to him. This letter he gave to a man, upon whom, as he <lb/>
            believed, he could depend, but who, when he received <lb/>
            it, carried it to Cyrus. 4. Cyrus, after reading the letter, <lb/>
            caused Orontes to be arrested, and summoned to his own tent <lb/>
            seven of the most distinguished Persians of his staff, and de­ <lb/>
            sired the Greek generals to bring up a body of heavy-armed <lb/>
            men, who should arrange themselves under arms around his <lb/>
            tent. They did as he desired, and brought with them about <lb/>
            three thousand heavy-armed soldiers. 5. Clearchus he called <lb/>
            in to assist at the council, as that officer appeared, both to him­ <lb/>
            self and to the rest, to be held most in honour among the <lb/>
            Greeks. Afterwards, when Clearchus left the council, he re­ <lb/>
            lated to his friends how the trial of Orontes was conducted ; <lb/>
            for there was no injunction of secrecy. He said, that <lb/>
            Cyrus thus opened the proceedings :</p>
          <p>6. " I have solicited your attendance, my friends, in order <lb/>
            that, on consulting with you, I may do, with regard to Orontes <lb/>
            here before you, whatever may be thought just before gods <lb/>
            and men. In the first place, then, my father appointed him to <lb/>
            be subject to me. And when afterwards, by the command, <lb/>
            as he himself states, of my brother, he engaged in war against <lb/>
            me, having possession of the citadel of Sardis, I, too, took up <lb/>
            arms against him, and made him resolve to desist from <pb n="26"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I</note> <lb/>
            war with me; and then I received from him, and gave turn <lb/>
            in return, the right-hand of friendship. 7. And since that <lb/>
            occurrence," lie continued, "is there anything in which I have <lb/>
            wronged you? " Orontes replied that there was not. Cyrus <lb/>
            again asked him, "And did you not then subsequently, when, <lb/>
            as you own yourself, you had received no injury from me, go <lb/>
            over to the Mysians, and do all the mischief in your power to <lb/>
            my territories?" Orontes answered in the affirmative. " And <lb/>
            did you not then," continued Cyrus, " when you had thus <lb/>
            again proved your strength, come to the altar of Diana, and <lb/>
            say that you repented, and, prevailing upon me by entreaties, <lb/>
            give me, and receive from me in return, pledges of mutual <lb/>
            faith?" This, too, Orontes acknowledged. 8. "What in­ <lb/>
            jury, then," continued Cyrus, "have you received from me, <lb/>
            that you are now, for the third time, discovered in traitorous <lb/>
            designs against me ? " Orontes saying that he had received <lb/>
            no injury from him, Cyrus asked him, "You confess, then, <lb/>
            that you have acted unjustly towards me ?" " I am necessi­ <lb/>
            tated to confess it," replied Orontes. Cyrus then again in­ <lb/>
            quired, " And would you yet become an enemy to my brother, <lb/>
            and a faithful friend to me ? " Orontes answered, " Though <lb/>
            I should become so, 0 Cyrus, I should no longer appear so to <lb/>
            you." 9. On this, Cyrus said to those present, " Such are this <lb/>
            man's deeds, and such his confessions. And now, do you first, <lb/>
            0 Clearchus, declare your opinion, whatever seems right to <lb/>
            you." Clearchus spoke thus : " I advise, that this man be put <lb/>
            out of the way with all despatch ; that so it may be no longer <lb/>
            necessary to be on our guard against him, but that we may <lb/>
            have leisure, as far as he is concerned, to benefit those who are <lb/>
            willing to be our friends." to. In this opinion, Clearchus <lb/>
            said, the rest concurred. Afterwards, by the direction of <lb/>
            Cyrus, all of them, even those related to the prisoner, rising <lb/>
            from their seats, took Orontes by the girdle,1 in token that he <lb/>
            was to suffer death; when those to whom directions had been <lb/>
            given, led him away. And when those saw turn pass, who <lb/>
            had previously been used to bow before him, they bowed be­ <lb/>
            fore him as usual, though they knew that he was being led to <lb/>
            execution. <note type="footnote"> I This was a custom among the Persians on such occasions, as is <lb/>

            and promises them great rewards in ease of victory. He advances in order <lb/>
            of battle, but afterwards, supposing that his brother had no immediate <lb/>
            intention to engage, proceeds with less caution.</p>
          <p>1. HENCE Cyrus proceeded through Babylonia, three days' <lb/>
            march, a distance of twelve parasangs; and at the end of <lb/>
            the third day's march, he reviewed his army, both Greeks <lb/>
            and Barbarians, in the plain, about midnight; for lie expected <lb/>
            that with the ensuing dawn the king would come up with his <lb/>
            army to offer him battle. He desired Clearchus to take <lb/>
            the command of the right wing, and Menon the Thessalian <lb/>
            that of the left, while he himself drew up his own troops.</p>

            of the Greeks, consulted with them how he should conduct <lb/>
            the engagement, and then encouraged them with the following <lb/>
            exhortations: 3. " It is not, 0 Greeks, from any want of Bar­ <lb/>
            barian farces, that I take yon with me as auxiliaries ; but it is <lb/>
            because I think you more efficient and valuable than a multi­ <lb/>
            tude of Barbarians, that I have engaged you in my service. <lb/>
            See, then, that you prove yourselves worthy of the liberty of <lb/>
            which you are possessed, and for which I esteem you fortunate ; <lb/>
            for be well assured, that I should prefer that freedom to all <lb/>
            that I possess, and to other possessions many times as great.</p>
          <p>4. But, that you may know to what sort of encounter you are <lb/>
            advancing, I, from my own experience, will inform you. The <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκηπτούχων</foreign>.] "Eunuchs, who, by the institution of Cyrus the <lb/>

            enemy's numbers are immense, and they make their onset with <lb/>
            a loud shout; but if you are firm against this, I feel ashamed <lb/>
            to think what sort of men, in other respects, you will find <lb/>
            those in the country to be. But if you are true men, and <lb/>
            prove yourselves stout-hearted, I will enable those of yon, who <lb/>
            may wish to go home, to return thither the envy of their fellow- <lb/>
            countrymen ; but I think that I shall induce most of you to <lb/>
            prefer the advantages of remaining with me to those in your <lb/>
            own country."</p>
          <p>5. Upon this, Gaulites, an exile from Samos, a man in the <lb/>
            confidence of Cyrus, being present, said, " Yet some say, O <lb/>
            Cyrus, that you make many promises now, because you are <lb/>
            in such a situation of approaching danger; but that if things <lb/>
            should turn out well, you will not remember them;1 and some, <lb/>
            too, say, that even if you have both the memory and the will, you <lb/>
            will not have the power of bestowing all that you promise." <lb/>
            6. Hearing this, Cyrus said, " We have before us, my friends, <lb/>
            the empire that was my father's, extending, on the south, to <lb/>
            the parts where men cannot live for heat; and on the north, <lb/>
            to the parts where they cannot live for cold ; and over all that <lb/>
            lies between these extremes, the friends of my brother are now <lb/>
            satraps. 7. But if we conquer, it will be proper for us to <lb/>
            make our own friends masters of these regions. So that it is <lb/>
            not this that I fear, that I shall not have enough to give to each <lb/>
            of my friends, if things turn out successfully, but that I shall <lb/>
            not have friends enough to whom I may give it. And to each <lb/>
            of you Greeks, I will also give a golden crown."</p>
          <p>8. The Greeks who were present, when they heard these as <lb/>
            surances, were much encouraged, and reported what he had said <lb/>
            to the rest. The captains, too, and some others of the Greeks, <lb/>
            went into his tent, desiring to know for certain what would <lb/>
            be their reward if they should be victorious; and he did not <lb/>
            let them go without satisfying the minds of all.</p>
          <p>9. But all, who conversed with him, urged him not to en­ <lb/>
            gage in the battle personally, but take his station behind their <lb/>
            line. About this time, also, Clearchus put a question to Cyrus <lb/>
            to this effect: " And do you think, Cyrus, that your brother <note type="footnote">1 ob <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεμνῆσθαι</foreign>.] This is the reading in all books and manuscripts. <lb/>
            But a future seems to be wanted rather than a perfect. Hutchinson <lb/>
            and others render it " te non fore memorem." Should we read <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            will come to battle with you ? " " By Jupiter," replied Cyrus, <lb/>
            "if he be indeed the son of Darius and Parysatis, and my <lb/>
            brother, I shall not gain possession of these dominions without <lb/>
            a struggle."</p>
          <p>10. In mustering the Greeks under arms, their numbers <lb/>
            were found to be ten thousand four hundred heavy-armed <lb/>
            men, and two thousand four hundred peltasts ; of Barbarian <lb/>
            troops under Cyrus, there were one hundred thousand, with <lb/>
            about twenty chariots armed with scythes.</p>
          <p>11. Of the enemy the number was said to be one million <lb/>
            two hundred thousand, with two hundred scythed chariots. <lb/>
            There were, besides, six thousand cavalry, of whom Artagerses <lb/>
            had the command; these were drawn up in front of the king <lb/>
            himself. 12. Of the royal army there were four command­ <lb/>
            ers, or generals, or leaders,1 each over three hundred thou­ <lb/>
            sand men ; that is to say, Abroeomas, Tissaphernes, Gobryas, <lb/>
            and Arbaces. But of this number only nine hundred thousand <lb/>
            were present at the battle, and one hundred and fifty seythed <lb/>
            chariots; for Abrocomas, who was marching from Phœnicia, <lb/>
            did not arrive till five days after the battle.</p>
          <p>13. This information was brought to Cyrus by some of the <lb/>
            enemy who deserted from the Great King before the battle: <lb/>
            and such of the enemy as were taken prisoners after the bat­ <lb/>
            tle gave the same account.</p>
          <p>14. Hence Cyrus proceeded one day's march, a distance of <lb/>
            three parasangs, with all his forces, as well Greek as Barba­ <lb/>
            rian, drawn up in order of battle; for he expected that on <lb/>
            this day the king would give him battle; as about the middle <lb/>
            of the day's march, there was a deep trench dug; the breadth <lb/>
            of it was five fathoms,2 and the depth three. 15. This ditch <lb/>
            extended up through the plain, to the distance of twelve para­ <lb/>
            gangs, as far as the wall of Media.3 Here are the canals which <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ησαν ἄρχοντες καὶ στράτηγοι καὶ ἡγεμόνες τέτταρες</foreign>.] Weiske <lb/>

            are supplied from the river Tigris ;1 there are four or them, each <lb/>
            a plethrum in breadth, and very deep ; boats employed in con­ <lb/>
            veying corn sail along them. They discharge themselves into <lb/>
            the Euphrates, are distant from each other one parasang, and <lb/>
            there are bridges over them. Near the Euphrates was a nar­ <lb/>
            row passage between the river and the trench, about twenty <lb/>
            feet in breadth. 16. This trench the Great King had made <lb/>
            to serve as a defence, when he heard that Cyrus was march­ <lb/>
            ing against him. By this passage Cyrus and his army made <lb/>
            their way, and got within the trench.</p>
          <p>17. On this day the king did not come to an engagement, <lb/>
            but there were to be seen many traces of men and horses in <lb/>
            retreat.</p>
          <p>IS. Cyrus sent for Silanus, the Ambracian soothsayer, and <lb/>
            gave him three thousand darics,2 because, on the eleventh <lb/>
            day previous, while sacrificing, he had told Cyrus that the <lb/>
            king would not fight for ten days; when Cyrus exclaimed, <lb/>
            " He will not then fight at all, if he does not fight within that <lb/>
            time; but if you shall prove to have spoken truly, I promise <lb/>
            to give you ten talents." This money, therefore, he now paid <lb/>
            him, the ten days having elapsed.</p>
          <p>19. As the king made no attempt, at the trench, to prevent <lb/>
            the passage of Cyrus's army, it was thought both by Cyrus <lb/>
            and the rest that he had given up the intention of fighting ; <lb/>
            so that on the day following Cyrus proceeded on his march <lb/>
            with less caution. 20. On the day succeeding that, he <note type="footnote"> named from Medea, the wife of the last king of the Medes, whom the <lb/>
            Persians conquered <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μηδίας</foreign>," and despoiled of his dominions. " Those who <lb/>
            defend the reading continues Kiihner, "suppose the name <lb/>
            to be derived from the country of Media, and believe, with Man­ <lb/>
            nert, (Geog. i. p. 330,) that it is the same wall which Semiramis built <lb/>
            to defend her kingdom on the side of Media ; but this opinion rests <lb/>
            on very weak arguments." Ainsworth, p. 180, thinks that it ex­ <lb/>
            tended from the Tigris to the Euphrates, and that the site of it is <lb/>
            indicated by the ruins now called Sidd Nimrud, or " the Wall of <lb/>
            Ninirod." </note><note type="footnote"> ' "These canals however flowed, not from the Tigris into the <lb/>

            later writers." Kühner. But " the difference in the level of the <lb/>

            pursued his journey seated in his chariot, and having but a <lb/>

          <p>The enemy are seen advancing in order of battle, and the army of Cyrus <lb/>
            hastily prepare for action. The Greeks, in the right wing, put to flight <lb/>
            the troops opposed to them, and pursue them some distance. Cyrus, in <lb/>
            the centre, directs his attack against the king, and is killed.</p>
          <p>1. IT was now about the time of full market,1 and the <lb/>
            station, where he intended to halt, was not far off, when <lb/>
            Pategyas, a Persian, one of Cyrus's confidential adherents, <lb/>
            made his appearance, riding at his utmost speed, with his <lb/>
            horse in a sweat, and straightway called out to all whom he <lb/>
            met, both in Persian and Greek, " that the king was approach­ <lb/>
            ing with a vast army, prepared as for battle." 2. Immediately <lb/>
            great confusion ensued ; for the Greeks and all the rest ima­ <lb/>
            gined that he would fall upon them suddenly, before they could <lb/>
            form their ranks; 3. and Cyrus, leaping from his chariot, put <lb/>
            on his breastplate, and, mounting his horse, took his javelin <lb/>
            in his hand, and gave orders for all the rest to arm themselves, <lb/>
            and to take their stations each in his own place. 4. They <lb/>
            accordingly formed with all expedition ; Clearchus occupying <lb/>
            the extremity of the right wing close to the Euphrates, Prox­ <lb/>
            enus being next to him, and after him the other captains in <lb/>
            succession. Menon and his troops occupied the left wing of <lb/>
            the Greeks.</p>
          <p>5. Of the Barbarian forces, about one thousand Paphlago. <lb/>
            nian cavalry were stationed near Clearchus, and the Grecian <lb/>
            peltasts on the right; and on the left was Ariæus, Cyrus's <lb/>
            lieutenant, with the rest of the Barbarian troops. 6. In the <lb/>
            centre2 was Cyrus, and with him about six hundred cavalry, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμφὶ ἀγορὰν πλήθονσαν</foreign>.] The time from the tenth hour till <lb/>

              self for battle with his head unprotected. [It is said, too, that <lb/>
              the other Persians expose themselves in battle with their <lb/>

          <p>7. All the horses of the cavalry, that were with Cyrus, had <lb/>
            defensive armour on the forehead and breast; and the horse­ <lb/>
            men had also Grecian swords.</p>
          <p>8. It was now mid-day, and the enemy was not yet in sight. <lb/>
            But when it was afternoon,2 there appeared a dust, like a <lb/>
            white cloud, and not long after, a sort of blackness, extending <lb/>
            to a great distance over the plain. Presently, as they ap. <lb/>
            preached nearer, brazen armour began to flash, and the spears <lb/>
            and ranks became visible. 9. There was a body of cavalry, <lb/>
            in white armour, on the left of the enemy's line ; (Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes was said to have the command of them ;) close by <lb/>
            these were troops with wicker shields; and next to them, <lb/>

            design of them was to penetrate and divide the ranks of the <lb/>
            Greeks.</p>
          <p>11. As to what Cyrus had said, however, when, on calling <lb/>
            together the Greeks, he exhorted them to sustain unmoved <lb/>
            the shout of the Barbarians, he was in this respect deceived; <lb/>
            for they now approached, not with a shout, but with all pos­ <lb/>
            sible silence, and quietly, with an even and slow step. 12. <lb/>
            Cyrus in the mean time, riding by with Pigres the interpreter, <lb/>
            and three or four others, called out to Clearchus to lead his <lb/>
            troops against the enemy's centre, for that there was the king ; <lb/>
            " and if," said he, "we are victorious in that quarter, our ob­ <lb/>
            ject is fully accomplished." 13. But though Clearchus saw <lb/>
            that close collection of troops in the centre of the enemy's <lb/>
            line, and heard from Cyrus that the king was beyond the left <lb/>
            of the Greeks, (for so much the superior was the king in <lb/>
            numbers, that, while occupying the middle of his own line, <lb/>
            he was still beyond Cyrus's left,) nevertheless he was unwill­ <lb/>
            ing to draw off his right wing from the river, fearing lest he <lb/>
            should be hemmed in on both sides ; and in answer to Cyrus <lb/>
            he said, " that he would take care that all should go well."</p>
          <p>14. During this time the Barbarian army advanced with a <lb/>
            uniform pace; and the Grecian line, still remaining in the <lb/>
            same place, was gradually forming from those who came up <lb/>
            from time to time. Cyrus, riding by at a moderate distance <lb/>
            from his army, 1 surveyed from thence both the lines, looking <lb/>
            as well towards the enemy as to his own men. 15. Xenophon, <lb/>
            an Athenian, perceiving him from the Grecian line, rode up <lb/>
            to meet him, and inquired whether he had any commands ; <lb/>
            when Cyrus stopped his horse, and told him, and desired him <lb/>

            noise that was. He answered,1 " that it was the watchword, <lb/>
            passing now for the second time."2 At which Cyrus won­ <lb/>
            dered who had given it, and asked what the word was. He <lb/>
            replied that it was, " JUPITER THE PRESERVER and VICTORY." <lb/>
            17. When Cyrus heard it, " I accept it as a good omen," said <lb/>
            he, " and let it be so." Saying this, he rode away to his own <lb/>
            station ; and the two armies were now not more than three or <lb/>
            four stadia distant from each other, when the Greeks sang the <lb/>
            pæan, and began to march forward to meet the enemy. 18. <lb/>
            And as, while they proceeded, some part of their body fluctu­ <lb/>
            ated out of line,3 those who were thus left behind began to run : <lb/>
            and at the same time, they all raised just such a shout as they <lb/>
            usually raise to Mars, and the whole of them took to a run­ <lb/>
            ning pace. Some say, that they made a noise with their <lb/>
            spears against their shields, to strike terror into the horses. <lb/>
            19. But the Barbarians, before an arrow could reach them, gave <lb/>
            way, and took to flight. The Greeks then pursued them <lb/>
            with all their force, calling out to each other, not to run, but <lb/>
            to follow in order. 20. The chariots, abandoned by their <lb/>
            drivers, were hurried, some through the midst of the enemies <lb/>
            themselves, and others through the midst of the Greeks. <note type="footnote"> I Dindorf has <foreign xml:lang="grc">ό δὲ</foreign> K.<foreign xml:lang="grc">λέαρχος εἴπεν</foreign>, which is the reading of some <lb/>

            The Greeks, when they saw them coming, opened their ranks <lb/>
            to let them pass; some few, however, were startled and <lb/>
            caught by them, as might happen in a race-course ; but <lb/>
            these, they said, suffered no material injury; nor did any <lb/>
            other of the Greeks receive any hurt in this battle, except <lb/>
            that, on the left of their army, a man was said to have been <lb/>
            shot with an arrow.</p>
          <p>21. Cyrus, though he saw the Greeks victorious, and pur­ <lb/>
            suing those of the enemies who were opposed to them, and <lb/>
            though he felt great pleasure at the sight, and was already <lb/>
            saluted as king by those about him, was not, however, led <lb/>
            away to join in the pursuit; but keeping the band of six hun­ <lb/>
            dred cavalry, that were with him, drawn up in close order around <lb/>
            hini, he attentively watched how the king would proceed ; for <lb/>
            lie well knew that he occupied the centre of the Persian army. <lb/>
            22. All the commanders of the Barbarians, indeed, lead1 their <lb/>
            troops to battle occupying the centre of their own men ; <lb/>
            thinking that they will thus be most secure, if they have the <lb/>
            strength of their force on either side of them, and that if they <lb/>
            have occasion to issue orders, their army will receive them in <lb/>
            half the time. 23. On the present occasion, the king, though <lb/>
            he occupied the centre of his own army, was nevertheless be­ <lb/>
            yond Cyrus's left wing. But as no enemy attacked him in <lb/>
            front, or the troops that were drawn up before him, he began <lb/>
            to wheel round, as if to enclose his adversaries. 24. Cyrus, in <lb/>
            consequence, fearing that he might take the Greeks in the <lb/>
            rear, and cut them in pieces, moved directly upon him, and <lb/>
            charging with his six hundred horse, routed the troops that <lb/>
            were stationed in front of the king, and put the guard of six <lb/>
            thousand to flight, and is said to have killed with his own <lb/>
            hand Artagerses, their commander.</p>
          <p>25. When this flight of the enemy took place, Cyrus's six <lb/>
            hundred became dispersed in the eagerness of pursuit; only a <lb/>
            very few remaining with him, chiefly those who were called <lb/>
            "partakers of his table."</p>
          <p>26. While accompanied by these, he perceived the king and <lb/>
            the close guard around him; when he immediately lost his <lb/>
            self-command, and exclaiming, "I see the man," rushed upon <note type="footnote"> I '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Πγου̃νυαι</foreign>.] Schneider, Kühner, and some other editors have <lb/>

            breastplate, as Ctesias, the physician, relates, stating that he <lb/>
            himself dressed the wound. 27. As Cyrus was in the act of <lb/>
            striking, some one hit him violently with a javelin under <lb/>
            the eye ; and how many of those about the king were killed, <lb/>
            (while they thus fought, the king, and Cyrus, and their re­ <lb/>

            was with him; on the other side, Cyrus himself was killed, <lb/>
            and eight of his principal officers lay dead upon his body. 28. <lb/>
            Artapates, the most faithful servant to him of all his sceptre- <lb/>
            bearers, 1 when he saw Cyrus fall, is said to have leaped from <lb/>
            his horse, and thrown himself upon the body of his master; <lb/>
            29. and some say, that the king ordered some one to kill him <lb/>
            on the body of Cyrus; but others relate, that lie drew his <lb/>
            scimitar, and killed himself upon the body; for he had a <lb/>
            golden scimitar by his side, and also wore a chain and brace­ <lb/>
            lets, and other ornaments, like the noblest of the Persians; <lb/>

          <p>1. THUS then died Cyrus; a man who, of all the Persians <lb/>
            since Cyrus the elder, was the most princely and most worthy <lb/>
            of empire, as is agreed by all who appeat to have had personal <lb/>
            knowledge of him. 2. In the first place, while he was yet a <lb/>
            boy, and when he was receiving his education with his brother <lb/>
            and the other youths, he was thought to surpass them all in <lb/>
            everything. a. For all the sons of the Persian nobles are <lb/>
            educated at the gates of the king; 2 where they may learn <note type="footnote"> I See c. 6, sect. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επὶ ται̑ς βασιλέως ϑύραις</foreign>.] For " at the king's palace." " The <lb/>
            king's palace was styled among the ancient Persians, as in the mo­ <lb/>
            dern Constantinople, the Porte. Agreeably to the customs of other <lb/>
            despots of the East, the kings of Persia resided in the interior of their <lb/>
            palaces; seldom appearing in public, and guarding all means of <lb/>
            access to their persons. The number of courtiers. masters of cere­ <lb/>
            mor ies, guards, and others was endless. It was through them alone </note> <pb n="37"/>

            many a lesson of virtuous conduct, but can see or hear nothing <lb/>
            disgraceful. 4. Here the boys see some honoured by the king, <lb/>
            and others disgraced, and hear of them ; so that in their very <lb/>
            childhood they learn to govern and to obey.</p>
          <p>5. Here Cyrus, first of all, showed himself most remark­ <lb/>
            able for modesty among those of his own age, and for paying <lb/>
            more ready obedience to his elders than even those who were <lb/>
            inferior to him in station ; and next, he was noted for his <lb/>
            fondness for horses, and for managing them in a superior <lb/>
            manner. They found him, too, very desirous of learning, <lb/>
            and most assiduous in practising, the warlike exercises of <lb/>
            archery, and hurling the javelin. 6. When it suited his age, <lb/>
            he grew extremely fond of the chase, and of braving dangers <lb/>
            in encounters with wild beasts. On one occasion, he did not <lb/>
            shrink from a she-bear that attacked him, but, in grappling <lb/>
            with her, was dragged from off his horse, and received some <lb/>
            wounds, the scars of which were visible on his body, but at last <lb/>
            killed her. The person who first came to his assistance he <lb/>
            made a happy man in the eyes of many.</p>
          <p>7. When he was sent down by his father, as satrap of <lb/>
            Lydia and Great Phrygia and Cappadocia, and was also ap­ <lb/>
            pointed commander of all the troops whose duty it is to <lb/>
            muster in the plain of Castolus, he soon showed that if he <lb/>
            made a league or compact with any one, or gave a promise, <lb/>
            lie deemed it of the utmost importance not to break his word. <lb/>
            8. Accordingly the states that were committed to his charge, <lb/>
            as well as individuals, had the greatest confidence in him; <lb/>
            and if any one had been his enemy, he felt secure that if <lb/>
            Cyrus entered into a treaty with him, he should suffer no in­ <lb/>
            fraction of the stipulations. 9. When, therefore, he waged <lb/>
            war against Tissaphernes, all the cities, of their own accord, <lb/>
            chose to adhere to Cyrus in preference to Tissaphernes, ex­ <lb/>
            cept the Milesians; but they feared him, because he would <lb/>
            not abandon the cause of the exiles; 10. for he both showed <lb/>
            by his deeds, and declared in words, that he would never de­ <lb/>
            sert them, since he had once become a friend to them, not <lb/>
            even though they should grow still fewer in number, and be <lb/>
            in a worse condition than they were. <note type="footnote"> that access could be obtained to the monarch." Heeren, Researches, <lb/>

            showed himself anxious to go beyond him in those respects ; <lb/>
            and some used to mention a wish of his, that "he desired to <lb/>
            live long enough to outdo both those who had done him <lb/>
            good, and those who had done him ill, in the requital that <lb/>
            he should make." 12. Accordingly to him alone of the men <lb/>
            of our days were so great a number of people desirous of <lb/>
            committing the disposal of their property, their cities, and <lb/>
            their own persons.</p>
          <p>13. Yet no one could with truth say this of him, that he <lb/>
            suffered the criminal or unjust to deride his authority; for <lb/>
            he of all men inflicted punishment most unsparingly; and <lb/>
            there were often to be seen, along the most frequented roads, <lb/>
            men deprived of their feet, or hands, or eyes ; so that in <lb/>
            Cyrus's dominions, it was possible for any one, Greek or Bar­ <lb/>
            barian, who did no wrong, to travel without fear whither­ <lb/>
            soever he pleased, and having with him whatever might suit <lb/>
            his convenience.</p>
          <p>14. To those who showed ability for war, it is acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged that he paid distinguished honour. His first war was <lb/>
            with the Pisidians and Mysians ; and, marching in person <lb/>
            into these countries, lie made those, whom he saw voluntarily <lb/>
            hazarding their lives in his service, governors over the terri­ <lb/>
            tory that he subdued, and distinguished them with rewards <lb/>
            in other ways. 15. So that the brave appeared to be the <lb/>
            most fortunate of men, while the cowardly were deemed fit1 <lb/>
            only to be their slaves. There were, therefore, great numbers <lb/>
            of persons who voluntarily exposed themselves to danger, <lb/>
            wherever they thought that Cyrus would become aware of <lb/>
            their exertions.</p>
          <p>16. With regard to justice, if any appeared to him inclined <lb/>
            to display that virtue, he made a point of making such men <lb/>
            richer than those who sought to profit by injustice. 17. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, while in many other respects his affairs were ad­ <lb/>
            ministered judiciously, he likewise possessed an army worthy <lb/>
            of the name. For it was not for money that generals and <lb/>
            captains came from foreign lands to enter into his service, <lb/>
            but because they were persuaded that to serve Cyrus well, <lb/>
            would be more profitable than any amount of monthly pay. <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αξιου̃σθαι</foreign>.] Lion, Poppo, Kiihner, and some other editors, read <lb/>

            IS. Besides, if any one executed his orders in a superior man­ <lb/>
            ner, he never suffered his diligence to go unrewarded ; con­ <lb/>
            sequently, in every undertaking, the best qualified officers <lb/>
            were said to be ready to assist him.</p>
          <p>19. If he noticed any one that was a skilful manager, with <lb/>
            strict regard to justice, stocking the land of which he had the <lb/>
            direction, and securing income from it, he would never taka <lb/>
            anything from such a person, but was ever ready to give him <lb/>
            something in addition ; so that men laboured with cheerful­ <lb/>
            ness, acquired property with confidence, and made no conceal­ <lb/>
            ment from Cyrus of what each possessed; for he did not <lb/>
            appear to envy those who amassed riches openly, but to en­ <lb/>
            deavour to bring into use the wealth of those who con­ <lb/>
            cealcd it.</p>
          <p>20. Whatever friends he made, and felt to be well-disposed <lb/>
            to him, and considered to be capable of assisting him in any­ <lb/>
            thing that lie might wish to accomplish, he is acknowledged <lb/>
            by all to have been most successful in attaching them to him. <lb/>
            21. For, on the very same account on which he thought that <lb/>
            he himself had need of friends, namely, that lie might have co- <lb/>
            operators in his undertakings, did he endeavour to prove an <lb/>
            efficient assistant to his friends in whatever he perceived <lb/>
            any of them desirous of effecting.</p>
          <p>22. He received, for many reasons, more presents than <lb/>
            perhaps any other single individual; and these he outdid <lb/>
            every one else in distributing amongst his friends, having a <lb/>
            view to the character of each, and to what he perceived each <lb/>
            most needed. 23. Whatever presents any one sent him of <lb/>
            articles of personal ornament, whether for warlike accoutre­ <lb/>
            ment, or merely for dress, concerning these, they said, he used <lb/>
            to remark, that he could not decorate his own person with <lb/>
            them all, but that he thought friends well equipped were the <lb/>
            greatest ornament a man could have. 24. That he should <lb/>
            outdo his friends, indeed, in conferring great benefits, is not <lb/>
            at all wonderful, since he was so much more able ; but, that <lb/>
            he should surpass his friends in kind attentions, and an anxious <lb/>
            desire to oblige, appears to me far more worthy of admiration. <lb/>
            25. Frequently, when he had wine served him of a peculiarly <lb/>
            fine flavour, he would send half-emptied flagons of it to some <lb/>
            of his friends, with a message to this effect: "Cyrus has <lb/>
            not for some time met with pleasanter wine than this; and he <pb n="40"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            has therefore sent some of it to you, and begs you will drink <lb/>
            it to-day, with those whom you love best." 26. He would <lb/>
            often, too, send geese partly eaten, and the halves of loaves, <lb/>
            and other such things, desiring the bearer to say, in present­ <lb/>
            ing them, " Cyrus has been delighted with these, and there­ <lb/>
            fore wishes you also to taste of them."</p>
          <p>27. Wherever provender was scarce, but he himself, from <lb/>
            having many attendants, and from the care which he took, <lb/>
            was able to procure some, he would send it about, and de­ <lb/>
            sire his friends to give that provender to the horses that <lb/>
            carried them, so that hungry steeds might not carry his <lb/>
            friends. 28. Whenever he rode out, and many were likely to <lb/>
            see him, he would call to him his friends, and hold earnest <lb/>
            conversation with them, that he might show whom he held in <lb/>
            honour ; so that, from what I have heard, I should think that <lb/>
            no one was ever beloved by a greater number of persons, <lb/>
            either Greeks or Barbarians. 29. Of this fact the following <lb/>
            is a proof; that no one deserted to the king from Cyrus, <lb/>
            though only a subject, (except that Orontes attempted to do <lb/>
            so ; but he soon found the person whom he believed faithful <lb/>
            to him, more a friend to Cyrus than to himself,) while many <lb/>
            came over to Cyrus from the king, after they became enemies <lb/>
            to each other; and these, too, men who were greatly beloved <lb/>
            by the king; for they felt persuaded, that if they proved <lb/>
            themselves brave soldiers under Cyrus, they would obtain <lb/>
            from him more adequate rewards for their services than from <lb/>
            the king.</p>
          <p>30. What occurred also at the time of his death, is a great <lb/>
            proof, as well that lie himself was a man of merit, as that he <lb/>
            could accurately distinguish such as were trust-worthy, well <lb/>
            disposed, and constant in their attachment. 31. For when he <lb/>
            was killed, all his friends, and the partakers of his table, who <lb/>
            were with him, fell fighting in his defence, except Ariæus, <lb/>
            who had been posted, in command of the cavalry, on the <lb/>
            left; and, when lie learned that Cyrus had fallen in the battle, <lb/>
            he took to flight, with all the troops which he had under his <lb/>
            command. <pb n="41"/>

          <p>The head and right-hand of Cyrus cut off. Artaxerxes pursues Ariseur. <lb/>
            plunders the camp of Cyrus, and then returns to attack the victorious <lb/>
            Greeks, who put hiin to flight, recover what he had seized, and return to <lb/>
            their camp.</p>
          <p>1. THE head and right-hand of Cyrus were then cut off. <lb/>
            The king, and the troops that were with him, engaging in <lb/>
            pursuit, fell upon the camp of Cyrus ; when the soldiers of <lb/>
            Ariæus no longer stood their ground, but fled through their <lb/>
            camp to the station whence they bad last started; which was <lb/>
            said to be four parasangs distant. 2. The king and his fol­ <lb/>
            lowers seized upon many other things, and also captured the <lb/>
            Phocæan woman, the mistress of Cyrus, who was said to be <lb/>
            both accomplished and beautiful. 3. His younger mistress, a <lb/>
            native of Miletus, being taken by some of the king's soldiers, <lb/>
            fled for refuge, without her outer garment, to the party of <lb/>
            Greeks,1 who were stationed under arms to guard the baggage, <lb/>
            and who, drawing themselves up for defence, killed several of <lb/>
            the pillagers; and some of their own number also fell; yet <lb/>
            they did not flee, but saved not only the woman, but all the <lb/>
            rest of the property and people that were in their quarters.</p>
          <p>4. The king and the main body of Greeks were now <lb/>
            distant from each other about thirty stadia, the Greeks pur­ <lb/>
            suing those that had been opposed to them, as if they had <lb/>
            conquered all; the Persians engaged in plundering, as if they <lb/>
            were wholly victorious. 5. But when the Greeks found that <lb/>
            the king with his troops was amongst their baggage; and the <lb/>
            king, on the other hand, heard from Tissaphernes, that the <lb/>
            Greeks had routed that part of his line which had been op­ <lb/>
            posed to them, and were gone forward in pursuit, the king, <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρὸς τω̃ν'Ελλήνων</foreign>.] " These words," says Külmer, " have won­ <lb/>

            mode of interpretation, he then observes, is to take <foreign xml:lang="grc">προ̃ς</foreign> in the sense <lb/>
            of versus, " towards," comparing iv. 3. 26; ii. 2. 4; but he inclines, <lb/>
            on the whole, to make the genitive <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελλήνων</foreign> depend on <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτους</foreign> un­ <lb/>

            though lie acknowledges that this construction is extremely forced, <lb/>

            on his part, collected his forces, and formed them in line <lb/>
            again ; while Clearchus, on the other side, calling to him <lb/>
            Proxenus, who happened to be nearest to him, consulted with <lb/>
            him whether they should send a detachment to the camp, or <lb/>
            proceed, all of them together, to relieve it. 6. In the mean <lb/>
            time, the king was observed again approaching them, as it <lb/>
            seemed, in their rear. The Greeks, wheeling round, prepared <lb/>
            to receive him, in the belief that he would attack them on <lb/>
            that quarter; the king, however, did not lead his troops that <lb/>
            way, but led them off by the same route by which he had be­ <lb/>
            fore passed on the outside of their left wing ; taking with him <lb/>
            both those who had deserted to the Greeks during the en­ <lb/>
            gagement, and Tissaphernes with the troops under his com­ <lb/>
            mand.</p>
          <p>7. Tissaphernes had not fled at the commencement of the <lb/>
            engagement, but had charged through the Greek peltasts, <lb/>
            close to the banks of the river. In breaking through, how­ <lb/>
            ever, he killed not a single man, for the Greeks, opening their <lb/>
            ranks, struck his men with their swords, and hurled their <lb/>
            javelins at them. Episthenes of Amphipolis had the com­ <lb/>
            mand of the peltasts, and was said to have proved himself an <lb/>
            able captain. 8. Tissaphernes, therefore, when he thus came <lb/>
            off with disadvantage, did not turn back again, but, proceed­ <lb/>
            ing onwards to the Grecian camp, met the king there; and <lb/>
            thence they now returned together, with their forces united in <lb/>
            battle-array. 9. When they were opposite the left wing of <lb/>
            the Greeks, the Greeks feared lest they should attack them on <lb/>
            that wing, and, enclosing them on both sides, should cut them <lb/>
            off; they therefore thought it advisable to draw back this <lb/>
            wing, 1 and to put the river in their rear. 10. While they <lb/>
            were planning this manoeuvre, the king, having passed be­ <lb/>
            yond them, presented his force opposite to them, in the same <lb/>
            form in which he had at first come to battle; and when <note type="footnote"> I 'Av<foreign xml:lang="grc">απτύσσιν</foreign>.] Literally "to fold back." Whether we are to <lb/>
            understand that one part of the wing was drawn behind the other, <lb/>
            is not very clear. The commentators are not all agreed as to the <lb/>
            exact sense that the word ought to bear. Some would interpret it <lb/>
            by explicare, " to open out," or " extend," and this indeed seems <lb/>
            more applicable to <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιπτύξαντες</foreign> which precedes; for the Greeks <lb/>
            might lengthen out their line that the king's troops might not sur­ <lb/>
            round them. But on the whole, the other interpretation seems to <lb/>
            have most voices in favour of it, </note> <pb n="43"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 10.] </note> <lb/>
            the Greeks saw their enemies close at hand, and drawn up for <lb/>
            fight, they again sang the pæan, and advanced upon them <lb/>
            with much greater spirit than before. 11. The Barbarians, <lb/>
            on the other hand, did not await their onset, but fled sooner1 <lb/>
            than at first; and the Greeks pursued them as far as a certain <lb/>
            village,2 where they halted; 12. for above the village was a <lb/>
            hill, upon which the king's troops had checked their flight, <lb/>
            and though there were no longer any infantry3 there, the <lb/>
            height was filled with cavalry; so that the Greeks could not <lb/>
            tell what was doing. They said, that they saw the royal <lb/>
            standard, a golden eagle upon a spear,4 with expanded <lb/>
            wings.5</p>
          <p>13. But as the Greeks were on the point of proceeding <lb/>
            thither, the cavalry too left the hill; not indeed in a body, <lb/>
            but some in one direction and some in another; and thus the <lb/>
            hill was gradually thinned of cavalry, till at last they were all <lb/>
            gone. 14. Clearchus, however, did not march up the hill, but, <note type="footnote"> I '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκ πλέονος</foreign>.] Sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διασυήματος</foreign>: they began to flee when the <lb/>

            accordingly being taken in this sense, all is clear, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπὶ ξύλου</foreign> is <lb/>
            superfluous. Kühner gives great praise to the conjecture of Hutch­ <lb/>
            inson, <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπὶ πέλτης έπὶ ξυστου̃</foreign>, who, taking <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέλτη</foreign> in the sense of <lb/>
            a shield, supposed that the eagle was mounted on a shield, and the <lb/>
            shield on a spear. But the shield would surely have been a mere <lb/>
            encumbrance, and we had better be rid of it. Yet to take <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέλτη</foreign> in <lb/>
            the sense of a spear, unusual in Xenophon, is not altogether satisfac­ <lb/>
            tory; and it would be well if we could fairly admit into the text <lb/>

            stationing his force at its foot, sent Lycius the Syracnsan and <lb/>
            another up the hill, and ordered them, after taking a view <lb/>
            from the summit, to report to him what was passing on the <lb/>
            other side. 15.Lycius accordingly rode thither, and having <lb/>
            made his observations, brought word that the enemy were <lb/>
            fleeing with precipitation. Just as these things took place, <lb/>
            the sun set.</p>
          <p>16. Here the Greeks halted, and piling their arms, took <lb/>
            some rest; and at the same time they wondered that Cyrus <lb/>
            himself nowhere made his appearance, and that no one else <lb/>
            came to them from him ; for they did not know that he was <lb/>
            killed, but conjectured that he was either gone in pursuit of <lb/>
            the enemy, or had pushed forward to secure some post. 17. <lb/>
            They then deliberated whether they should remain in that <lb/>
            spot and fetch their baggage thither, or return to the camp ; <lb/>
            and it was resolved to return, and they arrived at the tents <lb/>
            about supper-time. 18. Such was the conclusion of this day.</p>
          <p>They found almost all their baggage, and whatever food <lb/>
            and drink was with it, plundered and wasted ; the waggons, <lb/>
            too, full of barley-meal and wine, which Cyrus had provided, <lb/>
            in order that, if ever a great scarcity of provisions should fall <lb/>
            upon the army, he might distribute them amongst the Grecian <lb/>
            troops, (and the waggons, as was said, were four hundred in <lb/>
            number,) these also the king's soldiers had plundered. 19. <lb/>
            Most of the Greeks consequently remained supperless; and <lb/>
            they had also been without dinner; for before the army had <lb/>
            halted for dinner, the king made his appearance. In this <lb/>

          <p>The Greeks are surprised to hear of the death of Cyrus. Ariæus resolves to <lb/>
            return to Ionia, contrary to the advice of Clearchus, who incites him to <lb/>
            make an attempt on the throne of Persia. Artaxerxes sends a message to <lb/>
            the Greeks ; their reply.</p>
          <p>I.How the Grecian force was collected for Cyrus, when <lb/>
            he undertook his expedition against his brother Artaxerxes, <lb/>
            what occurred in his march up the country, how the battle <lb/>
            took place, how Cyrus was killed, and how the Greeks re­ <lb/>
            turned to their camp and went to rest, in the belief that they <lb/>
            were completely victorious, and that Cyrus was still alive, has <lb/>
            been related in the preceding book.</p>
          <p>2. When it was day, the generals met together, and ex­ <lb/>
            pressed their surprise that Cyrus had neither sent any person <lb/>
            to give directions how they should act, nor had made his ap­ <lb/>
            pearance himself. It seemed best to them, therefore, to pack <lb/>
            up what baggage they had, and, arming themselves, to march <lb/>
            forward till they could effect a junction with Cyrus. 3. But <lb/>
            when they were on the point of starting, just as the sun was <lb/>
            rising, there came to them Procles,the governor of Teuthrania, <lb/>
            (who was descended from Damaratus, the Lacedæmonian,) <lb/>
            and with him Glus, the son of Tamos, who told them that <lb/>
            Cyrus was dead, and that Ariæus, having fled, was, with the <lb/>
            rest of the Barbarians, at the station whence they started the <lb/>
            day before; and that he said he would wait for the Greeks <lb/>
            that day, if they would come to him ; but on the morrow, he <lb/>
            said, he should set off for Ionia, from whence he had come.</p>
          <p>4. The generals, on hearing this intelligence, and the other <lb/>
            Greeks, on learning it from them,' were grievously afflicted; <lb/>
            and Clearchus spoke thus: “ Would that Cyrus were still <lb/>
            alive; but since he is no more, carry back word to Ariæus, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πυνϑανόμενοι</foreign>.]Schneider and others would omit this word, a,,, <lb/>
            an apparent interpolation. I have followed Kühner’s interpret­ <lb/>

            that we at least are victorious over the king, and that, as you <lb/>
            see, no enemy any longer offers us battle; and, if you had not <lb/>
            come, we should have marched against the king; and we pro­ <lb/>
            mise Ariæns, that, if lie will come hither, we will seat him on <lb/>
            the royal throne; for to those who conquer, it belongs also to <lb/>
            rule.”5. Saying this, he dismissed the messengers, and bent <lb/>
            with them Cheirisophus the Lacedæmonian, and Menon the <lb/>
            Thessalian ; for Menon himself desired to go, as he was con­ <lb/>
            nected with Ariæus by ties of friendship and hospitality.</p>
          <p>6. While they departed on their mission Clearchus walted <lb/>
            where he was; and the troops supplied themselves with food, <lb/>
            as well as they could, from the carcases of their baggage-cattle <lb/>
            slaughtering their oxen and asses; and, going a little way in <lb/>
            front of the line, to the place where the battle was fouglir, <lb/>
            they collected and used as fuel, not only the arrows, which lay <lb/>
            in great quantities, and which the Greeks had compelled the <lb/>
            deserters from the king to throw down, but also the wicker <lb/>
            shields of the Persians, and the wooden ones of the Egyptians ; <lb/>
            and there were also many other light shields, and waggons <lb/>
            emptied of their contents,1 to be taken away; using all which <lb/>
            materials to cook the meat, they appeased their hunger for <lb/>
            that day.</p>
          <p>7. It was now about the middle of the forenoon,2 when <lb/>
            some heralds arrived from the king and Tissaphernes, all of <lb/>
            them Barbarians, except one, a Greek named Phalinus, who <lb/>
            chanced to be with Tissaphernes, and was highly esteemed by <lb/>
            him, for he had pretensions to skill in the arrangement of <lb/>
            troops, and in the exercise of heavy arms. 8. These persons <lb/>
            having approached, and asked to speak with the commanders <lb/>
            of the Greeks, told them, “that the king, since lie had gained <lb/>
            the victory and slain Cyrus, required the Greeks to deliver <lb/>
            up their arms, and go to the gates of the king,3 and try to <lb/>
            obtain, if they could, some favour from him." 9. Thus spoke <lb/>
            the king's heralds;and the Greeks heard them with no small <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φέρεσϑαι ἔρημοι</foreign>.] Before <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φέρεσϑαιι</foreign>s to be understood <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤστε</foreign>, as <lb/>

            concern ; but Clearchus only said, “that it was not the part <lb/>
            of conquerors to deliver up their arms: but," he continued, <lb/>
            “do you, fellow-captains, give these men such an answer as <lb/>
            you think most honourable and proper; and I will return im­ <lb/>
            mediately ;" for one of the attendants just then called him <lb/>
            away to inspect the entrails which had been taken out of the <lb/>
            victim, as he happened to be engaged in sacrifice. 10. Cleaner <lb/>
            the Arcadian, the oldest of them, then answered, that " they <lb/>
            would die before they would deliver up their arms." “ For my <lb/>
            part," said Proxenus the Theban, “ I wonder, Phalinus, <lb/>
            whether it is as conqueror that the king asks for our arms, or <lb/>
            as gifts in friendship ; for if as conqueror, why should he ask <lb/>
            for them at all, and not rather come and take them ? But if <lb/>
            lie wishes to get them from us by means of persuasion, let <lb/>
            him say what will be left to the soldiers, if they gratify him <lb/>
            in this particular.”11. To this Phalinus replied, " The king <lb/>
            considers himself the conqueror, since he has slain Cyrus. <lb/>
            For who is there now that disputes the sovereignty with him ? <lb/>
            And he also looks upon yourselves as his captives, having you <lb/>
            here in the middle of his dominions, and enclosed within im­ <lb/>
            passable rivers; and being able to lead such multitudes against <lb/>
            you, as, though he gave them into your power, it would be <lb/>
            impossible for you to destroy."</p>
          <p>12. After him, Theopompus,' an Athenian, spoke thus: “ 0 <lb/>
            Phalinus, we have now, as you see, nothing to avail us, ex­ <lb/>
            cept our arms and our valour. While we retain our arms, <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεόπομπος</foreign>.] This is the reading of six manuscripts;others have <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΞενΟφω̃ν</foreign>. The passage has greatly exercised the ingenuity of the <lb/>
            learned, some endeavouring to support one reading, some the other. <lb/>
            If we follow manuscript authority. it cannot be doubted that <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεό­ <lb/>
            ποπος</foreign> is genuine. W eiske thinks “ Xenophon " inadmissible, be­ <lb/>
            cause the officers only of the Greeks were called to a conference, <lb/>
            and Xenophon, as appears from iii. 1. 4, was not then in the ser­ <lb/>
            vice : as for the other arguments that he has offered, they are of <lb/>
            no weight. Krüger (Quæstt. de Xen. Vit. p. 12) attempts to refute <lb/>
            Weiske, and to defend the name of Xenophon, conjecturing that <lb/>
            some scholiast may have written in the margin <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεόπομπος δὲ Πρό­ <lb/>

            Proxenus. But as this notion rests on conjecture alone, I have <lb/>
            thought if safest, with Weiske,Schneider,l'oppo, and Dindorf, to <lb/>
            adhere to the reading of the best manuscripts. * * * Who this <lb/>
            Theopompus was, however, is unknown ; for he is nowhere clse <lb/>

            we may hope to profit by our valour; but if we were to give <lb/>
            them up, we should expect to be deprived also of our lives. <lb/>
            Do not suppose, therefore, that we shall give up to you the only <lb/>
            things of value that we possess; but, with these in our hands. <lb/>
            we will even fight for whatever of value you possess." 13. On <lb/>
            hearing him speak thus, Phalinus smiled, and said, "You <lb/>
            seem like a philosopher, young man, and express yourself not <lb/>
            without grace; but be assured that you are out of your senses <lb/>
            if you imagine that your valour will prove victorious over the <lb/>
            might of the king." 14. But it was reported that certain <lb/>
            others of the generals, giving way to their fears, said that they <lb/>
            had been faithful to Cyrus, and might likewise prove of great <lb/>
            service to the king, if he were willing to become their friend; <lb/>
            and that whether he might wish to employ them in any other <lb/>
            service, or in an expedition against Egypt, they would assist <lb/>
            him in reducing it."</p>
          <p>15. In the mean time Clearchus returned, and asked whether <lb/>
            they had yet given their answer. Phalinus, in reply, said, <lb/>
            “ Your companions, 0 Clearchus, give each a different an­ <lb/>
            swer; and now tell us what you have to say." 16. Clearchus <lb/>
            then said, “ I was glad to see you, 0 Phalinus, and so, I dare <lb/>
            say, were all the rest of us ; for you are a Greek, as we also <lb/>
            are ; and, being so many in number as you see, and placed <lb/>
            in such circumstances we would advise with you how we <lb/>
            should act with regard to the message that you bring. 17 <lb/>
            Give us then, I entreat you by the gods, such advice as seems <lb/>
            to you most honourable and advantageous, and such as will <lb/>
            bring you honour in time to come, when it is related, that <lb/>
            Phalinus, being once sent from the king to require the Greeks <lb/>
            to deliver up their arms, gave them, when they consulted him, <lb/>
            such and such counsel; for you know that whatever counsel <lb/>
            you do give, will necessarily be reported in Greece."</p>
          <p>is. Clearchus craftily threw out this suggestion,' with the <lb/>
            desire that the very person who came as an envoy from the <lb/>
            king, should advise them not to deliver up their arms, in order <lb/>
            that the Greeks might be led to conceive better hopes. But <lb/>
            Phalinus, adroitly evading the appeal, spoke, contrary to his <lb/>
            expectation, as follows: 19. "If, out of ten thousand hopeful <lb/>
            chances, you have any single one, of saving yourselves by con- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταυ̃τα ὑπήγετο</foreign>.] Hæc dolosè suadebat. Compare ii. 4.3 Kühner. </note> <pb n="49"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            tinuing in arms against the king, I advise you not to deliver <lb/>
            up your arms; but if you have not a single hope of safety in <lb/>
            opposing the king's pleasure, I advise you to save yourselves <lb/>
            in the only way in which it is possible." 20. Clearchus re­ <lb/>
            joined, "Such, then, is your advice ; but on our part return this <lb/>
            answer, that we are of opinion, that, if we are to be friends <lb/>
            with the king, we shall be more valuable friends if we retain <lb/>
            our arms, than if we surrender them to another ; but that if <lb/>
            we must make war against him, we should make war better if <lb/>
            we retain our arms, than if we give them up to another." 21. <lb/>
            Phalinus said, " This answer, then, we will report: but the <lb/>
            king desired us also to inform you, that while you remain in <lb/>
            this place, a truce is to be considered as existing between him <lb/>
            and you; but, if you advance or retreat, there is to be war. <lb/>
            Give us, therefore, your answer on this point also ; whether you <lb/>
            will remain here, and a truce is to exist, or whether I shall <lb/>
            announce from you, that there is war." 22. Clearchus re­ <lb/>
            plied, “Report, therefore, on this point also, that our resolution <lb/>
            is the same as that of the king." “ And what is that ? " said <lb/>
            Phalinus. Clearchus replied, “ If we stay here, a truce; but <lb/>
            if we retreat or advance, war." 23. Phalinus again asked him, <lb/>
            " Is it a truce or war that I shall report ? " Clearchus again <lb/>
            made the same answer: "A truce, if we stay ; and if we re­ <lb/>
            treat or advance, war." But of what he intended to do, he <lb/>
            gave no intimation.</p>

          <p>The Greeks, joining Ariæus, form an alliance with him, and take counsel <lb/>
            with him in reference to their return. During the night following the <lb/>
            first day's march they are seized with a panic, which Clearchus allays.</p>
          <p>1. PHALINUS and his companions departed ; and there now <lb/>
            returned, from their interview with Ariæus, Procles and <lb/>
            Cheirisophus; Menon had remained there with Ariæus. <lb/>
            They reported, “ that Ariæus said that there were many Per­ <lb/>
            sians, of superior rank to himself, who would not endure that <lb/>
            he should be king; but," he adds, " If you wish to return <lb/>
            with him, he desires you to come to him this very night; if <lb/>
            you do not, he says that he will set out by himself early in the <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <pb n="50"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            morning." 2. Clearchus rejoined. “ And we must certainly <lb/>
            do as you say, if we determine to go to him ; but if not, adopt <lb/>
            for yourselves such measures as you may think most for your <lb/>
            advantage :”for not even to them did he disclose what he in­ <lb/>
            tended to do.</p>
          <p>3. But afterwards, when the sun was setting, having as­ <lb/>
            sembled the generals and captains, he spoke as follows:“My <lb/>
            friends, when I offered a sacrifice with reference to marching <lb/>
            gainst the king, the signs of the victims were not favourable, <lb/>
            and indeed it was with good cause that they were not so; for <lb/>
            as I now learn, there is between us and the king the river <lb/>
            Tigris, a navigable river, which we could not cross without <lb/>
            vessels; and vessels we have none. Yet it is not possible to <lb/>
            remain here; for we have no means of procuring provisions. <lb/>
            But for going to the friends of Cyrus, the sacrifices were ex­ <lb/>
            tremely favourable. 4. We must accordingly proceed thus: <lb/>
            when we separate, we must sup, each of us on what he has ; <lb/>
            when the signal is given with the horn as if for going to rest, <lb/>
            proceed to pack up your baggage; when it sounds the second <lb/>
            time, place it on your baggage-cattle ;and, at the third signal, <lb/>
            follow him who leads the way, keeping your baggage-cattle <lb/>
            next the river, and the heavy-armed troops on the outside."</p>
          <p>5. The generals and captains, after listening to this address, <lb/>
            went away, and did as lie directed ; and thenceforth he com­ <lb/>
            manded, and the others obeyed, not indeed having elected him <lb/>
            commander, but perceiving that he alone possessed such qua­ <lb/>
            locations as a leader ought to have, and that the rest of them <lb/>
            were comparatively inexperienced.</p>
          <p>6. The computation of the route which they had come from . <lb/>
            Ephesus in Ionia to the field of battle, was ninety-three days' <lb/>
            march, and five hundred and thirty-five parasangs, or sixteen <lb/>
            thousand and fifty stadia ; 1 and the distance from the field <lb/>
            of battle to Babylon was said to be three hundred and sixty <lb/>
            stadia.</p>
          <p>7. Here, as soon as it was dark, Miltocythes the Thracian <lb/>
            deserted to the king, with about forty horse that he com- <note type="footnote"> I As Xenophon, in the first book, has enumerated only 84, days' <lb/>
            march, 517 parasangs, which make but 15,510 stadia, Zeune thinks <lb/>
            that the 9 days' march, and 18 parasangs, here added, are to be un­ <lb/>
            derstood as forming the route from Ephesus to Sardis. Krüger is in. <lb/>
            clined to think the passage an interpolation. </note> <pb n="51"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            manded, and nearly three hundred of the Thracian infantry. <lb/>
            8. Clearchus led the way for the rest, in the prescribed <lb/>
            order ; and they followed, and arrived at the first halting- <lb/>
            place,' to join Ariæus and his troops about midnight; and <lb/>
            the generals and captains of the Greeks, having drawn up <lb/>
            their men under arms, went in a body to Ariæus ;when the <lb/>
            Greeks on the one hand, and Ariæus and his principal officers <lb/>
            on the other, took an oath not to betray each other, and to <lb/>
            be true allies ; and the Barbarians took another oath, that <lb/>
            they would lead the way without treachery. 9. These oaths <lb/>
            they took after sacrificing a bull, a wolf,2 a boar, and a ram, <lb/>
            over a shield, the Greeks dipping a sword, and the Barbarians <lb/>
            a lance, into the blood.</p>
          <p>10. When these pledges of mutual fidelity were given, <lb/>
            Clearchus said : “Since then, Ariæus, our route and yours is <lb/>
            now the same, tell us,'what is your opinion with respect to <lb/>
            our course; whether we shall return the way we came, or <lb/>
            whether you consider that you have thought of a better way." <lb/>
            11. Ariæus replied: " If we were to return the way we came, <lb/>
            we should all perish of hunger: for we have now no supply of <lb/>
            provisions ; and for the last seventeen days' march, even when <lb/>
            we were coming hither, we could procure nothing from the <lb/>
            country through which we passed ; or, if anything was to be <lb/>
            found there, we consumed it ourselves in our passage. But <lb/>
            now we propose to take a longer road, but one in which we <lb/>
            shall not want for provisions. 12. We must make the first <lb/>
            days' marches as long as we can, that we may remove our­ <lb/>
            selves to the greatest possible distance from the king's army ; <lb/>
            for if we once escape two or three days' journey from him, the <lb/>
            king will no longer be able to overtake us; since he will not <lb/>
            dare to pursue us with a small force ; and, with a numerous <lb/>
            army, he will not be able to march fast enough, and will pro <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Είς</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̃τον σταθμόν</foreign>.] This is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σταθμός</foreign> mentioned in i. 10. <lb/>

          <p>13. This scheme for conducting the army was calculated for <lb/>
            nothing else than to effect an escape, clandestinely or openly, <lb/>
            by flight.1 But fortune proved a better leader; for as soon as <lb/>
            it was day they began their march, with the sun on their <lb/>
            right, expecting to arrive about sunset at some villages in the <lb/>
            Babylonian territory ; and in this expectation they were not <lb/>
            disappointed. 14. But, in the afternoon, they thought that they <lb/>
            perceived some of the enemy's cavalry; and those of the <lb/>
            Greeks who happened not to be in their ranks, ran to their <lb/>
            places in the ranks ; and Ariæus (for he was riding in a wag­ <lb/>
            gon because he had been wounded) came down and put on <lb/>
            his armour, as did those who were with him. 15. But while <lb/>
            they were arming themselves, the scouts that had been sent <lb/>
            forward returned, and reported that they were not cavalry, <lb/>
            but baggage-cattle grazing ; and every one immediately con­ <lb/>
            eluded that the king was encamped somewhere near. Smoke <lb/>
            also was seen rising from some villages not far distant. 16. <lb/>
            Clearchus however did not lead his troops against the enemy ; <lb/>
            (for he was aware that his soldiers were tired and in want <lb/>
            of food ; and besides it was now late;) yet he did not turn <lb/>
            out of his way, taking care not to appear to flee, but continued <lb/>
            his march in a direct line, and took up his quarters with his <lb/>
            vanguard, just at sunset, in the nearest villages, from which <lb/>
            even the wood-work of the houses had been carried off by the <lb/>
            king's troops. 17. These, therefore, who were in advance, <lb/>
            encamped with some degree of regularity; but those who <lb/>
            followed, coming up in the dark, took up with such quarters <lb/>
            as they chanced to find, and made so much noise in calling <lb/>
            to each other, that even the enemy heard them; and those <lb/>

            beast of burden to be seen, nor any camp, nor smoke any­ <lb/>

            the sudden approach of the Grecian army ; and of this he gave <lb/>
            proof by what he did on the following day.</p>
          <p>19. However, in the course of this night, a panic fell upon <lb/>
            the Greeks themselves, and there arose such noise and com­ <lb/>
            motion in their camp as usually ensues oil the occurrence of <lb/>
            sudden terror. 20. Upon this, Clearchus ordered Tolmides, <lb/>
            an Eleian, whom he happened to have with him, the best 1 <lb/>
            herald of his time, to command silence; and proclaim, that <lb/>
            "the generals give notice, that whoever will give information <lb/>
            of the person who turned the ass among the arms,2 shall re­ <lb/>
            ceive a reward of a talent of silver." 21. On this proclama­ <lb/>
            tion being made, the soldiers were convinced that their alarm <lb/>
            was groundless, and their generals were safe. At break of <lb/>
            day, Clearchus issued orders for the Greeks to form themselves <lb/>
            under arms, in the same order in which they had been when <lb/>
            the battle took place.</p>

          <p>The king proposes a truce, and supplies the Greeks with provisions during <lb/>
            the negotiation. Three days after he sends Tissaphernes to them, to ask <lb/>
            why they had engaged in hostilities against him; he is answered by <lb/>
            Clearchus. A treaty is then concluded, the king engaging to send home <lb/>
            the Greeks under the conduct of Tissaphernes, and the Greeks promising <lb/>
            to do no injury to the countries through which they should pass.</p>
          <p>1. WHAT I just now stated, that the king was alarmed at <lb/>
            me approach of the Greeks, became evident by what followed; <lb/>
            for though, when he sent to them on the preceding day, he <lb/>
            desired them to deliver up their arms, he now, at sunrise, sent <lb/>
            heralds to negotiate a truce. 2. These heralds, upon arriving <lb/>
            at the outposts, requested to speak with the commanders. <lb/>
            Their request being reported by the guards, Clearchus, who <lb/>
            happened then to be inspecting the several divisions, told the <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστον</foreign>.] Best, apparently, on account of the loudness or <lb/>
            clearness of his voice. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The arms, as Kühner observes, were piled in front of the men's <lb/>
            quarters. The affair of the ass was an invention of Clearchus to <lb/>
            draw off the thoughts of the soldiers from the subject of their ap­ <lb/>
            prehension.Polyænus, iii. 9. 4, speaks of a similar stratagem <lb/>
            having been adopted by Iphicrates. </note> <pb n="54"/>

            guards to desire the heralds to wait till he should be at leisure. <lb/>
            3. When he had arranged the army in such a manner as to <lb/>
            present on every side the fair appearance of a compact pha­ <lb/>
            lanx, and so that none of the unarmed were to be seen, lie <lb/>
            called for the heralds, and came forward himself, having about <lb/>
            him the best-armed and best-looking of his soldiers, and told <lb/>
            the other leaders to do the same. 4. When he drew near the <lb/>
            messengers, he asked them what they wanted. They replied, <lb/>
            " that they came to negotiate a truce, with full powers to com­ <lb/>
            municate with the Greeks on behalf of the king, and with <lb/>
            the king on behalf of the Greeks." 5. Clearchus answered, <lb/>
            " Tell the king, then, that we must come to battle first; for we <lb/>
            have no breakfast and there is no one who will dare to talk <lb/>
            to the Greeks of a truce, without first supplying them with <lb/>
            breakfast."</p>
          <p>6. On hearing this answer, the messengers departed, but <lb/>
            soon returned; from whence it was apparent that the king, <lb/>
            or some other person to whom a commission had been given <lb/>
            to conduct the negotiation, was somewhere near. They <lb/>
            brought word, " that the king thought what they said was <lb/>
            reasonable, and that they now came with guides, who, in case <lb/>
            the truce should be settled, would conduct the Greeks to a <lb/>
            place where they might procure provisions." 7. Clearchus then <lb/>
            inquired, whether the king would grant the benefit of the truce <lb/>
            to those only who went to him, on their way thither and back, <lb/>
            or whether the truce would be with the rest as well.2 The mes­ <lb/>
            sengers replied, “With all; until what you have to say is <lb/>
            communicated to the king." 8. When they had said this, <lb/>
            Clearchus, directing them to withdraw, deliberated with the <lb/>
            ther officers ; and they proposed to conclude the truce at <lb/>
            once, and to go after the provisions at their ease, and supply <lb/>
            themselves.. 9. And Clearchus said, “ I too am of that <note type="footnote"> 1’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αριστον</foreign>.] This word answers to the Latin prandium, a meal <lb/>
            taken in the early part of the day. We cannot here render <unclear/> <lb/>

            narrative requires. Krüger refers <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπένδοιτο</foreign> to Clearchus, and thinks <lb/>
            that by <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοἳς τοι̃ς ἀνδράσι</foreign> are meant the Persian deputies. Some <lb/>
            critics suppose that by those words the men who were to get pro­ <lb/>

            context but to refer <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπένδοιτο</foreign> to the king, and to understand by <lb/>

            opinion. I will not, however, announce our determination <lb/>
            immediately, but will wait till the messengers begin to be un­ <lb/>
            easy lest we should determine not to conclude the truce. And <lb/>
            yet," said he, " I suspect that a similar apprehension will arise <lb/>
            among our own soldiers.” When he thought therefore that <lb/>
            the proper time had arrived, he announced to the messengers <lb/>
            that he agreed to the truce, and desired them to conduct him <lb/>
            forthwith to the place where the provisions were.</p>
          <p>10. They accordingly led the way ; and Clearchus proceeded <lb/>
            to conclude the truce, keeping his army however in battle- <lb/>
            array; the rear he brought up himself. They met with <lb/>
            ditches and canals so full of water that they could not cross <lb/>
            without bridges ; but they made crossings of the palm-trees <lb/>
            which had fallen, and others which they cut down. 11. Here <lb/>
            it might be seen how Clearchus performed the duties of a <lb/>
            commander, holding his spear in his left hand, and a staff in <lb/>
            his right; and if any of those ordered to the work seemed to <lb/>
            him to loiter at it, he would select a fit object for punishment, 1 <lb/>
            and give him a beating, and would lend his assistance him­ <lb/>
            self,2 leaping into the midst, so that all were ashamed not to <lb/>
            share his industry. 12. The men of thirty and under only <lb/>
            had been appointed by him to the work; but the older <lb/>
            men, when they saw Clearchus thus busily employed, <lb/>
            gave their assistance likewise. 13. Clearchus made so much <lb/>
            the more haste, as he suspected that the ditches were not <lb/>
            always so full of water; (for it was not the season for irrigat­ <lb/>
            ing the ground ;) but thought that the king had let out the <lb/>
            water upon the plain, in order that even now there might ap <lb/>
            pear to the Greeks to be many difficulties in the march.</p>
          <p>14. Proceeding on their way, they arrived at some villages, <lb/>
            from which the guides signified that they might procure pro­ <lb/>
            visions. In these villages there was great plenty of corn, and <lb/>
            wine made from dates, and an acidulous drink obtained from <lb/>
            them by boiling. 15. As to the dates themselves, such as those <lb/>
            we see in Greece were here put aside for the use of the serv­ <lb/>
            ants ; but those which were laid by for their masters, were <lb/>
            choice fruit, remarkable for beauty and size; their colour was <lb/>
            not unlike that of amber; and some of these they dried and <note type="footnote"> I Tov t<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐιπήδειον</foreign>.] Sell. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παίεσϑαι</foreign> , panNe idoneum, pœnâ dignuM. <lb/>

            preserved as sweetmeats. These were a pleasant accompani­ <lb/>
            ment to drink, but apt to cause headache. 16. Here too the sol­ <lb/>
            diers for the first time tasted the cabbage1 from the top of the <lb/>
            palm-tree, and most of them were agreeably struck both with <lb/>
            its external appearance and the peculiarity of its sweetness. <lb/>
            But this also was exceedingly apt to give headache. The <lb/>
            palm-tree, out of which the cabbage had been taken, soon <lb/>
            withered throughout.</p>
          <p>17. In this place they remained three days, when Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes arrived from the Great King, and with him the <lb/>
            brother of the king's wife, and three other Persians ; and a <lb/>
            numerous retinue attended them. The generals of the Greeks <lb/>
            having met them on their arrival, Tissaphernes first spoke by <lb/>
            an interpreter, to the following effect: 18. "I myself dwell, 0 <lb/>
            Greeks, in the neighbourhood of your country; and when I <lb/>
            perceived you fallen into many troubles and difficulties, I <lb/>
            thought it a piece of good fortune if I could in any way press <lb/>
            a request upon the king to allow me to conduct you in safety <lb/>
            back to Greece. For I think that such a service would be <lb/>
            attended with no want of gratitude either from yourselves or <lb/>
            from Greece in general. 19. With these considerations, I made <lb/>
            my request to the king, representing to him that he might <lb/>
            reasonably grant me this favour, because I had been the first <lb/>
            to give him intelligence that Cyrus was marching against <lb/>
            him, and at the same time that I brought him the intelligence, <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸν ἐγκἐφαλον</foreign>.] Literally “ the brain." Dulcis medulla earum <lb/>

            </note>had come to him with an auxiliary force; because I alone, <lb/>
            of all those opposed to the Greeks, did not flee, but, on the <lb/>
            contrary, charged through the midst of them, and joined the <lb/>
            king in your camp, whither he came after he had slain Cyrus ; <lb/>
            and because, together with these who are now present with <lb/>
            me, and who are his most faithful servants, I engaged in pur­ <lb/>
            suit of the Barbarian part of Cyrus's army. 20. The king <lb/>
            promised to consider of my request; and in the mean time de­ <lb/>
            sired me to come and ask you, on what account it was that <lb/>
            you took the field against him ; and I advise you to answer <lb/>
            with moderation, in order that it may be easier for me to se <lb/>
            cure you whatever advantage I can from the king."</p>
          <p>21. The Greeks then withdrew, and, after some deliberation, <lb/>
            gave their answer, Clearchus speaking for them : " We neither <lb/>
            formed ourselves into a body, with the view of making war <lb/>
            upon the king, nor, when we set out, was our march directed <lb/>
            against him; but Cyrus, as you yourself are well aware, de­ <lb/>
            vised many pretences for his proceedings, that he might both <lb/>
            take you by surprise, and lead us up hither. 22. But when we <lb/>
            afterwards saw him in danger, we were ashamed, in the face of <lb/>
            gods and men, to desert him, as we had before allowed him tc <lb/>
            bestow favours upon us. 23. As Cyrus, however, is now <lb/>
            dead, we neither dispute the sovereignty with the king, nor is <lb/>
            there any reason why we should desire to do harm to the <lb/>
            king's territory ; nor would we wish to kill him, but would <lb/>
            proceed homeward, if no one molest us ; but we will endeavour <lb/>
            with the aid of the gods, to avenge ourselves on any one that <lb/>
            may do us an injury ; while, if any one does us good, we <lb/>
            shall not be behind-hand in requiting him to the utmost of <lb/>
            our power." Thus spoke Clearchus. 24. Tissaphernes, hav­ <lb/>
            ing heard him, said, “ I will report your answer to the king, <lb/>
            and bring back to you his reply ; and till I return, let the <lb/>
            truce remain in force; and we will provide a market for <lb/>
            you."</p>
          <p>25. On the following day he did not return ; so that the <lb/>
            Greeks began to be anxious; but on the third day he came, <lb/>
            and said, that he returned after having obtained the king'a <lb/>
            permission to be allowed to save the Greeks; although many <lb/>
            spoke against it, saying that it did not become the king to <lb/>
            suffer men to escape who bad engaged in war against him. <lb/>
            26. In conclusion he said, " You may now receive from us <pb n="58"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. <lb/>
            </note>solemn promises that we will render the country, through <lb/>
            which you will pass, friendly to you ; and will, without treach­ <lb/>
            ery, conduct you back to Greece, affording you opportunities <lb/>
            of purchasing provisions; and wheresoever we do not afford <lb/>
            you an opportunity of purchasing, we will allow you to take <lb/>
            for yourselves necessaries from the adjacent country. 27. <lb/>
            On the other hand, it will be incumbent upon you to swear <lb/>
            to us, that you will march, as through a friendly territory, <lb/>
            without doing harm, only taking a supply of meat and drink, <lb/>
            whenever we do not give you an opportunity of purchasing, <lb/>
            but that if we give you such opportunity, you will procure <lb/>
            your supplies by purchase." 28. These conditions were <lb/>
            assented to; and they took the oaths, and Tissaphernes and <lb/>
            the brother of the king's wife gave their right-hands to the <lb/>
            generals and captains of the Greeks, and received from the <lb/>
            Greeks theirs in return. 29. After this, Tissaphernes said, <lb/>
            " And now I shall go back to the king ; and as soon as I have <lb/>
            accomplished what I wish, I will come again, after making the <lb/>
            necessary preparations, for the purpose of conducting you <lb/>
            back to Greece, and returning myself to my province."</p>

          <p>The Greeks conceive distrust both of Tissaphernes and Ariæus, and resolve <lb/>
            to march apart from the Persians, They commence their march uuder <lb/>

          <p>1. AFTER these occurrences, the Greeks and Ariæus, en­ <lb/>

            that, on this account, they rendered most of the Greeks dissa­ <lb/>

            and the other generals, said, 3. " Why do we remain here ? <lb/>

            Greeks? For the present, he craftily protracts our stay, be­ <lb/>
            cause his forces are dispersed; but, when his army is re-as­ <lb/>
            sembled, it is not possible but that he will attack us. 4 <lb/>
            Perhaps, too, he is digging some trench, or building some wall, <lb/>
            that the way may be rendered impassable ; for he will never <lb/>
            consent, at least willingly, that we should go back to Greece, <lb/>
            and relate how so small a number as we are have defeated <lb/>
            the king at his own gates, and returned after setting him at <lb/>
            nought."</p>
          <p>5. To those who thus addressed him, Clearehus answered, <lb/>
            " I have been considering all these things as well; but I <lb/>
            think that, if we now go away, we shall be thought to go with <lb/>
            a view to war, and to act contrary to the terms of the truce. <lb/>
            Moreover, in the first place, there will be no one to provide us <lb/>
            a market, or any means of procuring provisions; and, in the <lb/>
            next place, there will be no one to guide us ; besides, the mo­ <lb/>
            ment that we do this, Ariæus will separate himself from us ; <lb/>
            so that not a friend will be left us ; and, what is more, our <lb/>
            former friends will then become our enemies. 6. Whether <lb/>
            there is any other river for us to cross, I do not know ; but <lb/>
            as for the Euphrates, we know that it is impossible to cross <lb/>
            that, if the enemy try to prevent us. Nor yet, if it should be <lb/>
            necessary to fight, have we any horse to support us; while <lb/>
            the enemy's cavalry is most numerous and efficient ; so that, <lb/>
            though we were victorious, how many of our enemies should <lb/>
            we be able to kill ? And, if we were defeated, it would not <lb/>
            be possible for a man of us to escape. 7. With regard to the <lb/>
            king, therefore, who is aided by so many advantages, I know <lb/>
            not, if he wishes to effect our destruction, why he should <lb/>
            swear, and give his right-hand, and perjure himself before the <note type="footnote"> Peppo. So it is said in Latin dextram ferre. See Breiteubach ou <lb/>

            gods, and render his pledges faithless both to Greeks and <lb/>
            Barbarians." He said much besides to the same effect.</p>
          <p>8. In the mean time Tissaphernes arrived, with his army, <lb/>
            as if with the view of returning home; and Orontes came <lb/>
            with his army. Orontes also brought1 with him the lung'a <lb/>
            daughter, whom he had received in marriage.2 9. From <lb/>
            hence they now proceeded on their march, Tissaphernes being <lb/>
            their gnide, and securing them opportunities of buying pro­ <lb/>
            visions ; Ariæus also, with the Barbarian troops of Cyrus, <lb/>
            marched in company with Tissaphernes and Orontes, and en­ <lb/>
            camped in common with them. 10. But the Greeks, conceiv­ <lb/>
            ing a suspicion of these men, began to march by themselves, <lb/>
            taking guides of their own ; and they always encamped at the <lb/>
            distance of a parasang, or little less, from each other ; and <lb/>
            both parties kept on their guard against one another, as if <lb/>
            they had been enemies, and this consequently increased their <lb/>
            mistrustful feelings. 11. More than once, too, as they were <lb/>
            gathering fuel, or collecting grass and other snch things, in the <lb/>
            same quarter, they came to blows with each other;3 and this <lb/>
            was an additional source of animosity between them.</p>
          <p>12. After marching three days, they arrived at the wall of <lb/>
            Media,4 as it is called, and passed to the other side of it. This <lb/>
            wall was built of burnt bricks, laid in bitumen ; it was twenty <lb/>
            feet in thickness, and a hundred in height, and the length of <lb/>
            it was said to be twenty parasangs ; and it was not far distant <lb/>
            from Babylon. 13. Hence they proceeded, in two days' march, <note type="footnote">1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηγε</foreign>.] From iii. 4. 13, it appears that we must refer this verb <lb/>
            to Orontes. See note on sect. 1. Whether Tissaphernes and Oron­ <lb/>
            tes both married daughters of the king, is uncertain. If only one <lb/>
            of them, Xenophon is more likely to be in the right than Diodorus <lb/>
            Siculus. Orontes was satrap of Armenia, iii. 5. 17. Rhodogune, a <lb/>
            daughter of Artaxerxes, is said by Plutarch (Vit. Art. c. 27) to have <lb/>
            been married to Orætes, who may be the same as Xenophon's <lb/>
            Orontes </note><note type="footnote"> 2 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επὶ γάμω</foreign>.] These words signify literally for or upon marriage. <lb/>
            The true interpretation, says Kriiger, is, doubtless, " in order that he <lb/>

            the distance of eight parasangs; crossing two canals, the one <lb/>
            by a permanent bridge, the other by a temporary one formed ot <lb/>
            seven boats. These canals were supplied from the river Tigris ; <lb/>
            and from one to the other of them were cut ditches across the <lb/>
            country, the first of considerable size, and the next smaller; <lb/>
            and at last diminutive drains, such as are cut in Greece through <lb/>
            the panic1 fields. They then arrived at the Tigris; nea <lb/>
            which there was a large and populous city, called Sitace, dis­ <lb/>
            tant from the banks of the river only fifteen stadia. 14. In <lb/>
            the neighbourhood of this city the Greeks encamped, close to <lb/>
            an extensive and beautiful park, thickly planted with all kinds <lb/>
            of trees. The Barbarians, though they had but just crossed <lb/>
            the Tigris, were no longer in sight.</p>
          <p>15. After supper Proxenus and Xenophon happened to be <lb/>
            walking in front of the place where the arms were piled, when <lb/>
            a man approached, and inquired of the sentinels where he <lb/>
            could see Proxenus or Clearchus. But he did not ask for <lb/>
            Menon, though he came from Ariæus, Menon's intimate friend. <lb/>
            16. Proxenus replying, " I am the person whom you seek," the <lb/>
            man said, “ Ariæus and Artaozus, the faithful friends of Cyrus, <lb/>
            who are interested for your welfare, have sent me to you, and <lb/>
            exhort you to beware lest the Barbarians should fall upon <lb/>
            you in the night; for there is a considerable body of troops in <lb/>
            the adjoining park. 17. They also advise you to send a guard <lb/>
            to the bridge over the Tigris, as Tissaphernes designs to break <lb/>
            it down in the night, if he can, in order that you may not be <lb/>
            able to cross the river, but may be hemmed in between the <lb/>
            river and the canal." is. On hearing the man's message, they <lb/>
            conducted him to Clearchus, and told him what lie had said. <lb/>
            When Clearchus heard it he was greatly agitated and alarmed.</p>
          <p>19. But a young man,2 one of those who were present, after <lb/>
            reflecting a little on the matter, observed, “ that the imputed <lb/>
            designs of making an attack, and of breaking down the <lb/>
            bridge, were not consistent; for," said he, " if they attack <lb/>
            us, they must certainly either conquer or be conquered ; if <lb/>
            then they are to conquer us, why should they break down the <lb/>
            bridge ? for even though there were many bridges, we have <lb/>
            no place where we could save ourselves by flight; 20. but if, on <note type="footnote">1 i. 2. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Zeune thinks that Xenophon may possibly mean himself; but <lb/>
            this is mere conjecture. </note> <pb n="62"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            the other hand, we should conquer them, then, if the bridge <lb/>
            is broken down, they will have no place of retreat ; nor will <lb/>
            any of their friends on the other side of the river, however <lb/>
            numerous, be able to come to their assistance when the bridge <lb/>
            is destroyed." 21. After listening to these observations, Clear­ <lb/>
            chus asked the messenger what was the extent of the country <lb/>
            that lay between the Tigris and the canal. He replied, "that <lb/>
            it was of considerable extent, and that there were several vil­ <lb/>
            lages and large towns in it." 22. It was then immediately con­ <lb/>
            cluded, that the Barbarians had sent this man with an under­ <lb/>
            hand object, being afraid lest the Greeks, having taken to <lb/>
            pieces1 the bridge, should remain in the island, where they <lb/>
            would have, as defences, the river Tigris on the one side, and <lb/>
            the canal on the other ; and might procure a sufficient supply <lb/>
            of provisions from the country which lay between, and which <lb/>
            was extensive and fertile, with people in it to cultivate it; <lb/>
            and which would also serve as a place of refuge to any that <lb/>
            might be inclined to annoy the king.</p>
          <p>23. They then prepared for rest, but did not neglect, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to send a guard to the bridge; but neither did any one <lb/>
            attempt to attack them on any quarter, nor did any of the <lb/>
            enemies come near the bridge, as those who were stationed <lb/>
            on guard there reported.</p>
          <p>24. As soon as it was day they crossed the bridge, which <lb/>
            was constructed of thirty-seven boats, with every precaution <lb/>
            in their power; for some of the Greeks, who came from Tis­ <lb/>
            saphernes, stated that the enemy meant to attack them as they <lb/>
            were crossing; but this report was also false. However, as <lb/>
            they were going over, GIns made his appearance, with some <lb/>
            others, watching to see if they were crossing the river; and <lb/>
            when they saw they were, he immediately rode away.</p>
          <p>25. From the Tigris they proceeded, in four days' march, a <lb/>
            distance of twenty parasangs, to the river Physcus, which was <lb/>
            a plethrum in breadth, and over which was a bridge. Hero <lb/>
            was situate a large town, called Opis; near which an ille­ <lb/>
            gitimate brother of Cyrus and Artaxerxes, who was leading <lb/>
            a numerous army from Susa and Ecbatana, with the intention <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διελόντες</foreign>.] An excellent conjectural emendation of Holtzmann <lb/>

            of assisting the king, met the Greeks, and, ordering his troops <lb/>
            to halt, took a view of the Greeks as they passed by. 16 <lb/>
            Clearchus marched his men two abreast, and halted occasion <lb/>
            ally on the way; and as long as the van of the army halted, <lb/>
            so long there was necessarily a halt throughout the whole of <lb/>
            the line; so that even to the Greeks themselves their army <lb/>
            seemed very large, and the Persian was amazed at the sight <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>17. Hence they proceeded through Media,1 six days' march <lb/>
            through a desert country, a distance of thirty parasangs, when <lb/>
            they arrived at the villages of Parysatis, the mother of Cyrus <lb/>
            and the king; which Tissaphernes, in mockery of Cyrus, gave <lb/>
            permission to the Greeks to plunder of everything except the <lb/>
            slaves. There was found in them a great quantity of corn, <lb/>
            and sheep, and other property. 18. Hence they advanced in <lb/>
            a march of five days more through the desert, a distance of <lb/>
            twenty parasangs, having the Tigris on their left. At the <lb/>
            end of the first day's march there was situate on the opposite <lb/>
            bank of the river a large and opulent city, called Cænæ, <lb/>
            whence the Barbarians brought over, on rafts made of hide <lb/>
            a supply of bread, cheese, and wine.</p>

          <p>After a three days’ halt on the river Zabatus, Clearchus endeavours to pin <lb/>
            an end to the distrust between the Persians and the Greeks by an inter­ <lb/>
            view with Tissaphernes, He is received so plausibly that he is induced <lb/>
            to return on the following day, accompanied by five other generals and <lb/>
            twenty captains, in expectation of being informed of the persons who had <lb/>
            excited, by false reports, ill feelings between the two armies. The gener­ <lb/>
            als are conducted into the tent and put to death; the captains and those <lb/>
            with them are massacred on the outside, one only escaping to tell the tale. <lb/>
            Ariæus calls on the rest of the Greeks to surrender their arms, but is an­ <lb/>
            swered with defiance.</p>
          <p>1. SOON after, they arrived at the river Zabatus, the breadth <lb/>
            of which was four plethra. Here they remained three days ; <lb/>
            during which the same suspicions continued, but no open in­ <lb/>
            dication of treachery appeared. 2. Clearchus therefore re­ <lb/>
            solved to have a meeting with Tissaphernes, and, if it was at <note type="footnote"> 1i.7. 15. </note> <pb n="64"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            all possible, to put a stop to these suspicions, before open hos­ <lb/>
            tilities should arise from them. He accordingly sent a person <lb/>
            to say, that he wished to have a meeting with Tissaphernes; <lb/>
            who at once requested him to come. 3. When they met, <lb/>
            Clearchus spoke as follows: “ I am aware, 0 Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            that oaths have been taken, and right-hands pledged between <lb/>
            us, that we will do no injury to each other: nevertheless, I <lb/>
            observe you on your guard against us, as though we were <lb/>
            enemies; and we, perceiving this, stand on our guard against <lb/>
            you. 4. But since, upon attentive observation, I can neither <lb/>
            detect yon in any attempt to injure us, and since, as I am <lb/>
            certain, we have no such intentions towards you, it seemed <lb/>
            proper for me to come to a conference with you, that we may <lb/>
            put an end, if we can, to our distrust of one another. 5. For <lb/>
            I have, before now, known instances of men, who, being in <lb/>
            fear of another, some through direct accusations, and others <lb/>
            through mere suspicion, have, in their eagerness to act before <lb/>
            they suffered, inflicted irremediable evils upon those who nei­ <lb/>
            ther intended nor wished anything of the kind. 6. Think­ <lb/>
            ing, therefore, that such misunderstandings may be best <lb/>
            cleared up by personal communications, I have come here, <lb/>
            and am desirous to convince you that you have no just ground <lb/>
            for mistrusting us. 7. In the first and principal place, the <lb/>
            oaths, which we have sworn by the gods, forbid us to be ene­ <lb/>
            mies to each other; and I should never consider him to be <lb/>
            envied who is conscious of having disregarded such obliga­ <lb/>
            tions; for from the vengeance of the gods I know not with <lb/>
            what speed any one could flee so as to escape, 1 or into what <lb/>
            darkness he could steal away, or how he could retreat into any <lb/>
            stronghold, since all things, in all places, are subject to the <lb/>
            gods ; and they have power over all everywhere alike. 8. Such <lb/>
            are my sentiments respecting the gods, and the oaths which <lb/>
            we swore by them, in whose keeping we deposited the friend­ <lb/>
            ship that we cemented; but among human advantages, I, for <lb/>
            my own part, consider you to be the greatest that we at pre <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὔτ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ ποίου ἀν τάχους φεύγων τις ὰποφύγοι</foreign>.] This is Din­ <lb/>

            and these, I have no doubt, I should be able, with my present <lb/>
            force, to render subservient to you; I am aware also that the <lb/>
            Pisidians molest you ; and I hear that there are many such <lb/>
            nations besides, which I think I could prevent from ever dis­ <lb/>
            turbing your tranquillity. As for the Egyptians, against <lb/>
            whom I perceive you are most of all incensed, I do not see <lb/>
            what auxiliary force you could use to chastise them better <lb/>
            than that which I now have with me. 14. If, again, among <lb/>
            the states that lie around you, you were desirous to become a <lb/>
            friend to any one, you might prove the most powerful of <lb/>
            friends; and if any of them gave you any annoyance, you <lb/>
            might, by our instrumentality, deal with them2 as a master, as <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸν μέγιστον έφεδρον</foreign>.] "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εφεδρος</foreign> properly meant a gladiator or <lb/>

            we should serve you not for the sake of pay merely, but from <lb/>
            gratitude, which we should justly feel towards you if we are <lb/>
            saved by your means. 15. When I consider all these things, <lb/>
            it appears to me so surprising that you should distrust us, that <lb/>
            I would most gladly hear the name 1 of him who is so persua­ <lb/>
            sive a speaker as to make you believe that we are forming <lb/>
            designs against you."</p>
          <p>Thus spoke Clearchus. Tissaphernes replied as follows: <lb/>
            16. "I am delighted, 0 Clearchus, to hear your judicious ob­ <lb/>
            servations ; for, with these sentiments, if you were to meditate <lb/>
            anything to my injury, you would appear to be at the same <lb/>
            time your own enemy. But that you may be convinced that <lb/>
            you have no just cause for distrusting either the king or me, <lb/>
            listen to me in your turn. 17. If we wisked to destroy you, <lb/>
            do we appear to yon to be deficient in numbers either of <lb/>
            cavalry or infantry, or in warlike equipments, with the aid of <lb/>
            which we might be able to do you injury, without danger of <lb/>
            suffering any in return? IS. Or do we seem to you likely to <lb/>
            be in want of suitable places to make an attack upon you? <lb/>
            Are there not so many plains, which, as the inhabitants of <lb/>
            them are friendly to us,2 you traverse with exceeding toil ? <lb/>
            See yon not so many mountains before you to be crossed, <lb/>
            which we might, by pre-occupying them, render impassable <lb/>
            to you ? Or are there not so many rivers, at which we might <lb/>
            parcel you out,3 as many at a time as we might be willing to <lb/>
            engage? Some of these rivers, indeed, you could not cross at <lb/>
            all, unless we secured you a passage. 19. But even suppos­ <lb/>
            ing that we were baffled in all these points, yet fire at least <lb/>
            would prove its power over the produce of the soil ; by burn­ <lb/>
            ing which, we could set famine in array against you, which, <lb/>
            though you were the bravest of the brave, you would find it <lb/>
            difficult to withstand. 20. How then, having so many means <note type="footnote"> that particle, as Dindorf thinks, has dropped out from before ava­ <lb/>

            of waging war with yon, and none of them attended with <lb/>
            danger to ourselves, should we select from amongst them all <lb/>
            this mode, the only one that is impious in the sight of the <lb/>
            gods, the only one that is disgraceful in the sight of men? <lb/>
            31. It belongs, altogether, to men who are destitute of means, <lb/>
            deprived of every resource, and under the coercion of neces­ <lb/>
            sity, and at the same time devoid of principle, to seek to effect <lb/>
            their purposes by perjury towards the gods, and breach of <lb/>
            faith towards men. We, 0 Clearchus, are not so foolish or so <lb/>
            inconsiderate; 22. or why, when we have the opportunity of <lb/>
            effecting your destruction, have we made no such attempt? <lb/>
            Be well assured, that the cause of this was my desire to prove <lb/>
            myself faithful to the Greeks, and, in consequence of doing <lb/>
            them service, to return supported by that very body of foreign <lb/>
            troops, to whom Cyrus, when lie went up, trusted only on ac­ <lb/>
            count of the pay that he gave them. 23. As to the particulars <lb/>
            in which you will be of service to me, some of them you have <lb/>
            enumerated, but of the greatest of all I am myself fully <lb/>
            conscious; for though it is permitted to the king alone to <lb/>
            wear the turban upright on the head, yet perhaps another <lb/>
            than he may, with your assistance, wear that upright which is <lb/>
            on the heart.”1</p>
          <p>24. Tissaphernes, in speaking thus, seemed to Clearchus to <lb/>
            speak with sincerity, and he replied, " Do not those, then, <lb/>
            who endeavour by calumny to make us enemies, when there <lb/>
            are such strong inducements to friendship between us, deserve <lb/>
            the severest of punishment?" 23. “ Well, then," said Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes, "if you will come to me, as well generals as captains, <lb/>
            in a public manner, I will inform you who they are that tell <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὴν δ' ὲπὶ τῄ καρδίᾳ</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχοι</foreign>.] Sc.<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὔρϑην</foreign>. The sense is, “ but to <lb/>
            wear a tiara erect on the heart, that is, to have a kingly spirit and <lb/>
            to aspire to dominion, is what another, by your aid, might be able <lb/>
            to do." Tissaphernes, by this expression, wished to make it under­ <lb/>
            stood that he might possibly, with the support of the Greeks, aspire <lb/>
            to the throne of Persia himself. A similar metaphor is noticed by <lb/>

              me that you are forming plots against me and my army." 26. <lb/>
              'I will bring them all," said Clearchus, "and, on my part, <lb/>
              will let yon know the quarter whence I hear reports respect­ <lb/>
              ing you." 27. After this conversation, Tissaphernes, behav­ <lb/>
              ing to Clearchus with much courtesy, desired him to stay with <lb/>
              him, and made him his guest at supper.</p>
          <p>On the following day, when Clearchus returned to the <lb/>
            camp, he plainly showed that he considered himself to be on <lb/>
            the most friendly footing with Tissaphernes, and stated what <lb/>
            he had proposed ; and he said that those must go to Tissa­ <lb/>
            phernes, whose presence he required, and that whoever of the <lb/>
            Greeks should be proved guilty of uttering the alleged calum­ <lb/>
            nies, must be punished as traitors, and persons ill-affected to <lb/>
            the Greeks. 28. It was Menon that he suspected of making <lb/>
            the charges, as he knew that he had had an interview with <lb/>
            Tissaphernes in company with Ariæus, and was forming a <lb/>
            party and intriguing against himself, in order that, having <lb/>
            gained the whole army over to his own interests, lie might <lb/>
            secure the friendship of Tissaphernes. 29. Clearchus likewise <lb/>
            wished the whole army to have their affections fixed on him­ <lb/>
            self, and troublesome rivals to be removed out of his way.</p>
          <p>Some of the soldiers urged, in opposition to his advice, that <lb/>
            all the captains and generals should not go, and that they <lb/>
            ought to place no confidence in Tissaphernes. 30. But Clear­ <lb/>
            chus pressed his proposal with great vehemence, till he at <lb/>
            length succeeded in getting five generals and twenty captains <lb/>
            to go; and some of the other soldiers followed them, to the <lb/>
            number of about two hundred, as if for the purpose of <lb/>
            marketing.1</p>
          <p>31. When they had arrived at the entrance of Tissaphernes' <lb/>
            tent, the general;;, who were Proxenus the Bccotian, Menon <lb/>
            the Thessalian, Agias the Arcadian, Clearchus the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monian, and Socrates the Achæan, were invited to enter; but <lb/>
            the captains waited at the door. 32. Not long after, at one <lb/>
            and the same signal, those within were seized, and those with­ <lb/>
            out massacred; and immediately afterwards a body of Bar­ <lb/>
            barian cavalry, riding through the plain, killed every Greek, <lb/>
            slave or freeman, that they met.</p>
          <p>33. The Greeks, observing the motions of these cavalry <note type="footnote"> '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ως είς άγορὰν</foreign>.] " Consequently unarmed.” Krüger. </note> <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5. ]</note> <lb/>
            from the camp, were filled with astonishment, and wondered <lb/>
            what they could be doing, till Nicarchus an Arcadian came <lb/>
            fleeing thither, wounded in the belly and holding his intestines <lb/>
            in his hands, and related all that had occurred. 34. The <lb/>
            Greeks, in consequence, ran to their arms in a state of general <lb/>
            consternation, expecting that the enemy would immediately <lb/>
            march upon the camp. 35. They however did not all come, <lb/>
            but only Ariæus and Artaozus and Mithridates, who had been <lb/>
            Cyrus's most confidential friends ; and the interpreter of the <lb/>
            Greeks said, that he saw with them, and recognised, the <lb/>
            brother of Tissaphernes. Other Persians, equipped with <lb/>
            corslets, to the number of three hundred, were in attendance <lb/>
            on them. 36. As they approached the camp, they called for <lb/>
            whatever general or captain of the Greeks might be there, to <lb/>
            come out to them, that they might deliver a message from the <lb/>
            king. 37. There accordingly went forth to them, with much <lb/>
            caution, Cleaner the Orchomenian, and Sophænetus the Stym­ <lb/>
            phalian, generals of the Grecks, and with them Xenophon <lb/>
            the Athenian, that he might learn news of Proxenus. As for <lb/>
            Cheirisophus, lie happened to be absent at some village look­ <lb/>
            in,,, for provisions.</p>
          <p>38. When they had stopped just within hearing, Ariæus <lb/>
            said to them: " Clearchus, 0 Greeks, having been found <lb/>
            guilty of perjury, and of violating the truce, has received his <lb/>
            just punishment, and is dead ; Proxenus and Menon, as hav­ <lb/>
            ing denounced his treachery, are in great honour; but the <lb/>
            king demands of you your arms ; for lie says that they are <lb/>
            his, as they belonged to Cyrus his subject." 39. To this the <lb/>
            Greeks answered, (Cleanor the Orchomenian spoke for them,) <lb/>
            " 0 Ariæus, most wicked of men, and the rest of you, as many <lb/>
            as were the friends of Cyrus, have you no regard either for <lb/>
            gods or men, that, after having sworn that you would consider <lb/>
            our friends and enemies to be likewise yours, you have thus,1 <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ως άπολωλέκατε</foreign>.] Jacobs interprets <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς</foreign> by quota, as equivalent <lb/>

            beings, murdered the very men to whom you swore alli­ <lb/>
            ance, and, abandoning us who are left, have come against us <lb/>
            in conjunction with our enemies?" 40. Ariæus replied, <lb/>
            "Clearchus had been previouslydetected in treacherous designs <lb/>
            against Tissaphernes and Orontes, and all of us who accom­ <lb/>
            pany them." 41. To this Xenophon rejoined, "Clearchus, <lb/>
            then, it he infringed the truce in violation of his oath, is de­ <lb/>
            serve<unclear>rlly</unclear> punished; for it is just that those who violate. <lb/>
            their oaths should suffer death ; but as for Proxenus and <lb/>
            Menon, as they are your benefactors and our generals, send <lb/>
            them hither ; for it is clear that, being friends to both parties, <lb/>
            they will endeavour to advise what is best both for you and <lb/>
            for us." 42. The Barbarians, after conversing among them­ <lb/>
            selves for some time, departed without making any answer to <lb/>
            this proposal</p>

          <p>One of them, Clearehus, by the general consent of all who <lb/>
            were acquainted with him, appears to have been a man well <lb/>
            qualified for war, and extremely fond of military enterprise. <lb/>
            2. For as long as the Lacedæmonians were at war with the <lb/>
            Athenians, lie remained in the service of his country; but <lb/>
            when the peace took place, having induced his government to <lb/>
            believe that the Thracians were committing ravages on the <lb/>
            Greeks, and having gained his point, as well as he could, <lb/>
            with the Ephori, he sailed from home to make war upon <lb/>

            Hellespont, 4. and was in consequence condemned to death, <lb/>
            for disobedience, by the chief magistrates at Sparta. Being <lb/>
            then an exile, he went to Cyrus; and by what methods he <lb/>
            conciliated the favour of Cyrus, has been told in another place. <lb/>
            Cyrus presented him with ten thousand darics ; 5. and he, <lb/>
            on receiving that sum, did not give himself up to idleness, <lb/>
            but having collected an army with the money, made war <lb/>
            upon the Thracians, and conquered them in battle, and from <lb/>
            that time plundered and laid waste their country, and con­ <lb/>
            tinued this warfare till Cyrus had need of his army ; when <lb/>
            he went to him, for the purpose of again making war in COIl­ <lb/>
            cert with him.</p>
          <p>6. These seem to me to have been the proceedings of one <lb/>
            fond of war, who, when he might have lived in peace without <lb/>
            disgrace or loss, chose war in preference ; when he might <lb/>
            have spent his time in idleness, voluntarily underwent toil for <lb/>
            the sake of military adventure ; and when he might have en­ <lb/>
            joyed riches in security, chose rather, by engaging in warfare, <lb/>
            to diminish their amount. He was indeed led by inclination to <lb/>
            spend his money in war, as he might have spent it in pursuits <lb/>
            of gallantry, or any other pleasure ; to such a degree was he <lb/>
            fond of war. 7. He appears also to have been qualified for <lb/>
            military undertakings, as he liked perilous adventure, was <lb/>
            ready to march day and night against the enemy, and was pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of great presence of mind in circumstances of difficulty, <lb/>
            as those who were with him on all such occasions were uni­ <lb/>
            versally ready to acknowledge.</p>
          <p>8. For commanding troops he was said to be qualified in as <lb/>
            great a degree as was consistent with his temper; for he <lb/>
            was excelled by no one in ability to contrive how an army <lb/>
            might have provisions, and to procure them ; and he was <lb/>
            equally fitted to impress on all around him the necessity of <lb/>
            obeying Clearchus. 9. This he effected by severity ; for he <lb/>
            was of a stern countenance and harsh voice; and he always <lb/>
            punished violently, and sometimes in anger, so that he occa­ <lb/>
            sionally repented of what he had done. He punished too on <lb/>
            principle, for he thought that there could be no efficiency in <lb/>
            on army undisciplined by chastisement. 10. He is also re- <pb n="72"/>
             <note type="margin">[B II. </note> <lb/>
            ported to have said, that a soldier ought to fear his commander <lb/>
            more than the enemy, if he would either keep guard well, or <lb/>
            abstain from doing injury to friends, or march without hesita­ <lb/>
            tion against foes. 11. In circumstances of danger, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, the soldiers were willing to obey him implicitly, and <lb/>
            wished for no other leader; for they said, that the sternness <lb/>
            in his countenance then assumed an appearance of cheerful­ <lb/>
            ness, and that what was severe in it seemed undauntedness <lb/>
            against the enemy ; so that it appeared indicative of safety, and <lb/>
            not of austerity. 12. But when they were out of danger, and <lb/>
            were at liberty to betake themselves to other chiefs, they de­ <lb/>
            serted him in great numbers ; for he had nothing attractive <lb/>
            in him, but was always forbidding and repulsive, so that the <lb/>
            soldiers felt towards him as boys towards their master. 13. <lb/>
            Hence it was, that lie never hall any one who followed him <lb/>
            out of friendship and attachment to his person ; though such <lb/>
            as followed him from being appointed to the service by their <lb/>
            country, or from being compelled by want or other necessity, <lb/>
            he found extremely submissive to him. 14. And when they <lb/>
            began under his command to gain victories over the enemy, <lb/>
            there were many important circumstances that concurred to <lb/>
            render his troops excellent soldiers ; for their perfect confi­ <lb/>
            dence against the enemy had its effect, and their dread of <lb/>
            punishment from him rendered them strictly observant of dis­ <lb/>
            cipline. 15. Such was his character as a commander. But <lb/>
            he was said to have been by no means willing to be com­ <lb/>
            manded by others. When he was put to death, he was about <lb/>
            fifty years of age.</p>
          <p>16, Proxenus the Bœotian. from his earliest youth, felt a <lb/>
            desire to become a man capable of great undertakings ; and <lb/>
            through this desire paid Gorgias of Leontium for instruction. <lb/>
            17. When he had passed some time with him, and thought <lb/>
            himself capable of command, and, if honoured with the <lb/>
            friendship of the great, of making no inadequate return for <lb/>
            their favours, he proceeded to take a part in this enterprise <lb/>
            with Cyrus ; and expected to acquire in it a great name, ex­ <lb/>
            tensive influence, and abundant wealth. IS. But though he <lb/>
            earnestly wished for these things, lie at the same time plainly <lb/>
            showed, that he was unwilling to acquire any of them by in­ <lb/>
            justice, but that he thought lie ought to obtain them by just <lb/>
            and honourable means, or otherwise not at all. <pb n="73"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> 19. He was indeed able to command orderly and well-dis­ <lb/>
            posed men, but incapable of inspiring ordinary soldiers with <lb/>
            either respect or fear for him ; he stood even more in awe of <lb/>
            those under his command, than they of him ; and evidently <lb/>
            showed that he was more afraid of being disliked by his sol­ <lb/>
            fliers, than his soldiers of being disobedient to him. 20. He <lb/>
            thought it sufficient both for being, and appearing, capable <lb/>
            of command, to praise turn who did well, and withhold his <lb/>
            praise from the offender. Such, therefore, of his followers, as <lb/>
            were of honourable and virtuous character, were much attach­ <lb/>
            ed to him, but the unprincipled formed designs upon him, as <lb/>
            a man easy to manage. He was about thirty years old when <lb/>
            lie was put to death.</p>
          <p>21. As for Menon the Thessalian, he ever manifested an <lb/>
            excessive desire for riches, being desirous of command that <lb/>
            he might receive greater pay, and desirous of honours that <lb/>
            he might obtain greater perquisites ; and he wished to be well <lb/>
            with those in power, in order that when lie did wrong he <lb/>
            might not suffer punishment. 22. To accomplish what lie <lb/>
            desired, he thought that the shortest road lay through perjury, <lb/>
            falsehood, and deceit; while sincerity and truth he regarded <lb/>
            as no better than folly. 23. He evidently had no affection for <lb/>
            any man ; and as for those to whom he professed to be a <lb/>
            friend, he was unmistakeably plotting mischief against them. <lb/>
            He never ridiculed an enemy, but always used to talk with <lb/>
            his associates as if ridiculing all of them.1 24. He formed no <lb/>
            designs on the property of his enemies, (for he thought it <lb/>
            difficult to take what belonged to such as were on their guard <lb/>
            against him,) but looked upon himself as the only person semi. <lb/>
            ible how very easy it was to invade the unguarded property <lb/>
            of friends.</p>
          <p>25. Those whom he saw given to perjury and injustice, lie <lb/>
            feared as men well armed; but sought to practise on those <lb/>
            who were pious and observant of truth, as imbeciles. 26. As <lb/>
            another might take a pride in religion, and truth, and justice, <lb/>
            so Menon took a pride in being able to deceive, in devising <lb/>
            falsehoods, in sneering at friends; and thought the man who <lb/>
            was guileless was to be regarded as deficient in knowledge of the <lb/>
            world. He believed that he must conciliate those, in whose <lb/>

            he tried to render obedient to him by being an accomplice ir <lb/>
            their dishonesty. lIe expected to be hononred and courted, <lb/>
            by showing that he had the power and the will to inflict the <lb/>
            greatest injuries. When any one deserted him, he spoke of it <lb/>
            as a favour on his own part that, while lie made use of his <lb/>
            services, he did not work his destruction.</p>
          <p>28. As to such parts of his history as are little known, I <lb/>
            might, if I were to speak of them, say something untrue of <lb/>
            him ; but those which every one knows, are these. While yet <lb/>
            in the prime of youth he obtained, at the hands of Aristippus, <lb/>
            the command of his corps of mercenaries. He was also, in <lb/>
            his prime, most intimate with Ariæus, though a Barbarian, as <lb/>
            Ariæus delighted in beautiful youths. He himself, too, while <lb/>
            yet a beardless youth, made a favourite of Tharypas, who had <lb/>
            arrived at manhood.</p>
          <p>29. When his fellow-officers were put to death, because <lb/>
            they had served with Cyrus against the king, he, though he <lb/>
            had done the same, was not put to death with them ; but after <lb/>
            the death of the other generals, he died under a punishment <lb/>
            inflicted by the king, not like Clearchus and the other com­ <lb/>
            manders, who were beheaded (which appears to be the <lb/>
            peediest kind of death): but after living a year in torture, <lb/>
            like a malefactor, he is said at length to have met his end.</p>
          <p>30. Agias the Arcadian and Socrates the Achæan were also <lb/>
            put to death. These no one ever derided as wanting courage <lb/>
            in battle, or blamed for their conduct towards their friends <lb/>
            They were both about five and thirty years of age.</p><pb n="75"/>

            Xenophon is one of those clected.</p>
          <p>1. WHAT the Greeks did in their march up the country <lb/>
            with Cyrus, until the time of the battle, and what occurred <lb/>
            after Cyrus was dead, when the Greeks set out to return <lb/>
            with Tissaphernes in reliance on a truce, has been related in <lb/>
            the preceding part of the work.</p>
          <p>2. After the general; were made prisoners, and such of the <lb/>
            captains and soldiers as had accompanied them were put to <lb/>
            death, the Greeks were in great perplexity, reflecting that <lb/>
            they were not far from the king's residence ; 1 that there were <lb/>
            around them, on all sides, many hostile nations and cities; <lb/>
            that no one would any longer secure them opportunities of <lb/>
            purchasing provisions; that they were distant from Greece <lb/>
            not less than ten thousand stadia ; that there was no one to <lb/>
            guide them on the way ; that impassable rivers would inter­ <lb/>
            cept them in the midst of their course; that the Barbarians <lb/>
            who had gone up with Cyrus had deserted them ; and that <lb/>
            they were left utterly alone, having no cavalry to support <lb/>
            them, so that it was certain, even if they defeated their one <lb/>
            mies, that they would kill not a man of them, and that, if <lb/>
            they were defeated, none of themselves would be left alive ;— <lb/>
            3. reflecting, I say, on these circumstances, and being dis­ <lb/>
            heartened at them, few of them tasted food for that eyening,2 <lb/>

            arms1 during the night, but lay down to rest where they <lb/>
            severally happened to be, unable to sleep for sorrow and long­ <lb/>
            ing for their country, their parents, their wives and children, <lb/>
            whom they never expected to see again. In this state of <lb/>
            mind they all went to their resting-places.</p>
          <p>4. There was in the army a certain Xenophon, an Athe­ <lb/>
            nian, who accompanied it neither in the character of general, <lb/>
            nor captain, nor common soldier, but it had happened that Prox­ <lb/>
            enus, an old guest-friend of his, had sent for him from home, <lb/>
            giving him a promise that, if he came, he would recommend <lb/>
            him to the friendship of Cyrus, whom he considered, he said, <lb/>
            as a greater object of regard than his own country. 5. <lb/>
            Xenophon, on reading the letter, consulted Socrates the <lb/>
            Athenian, as to the propriety of making the journey; and <lb/>
            Socrates, fearing that if he attached himself to Cyrus it might <lb/>
            prove a ground for accusation against him with his country, <lb/>
            because Cyrus was thought to have zealously assisted the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians in their war with Athens, advised Xenophon <lb/>
            to go to Delphi, and consult the god respecting the expedi­ <lb/>
            tion. 6. Xenophon, having gone thither accordingly, inquired <lb/>
            of Apollo to which of the gods lie should sacrifice and pray, <lb/>
            in order most honourably and successfully to perform the <lb/>
            journey which lie contemplated, and, after prosperously ac­ <lb/>
            complishing it, to return in safety. Apollo answered him that <lb/>
            "he should sacrifice to the gods to whom it was proper for <lb/>
            him to sacrifice."2 7. When he returned, he repeated the <lb/>
            oracle to Socrates, who, on hearing it, blamed him for not <lb/>
            asking Apollo in the first place, whether it were better for <lb/>
            him to go or stay at homo ; whereas, having settled with him­ <lb/>
            self that lie would go, he only asked how he might best go; <lb/>
            " but since you have," said he, "put the question thus, you <lb/>
            must do what the god has directed." 8. Xenophon, there­ <lb/>
            fore, having sacrificed to the gods that Apollo commanded, <note type="footnote">1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επι δὲ τὰ ὃπλα</foreign>.] See note on ii. 2. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οερις, οἶς ἓδει</foreign>, Ut diis cis, quibus oporteret, saera faceret. <lb/>
            Those gods are to lie understood, to whom it was established, by <lb/>
            law or by custom, that whoever was entering on an expedition, <lb/>
            such as that which Xenophon meditated, should offer sacrifice. <lb/>
            They were therefore certain or appointed gods: comp. sect. 8; and <lb/>

            set sail, and found Proxenus and Cyrus at Sardis, just setting <lb/>
            out on their march up the country, and was presented to <lb/>
            Cyrus. 9. Proxenus desiring that he should remain with <lb/>
            them, Cyrus joined in the same desire, and said that as soon <lb/>
            as the expedition was ended, lie would send him home again. <lb/>
            The expedition was said to be intended against the Pisidians. <lb/>
            tO. Xenophon accordingly joined in the enterprise, being thus <lb/>
            deceived, but not by Proxenus ; for he did not know that the <lb/>
            movement was against the king, nor did any other of the <lb/>
            Greeks, except Clearchus. When they arrived in Cilicia, <lb/>
            however, it appeared manifest to everyone that it was against <lb/>
            the king that their force was directed ; but, though they were <lb/>
            afraid of the length of the journey, und unwilling to proceed, <lb/>
            yet the greater part of them, out of respectI both for one <lb/>
            another and for Cyrus, continued to follow him; of which <lb/>
            number was Xenophon.</p>
          <p>11. When this perplexity occurred, Xenophon was distressed <lb/>
            as well as the other Greeks, and unable to rest, but having <lb/>
            at length got a little sleep, he had a dream, in which, in the <lb/>
            midst of a thunder-storm, a bolt seemed to him to fall upon <lb/>
            his father's house, and the house in consequence became <lb/>
            all in a blaze. 12. Being greatly frightened, he immediately <lb/>
            awoke, and considered his dream as in one respect favourable, <lb/>
            (inasmuch as, being in troubles and dangers, he seemed to be­ <lb/>
            hold a great light from Jupiter,) but in another respect he was <lb/>
            alarmed, (because the dream appeared to him to be from Ju­ <lb/>
            piter who was a king, and the fire to blaze all around him,) lest <lb/>
            he should be unable to escape from the king'a territories, but <lb/>
            should be hemmed in on all sides by inextricable difficulties.</p>
          <p>13. What it betokens, however, to see such a dream, we may <lb/>
            conjecture from the occurrences that happened after the dream. <note type="footnote"> 1 At' <foreign xml:lang="grc">αίσχύνην</foreign>.] They had regard for their character in the eyes <lb/>

              What immediately followed was this. As soon as lie awoke, <lb/>
              the thought that first occurred to him was, "Why do I lie <lb/>
              here ? The night is passing away. With daylight it is pro­ <lb/>
              bable that the enemy will come upon us ; and if we once fall <lb/>
              into the hands of the king, what is there to prevent us from <lb/>
              being put to death with ignominy, after witnessing the most <lb/>
              grievous sufferings among our comrades, and enduring every <lb/>
              severity of torture ourselves ? 14. Yet no one concerts mea­ <lb/>
              sures, or takes thought, for our defence, but we lie still, as <lb/>
              if we were at liberty to enjoy repose. From what city, then, <lb/>
              do I expect a leader to undertake our defence ? What age <lb/>
              am I wailing for to come to myself? Assuredly I shall never <lb/>
              be older, if I give myself up to the enemy to-day." 15. Aftei <lb/>
              these reflections lie arose, and called together, in the first <lb/>
              place, the captains that were under Proxenus.</p>
          <p>When they were assembled, lie said, " For my part, captains, <lb/>
            I cannot sleep, nor, I should think, can you, nor can I lie <lb/>
            still any longer, when I consider in what circumstances we <lb/>
            are placed ; 16. for it is plain that the enemy did not openly <lb/>
            manifest hostility towards us, until they thought that they <lb/>
            had judiciously arranged their plans ; but on our side no one <lb/>
            takes any thought how we may best maintain a contest with <lb/>
            them. 17. Yet if we prove remits, and fall into the power <lb/>
            of the king, what may we not expect to suffer from a man <lb/>
            who cut off the head and hand of his own brother by the <lb/>
            same mother and father, even after he was dead, and fixed <lb/>
            them upon a stake ? What may not we, I say, expect to <lb/>
            suffer, who have no relative1 to take our part, and who have <lb/>
            marched against him to make him a subject instead of a mon­ <lb/>
            arch, and to put him to death if it should lie in our power ? <lb/>
            IS. Will he not proceed to every extremity, that by reducing <lb/>
            us to the last degree of ignominious suffering, he may inspire <lb/>
            all meli with a dread of ever taking the field against him ? <lb/>
            We it. ist however try every expedient not to fall into his <lb/>
            hands. to. For myself, I never ceased, while the truce lasted, <lb/>
            to consider ourselves as objects of pity, and to regard the <lb/>
            king and his people as objects of envy, as I contemplated how <lb/>
            extensive and valuable a country they possessed, how great <lb/>
            an abundance of provisions, how many slaves and cattle, and <note type="footnote"> 1Cyrus, says Weiske, had his mother to take his part <lb/>
            the Greeks had no one to take theirs. </note> <pb n="79"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            how vast a quantity of gold and raiment ; 20. while, on the <lb/>
            other hand, when I reflected on the condition of our own <lb/>
            soldiers, that we had no share in any of all these blessings, <lb/>
            unless we bought it, and knew that few of us had any longer <lb/>
            money to buy, and that our oaths restrained us from getting <lb/>
            provisions otherwise than by buying, I sometimes, on taking <lb/>
            all these circumstances into consideration, feared the continu­ <lb/>
            ance of peace more than I now fear war. 21. But since they <lb/>
            have put an end to peace, their own haughtiness, and our <lb/>
            mistrust, seem likewise to be brought to an end ; for the <lb/>
            advantages which I have mentioned lie now as prizes between <lb/>
            us, for whichsoever of us shall prove the better men ; and <lb/>
            the gods are the judges of the contest, who, as is just, will <lb/>
            be on our side ; 22. since the enemy have offended them by <lb/>
            perjury, while we, though seeing many good things to tempt <lb/>
            us, have resolutely abstained from all of them through regard <lb/>
            to our oaths; so that, as it seems to me, we may advance to the <lb/>
            combat with much greater confidence than they can feel. 23. We <lb/>
            have bodies, moreover, better able than theirs to endure cold <lb/>
            and heat and toil ; and we have, with the help of the gods, <lb/>
            more resolute minds; while the enemy, if the gods, as before, <lb/>
            grant us success, will be found more obnoxious to wounds <lb/>
            and death 1 than we are. 24. But possibly others of you en­ <lb/>
            tertain the same thoughts ; let us not, then, in the name of <lb/>
            heaven, wait for others to come and exhort us to noble deeds, <lb/>
            but let us be ourselves the first to excite others to exert their <lb/>
            valour. Prove yourselves the bravest of the captains, and <lb/>
            more worthy to lead than those who are now leaders. 25. As <lb/>
            for me, if you wish to take the start in the course, I am <lb/>
            willing to follow you, or, if you appoint me to be a leader, <lb/>
            I shall not make my youth an excuse, but shall think myself <lb/>
            sufficiently mature to defend myself against harm."</p>
          <p>26. Thus spoke Xenophon; and the captains, on hearing <lb/>
            his observations, all desired him to be their leader, except a <lb/>
            certain Apollonides, who resembled a Bœotian in his manner <lb/>
            of speaking ; this man said that "whoever asserted they could <lb/>
            gain safety by any other means than by obtaining, if he could, <lb/>
            the king's consent to it, talked absurdly;" and at the same <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καὶ τρωτοὶ</foreign> icas <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑνητοὶ μᾱλλον</foreign>.] " More vulnerable and mortal." <lb/>
            Alluding to the superiority of the Grecian armour over that of the <lb/>
            Persians. </note> <pb n="80"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            time began to enumerate the difficulties surrounding them. <lb/>
            27. But Xenophon, interrupting him, said, " 0 most wonder­ <lb/>
            ful of men ! you neither understand what you see, nor remem­ <lb/>
            ber what you hear. Yet you were on the same spot with <lb/>
            those here present, when the king, after Cyrus was dead, being <lb/>
            in high spirits at the circumstance, sent to demand that we <lb/>
            should deliver up our arms ; 28. and when we, refusing to de­ <lb/>
            liver them up, and appearing in full armour, went and en­ <lb/>
            camped over against him, what means did he not try, sending <lb/>
            deputies, asking for a truce, and supplying us with provisions <lb/>
            until he obtained a truce ? 29. But when, on the other hand, <lb/>
            our general,; and captains went to confer with the Barbarians, <lb/>
            as you now advise us to do, without their arms, and relying <lb/>
            on the truce, were they not beaten, goaded, insulted, and are <lb/>
            they not unable, wretched men, to die, though, I should think, <lb/>
            greatly longing for death ? And do you, knowing all these <lb/>
            occurrences, say that those who exhort us to defend ourselves <lb/>
            talk absurdly, and advise us to go again to try persuasion? <lb/>
            so. To me, 0 captains, it seems that we should no longer ad­ <lb/>
            iit this man into the same service with ourselves, but take <lb/>
            from him his captaincy, and laying baggage on his back, make <lb/>
            use of him in that capacity; for lie disgraces both his own <lb/>
            country and all Greece, inasmuch as, being a Greek, he is of <lb/>
            such a character." 31. Here Agasias of Stymphalus, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding to speak, said, " But this man, assuredly, has nothing <lb/>
            to do either with Bœotia or with Greece at all, for I have ob­ <lb/>
            served that he has both his cars bored, like a Lydian." Such <lb/>
            indeed was the ease ; and they accordingly expelled him.</p>
          <p>32. The rest, proceeding to the different divisions of the <lb/>
            troops, called up the general wherever there was a general <lb/>
            surviving, and the lieutenant-general! where the geneial was <lb/>
            dead, and the captain wherever there was a captain sur living. <lb/>
            33. When they were all come together, they sat down before the <lb/>
            place where the arms were piled ; 2 and the generals a.<unclear/> cap­ <lb/>
            tains assembled were about a hundred in all. The time when <lb/>
            the meeting took place was about midnight <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸν ύποστράτηγον</foreign>.] Krüger, from v. 9. 36, and vi. 2. 11,con <lb/>
            eludes that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύποστράτηγος</foreign> was he who was appointed to discharge <lb/>

            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. 1.] </note> 34. Hieronymus, a native of Elis, the oldest of all the cap­ <lb/>
            tains that had served under Proxenus, was the first to speak, <lb/>
            as follows : " It has seemed proper to us, 0 generals and cap­ <lb/>
            tains, on contemplating the present state of OUt. affairs, to meet <lb/>
            together ourselves, and to call upon you to join us, that we <lb/>
            may determine, if we can, on some plan for our benefit. But <lb/>
            do you, Xenophon, first represent to the assembly what you <lb/>
            have already observed to us." 35. Xenophon accordingly said, <lb/>
            " We are all aware that the king and Tissaphernes have made <lb/>
            prisoners of as many of us as they could ; and it is evident that <lb/>
            they are forming designs against the rest of us, that they may <lb/>
            put us to death if they can. But on our parts I think that <lb/>
            every means should be adopted in order that we may not fall <lb/>
            into the Barbarians' hands, but rather that they, if we can <lb/>
            accomplish it, may fall into ours. 36. Be well assured then, <lb/>
            that you, who have now met together in such numbers, have <lb/>
            upon you a most important responsibility ; 1 for all the soldiers <lb/>
            look to yeu, and, if they see you dispirited, they will them­ <lb/>
            selves lose courage, but if both you yourselves appear well <lb/>
            prepared to meet the enemy, and exhort others to be equally <lb/>
            prepared, be certain that they will follow you, and strive to <lb/>
            imitate you. 37. Perhaps, too, it is right that you should <lb/>
            show some superiority over them ; for you are their generals, <lb/>
            their officers, and their captains, and, when there was peace, <lb/>
            you enjoyed advantages over them in fortune and honour: <lb/>
            and now, in consequence, when war arises, you ought to prove <lb/>
            yourselves pre-eminent over the multitude, and to take the <lb/>
            lead in forming plans for them, and, should it ever be neces­ <lb/>
            sary, in toiling for them. 38. And, in the first place, I think <lb/>
            that you will greatly benefit the army, if you take care that <lb/>
            generals and captains be chosen as soon as possible in the <lb/>
            room of those whom we have lost; for without commanders <lb/>
            nothing honourable or advantageous can be achieved, I may <lb/>
            say in one word, anywhere, but least of all in the field of battle. <lb/>
            Good order conduces to safety, but want of order has al­ <lb/>
            ready proved fatal to many. 39. Again, when you have ap­ <lb/>
            pointed as many commanders as are requisite, I consider that <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καιρόν</foreign>.] Leunclavius makes this equivalent to " in vobis pluri­ <lb/>
            mum est situm." Sturz, in his Lexicon Xenoph., says, " rerum <lb/>
            status is est, ut vos in primis debeatis rebus consulere." Toup, in <lb/>
            his Emend, ad Suid., gives maximum momentum habetis. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> o </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            if you were to assemble and encourage the rest of the soldiers, <lb/>
            you would act very suitably to the occasion ; 40. for you <lb/>
            perhaps observe, as well as myself, how dejectedly they have <lb/>
            now come to the place of arms,1 and how dejectedly they go <lb/>
            upon guard, so that, while they are in such a condition, I <lb/>
            know not for what service anyone could employ them, whether <lb/>
            required by night or by day. 41. But if any one could change <lb/>
            the direction of their thoughts, so that they may not merely <lb/>
            contemplate what they are likely to suffer, but what they may <lb/>
            be able to do, they will become much more eager for action ; <lb/>
            42. for you are certain that it is neither numbers nor strength <lb/>
            which gives the victory in war, but that whichsoever side <lb/>
            advances on the enemy with the more resolute courage, their <lb/>
            opponents, in general, cannot withstand their onset. 43. I <lb/>
            have also remarked, fellow-soldiers, that such as are eager in <lb/>
            the field to preserve their lives at any rate, for the most part <lb/>
            perish wretchedly and ignominiously, while I see that such <lb/>
            as reflect that death is to all men common and inevitable, and <lb/>
            seek in battle only to fall with honour, more frequently, from <lb/>
            whatever cause, arrive at old age, and live, while they live, <lb/>
            with greater happiness. 44. Being aware, then, of these facts, <lb/>
            it behoves us, such are the circumstances in which we are <lb/>
            placed, both to prove ourselves to be brave soldiers, and to <lb/>
            exhort others to be so likewise." 45. Having spoken thus, he <lb/>
            stopped.</p>
          <p>After him Cheirisophus said, " Till the present moment, 0 <lb/>
            Xenophon, I knew nothing of you, except having heard that <lb/>
            you were an Athenian, but now I have to praise you both <lb/>
            for what you say and what you do, and could wish that there <lb/>
            were very many like you ; for it would be a general good. <lb/>
            4G. And now," lie added, "let us not delay, my fellow-soldiers, <lb/>
            but proceed at once, you who want them, to choose commanders, <lb/>
            and when you have elected them, come to the centre of the <lb/>
            camp, and bring those that are chosen ; and we will then call <lb/>
            the rest of the soldiers together there. And let Tolmides <lb/>
            the herald," said he, "come with us." 47. As he said this, he <lb/>
            rose up, that the necessary measures might not be delayed, <lb/>
            but carried at once into execution. There were accordingly <lb/>
            chosen commanders, Timasion a Dardanian in the room of <lb/>
            Clearchus, Xanthicles an Achæan in that of Socrates, Cleanor <note type="footnote"> I See ii. 2 20. </note> <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            an Arcadian in that of Agias, Philesius an Achæan in that <lb/>
            of Menon, and Xenophon of Athens in that of Proxenus.</p>

          <p>The new generals hold a council of war. The speeches of Cheirisophus, <lb/>
            Cleanor, and Xenophon. The order of march is settled, and the <unclear>duti</unclear> <lb/>
            of each commander appointed.</p>
          <p>I. WHEN the officers were chosen, and day was just dawning, <lb/>
            they met in the centre of the camp, and it was resolved to sta­ <lb/>
            tion sentinels at the out-posts, and to call together the soldiers. <lb/>
            When the rest of the troops came up, Cheirisophus the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian rose first, and spoke as follows : 2. " Our pre­ <lb/>
            sent circumstances, fellow-soldiers, are fraught with difficulty, <lb/>
            since we are deprived of such able generals, and captains, and <lb/>
            soldiers, and since, also, the party of Arianus, who were for­ <lb/>
            merly our supporters, have deserted us ; 3. yet it behoves us <lb/>
            to extricate ourselves from these difficulties as brave men, <lb/>
            and not to lose courage, but to endeavour to save ourselves, <lb/>
            if we can, by an honourable victory ; but if we cannot do so, <lb/>
            let us at least die with honour, and never, while we live, put <lb/>
            ourselves into the power of the enemy ; for I think that, in <lb/>
            that case, we should endure such sufferings as I wish that the <lb/>
            gods may inflict on our adversaries."</p>
          <p>4. After him Cleaner the Orchomenian arose and spoke <lb/>
            thus: "You see, soldiers, the perjury and impiety of the <lb/>
            king ; and you see also the faithlessness of Tissaphernes, <lb/>
            who, after telling us that he was a neighbour of the Greeks, and <lb/>
            would esteem it the highest privilege to save us, and after <lb/>
            having given us his right hand as a pledge, has himself de­ <lb/>
            ceived and made prisoners our generals, and has not respected <lb/>
            even Jupiter, the protector of the rights of hospitality, but, <lb/>
            entertaining Clearchus at his own table, has, by this very means, <lb/>
            inveigled and destroyed our officers. 5. Ariæus, too, whom <lb/>
            we offered to make king, to whom we gave and from whom <lb/>
            we received pledges, that we would not betray one another, <lb/>
            even he, neither fearing the gods, nor respecting the memory <lb/>
            of Cyrus. though honoured by him in the highest degree while <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            he was alive, has now gone over to his bitterest enemies, and <lb/>
            endeavours to distress us who were his friends. 6. But on <lb/>
            these men may the gods take vengeance ; for ourselves, it is <lb/>
            incumbent upon us, having this conduct before our eyes, not <lb/>
            to be deceived again by them, but, after fighting as bravely <lb/>
            as we can, to bear with patience such fortune as the gods may <lb/>
            appoint us."</p>
          <p>7. Next stood up Xenophon, who had accoutred himself <lb/>
            tor war as splendidly as he could, thinking that if the <lb/>
            gods should grant them victory, the finest equipment would <lb/>
            be suitable to success, or that, if it were appointed for him <lb/>
            to die, it would be well for him to adorn himself with his <lb/>
            best armour,1 and in that dress to meet his end. He pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to speak thus : 8. " Of the perjury and perfidy of the <lb/>
            Barbarians Cleanor has just spoken, and you, I am sure, are <lb/>
            well aware of it. If, then, we think of coming again to term? <lb/>
            of friendship with them, we must of necessity feel much dis­ <lb/>
            trust on that head, when we see what our generals have suf­ <lb/>
            fered, who, in reliance on their faith, put themselves into their <lb/>
            hands ; but if we propose to inflict on them vengeance with <lb/>
            our swords for what they have done, and, for the future, to be <lb/>
            at war with them at all points, we have, with the help of the <lb/>
            gods, many fair hopes of safety." 9. As he was uttering these <lb/>
            words, somebody sneezed, and the soldiers, hearing it, with <lb/>
            one impulse paid their adoration to the god ; 2 and Xenophon <lb/>
            continued, " Since, soldiers, while we were speaking of safety, <lb/>
            an omen from Jupiter the Preserver has appeared, it seems to <lb/>
            me that we should vow to that god to offer sacrifices for <lb/>
            our preservation on the spot where we first reach a friendly <lb/>
            country; and that we should vow, at the same time, to sacri­ <lb/>
            lice to the other gods according to our ability. And to whom­ <lb/>
            soever this seems reasonable, let him hold up his hand." All <lb/>
            held up their hands ; and they then made their vows, and sang <lb/>
            the pæan. When the ceremonies to the gods were duly per­ <lb/>
            formed, he recommenced thus: 10. "I was saying that we <lb/>
            had many fair hopes of safety. In the first place, we have <lb/>
            observed our oaths made to the gods; but the enemy have <lb/>
            perjured themselves, and broken the truce and their oaths. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τών καλλίστων έαυτὸν άξυώσαντα</foreign>.] " Thinking himself werthy <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            Such being the case, it is natural that the gods should be un­ <lb/>
            favourable to our enemies, and should fight on our side; the <lb/>
            gods, who are able, whenever they will, to malo the mighty <lb/>
            soon weak, and to save the weak with case, although they be <lb/>
            in grievous perils. 11. In the next place, I will remind you <lb/>
            of the dangers in which our ancestors were, that you may feel <lb/>
            conscious how much it becomes you to be brave, and how the <lb/>
            brave are preserved, even from the greatest troubles, by the aid <lb/>
            of the gods. For when the Persians, and those united with <lb/>
            them, came with a numerous host, as if to sweep Athens from <lb/>
            the face of the earth, 1 the Athenians, by daring to oppose <lb/>
            them, gave them a defeat; 12. and having made a vow to <lb/>
            Diana, that whatever number they should kill of the enemy, <lb/>
            they would sacrifice to her divinity the same number of goats, <lb/>
            and not being able to find enough, they resolved to sacrifice <lb/>
            five hundred every year ; and to this day they still continue <lb/>
            to sacrifice them. 13. Again, when Xerxes, having collected <lb/>
            that innumerable army of his, came down upon Greece a se­ <lb/>
            cond time, our ancestors on that occasion, too, defeated the <lb/>
            ancestors of these Barbarians, both by land and sea ; of which <lb/>
            exploits the trophies are still to be seen as memorials; the <lb/>
            greatest of all memorials, however, is the liberty of the states <lb/>
            in which you were born and bred, for you worship no man <lb/>
            as master, but the gods alone. Of such ancestors are you <lb/>
            sprung.</p>
          <p>14. " Nor am I going to say that you dishonour them. <lb/>
            It is not yet many days since you arrayed yourselves in the <lb/>
            field against the descendants of those Barbarians, and defeated, <lb/>
            with the help of the gods, a force many times more numerous <lb/>
            than yourselves. 15. On that occasion you showed yourselves <lb/>
            brave men to procure a throne for Cyrus ; and now, when <lb/>
            the struggle is for your own lives, it becomes rou to be more <lb/>
            valiant and resolute. 16. At present, too, you may justly feel <lb/>
            greater confidence against your adversaries ; for even then, <lb/>
            when you had made no trial of them, and saw them in count- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αὺθις άφανιούντων</foreign>.] Weiske, Schneider, and others omit the <lb/>

            less numbers before you, you yet dared, with the spirit of <lb/>
            your fathers, to advance upon them, and now, when you have <lb/>
            learned from experience of them, that, though many times <lb/>
            your number, they shrink from receiving your charge, what <lb/>
            reason have you any longer to fear them ? 17. And do not <lb/>
            consider it any disadvantage, that the troops of Cyrus, who <lb/>
            were formerly arrayed on our side, have now left us; for they <lb/>
            are far more cowardly than those who were defeated by you ; <lb/>
            at least1 they deserted us to flee to them, and those who are <lb/>
            so ready to commence flight it is better to see posted on the <lb/>
            side of the enemy than in our own ranks.</p>
          <p>is. "If, again, any of you are disheartened because we <lb/>
            have no cavalry, and the enemy have a great number, con­ <lb/>
            sider that ten thousand cavalry are nothing more than ten <lb/>
            thousand men; for no one ever perished in battle of being <lb/>
            bitten or kicked by a horse ; it is the men that do whatever <lb/>
            is done in the encounter. 19. Doubtless we, too, rest upon a <lb/>
            surer support than cavalry have, for they are raised upon horses, <lb/>
            and are afraid, not only of us, but also of falling, while we, <lb/>
            taking our steps upon the ground, shall strike such as ap­ <lb/>
            proach us with far greater force, and hit much more surely <lb/>
            the mark at which we may aim. In one point alone, indeed, <lb/>
            have the cavalry the advantage, that it is safer for them to <lb/>
            flee than for us.</p>
          <p>20. “ But if, though you have courage for battle, you are <lb/>
            disquieted at the thought that Tissaphernes will no longer <lb/>
            guide you, and that the king will no longer supply you with <lb/>
            provisions, consider whether it is better to have Tissaphernes <lb/>
            for cur guide, who is manifestly plotting our destruction, or <lb/>
            such persons as we ourselves may seize and compel to be our <lb/>
            guides, who will be conscious that if they go wrong with re­ <lb/>
            gard to us, they go wrong with regard to their own lives and <lb/>
            persons. 21. And as to provisions, whether is it better for us <lb/>
            to purchase, in the markets which they provide, small measures <lb/>
            of food for large sums of money, (no longer, indeed, having the <lb/>
            money,) or, if we are successful in the field, to take supplies <lb/>
            for ourselves, adopting whatever measure each of us may <lb/>
            wish to use ?</p>
          <p>22. " Again, if you think, that this state of things will be <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γου̃ν</foreign>.] Some copies have <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὖν</foreign>. " The sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γου̃ν</foreign> is this: cete­ <lb/>

            better, but imagine that the rivers will be impassable, and <lb/>
            that you were greatly misled when you came across them, <lb/>
            reflect whether the Barbarians have not acted most unwisely <lb/>
            also in this respect.1 For an rivers, though they may be <lb/>
            impassable at a distance from their sources, are easy to be <lb/>
            forded by those who go to their springs, wetting them not <lb/>
            even to the knees. 23. But even if the rivers shall not afford <lb/>
            us a passage,2 and no guide skill appear to conduct us, we <lb/>
            still need not be in despair ; for we know that the Mysians, <lb/>
            whom we should not call more valiant than ourselves, have <lb/>
            settled themselves, against the king's will, in many rich and <lb/>
            large cities in the king's territory ; we know that the Pisi­ <lb/>
            dians have acted similarly ; and we have ourselves seen3 that <lb/>
            the Lycaonians, having seized on the strongholds in the <lb/>
            plains, enjoy the produce of the land of these Barbarians ; <lb/>
            24. and I should recommend that we, for the present, should <lb/>
            not let it be seen that we are eager to start homewards, but <lb/>
            should apparently make arrangements as if we thought of <lb/>
            settling somewhere in these parts; for I am sure that the king <lb/>
            would grant the Mysians many guides, and give them many <lb/>
            hostages to send them out of the country safely, and even make <lb/>
            roads for them, though they should desire to depart in four­ <lb/>
            horse chariots ; and for ourselves, too, I am convinced that <lb/>
            he would with thrice as much pleasure do the same, if he saw <lb/>
            us making dispositions to remain here. 25. But I am afraid <lb/>
            t hat if we should once learn to live in idleness, to revel in <lb/>
            abundance, and to associate with the fair and stately wives <lb/>
            and daughters of the Medes and Persians, we should, like the <lb/>
            lotus-eaters,1 think no more of the road homewards. 26. It <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰ ᾱρα, κ</foreign>. T. X.] Krüger admonishes the reader that these words <lb/>

            seems to me, therefore, both reasonable and just, that we <lb/>
            should first of all make an attempt to return to Greece, and <lb/>
            to the members of our families, and let our countrymen see <lb/>
            that they live in voluntary poverty, since they might see those, <lb/>
            who are now living at home without due means of subsistence, <lb/>
            enriched on betaking themselves hither. But I need say no <lb/>
            more on this head, for it is plain, my fellow-soldiers, that all <lb/>
            these advantages fall to the conquerors.</p>
          <p>27. “I must also suggest to you, however, in what mannei <lb/>
            we may proceed on our way with the greatest safety, and <lb/>
            how we may fight, if it should be necessary to fight, to the <lb/>
            greatest possible advantage. First of all, then," he continued, <lb/>
            “it seems to me that we ought to burn whatever carriages we <lb/>
            have, that our cattle may not influence our movements, but <lb/>
            that we may march whithersoever it may be convenient for <lb/>
            the army ; and then that we should burn our tents with them, <lb/>
            for tents are troublesome to carry, and of no service either for <lb/>
            fighting or in getting provisions. 28. I think also that we <lb/>
            ought to rid ourselves of whatever is superfluous in the rest <lb/>
            of our baggage, reserving only what we have for war, or for <lb/>
            meat and drink, that as many of us as possible may be under <lb/>
            arms, and as few as possible baggage-bearers; for you are <lb/>
            aware that whatever belongs to the conquered becomes the <lb/>
            property of others; and, if we are victorious, we ought to <lb/>
            look upon the enemy as our baggage-carriers.</p>
          <p>29. “It only remains for me to mention a particular which <lb/>
            I consider to be of the greatest importance. You see that <lb/>
            the enemy did not venture openly to commence war against <lb/>
            us, until they had seized our generals, thinking that as long <lb/>
            as we had commanders, and were obedient to them, we should <lb/>
            be in a condition to gain the advantage over them in the field, <lb/>
            but, on making prisoners of our generals, they expected that <lb/>
            we should perish from want of direction and order. 30. It is <lb/>
            incumbent, therefore, on our present commanders to be far <lb/>
            more vigilant than our former ones, and on those under com-</p>

            officers, at present than they were before. 31. And if you <lb/>
            were also to pass a resolution, that, should any one be dis­ <lb/>
            obedient, whoever of you chances to light upon him is to join <lb/>
            with his officer in punishing him, the enemy would by that <lb/>
            means be most effectually disappointed in their expectations, <lb/>
            for, on the very day that such resolution is passed, they will <lb/>
            see before them ten thousand Clearehuses instead of one, who <lb/>
            will not allow a single soldier to play the coward. 32. But it <lb/>
            is now time for me to conclude my speech ;1 for in an instant <lb/>
            perhaps the enemy will be upon us. Whosoever, therefore, <lb/>
            thinks these suggestions reasonable, let him give his sanction <lb/>
            to them at once, that they may be carried into execution. <lb/>
            But if any other course, in any one's opinion, be better than <lb/>
            this,2 let him, even though he be a private soldier, boldly give <lb/>
            us his sentiments; for the safety, which we all seek, is a ge­ <lb/>
            neral concern."</p>
          <p>33. Cheirisophus then said, “Should there be need of any <lb/>
            other measure in addition to what Xenophon proposes, it will <lb/>
            be in our power to bring it forward by and by ; what he has <lb/>
            now suggested we ought, I think, to vote at once to be the <lb/>
            best course that we can adopt; and to whomsoever this seems <lb/>
            proper, let him hold up his hand ;” and they all held them up. <lb/>
            34. Xenophon then, rising again, said, “Hear, soldiers, what <lb/>
            appears to me to be necessary in addition to what I have laid <lb/>
            before you. It is plain that we must march to some place <lb/>
            from which we may get provisions ; and I hear that there are <lb/>
            some good-looking villages not more than twenty stadia dis­ <lb/>
            tant ; 35. but I should not wonder if the enemy, (like cowardly <lb/>
            dogs that run after such as pass by them, and bite them if <lb/>
            they can, but flee from those who pursue them,) I should not <lb/>
            wonder, I say, if the enemy were to follow close upon us when <lb/>
            we begin to march. 36. It will, perhaps, be the safer way for <lb/>
            us to march, therefore, forming a hollow square of the heavy- <lb/>
            armed troops, in order that the baggage and the large number <lb/>
            of camp-followers may be in greater security within it ; <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περαίνειν</foreign>.] Sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν λόγον</foreign>. This is the sense in which this word <lb/>

            late the movements in front, who arc to be on each flank, and <lb/>
            who to have charge of the rear, we shall not have to consider <lb/>
            of these things when the enemy approach, but may at once <lb/>

            each of the flanks; and let Timasion and myself, the youngest <lb/>
            of the officers, take charge, at least for the present, of the rear. <lb/>
            38. After a time, when we have tried this arrangement, we will <lb/>

            yourselves know ; I am now well disposed towards you; and <lb/>
            I am living here under great apprehensions; if therefore I <lb/>
            should find that you are concerting any safe scheme for your <lb/>
            deliverance, I would come and join you, bringing with me all <lb/>
            my followers. Let me know, therefore, what you have in con­ <lb/>
            templation, as one who is your friend and well-wisher, and <lb/>
            who is willing to march along with you." 3. The general.?, <lb/>
            after consulting together, resolved on returning the following <lb/>
            answer; and Cheirisophus delivered it: "It is our deter­ <lb/>
            mination, if no one hinders us from returning home, to pro­ <lb/>
            ceed through the country with as little injury to it as possible; <lb/>
            but if any one opposes us on our march, to fight our way <lb/>
            against him as vigorously as we can." 4. Mithridates then <lb/>
            endeavoured to convince them how impracticable it was to <lb/>
            escape without the king's consent. But it was now concluded <lb/>
            that he was insidiously sent; for one of the followers of Tis­ <lb/>
            saphernes was in attendance on him to insure his fidelity.' <lb/>
            5. In consequence, it was thought right by the generals to <lb/>
            pass a resolution that the war should be such as to admit of <lb/>
            no intercourse by heralds ;2 for those that came tried to cor­ <lb/>
            rupt the soldiers, and succeeded in seducing one of the cap­ <lb/>
            tains, Nicarchus an Arcadian, and he deserted in the night <lb/>
            with about twenty men.</p>
          <p>6. Having then dined, and crossed the river Zabatus, they <lb/>
            marched on in regular order, keeping the baggage-cattle and <lb/>
            camp-followers in the centre. But before they had gone far, <lb/>
            Mithridates made his appearance again with about two hun­ <lb/>
            dred cavalry and about four hundred archers and slingers, <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πίστεως ἔνεκα</foreign>.] To watch him, lest lie should act treacherously. <lb/>

            very light and active troops. 7. He advanced towards the <lb/>
            Greeks as a friend, but, when he came near, some of his men, <lb/>
            both horse and foot, suddenly discharged their arrows, and <lb/>
            others used their slings, and wounded some of our men. The <lb/>
            rear of the Greeks indeed was much harassed, and could do <lb/>
            nothing in return ; for the Cretan bowmen shot to a less dis­ <lb/>
            tance than the Persians, and had also, as being lightly armed, <lb/>
            sheltered themselves within the heavy troops; and the javelin- <lb/>
            men did not hurl far enough to reach the slingers. 8. Upon <lb/>
            this it seemed to Xenophon that it would be well to pursue <lb/>
            them ; and such of the heavy-armed and peltasts as happened <lb/>
            to be with him in the rear, began to pursue, but could over­ <lb/>
            take in the pursuit not a single man of the enemy; 9. for the <lb/>
            Greeks had no cavalry,1 nor could their infantry, in a short <lb/>
            distance, overtake the infantry of the enemy, who took to <lb/>
            flight when they were a long way off, since it was impossible <lb/>
            for the Greeks to follow them to a great distance from the <lb/>
            rest of the army. 10. The Barbarian cavalry, too, inflicted <lb/>
            wounds in their retreat, shooting backwards as they rode, <lb/>
            and however far the Greeks advanced in pursuit, so far were <lb/>
            they obliged to retreat fighting, 11. Thus during the whole <lb/>
            day they did not advance more than five-and-twenty stadia; <lb/>
            however, they arrived at the villages in the evening.</p>
          <p>Here again there was much dejection ; and Cheirisophus <lb/>
            and the oldest of the generals blamed Xenophon for pursuing <lb/>
            the enemy apart from the main body, endangering himself, <lb/>
            and yet being unable to hurt the assailants. 12. Xenophon, <lb/>
            hearing this charge, acknowledged that they blamed him justly, <lb/>
            and that the result bore testimony in their favour. " But," <lb/>
            said he, " I was under the necessity of pursuing, as I saw <lb/>
            that we suffered great damage while remaining at our posts, <lb/>
            and were unable to retaliate. 13. But when we began to <lb/>
            pursue," continued lie, "the truth was as you say; for we <lb/>
            were none the better able to injure the enemy, and we could <lb/>
            not retreat without great difficulty. 14. Thanks are due to the <lb/>
            gods, therefore, that the Barbarians did not come upon us in <lb/>
            great force, but only with a few troops, so that, whilst they <note type="footnote"> 1 Cyrus's Greek auxiliaries for the expedition had consisted only <lb/>
            of infantry; all his cavalry was either Asiatic or Thracian. The <lb/>
            Thracian horse had deserted, and the Asiatic cavalry had gone over <lb/>
            to Tissaphernes soon after the battle. </note> <pb n="93"/>

            </note>did us no great harm, they showed us of what we stand in <lb/>
            need: 15. for at present the enemy shoot their arrows and <lb/>
            sling their stones such a distance, that neither can the Cretans <lb/>
            return their shots, nor can those who throw with the hand <lb/>
            reach them; and when we pursue them, we cannot go after <lb/>
            them any great distance from the main body, and in a short <lb/>
            space a foot-soldier, even if ever so swift, cannot overtake <lb/>
            another foot-soldier, starting at bow-shot distance. 16. It <lb/>
            therefore we would keep off the enemy, so that they may be <lb/>
            unable to hurt us on our march, we must at once provide our­ <lb/>
            selves with slingers and cavalry. There are, I hear, some <lb/>
            Rhodians in our army, the greater number of whom, they say, <lb/>
            understand the use of the sling, while their weapon carries <lb/>
            even double the distance of the Persian sling, 17. which, as <lb/>
            they sling with large stones, reach only a short distance, <lb/>
            while the Rhodians know how to use leaden bullets. is. If <lb/>
            then, we ascertain which of them have slings, and give money <lb/>
            to each of them1 for them ; and pay money also to any one <lb/>
            who is willing to plait more, and find some other privilege2 <lb/>
            for him who consents to serve in the troop of slingers,3 possi­ <lb/>
            bly some will offer themselves who may be able to be of ser­ <lb/>
            vice to us. 19. I see also that there are horses in the army, <lb/>
            some in my possession, and some left by Clearchus, besides <lb/>
            many others taken from the enemy which arc employed in <lb/>
            carrying the baggage. If, then, we collect all these, and put <lb/>
            ordinary baggage-cattle in their place, and equip the horses for <lb/>
            riders, they will perhaps annoy the enemy in their flight." <lb/>
            20. These suggestions were approved ; and that very night <lb/>
            there came forward slingers to the number of two hundred. <lb/>

          <p>Mithridates again pursues the Greeks, but is repulsed. They reach the <lb/>
            Tigris, encamp at Mespila, and are attacked by Tissaphernes with a nu­ <lb/>
            merous force. They repel him, and alter their order of march. Traversing <lb/>
            a mountainous part of the country, they arc harassed by the enemy, till, <lb/>
            on getting possession of a height, they are enabled to reach the plain be <lb/>
            yond it in safety.</p>
          <p>1. HAVING halted for that day, they went forward on the <lb/>
            next, rising earlier in the morning than usual; for they had <lb/>
            a ravine formed by a torrent to pass, at which they were <lb/>
            afraid that the enemy would attack them while they were <lb/>
            crossing. 2. It was not till they had got over, however, that <lb/>
            Mithridates again made his appearance, having now with him <lb/>
            a thousand horse, and archers and slingers to the number of <lb/>
            four thousand ; for he had solicited and obtained that number <lb/>
            from Tissaphernes, promising that, if lie received them, he <lb/>
            would deliver the Greeks into his hands ; for he had con­ <lb/>
            ceived a contempt for them, because, in his previous attack <lb/>
            on them, though he had but a small force with him, he had <lb/>
            suffered no loss, and thought that he had caused them great <lb/>
            annoyance. 3. When the Greeks, having crossed, were dis­ <lb/>
            tant about eight stadia from the ravine, Mithridates also <lb/>
            passed over it with his force. Instructions had been issued <lb/>
            to such of the peltasts and heavy-armed troops as were to <lb/>
            pursue, and a charge had been given to the horsemen to pur­ <lb/>
            sue with boldness, as a sufficient force would follow to support <lb/>
            them. 4. When therefore Mithridates overtook them, and <lb/>
            the slings and arrows began to take effect, a signal was given <lb/>
            to the Greeks with the trumpet, and those who had been or­ <lb/>
            dered immediately hastened to charge the enemy, the cavalry <lb/>
            riding forward at the same time. The enemy however did <lb/>
            not wait to receive their charge, but fled back to the ravine. <note type="footnote"> to have had the same signification ; but <foreign xml:lang="grc">σπολάς</foreign> to have been the <lb/>

            5. In the pursuit several of the Barbarian foot were killed, <lb/>
            and about eighteen of the horse were made prisoners in the <lb/>
            defile. The Greeks, of their own impulse, mutilated the dead <lb/>
            bodies, in order that the sight of them might be as horrible <lb/>
            as possible to the enemy.</p>
          <p>6. The enemy, after faring thus, went off, and the Greeks, <lb/>
            advancing the rest of the day without molestation, arrived at <lb/>
            the river Tigris. 7. Here was a large deserted city, the name <lb/>
            of which was Larissa, and which the Modes had formerly in­ <lb/>
            habited. The breadth of its wall was five and twenty feet, <lb/>
            and the height of it a hundred ; its circuit was two parasangs. <lb/>
            It was built of bricks made of clay, but there was under it a <lb/>
            stone foundation,! the height of twenty feet. 8. This city the <lb/>
            king of the Persians,2 at the time when the Persians wrested3 <lb/>
            the empire from the Modes, was unable by any means to take ; <lb/>
            a cloud, however, having covered the sun, hid it from view,4 <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κρηπὶς δ᾽ ὺπη̃ν λιθίνη</foreign>, K. T. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign>.] The foundation appears to have <lb/>
            risen twenty feet above the ground ; so that the whole height of the <lb/>
            wall would be a hundred and twenty feet. Mr. Ainsworth says that <lb/>
            he found the ruins of the brick wall at Resell, which he considers <lb/>
            to be the same with Larissa, " based on a rude and hard conglome­ <lb/>
            rate rock, giving to them all the solidity and characteristics of being <lb/>
            built of stone.” Travels in the Track, p. 139. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Cyrus the Great. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Ελάμανον</foreign>.] That the Medes did not willingly submit, but <lb/>

            till the people deserted it,1 and so it was taken. 9. Near the <lb/>
            city was a stone pyramid, of the breadth2 of one plethrum, <lb/>
            and the height of two plethra. Upon it3 were many of the <lb/>
            Barbarians who had fled from the neighbouring villages.</p>
          <p>10. Hence they proceeded one day's journey, six parasangs, <lb/>
            to a large unoccupied fortress,4 situated near a city, the name <lb/>
            of which was Mespila; the Modes had formerly inhabited it. <lb/>
            The foundation of the wall was of polished stone, full of <lb/>
            shells,5 the breadth fifty feet, and the height fifty ; 11. and on <lb/>
            it was constructed a wall of bricks, fifty feet broad, and a <lb/>
            hundred high ; the circumference of it was six parasangs. <lb/>
            Here Medea, the king's wife, is said to have taken refuge, <lb/>
            when the Medes were deprived of their empire by the Per­ <lb/>
            sians. 12. The king of the Persians, on besieging this city, <lb/>
            was unable to reduce it either by length of time or by assault, <lb/>
            but Jupiter, as with a thunder-stroke,6 deprived the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants of their senses, and thus it was taken.</p>
          <p>13. Hence they proceeded one day's journey, a distance of <lb/>
            four parasangs. In the course of this day's march Tissaphernes <lb/>
            made his appearance, having with him the cavalry which he <lb/>
            himself commanded, the force of Orontes, who had married <lb/>

            assist him, and, besides these, all that the king himself had <lb/>
            given him ; so that his army appeared extremely numerous. <lb/>
            14. When lie came near, he stationed some of his companies in <lb/>
            the rear, and brought others round upon our flanks, but did not <lb/>
            venture to make a charge, or show any disposition to endanger <lb/>
            himself, but ordered his men to use their slings and bows. 15. <lb/>
            But when the Rhodians, who were dispersed among the ranks, <lb/>
            began to use their slings, and the Scythian archers1 dis­ <lb/>
            charged their arrows, no one failing to hit a man, (for it <lb/>
            would not have been easy to do so, even if they had been ever <lb/>
            so desirous,) Tissaphernes hastily retreated beyond reach of <lb/>
            the missiles, and the other divisions drew off at the same time. <lb/>
            16. During the rest of the day the Greeks continued their <lb/>
            march, and the enemy followed; but the Barbarians no longer <lb/>
            harassed them with their usual skirmishing ; for the Rhodians <lb/>
            sent their missiles to a greater distance than the Persians. <lb/>
            and than most of the bowmen. 17. The bows of the Persians, <lb/>
            too, were large, so that such of their arrows as were taken up, <lb/>
            were of service to the Cretans, who continued to use the <lb/>
            enemy's arrows, and practised shooting by sending them far up <lb/>
            into the air.2 A great number of bowstrings were also <lb/>
            found in the villages, and some lead, so that they could use it <lb/>
            for their slings.</p>
          <p>is. For that day, therefore, as soon as the Greeks reached <lb/>
            the villages and encamped, the Barbarians went off, having <lb/>
            had the worst in the skirmish ; and during the next the <lb/>
            Greeks remained where they were, and collected provisions, <lb/>
            for there was plenty of corn in the villages. The day after, <lb/>
            they proceeded through the open country, and Tissaphernes <lb/>
            followed, hurling missiles at them from a distance. 19. Here <lb/>
            the Greeks found that a square was a bad disposition for au <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκύϑαι τοξόται</foreign>.] As there is no mention of Scythians in the <lb/>

            army when the enemy was behind them; for it must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily happen, that if the flanks of the square close together <lb/>
            from the road being narrow, or from hills or a bridge making <lb/>
            it necessary, that the heavy-armed men must be pushed out of <lb/>
            their places, and march with difficulty,' being at the same <lb/>
            time crowded together and thrown into confusion ; so that <lb/>
            when in such disorder they must be nearly useless. 20. And <lb/>
            when, again, the flanks divide, those who were previously <lb/>
            forced out of their places, must now of necessity separate, and <lb/>
            the space between the flanks be left empty; and men who are <lb/>
            thrown into such a condition must doubtless lose heart, if the <lb/>
            enemy are behind them. Whenever, too, they had to pass a <lb/>
            bridge, or any other crossing-place, each hastened on to get first, <lb/>
            and the enemy had then a fine opportunity of attacking them.2 <lb/>
            21. The generals, seeing that such was the case, formed six <lb/>
            companies of a hundred men each, and appointed captains of <lb/>
            these companies, as well as captains of fifty and captains of <lb/>
            twenty-five.3 These captains and their companies, on the <lb/>
            march, whenever the flanks of the square closed together, fell <lb/>
            behind, so as to cause no disorder in the flanks, and then led <lb/>
            on outside the flanks; 22. and whenever the sides of the square <lb/>
            opened, they filled up the centre, if the opening was narrow, <lb/>
            by companies ; if rather wide, by fifties ; if very wide, by <lb/>
            twenty-fives;4 so that the centre was always full. 23. If, <lb/>
            then, it was necessary to pass any defile or bridge, they were <lb/>
            not thrown into confusion, but the captains and companies went <lb/>
            over in succession;5 and if anything was needed in any part <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πονήρως</foreign>.] From <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόνηϱος</foreign>, difficult, not from <foreign xml:lang="grc">πονηρός</foreign>, bad. See <lb/>

            of the main body, these were at hand. In this order they <lb/>
            advanced four days'journey.</p>
          <p>24. As they were pursuing the fifth day's march, they ob­ <lb/>
            served a kind of palace, and several villages round it. The <lb/>
            way to this place, they perceived, lay among high hills, which <lb/>
            reached down from a mountain, at the foot of which the vil­ <lb/>
            lage was.1 These hills the Greeks were glad to see, as was <lb/>
            natural, when the enemy's force consisted of cavalry. 25. <lb/>
            But when, after leaving the plain, they had ascended the first <lb/>
            hill, and were descending in order to mount the second, the <lb/>
            Barbarians came upon them, and from the eminence began, <lb/>
            under the lash,2 to hurl darts, use their slings, and shoot <lb/>
            arrows, on the ground below; 26. they wounded many, and <lb/>
            had the advantage over the light-armed Greeks, and shut <lb/>
            them up within the heavy-armed ; so that both the slingers <lb/>
            and archers were that day entirely useless, being mixed with <lb/>
            the crowd that had charge of the baggage. 27. When the <lb/>
            Greeks, on being hard pressed, attempted pursuit, they <lb/>
            mounted the height but slowly, as being heavily armed, while <lb/>
            the enemy sprang up speedily. 28. When, again, they re­ <lb/>
            treated back to the rest of the force, they fared equally ill. <lb/>
            The same occurrences took place on the second hill; so that <lb/>
            they thought it proper not to move the soldiers from the third <lb/>
            hill, until they led up a body of peltasts to the mountain from <lb/>
            the right wing of the square. 29. When these had got above <lb/>
            the pursuing enemy, they no longer attacked them in their <lb/>
            descent, fearing that they might be cut off from their own <lb/>
            body, and that enemies might assail them on both sides. 30. <lb/>
            Marching in this manner for the rest of the day, some by the <lb/>
            route among the hills, and others advancing abreast of them <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ην ἡ κώμη</foreign>.] Schneider, Bornemann, and most editors before <lb/>

            added the article from two manuscripts, and Kühner has followed <lb/>

            thinks that the village in which the palace stood is intended. The <lb/>

            along the mountain, they arrived at the villages, and ap­ <lb/>
            pointed eight surgeons,1 for there were many wounded.</p>
          <p>31. Here they remained three days, both for the sake of the <lb/>
            wounded, and because they found, at the same time, abund­ <lb/>
            ance of provisions, wheat-flour, wine, and a great quantity <lb/>
            of barley laid up for horses; supplies which had been col­ <lb/>
            lected for the satrap of the country. On the fourth day <lb/>
            they went down into the plain. 32. But as Tissaphernes <lb/>
            overtook them with his forces, necessity taught them to en­ <lb/>
            camp where they first saw a village, and not to march on still <lb/>
            fighting; for there were many unfitted for action, some <lb/>
            wounded, some carrying the wounded, and some bearing the <lb/>
            arms of those that carried them. 33. When however they <lb/>
            were encamped, and the Barbarians, coming up to the village, <lb/>
            attempted to skirmish with them, the Greeks had greatly the <lb/>
            advantage ; for they found a great difference2 between sally­ <lb/>
            ing from their own ground to repulse the enemy, and fighting <lb/>
            with a pursuing enemy on their march.</p>
          <p>34. When evening approached, it became time for the <lb/>
            enemy to retire; for the Barbarians never encamped at a less <lb/>
            distance from the Greeks than sixty stadia, fearing lest the <lb/>
            Greeks should attack them in the night. 35. For in the night <lb/>
            a Persian army is difficult to manage; as their horses are <lb/>
            tied, and for the most part fastened by the feet, that they may <lb/>
            not run away if they should be untied ; and if any sudden at­ <lb/>

            horse, and to bridle him, and then, when lie has put on his <lb/>
            armour, to mount; but all these things are troublesome by <lb/>
            night and in the midst of an alarm. On this account they <lb/>
            encamped at a distance from the Greeks.</p>
          <p>36. As soon as the Greeks saw that they intended to retire, <lb/>
            and were passing the order for doing so, proclamation was <lb/>
            made among the Greeks, in the hearing of the enemy, that <lb/>
            they were to collect their baggage; when the Barbarians, for <lb/>
            some time, delayed their march ; but, when it grew late, they <lb/>
            went off, for they did not think it expedient to march and ar­ <lb/>
            rive at their camp I in the night. 37. When the Greeks ob­ <lb/>
            served them evidently moving away, they themselves also <lb/>
            decamped2 and began to march, and accomplished as much as <lb/>
            sixty stadia. There was thus so great a distance between the <lb/>
            armies, that the enemy did not appear on the following day or <lb/>
            on the third ; but on the fourth, the Barbarians, having gone <lb/>
            forward in the night, occupied an elevated position on the <lb/>
            right, on the route by which the Greeks were to pass ; the <lb/>
            brow of a mountain, beneath which was the descent into the <lb/>
            plain. 38. As soon as Cheirisophus saw that this eminence <lb/>
            was pre-occupied, he sent for Xenophon from the rear, and <lb/>
            ordered him to bring his peltasts and come to the front. 39. <lb/>
            Xenophon however did not bring the peltasts, (for he saw <lb/>
            Tissaphernes, and all his force, in full view,) but, riding up <lb/>
            alone, asked, " Why do you call me?" Cheirisophus replied, <lb/>
            " You may see ; for the eminence above the descent has been <lb/>
            pre-occupied against us, and it is impossible to pass, unless we <lb/>
            cut off those who are on it. But why did you not bring the <lb/>
            peltasts?" 40. Xenophon replied that he did not think it <lb/>
            right to leave the rear unguarded when the enemy were in <lb/>
            sight. "But it is high time," he continued, " to consider how <lb/>
            some of us may dislodge those men from the hill." 41. Xeno­ <lb/>

            above their own army, and that there was a way from it to <lb/>
            the hill where the enemy were, and exclaimed, “ It is best for <lb/>
            as, Cheirisophus, to hasten as quickly as possible to the <lb/>
            summit, for if we gain this, those who arc above our road <lb/>
            will be unable to maintain their ground. But do you, if you <lb/>
            please, remain with the army ; I have a desire to go forward ; <lb/>
            or, if you prefer it, proceed on to the mountain, and I will <lb/>
            stay here." 42. " I leave you," replied Cheirisophus, “ to <lb/>
            choose which of the two you please." Xenophon, observing <lb/>
            that he was the younger, decided on advancing, but requested <lb/>
            Cheirisophus to send with him a detachment from the front, <lb/>
            as it was too great a distance to bring one from the rear. <lb/>
            43. Cheirisophus then sent with him the peltasts from the <lb/>
            front; and he took those that were in the middle of the <lb/>
            square. Cheirisophus also ordered the three hundred that he <lb/>
            had with him at the head of the square, consisting of picked <lb/>
            men, to follow Xenophon.</p>
          <p>44. The party then marched forward with all possible <lb/>
            speed. But the enemy on the heights, when they perceived <lb/>
            that the Greeks were directing their course towards the sum­ <lb/>
            mit, hurried forward also themselves to contend for the pos­ <lb/>
            session of the summit. 45. There was then great shouting <lb/>
            from the Grecian army, cheering their men, and great shout­ <lb/>
            ing also from the troops of Tissaphernes, cheering on theirs. <lb/>
            46. Xenophon, riding along on horseback, encouraged his <lb/>
            party, saying, “ Consider, soldiers, that you are now contend­ <lb/>
            ing for Greece ; that after a brief struggle now, we shall <lb/>
            march the rest of the way without fighting, to join our chil­ <lb/>
            dren and our wives.” 47. Soterides, a Sicyonian, cried out, <lb/>
            “ We are not upon an equality, Xenophon ; for you are car­ <lb/>
            ried on a horse, while I have hard work to carry my shield." <lb/>
            48. Xenophon, on hearing this remark, leaped from his horse, <lb/>
            pushed Soterides from the ranks, took from him his shield, <lb/>
            and marched on with it as fast as he was able. he happened <lb/>
            however to have on his horseman's corslet, so that he was <lb/>
            distressed. Yet he continued to exhort the men in front to <lb/>
            lead on gently, and those behind, who followed with difficulty, <lb/>
            to come up. 49. But the rest of the soldiers beat and threw <lb/>
            stones at Soterides, and reviled him, till they obliged him to re­ <lb/>

             <note type="margin">CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            horseback, but when it became impassable, he left his horse <lb/>
            behind, and hastened forward on foot. Thus they got the <lb/>
            start of the enemy, and arrived first at the summit.</p>

          <p>The Greeks arrive at a point where the Carducliian mountains overhang the <lb/>
            river, and, as they are still harassed by the enemy, the generals hold a <lb/>
            consultation, and determine to march across the mountains.</p>
          <p>1. THE Barbarians, in consequence, turned their backs and <lb/>
            fled every one as he could, and the Greeks took possession of <lb/>
            the top of the hill. Tissaphernes and Ariæus turned aside, and <lb/>
            went off in another direction. Cheirisophus and his forces, go­ <lb/>
            ing down into the plain, encamped in a village abounding with <lb/>
            acceptable supplies; and there were also in this plain many <lb/>
            other villages stored with excellent provisions, lying along the <lb/>
            river Tigris. 2. When it was evening, the enemy suddenly <lb/>
            showed themselves in the plain, and cut off some of the <lb/>
            Greeks who were dispersed over the ground foraging ; for <lb/>
            several herds of cattle had been intercepted as they were <lb/>
            being transported to the other side of the river. 3. Here <lb/>
            Tissaphernes and his party attempted to set fire to the vil­ <lb/>
            lages, and some of the Greeks were much disheartened, being <lb/>
            apprehensive that, if they should burn them, they would have <lb/>
            no place whence to procure supplies.</p>
          <p>4. Cheirisophus and his men now returned from giving <lb/>
            succour;1 and Xenophon, when he came down, riding past <lb/>
            the ranks, as the Greeks, coming in from affording aid, met <lb/>
            him, said, 5. "You see, Greeks, that the enemy admit that <lb/>
            the country is now ours, for whereas they stipulated, when <lb/>
            they made the truce, that we should not burn the king's coun­ <lb/>
            try, they now burn it themselves, as being no longer theirs. <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκ τη̃ς βοηθείας</foreign>.] Xenophon is here somewhat obscure; for he <lb/>
            made no mention of this <foreign xml:lang="grc">βοηθεία</foreign> before. Cheirisophus and his men <lb/>
            seem to have gone to aid the party of Greeks that were dispersed <lb/>
            for plunder, when some of them were cut off by the Persians, <lb/>
            and when Tissaphernes attempted to burn the villages. * Of * After­ <lb/>

            But wherever they leave supplies for themselves, thither also <lb/>
            they shall see us direct our march. 6. I think, however, <lb/>
            Cheirisophus;” continued he,“that we ought to resist these burn­ <lb/>
            er?, as if in defence of our own territory.” “ I," replied Chei­ <lb/>
            risophus, “amof a different opinion ; rather let us burn also," <lb/>
            said he, "and thus they will the sooner cease."</p>
          <p>7. When they returned to their quarters,! the soldiers <lb/>
            busied themselves about their provisions, but the general <lb/>
            and captains held a council. There was now much perplex­ <lb/>
            ity ; for on one side of them were exceeding high mountains, <lb/>
            and on the other a river of such depth, that, when they <lb/>
            sounded it. their spears did not rise above the water. 8. <lb/>
            While they were in doubt how to act, a Rhodian came to <lb/>
            them, and said, " I am willing to convey you across, 0 Greeks, <lb/>
            by four thousand heavy-armed men at a time, if you will <lb/>
            furnish me with what I require for the purpose, and give me <lb/>
            a talent as a remuneration." 9. Being asked what he should <lb/>
            require, he replied, " I shall want two thousand hides made <lb/>
            into bags; and I see here many sheep, goats, oxen, and asses, <lb/>
            the hides of which, being blown out,2 would easily furnish the <lb/>
            means of crossing. to. I shall want also the ropes which you <lb/>
            use for the baggage-cattle ; joining, with these, the bags to <lb/>
            one another, steadying each bag by attaching stones to it, let­ <lb/>
            ting the stones down like anchors into the water, extending the <lb/>
            bags across the stream, and securing them to both banks, I <lb/>
            will then lay wood upon them, and strew earth over the wood. <lb/>
            11. That you will not sink, you will at once see; for each <lb/>
            skin will prevent two men from sinking, and the wood and <lb/>
            earth will keep them from slipping off." 12. The generals, <lb/>
            on hearing this proposal, thought the invention ingenious, <lb/>
            but the execution of it impossible, for there were numerous <lb/>
            cavalry on the other side to hinder their passage, who, at the <lb/>
            commencement, would not have allowed the first that made the <lb/>
            attempt to effect their purposes. <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επὶ τὰς σκηνάς</foreign>.] The tents were burned, iii. 3. 1 ; and Krüger <lb/>

            some unburnt villages, having first set fire to those which they <lb/>
            abandoned ; so that the enemy did not come up to them, but <lb/>
            watched them, and seemed to be wondering which way the <lb/>
            Greeks would turn themselves, and what they had in their <lb/>
            mind. 14. The rest of the soldiers then turned their thoughts <lb/>
            to getting supplies; but the generals and captains held ano­ <lb/>
            ther council, and, bringing together the prisoners, questioned <lb/>
            them as to the whole country around, what each part was. <lb/>
            15. They said that the parts toward the south were on the <lb/>
            road towards Babylon and Media, through which the Greeks <lb/>
            had come ; that the road towards the east led to Susa and <lb/>
            Eebatana, where the king was said to pass the summer and <lb/>
            spring ; that the one across' the river, towards the west, led <lb/>
            to Lydia and Ionia; and that the other over the mountains, <lb/>
            towards the north, led to the Carduchi. 16. This people, <lb/>
            they said, lived among the mountains, were very warlike, and <lb/>
            did not obey the king; that on one occasion, a royal army of <lb/>
            a hundred and twenty thousand men had penetrated into their <lb/>
            country, whence, from the impracticability of the ground, not <lb/>
            one of them returned ; but that, whenever they made a treaty <lb/>
            with the satrap of the plain, some of them had intercourse <lb/>
            with the Carduchi, and some of the Carduchi with them. <lb/>
            17. The generals, having heard these statements, kept apart <lb/>
            by themselves those who said that they knew the road in each <lb/>
            direction, not letting it be known which way they intended to <lb/>
            go. It appeared necessary to the generals, however, to make <lb/>
            their way over the mountains into the country of the Cardu­ <lb/>
            chi ; for the prisoners said that after passing through this they <lb/>
            would come to Armenia, a large and rich country, of which <lb/>
            Orontes was governor, whence it would be easy for them to go <lb/>
            whichever way they pleased.</p>
          <p>18. With reference to this proceeding, they made a sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, in order that, when it should seem time, they might com­ <lb/>
            mence their march; for they were afraid that the passage <lb/>
            over the mountains might be pre-occupied by the enemy ; and <lb/>
            they gave orders, that when the soldiers had supped, they <lb/>
            should all pack up their baggage and go to rest, and follow <lb/>
            their leaders whenever the signal should be given. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διαἀντι</foreign>.] The road " for one crossing” the river. </note> <pb n="106"/>

          <p>The Greeks enter the territory of the Carduchi, where they suffer greatly <lb/>
            from the wind and cold, as well as from the Barbarians, who harass them <lb/>
            with frequent attacks on their march.</p>
          <p>1. WHAT occurred in the expedition up the country to the <lb/>
            time of the battle, and what took place after the battle during <lb/>
            the truce which the king and the Greeks that went up with <lb/>
            Cyrus concluded, and what hostilities were committed against <lb/>
            the Greeks after the king and Tissaphernes had violated the <lb/>
            truce, and while the Persian army was pursuing them, have <lb/>
            been related in the preceding part of the narrative.</p>
          <p>2. When they had arrived at a spot where the Tigris was <lb/>
            quite impassable from its depth and width, and where there <lb/>
            was no passage along its banks, as the Carduchian mountains <lb/>
            hung steep over the stream, it appeared to the generals that <lb/>
            they must march over those mountains, 3. for they had heard <lb/>
            from the prisoners that " if they could but cross the Carduchian <lb/>
            mountains, they would be able to ford, if they wished, the <lb/>
            sources of the Tigris in Armenia, or, if they declined doing <lb/>
            so, to make a circuit round them." The sources of the Eu <lb/>
            phrates, too, they said were not far from those of the Tigris, <lb/>
            and such is the truth.1</p>
          <p>4. Their entrance upon the territory of the Carduchi they <lb/>
            made in the following manner, endeavouring at once to escape <lb/>
            observation, and to anticipate the enemy in getting pos­ <lb/>
            session of the heights. 5. When it was about the last watch, <lb/>
            and enough of the night was left to allow them to cross the <lb/>
            plain under cover of the darkness, they arose at a given sig­ <lb/>
            nal, and, marching onwards, reached the hills by break of <lb/>
            day. 6. Here Cheirisophus took the lead of the army, having <lb/>
            with him both his own men and all the light-armed; while <lb/>
            Xenophon brought up the rear with the heavy-armed troops, <lb/>
            having not a single light-armed soldier; for there seemed to <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καὶ ἕστιν οὕτως ἕχον</foreign>.] A most happy emendation of Abreschius, <lb/>

            be no danger that any of the enemy would attack them in the <lb/>
            rear as they were marching up the mountains. Cheirisophus <lb/>
            indeed mounted the summit before any of the enemy perceived <lb/>
            him ; he then led slowly forward ; 7. and each portion of the <lb/>
            army, as it passed the summit in succession, followed him to the <lb/>
            villages which lay in the windings and recesses of the moun­ <lb/>
            tains.l 8. The Carduchi, in consequence, quitting their dwell­ <lb/>
            ings, and taking with them their wives and children, fled to <lb/>
            the hills. There was plenty of provisions left for the Greeks <lb/>
            to take ; and the houses were furnished with great numbers <lb/>
            of brazen utensils, none of which the Greeks took away. Nor <lb/>
            did they pursue the people, being inclined to spare them, if <lb/>
            perchance the Carduchi, since they were enemies to the king, <lb/>
            might consent to allow them to pass through their country as <lb/>
            that of friends ; 9. the provisions, however, as many as fell in <lb/>
            their way, they carried off; for it was a matter of necessity <lb/>
            to do so. But as for the Carduchi themselves, they would <lb/>
            neither listen when they called, nor did they give any other <lb/>
            sign of friendly feeling.</p>
          <p>10. But when the rear of the Greeks was descending from <lb/>
            the hills into the villages, being now overtaken by darkness, <lb/>
            (for, as the way was narrow, their ascent of the heights, and <lb/>
            descent to the villages, had lasted the entire day,) some of <lb/>
            the Carduchi, collecting together, attacked the hindmost, and <lb/>
            killed and wounded some of them with stones and arrows. <lb/>
            They were but few; for the Greek troops had come on them <lb/>
            unawares; 11. but had they assembled in greater numbers, a <lb/>
            great part of the army would have been in danger of being <lb/>
            destroyed. For this night, accordingly, they took up their <lb/>
            abode in the villages ; and the Carduchi lighted a number of <lb/>
            fires around them on the hills, and observed the positions of <lb/>
            one another.2 12. As soon as it was day, the generals and <note type="footnote"> “ Thus they accomplished their entrance into Kurdistan with <lb/>

            captains of the Greeks, meeting together, resolved, when they <lb/>
            should march, to reserve only such of the baggage-cattle as <lb/>
            were most necessary and most able, abandoning the rest, and <lb/>
            to dismiss all the slaves in the army that had been recently <lb/>
            captured ; 13. for the cattle and the slaves, being numerous, <lb/>
            rendered their progress slow, and the number of men in charge <lb/>
            of them were unable to take part in any encounter; and be­ <lb/>
            sides, when the men were so numerous, it was necessary to <lb/>
            procure and carry with them a double quantity of provisions. <lb/>
            This resolution being passed, they made proclamation that the <lb/>
            troops should act accordingly.</p>
          <p>14. When they had breakfasted, and were on the march, <lb/>
            the generals, taking their stand in a narrow part of the way, <lb/>
            took from the soldiers whatever of the things mentioned they <lb/>
            found had not been left behind; and the men submitted to this, <lb/>
            unless any of them, smitten with desire of a handsome boy or <lb/>
            woman, conveyed them past sceretly.1 Thus they proceeded <lb/>
            during this day, sometimes having to fight a little, and some­ <lb/>
            times resting themselves. 15. On the next day a great storm <lb/>
            arose ; but they were obliged to pursue their march, for they <lb/>
            had not a sufficient supply of provisions. Cheirisophus con­ <lb/>
            tinued to lead, and Xenophon had charge of the rear. 16. <lb/>
            The enemy pressed steadily upon them, and, where the passes <lb/>
            were narrow, came close up, and used their lows and their <lb/>
            slings; so that the Greeks, sometimes pursuing and some­ <lb/>
            times retreating, were compelled to march but slowly; and <lb/>
            Xenophon, when the enemy attacked them violently, had fre­ <lb/>
            quently to pass the word for a halt. 17. Cheirisophus, at <lb/>
            other times, when the order was passed, halted, but on one <lb/>
            occasion he did not halt, but hurried on rapidly, and passed <lb/>
            the word to follow; so that it was manifest that there was some­ <lb/>
            thing extraordinary; but there was no time to go forward <lb/>
            and ascertain the cause of the haste; and the march of the <lb/>
            rear-guard became like a flight, 18. On this occasion a brave <lb/>
            soldier, Cleonymus a Lacedæmonian, met his death, being shot <lb/>
            with an arrow in the side through his shield and corslet ; 2 and <lb/>
            also Basias, an Arcadian, shot right through the head.</p>

            phon immediately proceeded, just as he was, to Cheirisophus, <lb/>
            and blamed him for not haying halted, as the men had been <lb/>
            compelled to flee and fight at the same time. " Two honour­ <lb/>
            able and brave soldiers," said he, “ have now been killed, and <lb/>
            we have been unable either to carry off their bodies or bury <lb/>
            them." 20. To this remark Cheirisophus answered, " Cast <lb/>
            your eyes upon those mountains, and observe how impassable <lb/>
            they all are. The only road which you see is steep; and <lb/>
            close upon it you may perceive a great multitude of men, who, <lb/>
            having occupied the pass, keep guard at it. 21. For these <lb/>
            reasons I hastened on, and therefore did not wait for you, to <lb/>
            try if I could get the start of the enemy before the pass was <lb/>
            seized ; and the guides whom we have say that there is no other <lb/>
            road.” 22. Xenophon rejoined, “ I have two prisoners; for <lb/>
            when the enemy molested us, we placed an ambush, which <lb/>
            enabled us to recover breath, and killed some of them; and <lb/>
            we were also anxious to take some alive for this very purpose, <lb/>
            that we might use them, as being well acquainted with the <lb/>
            country, for guides."</p>
          <p>23. Immediately after, bringing forward the two men, they <lb/>
            inquired of them separately whether they knew of any other <lb/>
            road than that which was open to their view. The one denied <lb/>
            that he knew of any other, though many threats were held out <lb/>
            to him ; and as he would give no useful information, he was put <lb/>
            to death in sight of the other. 24. The survivor said that the <lb/>
            other had denied any knowledge of a road, because he had a <lb/>
            daughter there married to somebody, but stated that he him­ <lb/>
            self would lead them by a road that might be passed even by <lb/>
            beasts of burden. 25. Being then asked if there was any spot <lb/>
            in it difficult to be passed, he replied that there was one height, <lb/>
            and that unless a party secured it before-hand, it would be im­ <lb/>
            possible for them to pass. 26. Upon this it was thought proper <lb/>
            to call together the captains, both of the peltasts and of the <lb/>
            heavy-armed men,1 and to acquaint them with the prospect of <lb/>
            affairs, and ask whether any of them was willing to prove <lb/>
            himself a man of valour, and engage to go on this service as a <lb/>
            volunteer. 27. Of the heavy-armed, Aristonymus of Methy­ <lb/>

            disputed the honour with them, and said that he himself was <lb/>

            “ for I am sure,” said lie, “ that many of the yonng men will <lb/>

            officers of the light-armed troops were willing to join in the <lb/>
            attempt; and Aristeas of Chios presented himself, a man <lb/>
            who had often proved himself of great value to the army for <lb/>
            similar services.</p>

          <p>One of the prisoners is forced to guide them to an eminence, from which <lb/>
            they dislodge the Carduchi. But they are still harassed, and the rear <lb/>
            suffers severely.</p>
          <p>1. IT was now afternoon, and the generals1 desired the <lb/>
            party to take some refreshment and set forward. Hav­ <lb/>
            ing bound the guide, they put him into their hands, and <lb/>
            arranged with them, that, if they should gain the summit, <lb/>
            they should keep guard at that post during the night, and give <lb/>
            a signal by trumpet at break of day, and that those on the <lb/>
            height should then charge the enemy in possession of the <lb/>
            apparent egress,2 and those below should issue forth and come <lb/>
            n a body to their assistance as soon as they were able.</p>
          <p>2. When they had made this arrangement, the party set <lb/>
            ut, being in number about two thousand; and there was <lb/>
            heavy rain at the time. Xenophon, taking the rear-guard, <lb/>
            led them towards the apparent egress, in order that the enemy <lb/>
            might turn their attention in that direction, and that those <lb/>
            who were going round might as much as possible escape no­ <lb/>
            tice. 3. But when the rear-guard came to a ravine, which <lb/>
            they had to pass to gain the ascent, the Barbarians then rolled <lb/>
            down masses of rock,3 each big enough to load a waggon, with <note type="footnote"> I Xenophon and Cheirisophus. Kühner. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὴν φανερὰν ἕκασιν</foreign>.] Xenophon calls the passage to the top of <lb/>

            other stones greater and smaller, which, striking in their de­ <lb/>
            scent against the rocks, were hurled abroad in all directions ; 1 <lb/>
            and it was utterly impossible even to approach the pass. 4. <lb/>
            Some of the captains, whan they could not succeed in this <lb/>
            part, made attempts in another, and continued their efforts <lb/>
            till darkness came on. When they thought that they might <lb/>
            retire unobserved, they went to get their supper ; for the <lb/>
            rear-guard had been dinnerless that day. The enemy, how­ <lb/>
            ever, being evidently in fear, continued to roll down stones <lb/>
            through the whole of the night, as it was easy to conjecture <lb/>
            from the noise. 5. Those, meanwhile, who had the guide, <lb/>
            taking a circuitous route, surprised a guard of the enemy <lb/>
            sitting round a fire, and, having killed some of them, and put <lb/>
            the rest to flight, remained on the spot, with the notion that <lb/>
            they were in possession of the summit. 6. But in possession <lb/>
            of it they were not; for there was a small hill above them, <lb/>
            round which lay the narrow pass, at which the guard had <lb/>
            been posted. However, there was a way from thence to that <lb/>
            party of the enemy who were stationed at the open egress. 7. <lb/>
            Here they remained during the night.</p>
          <p>As soon as day began to dawn, they advanced in regular <lb/>
            order, and with silence, against the enemy; and as there was <lb/>
            a mist, they came close upon them before they were per­ <lb/>
            ceived. But when they caught sight of one another, the <lb/>
            trumpet sounded on the side of the Greeks, who, raising the <lb/>
            shout of battle, rushed upon the enemy. The Barbarians did <lb/>
            not stand their charge, but quitted the pass and fled ; only a <lb/>
            few of them were killed, for they were active in moving off. <lb/>
            8. At the same time the party of Cheirisophus, hearing the <lb/>
            sound of the trumpet, marched immediately up the plain <lb/>
            track; while others of the officers proceeded by untrodden <lb/>
            paths, where each happened to be, and, climbing up as well <lb/>
            as they could, drew up one another with their spears; 9. and <lb/>
            these were the first to join those who had secured the position. <lb/>
            Xenophon, with the half. of the rear-guard, went up by the <note type="footnote"> perly a round stone fit for rolling, or a stone that has been made round <lb/>
            by rolling, as a pebble in the sea. It was originally an adjective, <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέτρος</foreign> understood. Most critics suppose it to be from <foreign xml:lang="grc">όλος</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρέχω</foreign>, totus teres atque rotundus. Liddell and Scott derive it from <lb/>

             <pb n="112"/>
            same way as those who had the guide ; for it was the most <lb/>
            practicable for the baggage-cattle ; the other half he ordered to <lb/>
            come up behind the cattle. to. In their way they came to a hill <lb/>
            overhanging the road, which was occupied by the enemy, <lb/>
            whom they must either dislodge or be separated from the rest <lb/>
            of the Greeks. The men themselves, indeed, might have gone <lb/>
            the same way as the rest of the army, but the baggage-cattle <lb/>
            could ascend by no other route than this. 11. Encouraging <lb/>
            one another, therefore, they made an attack upon the hill in <lb/>
            files,1 not on every side, but leaving a way of escape for the <lb/>
            enemy, if they should be inclined to flee. 12. For a while, <lb/>
            as they were making their way as each best could, the Bar­ <lb/>
            barians shot arrows and threw stones at them, but did not <lb/>
            receive them in close encounter, and at last abandoned the <lb/>
            place entirely.</p>
          <p>The Greeks had no sooner passed the hill, than they caught <lb/>
            sight of another before them occupied also by the enemy. <lb/>
            Upon this hill it was resolved likewise to make an assault. <lb/>
            13. But Xenophon, apprehending that, if he left the hill <lb/>
            which they had taken unguarded, the enemy, recovering it, <lb/>
            might attack the baggage-cattle as they were passing, (for the <lb/>
            train of baggage-cattle reached a great distance, as they were <lb/>
            marching along a narrow path,) left upon the hill the captains <lb/>
            Cephisodorus the son of Cephisophon, an Athenian, Amphi­ <lb/>
            crates the son of Amphidemus, an Athenian, and Archagoras, <lb/>
            an exile from Argos, while he himself, with the others, directed <lb/>
            his march upon the second hill, which they also captured in <lb/>
            similar manner. 14. However, there was still a third hill left <lb/>
            for them to take, which was by far the steepest of the whole; <lb/>
            this was an eminence that overhung the post where the guard <lb/>
            was surprised in the night by the volunteers. 15. Bit as the <lb/>
            Greeks came up, the Barbarians deserted the hill without <lb/>
            attempting any defence, so that all were surprised, and sus­ <lb/>
            pected that they had left their position from fear of being sur­ <lb/>
            rounded and besieged in it. But the truth was, that having ob- <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ορϑίοις τοι̃ς λόχοις</foreign>] Eae h <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοχος</foreign> or company marching in file <lb/>

            served from the eminence what had passed behind, they all <lb/>
            went off with the intention of attacking the rear.</p>
          <p>16. Xenophon, with the youngest of his men, ascended to <lb/>
            the top, and ordered the rest to march on slowly, so that the <lb/>
            companies in the rear might join them ; and he directed them, <lb/>
            after proceeding some distance, to halt under arms, on a level <lb/>
            piece of ground. 17. At this juncture Aristagoras the Argive <lb/>
            came fleeing from the enemy, and said that the Greeks were <lb/>
            driven from the first hill, and that Cephisodorus, and Amphi­ <lb/>
            erates, and all the rest, who had not leaped from the rock, and <lb/>
            joined the rear-guard, had been killed. 18. The Barbarians, <lb/>
            after this success, appeared upon an eminence opposite the <lb/>
            third hill, and Xenophon began to treat with them, through <lb/>
            an interpreter, about making a twice, and called upon them <lb/>
            to give up the dead. 19. They replied, that they would give <lb/>
            them up on condition that he would not burn their villages. <lb/>
            To this Xenophon agreed. But while the rest of the army <lb/>
            was passing on, and these were discussing the terms of a <lb/>
            truce, all the Barbarians from that part of the country had <lb/>
            flocked together. Here the enemy made a stand; 20. and <lb/>
            when Xenophon's party began to descend the hill, to join the <lb/>
            others where the heavy-armed troops were drawn up,1 they <lb/>
            came forward in great numbers and with loud shouts. When <lb/>
            they had reached the top of the hill from which Xenophon <lb/>
            was descending, they rolled down stones, and broke the leg <lb/>
            of one man ; and Xenophon's shield-bearer deserted him, <lb/>
            carrying off his shield, 21. but Eurylochus, an Arcadian from <lb/>
            Lusia,2 a heavy-armed soldier, ran to his support, and went <lb/>
            on holding his shield before them both ; and the rest went to <lb/>
            join those who were already drawn up.</p>
          <p>22. The entire Grecian force was now together, and took <lb/>
            up their quarters in a number of good houses, and in the <lb/>
            midst of abundance of provisions. Wine was so abundant, <lb/>
            that they kept it in excavations under ground, which were <lb/>
            plastered over.3 23. Xenophon and Cheirisophus now made <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰ ὅπλα ἔκειντο</foreign>.] See sect. 16. The heavy-armed men had <lb/>

            an agreement with the enemy, that on receiving the dead <lb/>
            bodies they should give up the guide; and they performed all <lb/>
            funeral rites for the deceased, as far as they could, according <lb/>
            to what is usually done at the interment of brave men. <lb/>
            24. The next day they proceeded without a guide; and the <lb/>
            enemy, sometimes by skirmishing, and sometimes, where there <lb/>
            was a narrow pass, by pre-occupying it, endeavoured to <lb/>
            obstruct their progress. 25. Whenever therefore they im­ <lb/>
            peded the front, Xenophon, ascending the hills from the rear, <lb/>
            endeavoured to break through the opposition made in that <lb/>
            quarter, trying always to reach higher ground than the ob­ <lb/>
            structing enemy; 26. and when they assailed the rear, Chei­ <lb/>
            risophus, quitting his place, and striving also to get above <lb/>
            the enemy, removed the obstruction that was offered to the <lb/>
            passage of that part of the army. Thus they relieved and <lb/>
            supported each other with effect. 27. Sometimes, too, when <lb/>
            the Greeks had ascended eminences, the Barbarians gave <lb/>
            them great annoyance in their descent; and, as they were <lb/>
            nimble, they could escape, though they had but a very short <lb/>
            start of us ;1 for they were encumbered with no other weapons <lb/>
            than bows and slings. 28. As archers they were very expert, <lb/>
            and had bows nearly three cubits long, and arrows above two <lb/>
            cubits ; and they drew the string, whenever they discharged <lb/>
            their arrows, advancing the left foot 2 against the lower ex­ <lb/>
            tremity of the bow. Their arrows penetrated through shields <note type="footnote"> and, covering them over with plaster, laid up their wine and oil in <lb/>
            them; they called them <foreign xml:lang="grc">λάκκοι</foreign>. Schol. ad Aristoph. Eccl., cited by <lb/>

          <p>The Greeks arrive at the river Centrites, which divides the Carduchi from <lb/>
            Armenia. They see the Persians drawn up on the opposite bank, while <lb/>
            the Carduchi threaten their rear. They are encouraged by a dream of <lb/>
            Xenophon's to try a ford, and effect a safe passage across the stream.</p>
          <p>I. THIS day the Greeks abode in the villages above the <lb/>
            plain near the river Centrites, the breadth of which is about <lb/>
            two hundred feet, and which forms the boundary between <lb/>
            Armenia and the territory of the Carduchi. Here they took <lb/>
            some rest, being glad to see a piece of level country. The <lb/>
            river is distant from the mountains of the Carduchi about six <lb/>
            or seven stadia. 2. It was with great satisfaction that they <lb/>
            stayed here, as they had a sufficiency of provisions, and were <lb/>
            frequently reflecting on the difficulties that were past, for, <lb/>
            during seven days that they had been marching among the <lb/>
            Carduchi, they had been constantly fighting, and had suffered <lb/>

          <p>3. At day-break, however, they perceived on the other side <lb/>
            of the river a body of cavalry, in complete armour, ready to <lb/>
            prevent them from crossing, and on the high banks above the <lb/>
            cavalry, another of foot prepared to hinder them from enter­ <lb/>
            ing Armenia. 4. These were Armenians, Mardians, and <lb/>
            Chaldæans, mercenary troops of Orontes and Artuchas.2 <lb/>
            The Chaldæans were said to be a free people, and warlike; <lb/>
            for arms they had long shields and spears. 5. The high <lb/>
            banks on which these forces were drawn up, were three or <lb/>
            four hundred feet from the river; and the only road that was <lb/>
            visible was one that led upward, apparently a work of art. <lb/>
            Here the Greeks endeavoured to cross, 6. but as, on making <lb/>
            trial, the water rose above their breasts, and the bed of the <lb/>
            river was rough with large and slippery stones, and as it was <lb/>
            impossible for them to carry their arms in the water, or, if <lb/>
            they attempted to do so, the river swept them away, (while, <lb/>
            if any of them took their arms on their heads, they became <lb/>
            exposed to the arrows and other missiles of the enemy,) they <lb/>
            in consequence retreated, and encamped at the side of the <lb/>
            river.</p>
          <p>7. They now perceived the Carduchi assembled in great <lb/>
            numbers under arms on the spot where they themselves had <note type="footnote"> I Yet "the Carduchian mountains," observes Rennell, "in effect <lb/>
            presented an asylum to the Greeks, who could no other way have <lb/>
            escaped, at least, the re'terated attacks of such a host of enemies, <lb/>
            whose numbers also were augmenting instead of diminishing <lb/>
            But as a Persian army could not subsist, or their cavalry act, with <lb/>
            in the wide range of these mountains, the Greeks, by ascending <lb/>
            them, got rid of their dreaded enemy. And although, in the mean <lb/>
            time, they had to contend with an enemy milch more brave and <lb/>
            persevering, their numbers were fewer, and they might reasonably <lb/>
            expect an earlier escape from them than from the Persians. Had <lb/>
            they known that the Tigris was fordable under the Zaco hills, and <lb/>
            passed into Mesopotamia, they would still have had the Euphrates <lb/>
            to cross, a yet more difficult river, in the line which they must have <lb/>
            pursued. Therefore, according to our limited view of things, it <lb/>
            appears that nothing less than such a barrier as these mountains <lb/>

            been on the previous night. Hence great despondency was <lb/>
            felt by the Greeks, as they knew the difficulty of passing <lb/>
            the river, and saw the Carduchi ready to attack them if they <lb/>
            attempted to cross. 8. This day, therefore, and the following <lb/>
            night, they remained where they were in great perplexity. <lb/>
            Xenophon however had a dream; he thought that he was <lb/>
            bound in fetters, but that they fell off him of their own <lb/>
            accord, so that he was set at liberty, and walked securely1 <lb/>
            whithersoever he pleased. 9. When the morning approached, <lb/>
            he went to Cheirisophus, told him that he had hopes that all <lb/>
            would be well, and related to him his dream. Cheirisophus <lb/>
            was much pleased, and, as soon as it was day, all the general:; <lb/>
            who were present offered sacrifice, and the victims were <lb/>
            favourable at the very first. As soon as they left the place of <lb/>
            sacrifice, the generals and captains gave directions to the <lb/>
            troops to take their breakfast.</p>
          <p>10. While Xenophon was at breakfast, two young men <lb/>
            came running up to him, for every one knew that it was <lb/>
            allowable to approach him whether breakfasting or supping, <lb/>
            and to wake him and speak to him even when asleep, if they <lb/>
            had anything to tell of affairs relating to the war. 11. The <lb/>
            youths informed him that they had been gathering sticks for <lb/>
            their fire, and had chanced to see, on the opposite side of the <lb/>
            river, among the rocks that reached down to the stream itself, <lb/>
            an old man, a woman, and some girls, depositing in a cavern­ <lb/>
            ous rock what appeared to be bags of clothes ; 12. that when <lb/>
            they saw this, they thought it would be safe to cross, as the <lb/>
            ground at that point was inaccessible to the enemy's horse ; <lb/>
            that having taken off their clothes, and taken their daggers in <lb/>
            their hands, they went over undressed, in expectation of hav­ <lb/>
            ing to swim, but that, as they went on, they reached the other <lb/>
            side before they were wet to the middle, and, having thus <lb/>
            forded the stream, and taken the clothes, they came back <lb/>
            again. 13. Xenophon immediately therefore made a libation, <lb/>
            and ordered the young men to join in it,2 and to pray to the <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διααίνειν</foreign>.] " Ingredi, pedem proferre." Kühner. His fetters <lb/>
            being removed, he was able to put his legs apart, and walk with <lb/>

            tion, he at once conducted the youths to Cheirisophus, and <lb/>
            to him they gave the same account. Cheirisophus, on hear­ <lb/>
            ing it, made a libation also.</p>
          <p>14. When the libation was over, they gave orders to the <lb/>
            soldiers to get their baggage ready ; while they themselves. <lb/>
            calling the rest of the generals together, consulted with them <lb/>
            how they might cross the river to the best advantage, and how <lb/>
            they might defeat the enemy in front, and suffer no damage <lb/>
            from those in the rear. 15. It was then resolved that Cheiri­ <lb/>
            sophus should take the lead, and cross over with half of the <lb/>
            army, that the other half should stay behind with Xenophon, <lb/>
            and that the baggage-cattle and camp-followers should go <lb/>
            over between the two. 16. When these matters were fairly <lb/>
            arranged, they began to move, the young men acting as <lb/>
            guides, and keeping the river on the left, the distance to the <lb/>
            ford being about four stadia. 17. As they proceeded, the <lb/>
            lines of the enemy's cavalry advanced abreast of them on the <lb/>
            opposite bank; and when they came to the ford, and the mar­ <lb/>
            gin of the river, they halted, laying down their arms; and <lb/>
            then Cheirisophus himself, placing a chaplet upon his head,1 <lb/>
            and laying aside his outer garments, took up his arms and <lb/>
            commanded the rest to follow his example, directing the cap­ <lb/>

            sacrifices appeared favourable, all the soldiers sung the pæan <lb/>
            and raised a shout, and all the women (for there were a number <lb/>

            Xenophon, taking the most active of the rear-guard, marched <lb/>
            at full speed back to the ford1 opposite the outlet into the <lb/>
            mountains of Armenia, making a feint that he meant to cross <lb/>
            the river there, and thus cut off the cavalry that were on the <lb/>
            bank ; 21. when the enemy, seeing Cheirisophus and his men <lb/>
            crossing over with ease, and Xenophon and his party hurry­ <lb/>
            ing back, were afraid of being intercepted, and fled with pre­ <lb/>
            cipitation to gain the outlet that led up from the river, and as <lb/>
            soon as they came to that passage, they directed their course <lb/>
            up into the mountains. 22. Lycius, who had the command of <lb/>
            the troop of horse, and AEschines, who commanded the band of <lb/>
            peltasts attending on Cheirisophus, seeing the enemy retreat­ <lb/>
            ing with so much haste, set off in pursuit of them ; and the <lb/>
            rest of the soldiers called to each other not to stay behind,2 <lb/>
            but to go along with them up the mountains. 23. But Cheiri­ <lb/>
            sophus, when he had crossed the river, did not follow the <lb/>
            cavalry, but made his way up the high banks that reached <lb/>
            down to the river, to attack that portion of the enemy that <lb/>
            were on the more elevated ground.3 This party on the <lb/>
            heights, however, seeing their cavalry take to flight, aban­ <lb/>
            doned their commanding position above the stream.</p>
          <p>24. Xenophon, when lie saw that all was going well on the <lb/>
            other side, returned with all possible speed to join that part of <lb/>
            the army which was crossing over; for the Carduchi were <lb/>
            evidently descending into the plain, with the view of falling <lb/>
            upon the rear. 25. Cheirisophus was now in possession of <lb/>
            the heights, and Lycius, who, with his small party, had pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded in pursuit of the enemy, had captured some of their <lb/>
            baggage that they had left behind, and amongst it some rich <lb/>
            garments and drinking-eups. 26. The baggage and camp- <lb/>
            followers of the Greeks were still in the act of crossing; and <lb/>
            Xenophon, turning towards the Carduchi, halted under arms <lb/>
            over against them, and ordered the captains to form each his <lb/>
            own company into divisions of five and twenty men, bringing <lb/>
            round each division in line towards the left; and he directed <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸν πόρον</foreign>.] The ford mentioned in sect. 5,6. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Behind the enemy. Khüner. Or behind the cavalry that were <lb/>

          <p>27. The Carduchi, when they observed that the rear-guard <lb/>
            of the camp-followers was diminished in number, and that <lb/>
            they seemed now indeed to be but few, advanced at a quicker <lb/>
            pace, singing at the same time certain songs. Cheirisophus, <lb/>
            when he saw that all was safe on his own side, sent the pel­ <lb/>
            tasts, and the slingers and archers, to Xenophon, desiring <lb/>
            them to do whatsoever he should direct. 28. Xenophon, see­ <lb/>
            ing them beginning to cross, sent a messenger to desire that <lb/>
            they should remain by the river where they were, without <lb/>
            crossing, and that, when his own party should begin to cross, <lb/>
            they should come forward into the water on each side opposite to <lb/>
            him, the javelin-men holding their weapons by the thong,1 <lb/>
            and the archers with their arrows on the string, as if with <lb/>
            the intention of crossing over, but not to advance far into the <lb/>
            river. 29. His own men lie ordered, as soon as a sling should <lb/>
            reach them and a shield should ring,2 to raise the pæan and <lb/>
            rush towards the enemy; and he directed that when the <lb/>
            enemy should take to flight, and the trumpeter should sound <lb/>
            the signal of attack3 from the river, the rear should wheel to <lb/>
            the right and take the lead, and that they should then all run <lb/>
            forward as fast as possible, and cross over at the part where <lb/>
            each happened to be stationed, so as not to impede one <lb/>
            another; telling them that he would be the best man who <lb/>
            should first reach the opposite side. 30. The Carduchi, see- . <lb/>

            the Barbarians did not stand their charge; for though they <lb/>

          <p>1. WHEN they had crossed, and had ranged themselves in <lb/>
            order about noon, they proceeded through the country of At,­ <lb/>
            menia, consisting wholly of plains and gently sloping hills, a <lb/>
            distance of not less than five parasangs ;for there were no <lb/>
            villages near the river, in consequence of the hostilities with <lb/>
            the Carduchi. 2. The village, however, at which they at <lb/>
            length arrived, was of considerable size, and contained a palace <lb/>
            for the satrap ;1 upon most of the houses there were towers, <lb/>
            and provisions were in great plenty.</p>
          <p>3. Hence they proceeded, two days' journey, a distance of <lb/>
            ten parasangs, until they passed round the sources of the river <lb/>
            Tigris. From hence they advanced, three days' journey, fif- <note type="footnote"> 1Orontes: iii. 5. 17; 4. 3, 4. lie was the satrap, as Krüger <lb/>

            deed, but of much beauty ; and there were many villages on <lb/>
            its banks, 4. This part of the country was called Western <lb/>
            Armenia. The deputy-governor of it was Tiribazus, who was <lb/>
            an intimate friend of the king ; and no one else, when he was <lb/>
            present, assisted the king to mount his horse. 5. He now <lb/>
            rode up with a body of cavalry, and sending forward an inter­ <lb/>
            preter, said that he wished to speak with the commanders. <lb/>
            The generals thought proper to hear what he had to say, and, <lb/>
            advancing within hearing, asked what he wanted. 6. He re­ <lb/>
            plied, that he wished to make a treaty with them, on the con­ <lb/>
            ditions that he himself should not hurt the Greeks, and that <lb/>
            the Greeks should not burn the houses, but should be at <lb/>
            liberty to take such provisions as they required. This pro­ <lb/>
            posal was agreeable to the generals, and they concluded a <lb/>
            treaty upon these terms.</p>
          <p>7. Hence they proceeded, three days' march, a distance of <lb/>
            fifteen parasangs, through a plain; and Tiribazus followed <lb/>
            them with his troops, keeping at the distance of about ten <lb/>
            stadia. They then came to a palace,3 with several villages <lb/>
            around it stored with abundance of provisions. 8. While <lb/>
            they were encamped, there fell a great quantity of snow4 in <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τύρσεις</foreign>.] Apparently intended for a sort of defences, should the <lb/>

            The generals thought it unsafe, therefore, for the troops to <lb/>
            quarter apart, and resolved to bring the whole army together <lb/>
            again. They accordingly assembled, for it seemed to be clear­ <lb/>
            ing up.2 11. But as they were passing the night here, there <lb/>
            fell a vast quantity of snow, so that it covered both the arms <lb/>
            and the men as they lay on the ground. The snow cramped <lb/>
            the baggage-cattle, and they were very reluctant to rise ; for, <lb/>
            as they lay, the snow that had fallen upon them served to <lb/>
            keep them warm, when it had not dropped off. 12. But when <lb/>
            Xenophon was hardy enough to rise without his outer gar­ <lb/>

            the villages, under shelter; and the soldiers went off with <lb/>
            great shouting and delight to the cottages and provisions. <lb/>
            Those who had set fire to the houses, when they quitted them <lb/>
            before, paid the penalty of having to encamp uncomfortably in <lb/>
            the open air. 13. Hence they despatched in the night De­ <lb/>
            mocrates of Temenos, giving him a detachment of men, to the <lb/>
            hills where the stragglers said that they had seen the fires ; they <lb/>
            selected him because he was thought on several former occasions <lb/>
            to have brought exact information concerning such matters <lb/>
            reporting what was, just as it appeared, and what was not, a: <lb/>
            not existing. 16. Having gone, he said that he saw no fires, <lb/>
            but he brought with him a captive that he had taken, having <lb/>
            a Persian bow and quiver, and a short battle-axe, such as the <lb/>
            Amazons have. 17. Being asked of what country he was, he <lb/>
            said that he was a Persian, and that he was going from the <lb/>
            army of Tiribazus to get provisions. They then asked him <lb/>
            how large the army was, and for what purpose it was assem­ <lb/>
            bled. IS. He said that Tiribazus had his own troops, and <lb/>
            some mercenaries from the Chalybes and Taochians; and that <lb/>
            he was prepared to attack the Greeks in their passage over <lb/>
            the mountains, at a narrow defile through which lay their <lb/>
            only road.</p>
          <p>19. The generals, on hearing this, resolved to collect the <lb/>
            army, and, leaving a guard, with Sophænetus the Stymphalian <lb/>
            as commander over those who stayed behind, proceeded to <lb/>
            march without delay, taking the man that had been captured <lb/>
            for their guide. 20. After they had passed the mountains, <lb/>
            the peltasts, who went before the rest, and were the first to <lb/>
            discover the enemy's camp, did not wait for the heavy-armed <lb/>
            men, but ran forward with a shout to attack it. 21. The <lb/>
            Barbarians, hearing the noise, did not stand their ground, but <lb/>
            fled; some of them however were killed, and about twenty <lb/>
            horses taken, as was also the tent of Tiribazus, and in it some <lb/>
            couches with silver feet, and drinking-cups, and some prison­ <lb/>
            ers, who said that they were bakers and cup-bearers. 22. <lb/>
            When the officers of the heavy-armed troops heard what had <lb/>
            taken place, they resolved upon marching back as fast as pos­ <lb/>
            sible to their own camp, lest any attempt should be made on <lb/>
            those who had been left there. Calling in the men immedi­ <lb/>

          <p>The Greeks march through an uninhabited tract of country, suffering great­ <lb/>
            ly from cold winds, snow, and want of provisions. At length they reach <lb/>
            some well-stored villages, where they rest seven days.</p>
          <p>I. THE next day it was thought necessary to march away <lb/>
            as fast as possible, before the enemy's force should be re­ <lb/>
            assembled, and get possession of the pass. Collecting their <lb/>
            baggage at once, therefore, they set forward through a deep <lb/>
            snow, taking with them several guides ; and, having the same <lb/>
            day passed the height on which Tiribazus had intended to at­ <lb/>
            tack them, they encamped. 2. Hence they proceeded three <lb/>
            days'journey through a desert tract of country, a distance of <lb/>
            fifteen parasangs,1 to the river Euphrates, and passed it with­ <lb/>
            out being wet higher than the middle. The sources of the <lb/>
            river were said not to be far off. 3. From hence they ad­ <lb/>
            vanced three days' march, through much snow and a level <lb/>
            plain, a distance of fifteen parasangs; the third day's march <lb/>
            was extremely troublesome, as the north-wind blew full in <lb/>
            their faces, completely parching up everything and benumb­ <lb/>
            ing the men. 4. One of the augurs, in consequence, advised <lb/>
            that they should sacrifice to the wind ;and a sacrifice was <lb/>
            accordingly offered; when the vehemence of the wind ap­ <lb/>
            peared to every one manifestly to abate. The depth of the <lb/>
            snow was a fathom ;2 so that many of the baggage-cattle and <lb/>
            slaves perished, with about thirty of the soldiers. 5. They <lb/>
            continued to burn fires through the whole night, for there <lb/>
            was plenty of wood at the place of encampment. But those <lb/>
            who came up late could get no wood; those therefore who <lb/>
            had arrived before, and had kindled fires, would not admit <lb/>
            the late comers to the fire unless they gave them a share of <lb/>
            the corn or other provisions that they had brought. 6. Thus <lb/>
            they shared with each other what they respectively had. In <lb/>
            the places where the fires were made, as the snow melted, <note type="footnote"> I Rennell, p. 214, and Kinneir, p. 485, think this distance too great <lb/>

            there were formed large pits that reached down to the ground; <lb/>
            and here there was accordingly opportunity to measure the <lb/>
            depth of the snow.</p>
          <p>7. From hence they marched through snow the whole of <lb/>
            the following day, and many of the men contracted the buli­ <lb/>
            mia.1 Xenophon, who commanded in the rear, finding in his <lb/>
            way such of the men as had fallen down with it, knew not <lb/>
            what disease it was. 8. But as one of those acquainted with <lb/>
            it, told him that they were evidently affected with bulimia, <lb/>
            and that they would get up if they had something to eat, he <lb/>
            went round among the baggage, and, wherever he saw any­ <lb/>
            thing eatable, he gave it out, and sent such as were able to <lb/>
            run to distribute it among those diseased, who, as soon as they <lb/>
            had eaten, rose up and continued their march. 9. As they <lb/>
            proceeded, Cheirisophus came, just as it grew dark, to a vil­ <lb/>
            lage, and found, at a spring in front of the rampart, some <lb/>
            women and girls belonging to the place fetching water. 10. <lb/>
            The women asked them who they were; and the interpreter <lb/>
            answered, in the Persian language, that they were people <lb/>
            going from the king to the satrap. They replied that he was <lb/>
            not there, but about a parasang off. However, as it was late, <lb/>
            they went with the water-carriers within the rampart, to the <lb/>
            head man of the village; 11. and here Cheirisophus, and as <lb/>
            many of the troops as could come up, encamped; but of the <lb/>
            rest, such as were unable to get to the end of the journey, <lb/>
            spent the night on the way without food or fire ; and some of <lb/>
            the soldiers lost their lives on that occasion. 12. Some of the. <lb/>
            enemy too, who had collected themselves into a body, pursued <lb/>
            our rear, and seized any of the baggage-cattle that were un­ <lb/>
            able to proceed, fighting with one another for the possession <lb/>
            of them. Such of the soldiers, also, as had lost their sight <lb/>
            from the effects of the snow, or had had their toes mortified by <lb/>
            the cold, were left behind. 13. It was found to be a relief to <lb/>
            the eyes against the snow, if the soldiers kept something black <lb/>
            before them on the march, and to the feet, if they kept con­ <lb/>
            stantly in motion, and allowed themselves no rest, and if they <note type="footnote"> I ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εβουλιμίασαν</foreign>.] Spelman quotes a description of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλιμία</foreign> or <lb/>

            took off their shoes in the night; 14. but as to such as slept <lb/>
            with their shoes on, the straps worked into their feet, and the <lb/>
            soles were frozen about them; for when their old shoes had <lb/>
            failed them, shoes of raw hides had been made by the men <lb/>
            themselves from the newly-skinned oxen. 15. From such <lb/>
            unavoidable sufferings, some of the soldiers were left behind, <lb/>
            who, seeing a piece of ground of a black appearance, from the <lb/>
            snow having disappeared there, conjectured that it must have <lb/>
            melted; and it had in fact melted in the spot from the effect <lb/>
            of a fountain, which was sending up vapour in a woody hol­ <lb/>
            low close at hand. Turning aside thither, they sat down and <lb/>
            refused to proceed farther. 16. Xenophon, who was with the <lb/>
            rear-guard, as soon as lie heard this, tried to prevail on them <lb/>
            by every art and means not to be left behind, telling them, <lb/>
            at the same time, that the enemy were collected, and pursuing <lb/>
            them in great numbers. At last he grew angry ; and they <lb/>
            told him to kill them, as they were quite unable to go forward. <lb/>
            17. He then thought it the best course to strike a terror, if <lb/>
            possible, into the enemy that were behind, lest they should <lb/>
            fall upon the exhausted soldiers. It was now dark, and the <lb/>
            enemy were advancing with a great noise, quarrelling about <lb/>
            the booty that they had taken; is. when such of the rear- <lb/>
            guard as were not disabled, started up, and rushed towards <lb/>
            them, while the tired men, shouting as loud as they could, <lb/>
            clashed their spears against their shields. The enemy, struck <lb/>
            with alarm, threw themselves among the snow into the <lb/>
            hollow, and no one cf them afterwards made themselves heard <lb/>
            from any quarter.</p>
          <p>19. Xenophon, and those with him, telling the sick men that <lb/>
            a party should come to their relief next day, proceeded on <lb/>
            their march, but before they had gone four stadia, they found <lb/>
            other soldiers resting by the way in the snow, and covered <lb/>
            up with it, no guard being stationed over them. They roused <lb/>
            them up, but they said that the hoad of the army was not <lb/>
            moving forward. 20. Xenophon, going past them, and send­ <lb/>
            ing on some of the ablest of the peltasts, ordered them to ascer­ <lb/>
            tain what it was that hindered their progress. They brought <lb/>
            word that the whole army was in that manner taking rest. <lb/>
            21. Xenophon and his men, therefore, stationing such a guard <lb/>
            as they could, took up their quarters there without fire or <lb/>
            supper. When it was near day, he sent the youngest of his <pb n="128"/>
             <note type="margin">[B IV </note> <lb/>
            men to the sick, telling them to rouse them and oblige them <lb/>
            to proceed. 22. At this juncture Cheirisophus sent some of <lb/>
            his people from the villages to see how the rear were faring. <lb/>
            The young men were rejoiced to see them, and gave them the <lb/>
            sick to conduct to the camp, while they themselves went for <lb/>
            ward, and, before they had gone twenty stadia, found them­ <lb/>
            selves at the village in which Cheirisophus was quartered. <lb/>
            23. When they came together, it was thought safe enough to <lb/>
            lodge the troops up and down in the villages. Cheirisophus <lb/>
            accordingly remained where he was, and the other officers, <lb/>
            appropriating by lot the several villages that they had in sight, <lb/>
            went to their respective quarters with their men.</p>
          <p>24. Here Polycrates, an Athenian captain, requested leave <lb/>
            of absence, and, taking with him the most active of his men, <lb/>
            and hastening to the village which Xenophon had been allot­ <lb/>
            ted, surprised all the villagers, and their head man, in their <lb/>
            houses, together with seventeen I colts that were bred as a <lb/>
            tribute for the king, and the head man’s daughter, who had <lb/>
            been but nine days married ; her husband was gone out to <lb/>
            hunt hares, and was not found in any of the villages. 25. <lb/>
            Their houses were under ground, the entrance like the mouth <lb/>
            of a well, but spacious below ; there were passages dug into <lb/>
            them for the cattle, but the people descended by ladders. In <lb/>
            the houses were goats, sheep, cows, and fowls, with their <lb/>
            young ; all the cattle were kept on fodder within the walls.1 <lb/>
            26. There was also wheat, barley, leguminous vegetables, and <note type="footnote"> I That this number is corrupt is justly suspected by Weiske, and <lb/>

            with it, and a very pleasant drink to those accustomed to it.</p>
          <p>28. Xenophon made the chief man of his village sup with <lb/>
            him, and told him to be of good courage, assuring him that <lb/>
            he should not be deprived of his children, and that they would <lb/>
            not go away without filling his house with provisions in re­ <lb/>

            author of some service to the army till they should reach <lb/>
            another tribe. 29. This lie promised, and, to show his good- <lb/>
            will, pointed out where some wine3 was buried. This <lb/>
            night, therefore, the soldiers rested in their several quarters <lb/>
            in the midst of great abundance, setting a guard over the <lb/>
            chief, and keeping his children at the same time under their <lb/>
            eye. 30. The following day Xenophon took the head man <lb/>
            and went with him to Cheirisophus, and wherever he passed <lb/>
            by a village, he turned aside to visit those who were quarter­ <lb/>
            ed in it, and found them in all parts feasting and enjoying <lb/>
            themselves; nor would they anywhere let them go till they <lb/>

            with plenty of bread both of wheat and barley. 32. When­ <lb/>

            to take whatever he pleased, but he accepted nothing from <lb/>

            ing upon them, to whom they made signs what they were to <lb/>
            do as if they had been deaf and dumb. 34. When Cheiriso­ <lb/>
            phus and Xenophon had saluted one another, they both asked <lb/>
            the chief man, through the interpreter who spoke the Persian <lb/>
            language, what country it was. He replied that it was Ar­ <lb/>
            menia. They then asked him for whom the horses were bred ; <lb/>
            and he said that they were a tribute for the king, and added <lb/>
            that the neighbouring country was that of the Chalybes, and <lb/>
            told them in what direction the road lay. 35. Xenophon then <lb/>
            went away, conducting the chief back to his family, giving <lb/>
            him the horse that he had taken, which was rather old, to fat­ <lb/>
            ten and offer in sacrifice, (for he had heard that it had been <lb/>
            consecrated to the sun,) being afraid, indeed, that it might <lb/>
            die, as it had been injured by the journey. He then took some <lb/>
            of the young horses, and gave one of them to each of the other <lb/>
            generals and captains. 36. The horses in this country were <lb/>
            smaller than those of Persia, but far more spirited. The chief <lb/>
            instructed the men to tie little bags round the feet of the <lb/>
            horses, and other cattle, when they drove them through the <lb/>
            snow, for without such bags they sunk up to their bellies.</p>

            of his family, except his son, a youth just coming to mature <lb/>
            age ; him he gave in charge to Episthenes of Amphipolis, in <lb/>
            order that If the father should conduct them properly, he <lb/>
            might return home with him. At the same time they carried <lb/>
            to his house as many provisions as they could, and then broke <lb/>
            up their camp, and resumed their march. 2. The chief con­ <lb/>
            ducted them through the snow, walking at liberty. When lie <lb/>
            came to the end of the third day's march, Cheirisophus <unclear>was</unclear> <lb/>
            angry at him for not guiding them to some villages. He said <lb/>
            that there were none in that part of the country. Cheiriso­ <lb/>
            phus then struck him, but did not confine him ; 3. and in con­ <lb/>
            sequence he ran off in the night, leaving his son behind him. <lb/>
            This affair, the ill-treatment and neglect of the guide, <lb/>
            was the only cause of dissension between Cheirisophus and <lb/>
            Xenophon during the march. Episthenes conceived an affec­ <lb/>
            tion for the youth, and, taking him home, found him extremely <lb/>
            attached to him.</p>
          <p>4. After this occurrence they proceeded seven days'journey, <lb/>
            five parasangs each day, till they came to the river Phasis,1 <lb/>
            the breadth of which is a plethrum. 5. Hence they advanced <lb/>
            two days' journey, ten parasangs; when, on the pass that led <lb/>
            over the mountains into the plain, the Chalybes, Taochi, and <lb/>
            Phasians were drawn up to oppose their progress. 6. Chei­ <lb/>
            risophus, seeing these enemies in possession of the height, <lb/>
            came to a halt, at the distance of about thirty stadia, that lie <lb/>
            might not approach them while leading the army in a column. <lb/>
            He accordingly ordered the other officers to bring up their <lb/>
            companies, that the whole force might be formed in line.2</p>
          <p>7. When the rear-guard was come up, he called together <lb/>
            the generals and captains, and spoke to them as follows: <lb/>
            " The enemy, as you see, are in possession of the pass over <lb/>
            the mountains ; and it is proper for us to consider how we <lb/>
            may encounter them to the best advantage. 8. It is my <lb/>
            opinion, therefore, that we should direct the troops to get <lb/>
            their dinner, and that we ourselves should hold a council, in <note type="footnote">1 Not the Colchian Phasis, which flows into the Enxine, but a <lb/>

            See Ainsworth, Travels, p. 179, 247. However Xenophon himself <lb/>
            seems to have confounded this Phasis with that of Colchis. See <lb/>

            the mean time, whether it is advisable to cross the mountain <lb/>
            to-day or to-morrow." 9. “ It seems best to me," exclaimed <lb/>
            Cleanor, “ to march at once, as soon as we have dined and <lb/>
            resumed our arms, against the enemy; for if we waste the <lb/>
            present day in inaction, the enemy who are now looking <lb/>
            down upon us will grow bolder, and it is likely that, as <lb/>
            their confidence is increased, others will join them in greater <lb/>
            numbers."</p>
          <p>10. After him Xenophon said, "I am of opinion, that if <lb/>
            it is necessary to fight, we ought to make our arrangements <lb/>
            so as to fight with the greatest advantage ; but that, if we <lb/>
            propose to pass the mountains as easily as possible, we ought <lb/>
            to consider how we may incur the fewest wounds and lose the <lb/>
            fewest men. 11. The range of hills, as far as we see, extends <lb/>
            more than sixty stadia in length; but the people nowhere <lb/>
            seem to be watching us except along the line of road ; and it is <lb/>
            therefore better, I think, to endeavour to try to seize unobserved <lb/>
            some part of the unguarded range, and to get possession of <lb/>
            it, if we can, beforehand, than to attack a strong post and <lb/>
            men prepared to resist us. 12. For it is far less difficult to <lb/>
            march up a steep ascent without fighting than along a level <lb/>
            road with enemies on each side; and, in the night, if men <lb/>
            are not obliged to fight, they can see better what is before <lb/>
            them than by day if engaged with enemies; while a rough <lb/>
            road is easier to the feet to those who are marching without <lb/>
            molestation than a smooth one to those who are pelted on the <lb/>
            head with missiles. 13. Nor do I think it at all impracticable <lb/>
            for us to steal a way for ourselves, as we can march by night, <lb/>
            so as not to be seen, and can keep at such a distance from <lb/>
            the enemy as to allow no possibility of being heard. We <lb/>
            seem likely, too, in my opinion, if we make a pretended <lb/>
            attack on this point, to find the rest of the range still less <lb/>
            guarded; for the enemy will so much the more probably <lb/>
            stay where they are. 14. But why should I speak doubtfully <lb/>
            about stealing ? For I hear that you Lacedæmonians, 0 <lb/>
            Cheirisophus, such of you at least as are of the better <lb/>
            class,1 practise stealing from your boyhood, and it is not a <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̃ν</foreign> <unclear>ὀμoίων</unclear>.] The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅμοιοι</foreign>at Sparta were all those who nad an <lb/>

            dexterity, and strive to escape discovery, it is appointed by <lb/>
            law that, if you are caught stealing, you are scourged. It is <lb/>
            now high time for you, therefore, to give proof of your <lb/>
            education, and to take care that we may not receive many <lb/>
            stripes." 16. “ But I hear that you Athenians also," rejoined <lb/>
            Cheirisophus, "are very clever at stealing the public money, <lb/>
            though great danger threatens him that steals it; and that <lb/>
            your best men steal it most, if indeed your best men are <lb/>
            thought worthy to be your magistrates; so that it is time for <lb/>
            you likewise to give proof of your education." 17. " I am then <lb/>
            ready," exclaimed Xenophon, "to march with the rear-guard, <lb/>
            as soon as we have supped, to take possession of the hills. I <lb/>
            have guides too; for our light-armed men captured some of <lb/>
            the marauders following us by lying in ambush; and from <lb/>
            them I learn that the mountains are not impassable, but are <lb/>
            grazed over by goats and oxen, so that if we once gain <lb/>
            possession of any part of the range, there will be tracks also <lb/>
            for our baggage-cattle. 18. I expect also that the enemy will <lb/>
            no longer keep their ground, when they see us upon a level <lb/>
            with them on the heights, for they will not now come down <lb/>
            to be upon a level with us." 19. Cheirisophus then naid, <lb/>
            "But why should you go, and leave the charge of the <unclear>roar</unclear>? <lb/>
            Rather send others, unless some volunteers present themselves." <lb/>
            20. Upon this Aristonymus of Methydria came forward with <lb/>
            his heavy-armed men, and Aristeas of Chios and Xicomachus <lb/>
            of Œta1 with their light-armed ; and they made an arrange­ <lb/>
            ment, that as soon as they should reach the top, they should <lb/>
            light a number of fires. 21. Having settled these points, they <lb/>
            went to dinner; and after dinner Cheirisophus led forward <lb/>
            the whole army ten stadia towards the enemy, that he might <lb/>
            appear to be fully resolved to march against them on that <lb/>

            and burned a number of fires all night. 23. As soon as it <lb/>
            was day, Cheirisophus, after having offered sacrifice, marched <lb/>
            forward along the road; while those who had gained the <lb/>
            heights advanced by the ridge. 24. Most of the enemy, <lb/>
            meanwhile, stayed at the pass, but a part went to meet the <lb/>
            troops coming along the heights. But before the main bodies <lb/>
            came together, those on the ridge closed with one another, <lb/>
            and the Greeks had the advantage, and put the enemy to <lb/>
            flight. 25. At the same time the Grecian peltasts ran up <lb/>
            from the plain to attack the enemy drawn up to receive them, <lb/>
            and Cheirisophus followed at a quick pace with the heavy- <lb/>
            armed men. 26. The enemy at the pass, however, when they <lb/>
            saw those above defeated, took to flight. Not many of them <lb/>
            were killed, but a great number of shields were taken, which <lb/>
            the Greeks, by hacking them with their swords, rendered <lb/>
            useless. 27. As soon as they had gained the ascent, and had <lb/>
            sacrificed and erected a trophy, they went down into the plain <lb/>
            before them, and arrived at a number of villages stored with <lb/>
            abundance of excellent provisions.</p>

          <p>The Greeks, entering the country of the Taochi, storm a fort, capturing a <lb/>
            great number of cattle, on which they subsist while traversing the region <lb/>
            of the Chalybes. They cross the Harpasus, and, marching through the <lb/>
            territory of the Scythini, arrive at a town called Gymnias, whence they <lb/>
            are conducted to Mount Thechus, from the top of which they see the <lb/>
            Euxine.</p>
          <p>1. FROM hence they marched five days' journey, thirty <lb/>
            parasangs, to the country of the Taochi, where provisions <lb/>
            began to fail them ; for the Taochi inhabited strong fastnesses, <lb/>
            in which they had laid up all their supplies. 2. Having at <lb/>
            length, however, arrived at one place which had no city or <lb/>
            houses attached to it, but in which men and women and a <lb/>
            great number of cattle were assembled, Cheirisophus, as <lb/>
            soon as he came before it, made it the object of an attack i <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            and when the first division that assailed it began to be tired, <lb/>
            another succeeded, and then another; for it was not possible <lb/>
            for them to surround it in a body, as there was a river about <lb/>
            it. 3. When Xenophon came up with his rear-guard, peltasts, <lb/>
            and heavy-armed men, Cheirisophus exclaimed, “ You come <lb/>
            seasonably, for we must take this place, as there are no pro­ <lb/>
            visions for the army, unless we take it."</p>
          <p>4. They then deliberated together, and Xenophon asking <lb/>
            what hindered them from taking the place, Cheirisophus <lb/>
            replied, “ The only approach to it is the one which you see; <lb/>
            but when any of our men attempt to pass along it, the enemy <lb/>
            roll down stones over yonder impending rock, and whoever <lb/>
            is struck, is treated as you behold ;” and he pointed, at the <lb/>
            same moment, to some of the men who had had their legs and <lb/>
            ribs broken. 5. " But if they expend all their stones," re­ <lb/>
            joined Xenophon, " is there anything else to prevent us from <lb/>
            advancing ? For we see, in front of us, only a few men, and <lb/>
            but two or three of them armed. 6. The space, too, through <lb/>
            which we have to pass under exposure to the stones, is, as you <lb/>
            see, only about a hundred and fifty feet in length; and of <lb/>
            this about a hundred feet is covered with large pine trees in <lb/>
            groups, against which if the men place themselves, what <lb/>
            would they suffer either from the flying stones or the rolling <lb/>
            ones? The remaining part of the space is not above fifty <lb/>
            feet, over which, when the stones cease, we must pass at a. <lb/>
            running pace." 7. “But,” said Cheirisophus, "the instant <lb/>
            we offer to go to the part covered with trees, the stones fly in <lb/>
            great numbers." “ That," cried Xenophon, “ would be the <lb/>
            very thing we want, for thus they will exhaust their stones <lb/>
            the sooner. Let us then advance, if we can, to the point <lb/>
            whence we shall have but a short way to run, and from which <lb/>
            we may, if we please, easily retreat."</p>
          <p>8. Cheirisophus and Xenophon, with Callimachus of Par­ <lb/>
            rhasia, one of the captains, who had that day the lead of all <lb/>
            the other captains of the rear-guard, then went forward, all <lb/>
            the rest of the captains remaining out of danger. Next, about <lb/>
            seventy of the men advanced under the trees, not in a body, <lb/>
            but one by one, each sheltering himself as he could. 9. Aga­ <lb/>
            sias of Stymphalus, and Aristonymus of Methydria, who <lb/>
            were also captains of the rear-guard, with some others, were <lb/>
            at the same time standing behind, without the trees for it was <pb n="136"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            not safe for more than one company to stand under them. <lb/>
            10. Callimachus then adopted the following stratagem: he raIl <lb/>
            forward two or three paces from the tree under which he was <lb/>
            sheltered, and when the stones began to be hurled, hastily <lb/>
            drew back; and at each of his sallies more than ten cart­ <lb/>
            loads of stones were spent. 11. Agasias, observing what Cal-. <lb/>
            limachus was doing, and that the eyes of the whole army <lb/>
            were upon him, and fearing that he himself might not be the <lb/>
            first to enter the place, began to advance alone, (neither call­ <lb/>
            ing to Aristonymus who was next him, nor to Eurylochus of <lb/>
            Lusia, both of whom were his intimate friends, nor to any other <lb/>
            person,) and passed by all the rest. 12. Callimachus, seeing him <lb/>
            rushing by, caught hold of the rim of his shield, and at that <lb/>
            moment Aristonymus of Methydria ran past them both, and <lb/>
            after him Eurylochus of Lusia, for all these sought distinction <lb/>
            for valour, and were rivals to one another; and thus, in <lb/>
            mutual emulation, they got possession of the place, for when <lb/>
            they had once rushed in, not a stone was hurled from above. <lb/>
            13. But a dreadful spectacle was then to be seen; for the <lb/>
            women, flinging their children over the precipice, threw them­ <lb/>
            selves after them; and the men followed their example. <lb/>
            AEneas of Stymphalus, a captain, seeing one of them, who had <lb/>
            on a rich garment, running to throw himself over, caught hold <lb/>
            of it with intent to stop him. 14. But the man dragged him <lb/>
            forward, and they both went rolling down the rocks together, <lb/>
            and were killed. Thus very few prisoners were taken, but <lb/>
            a great number of oxen, asses, and sheep.</p>
          <p>15. Hence they advanced, seven days' journey, a distance <lb/>
            of fifty parasangs, through the country of the Chalybes. <lb/>
            These were the most warlike people of all that they passed <lb/>
            through, and came to close combat with them. They had <lb/>
            linen cuirasses, reaching down to the groin, and, instead of <lb/>
            skirts,' thick cords twisted. 16. They had also greaves and <lb/>
            helmets, and at their girdles a short faulchion, as large as a <lb/>
            Spartan crooked dagger, with which they cut the throats of <lb/>
            all whom they could master, and then, cutting off their heads, <lb/>
            carried them away with them. They sang and danced when <lb/>
            the enemy were likely to see them. They carried also a spear <lb/>
            of about fifteen cubits in length, having one spiked 17. They <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αντὶ τω̃ν πτερύγων</foreign>.] That this is the true sense of this word <lb/>

            stayed in their villages till the Greeks had passed by, when <lb/>
            they pursued and perpetually harassed them. They bad <lb/>
            their dwellings in strong places, in which they had also laid <lb/>
            up their provisions, so that the Greeks could get nothing <lb/>
            from that country, but lived upon the cattle which they taken <lb/>
            from the Taochi.</p>
          <p>18. The Greeks next arrived at the river Harpasus, the <lb/>
            breadth of which was four plethra. Hence they proceeded <lb/>
            through the territory of the Scythini, four days' journey, <lb/>
            making twenty parasangs, over a level tract, until they came <lb/>
            to some villages, in which they halted three days, and collect­ <lb/>
            ed provisions. 19. From this place they advanced four days' <lb/>
            journey, twenty parasangs, to a large, rich, and populous city, <lb/>
            called Gymnias, from which the governor of the country sent <lb/>
            the Greeks a guide, to conduct them through a region at war <lb/>
            with his own people. 20. The guide, when he came, said that <lb/>
            he would take them in live days to a place whence they should <lb/>
            see the sea; if not, he would consent to be put to death. When, <lb/>
            as he proceeded, he entered the country of their enemies, he <lb/>
            exhorted them to burn and lay waste the lands ; whence it was <lb/>
            evident that he had come for this very purpose, and not from <lb/>
            any good will to the Greeks. 21. On the fifth day they came <lb/>
            to the mountain;1 and the name of it was Theches. When <lb/>
            the men who were in the front had mounted the height, and <lb/>
            looked down upon the sea, a great shout proceeded from them; <lb/>
            22. and Xenophon and the rear-guard, on hearing it, thought <lb/>
            that some new enemies were assailing the front, for in the <lb/>
            rear, too, the people from the country that they had burnt <lb/>
            were following them, and the rear-guard, by placing an am­ <lb/>
            buscade, had killed some, and taken others prisoners, and had <lb/>
            captured about twenty shields made of raw ox-hides with the <lb/>
            hair on. 23. But as the noise still increased, and drew nearer, <lb/>
            and as those who came up from time to time kept running at <lb/>
            full speed to join those who were continually shouting, the <lb/>
            cries becoming louder as the men became more numerous, it <note type="footnote">I The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίεϱόν</foreign>, which precedes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ο̃ϱος</foreign> in the older editions, is en <lb/>

            appeared to Xenophon that it must be something of very great <lb/>
            moment. 24. Mounting his horse, therefore, and taking with <lb/>
            him Lyeius and the cavalry, he hastened forward to give aid, <lb/>
            when presently they heard the soldiers shouting, “The sea, <lb/>
            the sea !" and cheering on one another. They then all began <lb/>
            to run, the rear-guard as well as the rest, and the baggage- <lb/>
            cattle and horses were put to their speed; 25. and when they <lb/>
            had all arrived at the top, the men embraced one another, and <lb/>
            their generals and captains, with tears in their eyes. Sud­ <lb/>
            denly, whoever it was that suggested it, the soldiers brought <lb/>
            stones, and raised a large mound, 26. on which they laid a <lb/>
            number of raw ox-hides,1 staves, and shields taken from the <lb/>
            enemy. The shields the guide himself hacked in pieces,2 <lb/>
            and exhorted the rest to do the same. 27. Soon after, the <lb/>
            Greeks sent away the guide, giving him presents from the <lb/>
            common stock, a horse, a silver cup, a Persian robe, and ten <lb/>
            darics ;3 but he showed most desire for the rings on their <lb/>
            fingers, and obtained many of them from the soldiers. Having <lb/>
            then pointed out to them a village where they might take up <lb/>
            their quarters, and the road by which they were to proceed <lb/>
            to the Macrones, when the evening came on he departed, pur­ <lb/>
            suing his way during the night.</p>

          <p>The Greeks proceed unmolested through the country of the Macrones, and <lb/>
            enter Colchis. Putting to flight the Colchians who obstructed their pass­ <lb/>
            age, they arrive at Trebisond, a Greek city, where they perform whatever <lb/>
            vows they had made, and celebrate games.</p>
          <p>1. HENCE the Greeks advanced three days’journey, a dis­ <lb/>
            tance of ten parasangs, through the country of the Macrones. <lb/>
            On the first day they came to a river which divides the terri­ <lb/>

            their right they had an eminence extremely difficult of access, <lb/>
            and on their left another river,1 into which the boundary <lb/>
            river, which they had to cross, empties itself. This stream <lb/>
            was thickly edged with trees, not indeed large, but growing <lb/>
            closely together. These the Greeks, as soon as they came to <lb/>
            the spot, cut down,2 being in haste to get out of the country <lb/>
            as soon as possible. 3. The Macrones, however, equipped <lb/>
            with wicker shields, and spears, and hair tunics, were drawn <lb/>
            up on the opposite side of the crossing-place; they were ani­ <lb/>
            mating one another, and throwing stones into the river.3 <lb/>
            They did not hit our men, or cause them any inconvenience.</p>
          <p>4. At this juncture one of the peltasts came up to Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, saying that he had been a slave at Athens, and adding <lb/>
            that he knew the language of these men. " I think, indeed," <lb/>
            said lie, " that this is my country, and, if there is nothing to <lb/>
            prevent, I should wish to speak to the people.” 5. " There is <lb/>
            nothing to prevent," replied Xenophon ; " so speak to them, <lb/>
            and first ascertain what people they are." When he asked <lb/>
            them, they said that they were the Macrones. " Inquire, <lb/>
            then," said Xenophon, “why they are drawn up to oppose us, <lb/>
            and wish to be our enemies." 6. They replied, “Because <lb/>
            you come against our country." The generals then told him <lb/>
            to acquaint them that we were not come with any wish to do <lb/>
            them injury, but that we were returning to Greece after hav­ <lb/>
            ing been engaged in war with the king, and that we were <lb/>
            desirous to reach the sea. 7. They asked if the Greeks would <lb/>
            give pledges to this effect; and the Greeks replied that they <lb/>
            were willing both to give and receive them. The Macrones <lb/>
            accordingly presented the Greeks with a Barbarian lance, <lb/>
            and the Greeks gave them a Grecian one; for they said that <lb/>
            such were their usual pledges. Both parties called the gods <lb/>
            to witness.</p>
          <p>8. After these mutual assurances, the Macrones immediate­ <lb/>
            ly assisted them in cutting away the trees, and made a passage <note type="footnote"> 1 A stream running into the Tchórúk-sú, according to Ainsworth, <lb/>

            for them, as if to bring them over, mingling freely among the <lb/>
            Greeks ; they also gave such facilities as they could for buying <lb/>
            provisions, and conducted them through their country for three <lb/>
            days, until they brought them to the confines of the Colchians. <lb/>
            9. Here was a range of hills,' high, but accessible, and upon <lb/>
            them the Colchians were drawn up in array. The Greeks, at <lb/>
            first, drew up against them in a line,2 with the intention of <lb/>
            marching up the hill in this disposition ; but afterwards the <lb/>
            generals thought proper to assemble and deliberate how they <lb/>
            might engage with the best effect. 10. Xenophon then said <lb/>
            it appeared to him that they ought to relinquish the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment in line, and to dispose the troops in columns;3 "for a <lb/>
            line," pursued he, “will be broken at once, as we shall find <lb/>
            the hills in some parts impassable, though in others easy of <lb/>
            access; and this disruption will immediately produce despond­ <lb/>
            ency in the men, when, after being ranged in a regular line, they <lb/>
            find it dispersed. 11. Again, if we advance drawn upverymany <lb/>
            deep, the enemy will stretch beyond us on both sides, and will <lb/>
            employ the parts that outreach us in any way they may think <lb/>
            proper; and if we advance only a few deep, it would not be <lb/>
            at all surprising if our line be broken through by showers of <lb/>
            missiles and men falling upon us in large bodies. If this <lb/>
            happen in any part, it will be ill for the whole extent of the <lb/>
            line. 12. I think, then, that having formed our companies in <lb/>
            columns, we should keep them so far apart from each other as <lb/>
            that the last companies on each side may be beyond tho <lb/>
            enemy's wings. Thus our extreme companies will both <lb/>
            outflank the line of the enemy, and, as we march in file, the <lb/>
            bravest of our men will close with the enemy first, and wher­ <lb/>
            ever the ascent is easiest, there each division will direct its <lb/>
            course. 13. Nor will it be easy for the enemy to penetrate <lb/>
            into the intervening spaces, when there are companies on each <lb/>
            side, nor will it be easy to break through a column as it ad­ <lb/>
            vances ; while, if any one of the companies be hard pressed, <lb/>
            the neighbouring one will support it; and if but one of the <lb/>
            companies can by any path attain the summit, the enemy will <lb/>
            no longer stand their ground." 14. This plan was approved, <lb/>
            and they threw the companies into columns.

            tiding along from the right wing to the left, said, " Soldiers, <lb/>
            the enemy whom you see before you, are now the only ob­ <lb/>
            stacle to hinder us from being where we have long been eager <lb/>
            to be. These, if we can, we must eat up alive." 1</p>
          <p>is. When the men were all in their places, and they had <lb/>
            formed the companies into columns, there were about eighty <lb/>
            companies of heavy-armed men, and each company consisted of <lb/>
            about eighty men. The peltasts and archers they divided into <lb/>
            three bodies, each about six hundred men, one of which they <lb/>
            placed beyond the left wing, another beyond the right, and <lb/>
            the third in the centre. 16. The generals then desired the <lb/>
            soldiers to make their vows2 to the gods ; and having made <lb/>
            them, and sung the paean, they moved forward. Cheirisophus <lb/>
            and Xenophon, and the peltasts that they had with them, who <lb/>
            were beyond the enemy's flanks, pushed on ; 17. and the ene­ <lb/>
            my, observing their motions, and hurrying forward to receive <lb/>
            them, were drawn off, some to the right and others to the left, <lb/>
            and left a great void in the centre of their line ; 18. when the <lb/>
            peltasts in the Arcadian division, whom Æschines the Acar­ <lb/>
            nanian commanded, seeing them separate, ran forward in all <lb/>
            haste, thinking that they were taking to flight; and these were <lb/>
            the first that reached the summit. The Arcadian heavy- <lb/>
            armed troop, of which Cleaner the Orchomenian was captain, <lb/>
            followed them. 19. But the enemy, when once the Greeks <lb/>
            began to run, no longer stood their ground, but went off in <lb/>
            flight, some one way and some another.</p>
          <p>Having passed the summit, the Greeks encamped in a num­ <lb/>
            ber of villages containing abundance of provisions. 20. As <lb/>
            to other things here, there was nothing at which they were <lb/>
            surprised; but the number of bee-hives was extraordinary <lb/>
            and all the soldiers that ate of the combs, lost their senses, <lb/>
            vomited, and were affected with purging, and none of them <lb/>
            were able to stand upright; such as had eaten only a little were <lb/>
            like men greatly intoxicated, and such as had eaten much were <lb/>
            like mad-men, and some like persons at the point of death. <lb/>
            21. They lay upon the ground, in consequence, in great num­ <lb/>
            bers, as if there had been a defeat; and there was general de- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὠμοὺς</foreign> ——<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάφαεῑν</foreign>.] " Eat up raw," without waiting to cook <lb/>

            jection. The next day no one of them was found dead ; and <lb/>
            they recovered their senses about the same hour that they had <lb/>
            lost them on the preceding day; and on the third and fourth <lb/>
            days they got up as if after having taken physic.1</p>
          <p>22. From hence they proceeded two days' march, seven <lb/>
            parasangs, and arrived at Trebisond, a Greek city, of large <lb/>
            population, on the Euxine Sea ; a colony of Sinope, but lying <lb/>
            in the territory of the Colchians. Here they stayed about <lb/>
            thirty days, encamping in the villages of the Colchians, 23. <lb/>
            whence they made excursions and plundered the country of <lb/>
            Colchis. The people of Trebisond provided a market for <lb/>
            the Greeks in the camp, and entertained them in the city; <lb/>
            and made them presents of oxen, barley-meal, and wine. 24. <lb/>
            They negotiated with them also on behalf of the neighbour­ <lb/>
            ing Colchians, those especially who dwelt in the plain, and <lb/>
            from them too were brought presents of oxen.</p>
          <p>25. Soon after, they prepared to perform the sacrifice which <lb/>
            they had vowed. Oxen enough had been brought them to <lb/>
            offer to Jupiter the Preserver, and to Hercules, for their safe <lb/>
            conduct, and whatever they had vowed to the other gods. <lb/>
            They also celebrated gymnastic games upon the hill where <lb/>
            they were encamped, and chose Dracontius a Spartan, (who <lb/>
            had become an exile from his country when quite a boy, for <lb/>
            having involuntarily killed a child by striking him with a <lb/>
            dagger,) to prepare the course and preside at the contests.</p>

            among the Sanni or Macrones. The peculiarities of the honey <lb/>
            arose from the herbs to which the bees resorted ; the first came from <lb/>

            he had made the course. Dracontius, pointing to the place where <lb/>
            they were standing, said, “This hill is an excellent place for <lb/>
            running, in whatever direction the men may wish." " But <lb/>
            how will they be able," said they, " to wrestle on ground so <lb/>
            rough and bushy?” " He that falls," said he, " will suffer the <lb/>
            more." 27. Boys, most of them from among the prisoners, <lb/>
            contended in the short course,' and in the long course1 above <lb/>
            sixty Cretans ran; while others were matched in wrestling, <lb/>
            boxing, and the pancratium. It was a fine sight; for many <lb/>
            entered the lists, and as their friends were spectators, thero <lb/>
            was great emulation. 28. Horses also ran ; and they had to <lb/>
            gallop down the steep, and, turning round in the sea, to come <lb/>
            up again to the altar.2 In the descent, many rolled down ; <lb/>
            but in the ascent, against the exceedingly steep ground, the <lb/>
            horses could scarcely get up at a walking pace. There was <lb/>
            consequently great shouting, and laughter, and cheering from <lb/>
            the people.</p>

            sion, and causing the roads to be repaired, in ease the army should be <lb/>

            with Cyrus, and what they underwent in their journey to the <lb/>
            Euxine Sea; how they arrived at the Greek city of Trebi­ <lb/>

            remainder of their journey; and Antileon, a native of Thurii, <lb/>
            stood up first, and spoke thus: " For my part, my friends, I <lb/>
            am now quite exhausted with packing up my baggage, walk­ <lb/>
            ing, running, carrying my arms, marching in order, mount­ <lb/>
            ing guard, and fighting, and should wish, since we have come <lb/>
            to the sea, to rest from such toils, and to sail the remainder of <lb/>
            the way ; and to arrive at Greece, like Ulysses, stretched out <lb/>
            asleep ”1 3. The soldiers, on hearing these remarks, cried <lb/>
            out that he spoke well; and then another, and afterwards all <lb/>
            the rest, expressed the same feelings. Cheirisophus then <lb/>
            rose, and spoke as follows: 4. “Anaxibius2 is a friend of mine, <lb/>
            and is now admiral. If, therefore, you will commission me to <lb/>
            go to him, I have no doubt that I shall return with galleys <lb/>
            and transport-vessels to carry you. And as you wish to sail, <lb/>
            stay here till I come back ; for I shall come very soon." When <lb/>
            the soldiers heard this offer, they were delighted, and voted <lb/>
            that he should set sail with all speed.</p>
          <p>5. After him Xenophon stood up, and spoke to the follow­ <lb/>
            ing effect: “Cheirisophus is going to fetch ships, and we <lb/>
            shall remain here ; and I will now mention what I think it <lb/>
            proper for us to do during our stay. 6. In the first place, <lb/>
            we must get provisions from the enemy's country; for the <lb/>
            market here is not abundant enough to supply us, nor have <lb/>
            we, except some few, a sufficiency of means with which to <lb/>
            purchase. But the country around us is inhabited by ene­ <lb/>
            mies; and there is danger, therefore, that many of you may' <lb/>
            be killed, if you go out in quest of provisions heedlessly and <lb/>
            unguardedly. 7. It seems to me, then, that we ought to seek <note type="footnote"> 1 —The winged galley flies; <lb/>

            Divine Ulysses was her sacred load, <lb/>

            Much danger, long and mighty toils he tore, <lb/>
            In storms by sea, and combats on the shore: <lb/>

            provisions in foraging-parties,1 and not to wander about at <lb/>
            random ; so that you may preserve your lives; and that we, <lb/>
            the officers, should have the regulation of these proceedings." <lb/>
            These suggestions were approved. 8. “Attend also," he <lb/>
            said, "to the following hints. Some of you will go out <lb/>
            for plunder. I think it will be better, then, for any one that <lb/>
            intends to go out, to give us notice, and say in what direc­ <lb/>
            tion, that we may know the number of those who go and of <lb/>
            those who stay at home, and may take part in their projects if <lb/>
            it should be necessary ; and that, if it should be requisite to <lb/>
            send succour to any party, we may know whither to send it; <lb/>
            while if any of the less experienced make an attempt in any <lb/>
            quarter, we may aid his views by trying to learn the strength <lb/>
            of the enemy against whom he is going." To this proposal <lb/>
            assent was likewise given. 9. “Consider this too," added <lb/>
            he ; “the enemy have leisure to rob us; they meditate attacks <lb/>
            upon us, and with justice, for we are in possession of their <lb/>
            property. They are also posted above us ; and it appears to <lb/>
            me, therefore, that sentinels should be placed round the camp, <lb/>
            so that, if, being divided into parties, we keep guard and <lb/>
            watch by turns, the enemy will be less in a condition to catch <lb/>
            us by surprise. 10. Take this also into consideration. If we <lb/>
            knew for certain that Cheirisophus would come with a suffi­ <lb/>
            cient number of ships to transport us, there would be no occa­ <lb/>
            sion for what I am going to say; but, since this is uncertain, <lb/>
            I think that we ought, in the mean time, to endeavour to pro­ <lb/>
            vide ourselves with ships from hence; for, if he comes with <lb/>
            ships, and vessels are ready here, we shall sail in a greater <lb/>
            number of ships ; and, if he brings none, we shall make use of <lb/>
            what we have procured here. 11. I observe vessels frequently <lb/>
            sailing past; and if therefore we should ask the people of <lb/>
            Trebisond for ships of war, and bring them in to the shore and <lb/>
            keep them under guard, unshipping their rudders till a sum­ <lb/>
            cient number be collected to carry us, we shall possibly not <lb/>
            fail of securing such conveyance as we require." This sugges­ <lb/>
            tion was also approved. 12. " Reflect also," said he, "whether <lb/>
            it will not be proper to support the mariners whom we bring <lb/>
            into harbour from the common stock, as long as they may stay <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σὺν προνομι̃ς</foreign>.] A military mode of expression, as it appears, <lb/>

            on our account, and to make an agreement with them about <lb/>
            the passage-money, that by benefiting us they may also be <lb/>
            benefited themselves." To this they also agreed. 13. " It <lb/>
            appears to me further," he continued, “that if our efforts are <lb/>
            not successful to procure vessels in sufficient number,' we <lb/>
            should enjoin the towns lying on the sea to repair the roads, <lb/>
            which, we hear, are scarcely passable; for they will obey <lb/>
            such an injunction both from fear and from a wish to be rid of <lb/>
            us.” 14. At this point of his speech they cried out that there <lb/>
            must be no travelling by land.</p>
          <p>Xenophon, seeing their want of consideration, did not put <lb/>
            that particular to the vote. But he afterwards prevailed on <lb/>
            the towns to mend the roads of their own accord, telling them <lb/>
            that if the roads were made passable, they would so much the <lb/>
            sooner be delivered from the Greeks. 15. They received also <lb/>
            a fifty-oared galley from the people of Trebisond, over which <lb/>
            they placed Dexippus, a Spartan, one of the periœci ;2 who, <lb/>
            neglecting to get vessels together, went off with the galley <lb/>
            clear out of the Euxine. He however met with a just retribu­ <lb/>
            tion some time after; for being in Thrace, at the court of <lb/>
            Seuthes, and engaging in some intrigue, he was killed by <lb/>
            Nicander a Lacedæmonian. 16. They received too a thirty- <lb/>
            oared galley, over which Polycrates an Athenian was ap­ <lb/>
            pointed, who brought all the vessels that he could get to <lb/>
            the shore before the camp ; and the Greeks, taking out their <lb/>
            cargoes, if they had any, set guards over them, that they <lb/>
            might be secure, and reserved the vessels for their passage.</p>
          <p>17. While these affairs were going on, the soldiers were <lb/>
            making excursions for plunder; and some succeeded and <lb/>
            others not; but Cleænetus, as he was leading out his own <lb/>
            troop and another against some strong place, was killed, as <lb/>

          <p>To augment their stock of provisions, Xenophon undertakes a foraging ex­ <lb/>
            pedition against the Drilæ, who lay waste their fields, and shut themselve <lb/>
            up in their chief fort, which the Greeks take and burn to the ground.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN it was no longer possible for the foragers to get <lb/>
            provisions, so as to return the same day to the camp, Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, taking some of the people of Trebisond as guides, led <lb/>
            out half the army against the Drilæ, leaving the other half to <lb/>
            guard the camp ; for the Colchians, having been driven from <lb/>
            their homes, were collected in large numbers, and had posted <lb/>
            themselves on the heights. 2. The guides from Trebisond, <lb/>
            however, did not conduct them to places whence it was easy <lb/>
            to get provisions, for the inhabitants of those parts were their <lb/>
            friends, but led them with great eagerness into the territories <lb/>
            of the Drilæ, from whom they had received injuries, into <lb/>
            mountainous and difficult tracts, and against the most warlike <lb/>
            of all the people on the shores of the Pontus Euxinus.</p>
          <p>3. When the Greeks had got up into their country, the <lb/>
            Drilæ retreated, having first set fire to such of their places as <lb/>
            seemed easy to be taken ; and there was nothing for the <lb/>
            Greeks to capture but swine, or oxen, or any other cattle that <lb/>
            had escaped the fire. But there was one place that consti­ <lb/>
            tuted their metropolis; and to this they had all flocked. <lb/>
            Around it there was an extremely deep ravine, and the ways <lb/>
            of access to the place were difficult. 4. However the peltasts, <lb/>
            having outstripped the heavy-armed men by five or six stadia, <lb/>
            crossed the ravine, and getting sight of a great deal of cattle <lb/>
            and other booty, made an attack upon the place; and many <lb/>
            spear-men,' who had gone out for plunder, followed close upon <lb/>
            them; so that the number of those who crossed the ravine <lb/>
            amounted to more than two thousand. 5. As they found <lb/>
            themselves unable to take the place by assault, (for there was <lb/>
            a broad trench round it, the earth from which had been thrown <lb/>
            up as a rampart, and upon the rampart were palisades, and a <lb/>
            number of wooden towers erected,) they attempted to retire, <lb/>
            but the enemy pressed hard upon them; 6. and a,; they could <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δοϱοφόροι</foreign>.] No particular class of troops is meant, but merely <lb/>
            such of the foragers as had armed themselves with spears, either for <lb/>
            defence, or to assist them in bringing home what they took. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. V. </note> <lb/>
            not effect a retreat, (for the descent from the place to the ravine <lb/>
            would allow only one to pass at a time,) they sent for aid to <lb/>
            Xenophon, who was at the head of the heavy-armed men. 7. <lb/>
            The messenger said, that the place was stored with abundance <lb/>
            of things; "but," said he, " we are unable to take it, for it is <lb/>
            strong; nor is it easy for us to retreat, for the enemy <lb/>
            sally forth and assail our rear, and the way from it is dif­ <lb/>
            ficult."</p>
          <p>8. Xenophon, on hearing this account, brought up the <lb/>
            heavy-armed to the ravine, and ordered them to halt there <lb/>
            under arms, while he himself, crossing over with the captains, <lb/>
            deliberated whether it would be better to bring off those that <lb/>
            had already gone over, or to lead over the heavy-armed also, <lb/>
            in the hope that the place might be taken; 9. for it seemed <lb/>
            impossible to bring off the first party without the loss of many <lb/>
            lives, and the captains were of opinion that they might take <lb/>
            the place. Xenophon accordingly yielded to their judgment, <lb/>
            placing some reliance, at the same time, on the sacrifices; for <lb/>
            the augurs had signified that there would be an action, and <lb/>
            that the result of the excursion would be favourable. to. He <lb/>
            therefore despatched the captains to bring over the heavy- <lb/>
            armed men, while he himself remained where he was, keeping <lb/>
            back the peltasts, and allowing none of them to skirmish with <lb/>
            the enemy. 11. When the heavy-armed troops came up, he <lb/>
            ordered each of the captains to form his company in such a <lb/>
            manner as he might think most advantageous for fighting; <lb/>
            for those captains, who were perpetually contending with one <lb/>
            another in gallantry, were now standing close to each other. <lb/>
            12. They executed his orders ; and he then directed all the <lb/>
            peltasts to advance holding their javelins by the thong,1 as it <lb/>
            would be necessary to hurl whenever he should give the <lb/>
            signal, and the archers having their arrows resting on the <lb/>
            string,1 as, whenever he gave the signal, they would have to <lb/>
            shoot; he ordered the skirmishers2 also to have their bags full <lb/>
            of stones, and commissioned proper persons to see these orders <lb/>
            executed. 13. When everything was ready, and the captains <note type="footnote"> 1 See on iv. 3. 28. </note><note type="footnote"> ' The <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυμνη̃ται</foreign>, are here distinguished from the archers, although <lb/>

            and lieutenants, and all those1 who thought themselves not <lb/>
            inferior to these, were in their places, and had a full view of <lb/>
            each other, (for the disposition of the troops, from the nature <lb/>
            of the ground, was in the form of a crescent,) the heavy-armed <lb/>
            men, 14. after they had sung the paean and the trumpet had <lb/>
            sounded, raised the war-cry to Mars, and ran forward, while <lb/>
            the missiles, consisting of lances, arrows, balls from slings, and <lb/>
            numbers of stones flung from the hand, were hurled among <lb/>
            the enemy; and some of the men, too, threw fire-brands at <lb/>
            the place. 15. By reason, therefore, of the multitude of these <lb/>
            missives, the enemy abandoned both the palisades and the <lb/>
            lowers; so that Agasias of Stymphalus and Philoxenus of <lb/>
            Pellene, laying aside their armoury mounted the ramparts in <lb/>
            their tunics only; and then one drew up another, and others <lb/>
            mounted by themselves, and the place, as it appeared, was <lb/>
            taken. 16. The peltasts and light-armed men, accordingly, <lb/>
            rushed in and laid hands on whatever they could find ; while <lb/>
            Xenophon, taking his stand at the gates, detained as many of <lb/>
            the heavy-armed as he could outside of them, for other bodies <lb/>
            of the enemy were showing themselves upon some strong posi­ <lb/>
            tions among the hills. 17. After the lapse of a short interval <lb/>
            of time, a cry arose within, and the men came fleeing out, <lb/>
            some carrying what they had seized, and one or two perhaps <lb/>
            wounded ; and there was great crowding about the gates. <lb/>
            Those who rushed out, being questioned as to the cause, said <lb/>
            that there was a citadel within, and a great number of the <lb/>
            enemy, who sallied forth and fell upon our men who were in <lb/>
            the place. 18. Xenophon then told Tolmides the crier to pro­ <lb/>
            claim that whoever wished to get any plunder might go in ; <lb/>
            when many hastened to the entrance, and those who tried to <lb/>
            push their way in got the better of those that were hurrying <lb/>
            out, and shut up the enemy again within the citadel. 19. All <lb/>
            the parts without the citadel were then ravaged, and the <lb/>
            Greeks brought out the spoil; while the heavy-armed men <lb/>
            ranged themselves under arms, some round the palisading, and <lb/>
            some along the way leading to the citadel. 20. Xenophon <lb/>
            and the captains then deliberated whether it would be possible <lb/>
            to take the citadel, for, in that case, a safe retreat would be <note type="footnote"> 1 Halbkart supposes, with much reason, that we must understand <lb/>
            the captains of fifty and twenty-five. See iii- 4. 21 </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In order to climb with more agility. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            secured ; otherwise it seemed a difficult matter to retire ; and <lb/>
            it appeared to them, upon consideration, that the citadel was <lb/>
            altogether impregnable. 21. They accordingly began to pre­ <lb/>
            pare for a retreat; each of the men pulled up the palisades <lb/>
            that were nearest to him; and the captains sent out of the <lb/>
            place the useless hands,1 and those who were loaded with <lb/>
            plunder, but retained those in whom they severally confided.2</p>
          <p>22. When they commenced their retreat, numbers of the <lb/>
            enemy sallied forth upon them from within, armed with light <lb/>
            shields, spears, greaves, and Paphlagonian helmets,3 while <lb/>
            others climbed upon the houses that were on each side of the <lb/>
            road leading to the citadel, 23. so that it was not safe to <lb/>
            pursue them towards the gate leading thither, for they hurled <lb/>
            down large pieces of timber from above; and it was in con­ <lb/>
            sequence dangerous either to remain or retreat; and the <lb/>
            night, which was coming on, increased their alarm. 24. But <lb/>
            while they were thus engaged and in perplexity, some god <lb/>
            gave them the means of saving themselves; for one of the <lb/>
            houses on the right suddenly burst out in flames, whoever it <lb/>
            was that set fire to it, and when it fell in, the enemy fled <lb/>
            from all the houses on the right; 25. when Xenophon, having <lb/>
            learned this expedient from fortune, gave orders to set fire to <lb/>
            all the houses on the left, which were of wood, and soon in a <lb/>
            blaze; and the enemy accordingly fled from these houses also. <lb/>
            26. Those who were directly over against them,4 however, <lb/>
            and those only, still continued to annoy them, and gave evident' <lb/>
            signs of an intention to fall upon them in their egress and <lb/>
            descent. Xenophon in consequence ordered all who were out <lb/>
            of reach of the missiles to bring wood into the space between <lb/>
            them and the enemy; and when a considerable quantity was <lb/>
            collected, they set fire to it, setting fire at the same time to <lb/>
            the houses close to the palisading, in order that the enemy's at- <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοὺς ἀχρείους</foreign>.] Whatever camp-followers there were, witli the <lb/>

            tention might be engaged about these proceedings. 27. Thus, <lb/>
            by interposing fire between themselves and the enemy, they <lb/>
            effected, though with difficulty, a retreat from the place. <lb/>
            The whole of the town, houses, towers, palisading, and every­ <lb/>
            thing else except the citadel, was reduced to ashes.</p>
          <p>28. The next day the Greeks marched away, carrying with <lb/>
            them the provisions that they had taken; but as they had <lb/>
            some fears with regard to the descent to Trebisond, (for it <lb/>
            was steep and narrow,) they placed a pretended ambuscade. <lb/>
            29. A certain man, a Mysian by birth, and bearing that name,1 <lb/>
            took ten Cretans with him and waited in a woody place, <lb/>
            making it appear that he was endeavouring to conceal himself <lb/>
            from the enemy; while their shields, which were of brass, <lb/>
            glittered from time to time through the bushes. 30. The <lb/>
            enemy accordingly, observing these indications, were afraid <lb/>
            as of a real ambuscade ; and in the mean time the army <lb/>
            effected its descent. When it appeared to the Mysian that <lb/>
            they were advanced far enough,3 he gave a signal for them <lb/>
            to flee with all speed, and he himself, and those that were with <lb/>
            him, started up and hurried off. 31. The others, the Cretans, <lb/>
            quitting the road, (for they said4 that they were gained upon in <lb/>
            the race,) threw themselves down among the wood into the <lb/>
            bushy hollows, and got off safe; 32. but the Mysian himself, <lb/>
            pursuing his flight along the road, was heard to call out for aid, <lb/>
            when some ran to his relief, and brought him off wounded. The <lb/>
            party who had rescued him then retreated step by step with <lb/>
            their face towards the enemy, being exposed to their missiles, <lb/>
            while some of the Cretans discharged their arrows in return. <lb/>
            Thus they all returned in safety to the camp. <note type="footnote"> I He was a Mysus or Mysian by birth, and was called Myst. <lb/>

          <p>Being unable, from want of provisions, to wait longer for Cheirisophus, the <lb/>
            Greeks despatch the camp-followers and baggage by sea, and proceed <lb/>
            themselves by land to Cerasus, where the whole army is reviewed. They <lb/>
            divide among themselves the money arising from the sale of the prison­ <lb/>
            ers, the generals taking charge of the tenth part, which had been vowed <lb/>
            to Apollo and Diana. Description of Xenophon's residence, and of the <lb/>
            temple of Diana, at Scillus.</p>
          <p>1. As Cheirisophus did not return, and a sufficient number <lb/>
            of vessels were not collected, and as there was no longer a <lb/>
            possibility of getting supplies, it appeared that they must take <lb/>
            their departure. They accordingly put on board the sick <lb/>
            persons, and those who were above forty years of age, with <lb/>
            the women and children, and whatever baggage it was not <lb/>
            necessary to retain, and appointed Philesius and Sophænetus, <lb/>
            the eldest of the generals, to go in the vessels and take charge <lb/>
            of them. The rest of the army proceeded by land ; for the <lb/>
            road was now prepared. 2. Pursuing their march, they ar­ <lb/>
            rived on the third day at Cerasus, a Greek city upon the <lb/>
            coast in the country of Colchis, and a colony from Sinope. <lb/>
            3. Here they stayed ten days, and a review of the troops <lb/>
            under arms was held, and their number taken ; they were in <lb/>
            all eight thousand six hundred. These were saved out of <lb/>
            about ten thousand ; the rest had been cut off by the enemy <lb/>
            and the snow, and perhaps two or three by sickness.</p>
          <p>4. Here also they distributed the money arising from the <lb/>
            sale of the prisoners. The tenth part, which they set aside <lb/>
            for Apollo and Diana of Ephesus, the generals took among <lb/>
            them, each a portion, to keep for those duties. Neon of Asina <lb/>
            received that which was intended for Cheirisophus.</p>
          <p>5. Xenophon, after causing an offering to be made for <lb/>
            Apollo, deposited it in the treasury of the Athenians at <lb/>
            Delphi, inscribing on it his own name, and that of Proxenus, <lb/>
            who was killed with Clearchus; for he had been his guest- <lb/>
            friend. 6. The portion designed for Diana of Ephesus he <lb/>
            left with Megabyzus, the warden of that goddess's temple, <lb/>
            when he returned1 with Agesilaus out of Asia on an expedi- <note type="footnote">1 "Ore <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπήει, κ</foreign>. r. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign>.] Verte: quum redibat cum Agesilao ex Asiâ <lb/>

            tion to Bœotia, because he seemed likely to incur some peril, <lb/>
            and enjoined him, if he escaped, to return the money to him, <lb/>
            but, if he met with an ill fate, to make such an offering as he <lb/>
            thought would please the goddess, and dedicate it to her. <lb/>
            7. Afterwards, when Xenophon was banished1 from his <lb/>
            country, and was living at Scillus, a colony settled by the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians near Olympia, Megabyzus came to Olympia <lb/>
            to see the games, and restored him the deposit. Xenophon, on <lb/>
            receiving it, purchased some land as an offering to the goddess <lb/>
            where the god had directed him. The river Selinus happen <lb/>
            to run through the midst of it; 8. and another river named <lb/>
            Selinus runs close by the temple of Diana at Ephesus; and <lb/>
            in both there are different kinds of fish, and shell-fish. On <lb/>
            the land near Scillus, too, there is hunting, of all such beasts <lb/>
            as are taken in the chase. 9. He built also an altar and a <lb/>
            temple with the consecrated money, and continued afterwards <lb/>
            to make a sacrifice every year, always receiving a tenth of the <lb/>
            produce of the seasons from the land; and all the people of <lb/>
            the town, as well as the men and women of the neighbour­ <lb/>
            hood, took part in the festival; while the goddess supplied <lb/>
            those in tents there with barley-meal, bread, wine, sweetmeats. <lb/>
            and a share of the victims offered from the sacred pastures, <lb/>
            and of those caught in hunting; 10. for the sons of Xenophon, <lb/>
            and those of the other inhabitants, always made a general <lb/>
            hunt against the festival, and such of the men as were willing <lb/>
            hunted with them ; and there were caught, partly on the <lb/>
            sacred lands, and partly on Mount Pholoe, boars, and antelopes, <lb/>
            and deer. 11. This piece of ground lies on the road from <lb/>
            Lacedæmon to Olympia, about twenty stadia from the temple <lb/>
            of Jupiter at Olympia. There are within the place groves <lb/>
            and hills covered with trees, adapted for the breeding of swine, <lb/>
            goats, oxen, and horses, so that the beasts of the persons <lb/>
            coming to the festival are amply supplied with food. 12. Round <lb/>
            the temple itself is planted a grove of cultivated trees, bearing <lb/>
            whatever fruits are eatable in the different seasons. The <lb/>
            edifice is similar, as far as a small can be to a great one, to <lb/>
            that at Ephesus; and the statue is as like to that at Ephesus <note type="footnote"> 1 He was banished by the Athenians for having joined Cyrus in <lb/>

          <p>The Greeks arrive at the country of the Mossynœci, who, relying on their <lb/>
            strong-holds, endeavour to stop their progress. But as they were divided <lb/>
            into two parties, the Greeks defeat the one with the aid of the other, <lb/>
            burn two fortresses and plunder the chief city. Account of the barbarous <lb/>
            manners of the Mossynœci.</p>
          <p>1. FROM Cerasus those who had previously gone on board <lb/>
            pursued their voyage by sea ; the rest proceeded by land. <lb/>
            2. When they came to the confines of the Mossynœci, they <lb/>
            sent to them Timesitheus, a native of Trapezus, and a guest- <lb/>
            friend of the Mossynœci, to inquire whether they were to <lb/>
            march through their country as one of friends or of enemies. <lb/>
            The Mossynœci replied that " they would allow them no pass­ <lb/>
            age at all ;” for they trusted to their strong-holds. 3. Time­ <lb/>
            sitheus then acquainted the Greeks that the Mossynœci in the <lb/>
            country beyond were at enmity with these; and it was re­ <lb/>
            solved accordingly to ask them whether they were willing to <lb/>
            form an alliance with the Greeks. Timesitheus, being de­ <lb/>
            spatched for that purpose, returned with their chiefs.</p>
          <p>4. On their arrival, the chiefs of the Mossynœci and the <lb/>
            generals of the Greeks held a conference, when Xenophon <lb/>
            spoke, and Timesitheus interpreted. 5. “ We are desirous," <lb/>
            said he, " 0 Mossynœci, to effect a safe passage to Greece by <lb/>
            land, as we have no ships ; but these people, who, as we hear, <lb/>
            are your enemies, oppose our way. 6. It is in your power, <lb/>
            therefore, if you think proper, to take us for your allies, and <lb/>
            to avenge yourselves for whatever injury they have done you, <lb/>
            and make them subject to you for the future.1 7. But if you <note type="footnote"> • <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ὑμω̄ν ὺπηκόους εὶναι τοὑτους</foreign>.] Supply <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔξεστιν ὑμῑν</foreign>, <lb/>

            reject our application, consider whence you will again procure <lb/>
            so efficient a power to support you." 8. To this the head chief <lb/>
            of the Mossynœci answered that they were pleased with the <lb/>
            proposal, and would consent to the alliance. 9. “ Well then," <lb/>
            said Xenophon, " for what purpose will you want to make <lb/>
            use of us, if we become your allies, and how far will you be <lb/>
            able to assist us with regard to our passage through the <lb/>
            country ?" to. They replied, " We shall be able to make an <lb/>
            irruption, from the farther side, into the country of those who <lb/>
            are enemies to both you and us, and to send hither for you, <lb/>
            both ships and men, who will be your auxiliaries, and guide <lb/>
            you on your way." 11. Having given and received pledges <lb/>
            on these terms, they departed.</p>
          <p>The next day they returned with three hundred canoes,. <lb/>
            and three men in each, of whom two disembarked, and formed <lb/>
            in line under arms, while the third remained on board. 12. <lb/>
            The latter sailed off with the canoes, and those who were left <lb/>
            behind, ranged themselves in the following manner. They <lb/>
            drew up in lines, of about a hundred men in each, like rows <lb/>
            of dancers fronting one another, all bearing shields made of <lb/>
            the hides of white oxen, with the hair on, shaped like an ivy­ <lb/>
            leaf, and in their right hand a spear six cubits long, with a <lb/>
            point at the upper end, and at the lower a round knob formed <lb/>
            from the wood of the shaft. 13. They were clad in short <lb/>
            tunics, that did not reach to their knees, of the thickness of a <lb/>
            linen bag for bed-clothes,2 and had on their heads helmets <lb/>
            made of leather like those of the Paphlagonians, with a plait <lb/>
            of hair round the middle, nearly resembling a tiara ; they had <lb/>
            also battle-axes of iron. 14. One of them next went forward, <lb/>
            and all the rest followed him, singing to a tune; and then, <lb/>
            passing through the lines and heavy-armed troops of the <lb/>
            Greeks, they proceeded straight towards the enemy, to attack <lb/>
            a. fortress, which appeared easy to be assailed, 15. and which <lb/>
            was situated in front of the city which they call their metro­ <lb/>

            synœci. It was about this strong-hold that the present war <lb/>
            had arisen ; for those who for the time being held this posi­ <lb/>
            tion, were regarded as chief of all the Mossynæci ; and they <lb/>
            said that the other party had seized it unjustly, and, by ap­ <lb/>
            propriating to themselves a common possession, had gained <lb/>
            the ascendency over them. 16. Some of the Greeks followed <lb/>
            these men, not by orders from their officers, but for the sake <lb/>
            of plunder. While they were advancing, the enemy were <lb/>
            quiet for a time, but, as they drew near the fort, they sallied <lb/>
            out and put them to flight, killing several of the Barbarians, <lb/>
            and some few of the Greeks that went up with them, and <lb/>
            continued the pursuit until they saw the main body of the <lb/>
            Greeks coming to the rescue. 17. They then turned and fled, <lb/>
            and, cutting off the heads of the slain, exhibited them to the <lb/>
            Greeks and their own enemies, dancing and singing, at the <lb/>
            same time, to some kind of tune.</p>
          <p>18. The Greeks were much vexed on this occasion, because <lb/>
            they had rendered the enemy bolder, and because their own <lb/>
            men, who had gone out with the party in considerable num­ <lb/>
            bers, had run away; a circumstance which had never before <lb/>
            happened during the expedition. 19. Xenophon however, <lb/>
            calling the Greeks together, said, “Do not be cast down, sol­ <lb/>
            diers, at what has happened, for be assured that the good <lb/>
            which has occurred is not less than the evil. 20. In the first <lb/>
            place, you are now convinced that those who are to guide us, <lb/>
            are in reality enemies to those to whom it is necessary for us <lb/>
            also to be enemies. In the next, those of the Greeks who <lb/>
            were regardless of our discipline, and thought themselves able <lb/>
            to do as much in conjunction with the Barbarians as with us, <lb/>
            have paid the penalty of their rashness ; so that on any other <lb/>
            occasion they will be less inclined to desert our body. 21. <lb/>
            And it is now incumbent on you so to prepare yourselves, that <lb/>
            you may appear to such of the Barbarians as are your friends <lb/>
            to be superior to them in courage, and to prove to your ene­ <lb/>
            mies that they will not fight with the same kind of men now, <lb/>
            as when they fought with those who were in disorder.”</p>
          <p>22. Thus they rested for that day. On the next, when <lb/>
            they had sacrificed, and found favourable omens, and had <lb/>
            taken their breakfast, they formed themselves in columns, <lb/>
            ranging the Barbarians on the left in the same way, and <lb/>
            marched forward with the archers between the columns, keep- <pb n="157"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            ing a little within the front ranks of the heavy-armed troops, <lb/>
            for some of the enemy's light-armed men ran down and hurled <lb/>
            stones at them. 23. These the archers and peltasts tried to <lb/>
            keep in check; the rest of the Greeks proceeded at a slow <lb/>
            pace, in the first place, towards the fortress, from which the <lb/>
            Barbarians, and the Greeks who were with them, had been <lb/>
            repulsed the day before ; for here the enemy were drawn up <lb/>
            to oppose them. 24. The Barbarians awaited the charge of <lb/>
            the peltasts, and engaged with them; but when the heavy- <lb/>
            armed came up, they took to flight, when the peltasts immedi­ <lb/>
            ately pursued them up the hill to the metropolis, and the <lb/>
            heavy-armed followed in order. 25. As soon as they had <lb/>
            reached the top, and were close to the houses in the metropo <lb/>
            lis, the enemy, being now collected in a body, encountered <lb/>
            and hurled lances at them ; and, using other spears of great <lb/>
            thickness and length, such as a man could hardly carry, they <lb/>
            endeavoured to defend themselves with them hand to hand.</p>
          <p>26. As the Greeks however did not give way, but engaged <lb/>
            them in close combat, they fled also from this part, abandon­ <lb/>
            ing the place entirely. But their king, who resided in a <lb/>
            wooden tower,' built upon an eminence, and whom, while he <lb/>
            lives there, they all maintain and guard2 in common, would <lb/>
            not consent to come out, nor would those who were in the <lb/>
            fortress that was first taken,3 but were burnt there toge­ <lb/>
            ther with the towers. 27. The Greeks, in ransacking the <lb/>
            place, found in the houses stores4 of bread, laid up, as the <lb/>
            Mossynœci themselves said, according to their hereditary prac­ <lb/>
            tice, and the new corn put by in the straw; the most of it <lb/>
            was spelt. 28. Sliced flesh of dolphins,5 too, was found pic­ <lb/>
            kled in jars, and fat of dolphins also in other vessels, which <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μόσσυνι</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μόσσυν, ξύλινος πυ̃ργος</foreign>, as appears from Diod. Sic. <lb/>

            the Mossynœci used as the Greeks use oil. 29. In the upper <lb/>
            part of the houses were vast stores of chestnuts,1 of the broad <lb/>
            kind, without any fissure; these they used in great quantities <lb/>
            for food, boiling them and baking loaves of them. Wine was <lb/>
            likewise found, which, when unmixed, seemed sour to the <lb/>
            taste by reason of its roughness, but mixed with water, was <lb/>
            both fragrant and sweet.</p>
          <p>30. The Greeks, after dining here, proceeded on their march, <lb/>
            delivering up the place to the tribe of Mossynœci that had <lb/>
            become their allies. As for the other towns at which they <lb/>
            arrived, belonging to the people on that side of the enemy, <lb/>
            the Barbarians deserted such as were most accessible, while <lb/>
            the inhabitants of others willingly came over to them. 31. <lb/>
            Most of these places were situated thus: they were distant <lb/>
            from one another about eighty stadia, some more, some less ; <lb/>
            yet the inhabitants could hear each other calling out from <lb/>
            one town to another; so mountainous and hollow is the <lb/>
            country.</p>
          <p>32. When the Greeks, advancing onward, arrived in the <lb/>
            country of their friends, they showed them some boys, sons of <lb/>
            the richer sort of people, extremely fat, (having been fed on <lb/>
            boiled chestnuts,) very soft and fair-skinned, and not far from <lb/>
            being equal in height and breadth, painted also on their backs <lb/>
            with various colours, and tattooed all over their fore-parts <lb/>
            with flowers.2 33. They wanted to have intercourse in public <lb/>
            with the mistresses that the Greeks had with them ; for such <lb/>
            is their custom. Both the men and women were very fair.. <lb/>
            34. Those engaged in this expedition said that these were the <lb/>
            most barbarous of all the people they passed through, and <lb/>
            furthest removed from the manners of the Greeks; for they <lb/>
            do those things in a crowd, which other men would do in pri­ <lb/>
            vate, or would not venture to do at all; and they acted, when <lb/>
            alone, just as they would have acted in company with others; <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κάρυα</foreign>.] The commentators rightly understand castaneœ nuces, <lb/>

            they talked to themselves, laughed to themselves, and stopped <lb/>

          <p>The Greeks pass through the territories of the Chalybes, and arrive at <lb/>
            Cotyora, a colony from Sinope, in those of the Tibareni. Not being hos­ <lb/>
            pitably received, they subsist by plundering the neighbouring country, <lb/>
            and that of the Paphlagonians. The people of Sinope complain of these <lb/>
            depredations, but are appeased by the reply of Xenophon.</p>
          <p>1. THROUGH this country, partly hostile and partly friend­ <lb/>
            ly, the Greeks proceeded eight days' journey, and arrived <lb/>
            among the Chalybes. This people are few in number, and <lb/>
            subject to the Mossynœci; and the subsistence of most of <lb/>
            them is procured by working in iron. 2. They next came to <lb/>
            the Tibareni, whose country was much more level, and con­ <lb/>
            tained some towns on the sea-coast, not very strongly fortified. <lb/>
            Upon these places the generals were inclined to make an at­ <lb/>
            tack, and thus in some degree to benefit the army ; and accord <lb/>
            ingly they did not receive the offerings of hospitality that <lb/>
            were sent them from the Tibareni, but ordered those who <lb/>
            brought them to wait till they had considered how to act, and <lb/>
            then proceeded to sacrifice. 3. After offering several victims, <lb/>
            all the augurs at last gave their opinion that the gods by no <lb/>
            means approved of war. They then accepted the presents, <lb/>
            and marching on, as through a country belonging to friends, <lb/>
            they arrived in two days at Cotyora, a Greek city, a colony <lb/>
            from Sinope, situated in the territory of the Tibareni.</p>
          <p>4. Thus far the army had proceeded by land. The length <lb/>
            of their journey down the country, from the field of battle <lb/>
            near Babylon to Cotyora, was a hundred and twenty-two days' <lb/>
            march, six hundred and twenty parasangs, or eighteen thou­ <lb/>
            sand six hundred stadia; and the length of time spent in it <lb/>
            was eight months.</p>
          <p>5. Here they stayed forty-five days; during which they <lb/>
            first sacrificed to the gods, and then each of the Greeks, ae­ <lb/>
            cording to their tribes celebrated processions and gymnastio <pb n="160"/>
             <note type="margin">[<foreign xml:lang="grc">Β</foreign>. V. </note> <lb/>
            games. 6. Their provisions, meanwhile, they took partly <lb/>
            from Paphlagonia, and partly from the lands of the Cotyo­ <lb/>
            rites ; for they refused to permit them to purchase, or to re­ <lb/>
            ceive their siek within the walls.</p>
          <p>7. During this state of things ambassadors came from the <lb/>
            people of Sinope, who were in fear about the city of Cotyora, <lb/>
            (for it belonged to them, and the inhabitants paid them <lb/>
            tribute,) and about the land, as they had heard that it was <lb/>
            being ravaged. Having arrived at the camp, they said, <lb/>
            (Hieronymus, who was thought a man of eloquence, speaking <lb/>
            for the rest,) 8. "The people of Sinope, soldiers, have sent us <lb/>
            hither, first of all, to offer you commendation, because, being <lb/>
            Greeks, you have overcome the Barbarians, and next to con­ <lb/>
            gratulate you on haying arrived here safe, as we hear, through <lb/>
            many and great struggles. 9. But we think it right that, as <lb/>
            we ourselves are Greeks, we should receive favour, and not <lb/>
            injury, at the hands of you who are Greeks; for we have <lb/>
            certainly never been aggressors in doing you any ill. 10. The <lb/>
            people of Cotyora are colonists of ours, and we gave them this <lb/>
            land after having taken it from the Barbarians; on which ac­ <lb/>
            count they pay us an appointed tribute, in the same manner <lb/>
            as the people of Cerasus and Trebisond ; so that whatever <lb/>
            evil you do to them, the city of Sinope will consider itself <lb/>
            aggrieved by it. 11. We are now informed that, having en­ <lb/>
            tered the town by force, you are quartered, some of you, in <lb/>
            the houses, and are taking whatever you want from the <lb/>
            neighbourhood without having obtained the people's consent. <lb/>
            12. These proceedings we cannot approve, and, if you eontinue <lb/>
            to act thus, it will be necessary for us to make friends of <lb/>
            Corylas and the Paphlagonians, and whomsoever else we may <lb/>
            be able to attach to us."</p>
          <p>13. In reply to these complaints Xenophon rose up and <lb/>
            spoke in behalf of the army as follows : " We, 0 men of <lb/>
            Sinope, have come hither, content with having preserved our <lb/>
            persons and our arms ; for to bring away spoil with us, and <lb/>
            at the same time to fight with our enemies, was impossible; <lb/>
            14. and now, since we arrived among the Greek cities, (at <lb/>
            Trebisond for example, for there they allowed us to buy,) we <lb/>
            have got our provisions by purchase; and in return for the <lb/>
            honours which they did us, and the presents which they gave <lb/>
            to the army, we paid them every respect, and abstained from <pb n="161"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            injuring any of the Barbarians that were their friends, while <lb/>
            to their enemies, against whom they led us, we did as much <lb/>
            harm as we could. 15. Inquire of them, (for the men, whom, <lb/>
            through friendship, the city sent along with us as guides, are <lb/>
            present here,) what sort of persons they found us. 16 . But <lb/>
            whithersoever we come and find no opportunity of purchas­ <lb/>
            in,-, whether to a country of Barbarians or of Greeks, we <lb/>
            take provisions for ourselves, not tyrannically, but from neces­ <lb/>
            sity. IT. Thus we made the Carduehi, the Taochi, and the <lb/>
            Chaldæans, (not subjects of the king indeed, but very formid­ <lb/>
            able people,) our enemies, by being under the necessity of <lb/>
            taking provisions from them, as they gave us no opportunity <lb/>
            to buy ; is. but the Macrones, since they afforded us every <lb/>
            facility for purchasing that they could, we regarded, though <lb/>
            Barbarians, as friends, and took nothing from them by force. <lb/>
            19. But as for the people of Cotyora, (who, you say, are your <lb/>
            subjects,) for whatever we have taken from them they them­ <lb/>
            selves are to be blamed; for they did not make advances to us <lb/>
            as friends, but, shutting their gates, would neither admit us <lb/>
            within their walls, nor offer us provisions for sale without; <lb/>
            and they alleged that the governor appointed by you was the <lb/>
            cause of these proceedings. 20. With regard to your remark <lb/>
            that we have entered the city and lodged ourselves in it by <lb/>
            force, we requested them to receive our sick under their roofs ; <lb/>
            but, when they would not open their gates, we, effecting an <lb/>
            entrance where the place itself would admit us, 1 committed no <lb/>
            further act of violence ; and the sick now lodge in the houses, <lb/>
            living upon their own means ; while we place a guard at the <lb/>
            gates, only that our disabled soldiers may not be in the hands <lb/>
            of your governor, but that it may be in our power to remove <lb/>
            them when we wish. 21. The rest of us, as you see, are en­ <lb/>
            camped in order in the open air, prepared, if any one does us <lb/>
            a service, to do him a service in return ; if an injury, to defend <lb/>
            ourselves against him. 22. And as to your threat that, if you <lb/>
            think proper, you will make Corylas and the Paphlagonians <lb/>
            your allies against us, be assured that we, if it be necessary <lb/>
            will fight with you both, (for we have already fought with <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Έδέχετο αὐτὸ τὸ χωρίον</foreign>.] Qua nos ipse locus recipiebat : h. e. quà <lb/>

            enemies much more numerous than you,) or, if we think fit, <lb/>
            we will make the Paphlagonian leader our friend, 23. for we <lb/>
            have heard that he covets both your city and all the other <lb/>
            places on the sea. We shall try to become his friends by as­ <lb/>
            sisting him in the attainment of what he desires."</p>
          <p>24. After this speech the colleagues of Hecatonymus testi­ <lb/>
            fied manifest displeasure at what he had said, and another of <lb/>
            them, coming forward, said that they were not come to make <lb/>
            war, but to declare that they were friends. “And if you <lb/>
            come," he continued, “ to the city of Sinope, we will receive <lb/>
            you there, with tokens of friendship, and, for the present, we <lb/>
            will desire the people here to supply you with what they can, <lb/>
            for we see that all that you state is true." 25. The people of <lb/>
            Cotyora then sent presents to the army, and the generals of <lb/>
            the Greeks entertained the ambassadors from Sinope; and <lb/>
            they conversed with one another about many other things that <lb/>
            concerned them, and inquired about such particulars as each <lb/>
            party wanted to know respecting the remainder of the route.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>The Greeks, by the advice of Hccatonymus, resolved to proceed by sea, if <lb/>
            the people of Sinope will send them ships enough for theirconveyance. <lb/>
            A project of Xenophon’s to build a city in Pontus is frustrated bythe <lb/>
            treachery of Silanus. Several of the Greeks are inclined to settle in <lb/>
            Pontus.</p>
          <p>1. SUCH was the end of that day. On the next, the generals <lb/>
            assembled the soldiers, and it was resolved to call in the am­ <lb/>
            bassadors from Sinope and consult them about the rest of <lb/>
            their journey; for, if it should be necessary to proceed by <lb/>
            land, the Sinopeans seemed likely to prove useful as guides, <lb/>
            as they were well acquainted with Paphlagonia ; or if by sea, <lb/>
            it appeared that they would want the aid of the Sinopeans, for <lb/>
            they were the only people that seemed able to furnish a suffi­ <lb/>
            cient number of ships for transporting the army. a. Having <lb/>
            requested the attendance of the ambassadors, therefore, they <lb/>
            asked their opinion, and desired that, being Greeks, they <lb/>
            would in the first place receive them well,' both by being <note type="footnote"> 1 The student will find the original, in this passage, somewhat </note> <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            kind to them as Greeks, and by advising them for the <lb/>
            best.</p>
          <p>3. Hecatonymus, rising up, first stated in apology for his <lb/>
            observation " that they would make the Paphlagonian their <lb/>
            friend," that he had said this. not to imply that they were <lb/>
            going to make war upon the Greeks, but that they would <lb/>
            prefer the friendship of the Greeks though they had the option <lb/>
            of becoming friends to the Barbarians. When they called <lb/>
            upon him to give them his advice, he spoke, with an appeal to <lb/>
            the gods, to the following effect: 4. " If I advise you what <lb/>
            seems to me to be best, may many good things befall me; if <lb/>
            not, things of a contrary nature; for that sort of counsel, <lb/>
            which is said to be sacred,1 appears now to be required; and, <lb/>
            if I shall be thought to have advised you well, there will be <lb/>
            many of you to applaud me, and if ill, many of you to execrate <lb/>
            me. 5. I am aware, then, that we ourselves shall have much <lb/>
            more trouble if you proceed by sea, for it will be necessary for <lb/>
            us to furnish the vessels; while, if you go by land, it will fall <lb/>
            upon you to fight your way. 6. However, I must tell you <lb/>
            what I know ; for I am well acquainted both with the country <lb/>
            of the Paphlagonians and with their strength. As for the <lb/>
            country, it presents many beautiful plains, and mountains of a <lb/>
            very great height; 7. and I know, in the first place, the part <lb/>
            where you must certainly make your entrance into it, for it is <lb/>
            impossible to enter it at any other point than where the peaks <lb/>
            of a mountain rise to a vast height on each side of the road, <lb/>
            which a handful of men in possession of them would be able. <lb/>

            men in the world would be able to force a passage. These I <lb/>
            could show you, if you would send anybody with me. 8. Be­ <lb/>
            yond, I know that there are plains, and a body of cavalry <lb/>
            which the Barbarians themselves think superior to all <lb/>
            the king's cavalry; and, on a recent occasion, they did not <lb/>
            oin him when he summoned them, as their leader1 has too <lb/>
            high a spirit to do so. a. But if you could even pass the <lb/>
            mountains unobserved, or anticipate the enemy in taking pos­ <lb/>
            session of them, and could defeat their cavalry, as well as more <lb/>
            than a hundred and twenty thousand infantry, in battle on the <lb/>
            plain, you would in the next place come to rivers, first to the <lb/>
            Thermodon, three hundred feet in breadth, which I consider <lb/>
            difficult to pass, especially with a large number of enemies <lb/>
            before you, and an equal number following you behind; next <lb/>
            to the Iris, three hundred feet broad also ; and, thirdly, to the <lb/>
            Halys, not less than two furlongs in breadth, which you would <lb/>
            be unable to cross without boats ; and with boats who would <lb/>
            supply you ? The Parthenius, too, at which you would arrive <lb/>
            if you were to pass the Halys, is equally impassable. 10. I <lb/>
            consider this way, therefore, not merely as difficult, but as ab­ <lb/>
            solutely impracticable. But if you go by sea, you may sail <lb/>
            along the coast from hence to Sinope, and from Sinope to <lb/>
            Heraclea; and from Heraclea there will be no difficulty in <lb/>
            proceeding either by land or sea, as there are plenty of vessels <lb/>
            at Heraclea."</p>
          <p>II. When he had given this advice, some suspected that he <lb/>
            had given it through friendship for Corylas, as he was a <lb/>
            public guest-friend of his; others thought that he was to <lb/>
            receive a reward for his counsel; and others, again, imagined <lb/>
            that he had thus advised them, in order that they might not, <lb/>
            by marching through the territory of the Sinopeans, do any <lb/>
            damage to it. The Greeks however gave their votes for going <lb/>
            uy sea.</p>
          <p>12. Xenophon then said, "0 men of Sinope, the soldiers <lb/>
            have chosen the mode of travelling which you advise; and <lb/>
            the matter now stands thus; if the vessels are to be furnished <note type="footnote"> their enemies.” Krüger’s method is the more simple. “ This pass <lb/>
            appears to be situated in the range of mountains which extends <lb/>
            northward into the sea, to form the cape Jasonium, now Yasun <lb/>
            Burnu,” Ainsworth, p. 205. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Corylas. </note> <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6. ] </note> <lb/>
            in sufficient numbers, so that not a man of us be left here, <lb/>
            we will sail; but if some of us are to be left here, and others to <lb/>
            sail, we shall not go on board the vessels at all ; 13. for we are <lb/>
            sure that wherever we are the stronger, we shall be able both <lb/>
            to save ourselves and to get provisions, but that if we are <lb/>
            anywhere found weaker than our enemies, it is quite clear wc <lb/>
            shall be in the condition of slaves." 14. The ambassadors, <lb/>
            on hearing this statement, desired the Greeks to send an <lb/>
            embassy to Sinope. They accordingly sent Callimachus an <lb/>
            Arcadian, Ariston an Athenian, and Samolas an Achæan ; <lb/>
            all of whom immediately set out.</p>
          <p>15. In the mean time, when Xenophon contemplated the <lb/>
            numerous body of heavy-armed Greeks, as well as the great <lb/>
            number of peltasts, archers, slingers, and cavalry, rendered <lb/>
            extremely efficient by exercise, that were now in Pontus, <lb/>
            where so large a force could not be collected without great <lb/>
            expense, it appeared to him that it would be an honourable <lb/>
            undertaking to acquire territory and power for Greece by <lb/>
            founding a city there. 16. He thought that such a city might <lb/>
            became great, when he considered both the number of the <lb/>
            Greeks themselves, and that of the surrounding inhabitants <lb/>
            of Pontus. With reference to this project he offered a sacri­ <lb/>
            fice, summoning to it Silanus of Ambracia, who had been <lb/>
            augur to Cyrus, before he spoke on the subject to any one of <lb/>
            the soldiers. 17. Silanus, fearing that the scheme might take <lb/>
            effect, and that the army might form a settlement somewhere, <lb/>
            spread a report through the army that Xenophon wanted <lb/>
            them all to remain there, and form a city, and thus give him <lb/>
            fame and power. is. But what Silanus himself wished, was <lb/>
            to set off for Greece as soon as possible, as lie had saved the <lb/>
            three thousand darics that he had received from Cyrus, when, <lb/>
            sacrificing for him, he gave a true prediction concerning the <lb/>
            ten days.' 19. As to the soldiers, when they heard of the <lb/>
            matter, some thought it best to stay there, but the majority <lb/>
            were of a different opinion ; and Timasion the Dardanian and <lb/>
            Thorax the Bœotian told some merchants of Heraclea and <lb/>
            Sinope who happened to be there, that if they did not <lb/>
            procure pay for the troops, so that they might have provisions <lb/>
            on the voyage, there would be danger of so great an army <note type="footnote"> 1 i. 7. 18 </note> <pb n="166"/>

            remaining in Pontus; for Xenophon, said they, IS forming <lb/>
            this project, and desires us, when the vessels have arrived, <lb/>
            suddenly to say to the army, 20. “ Soldiers, we observe that <lb/>
            we are now at a loss both how to get provisions for our <lb/>
            voyage, and how to benefit our families on returning home. <lb/>
            But if you are inclined to select some spot, wherever you <lb/>
            please, in the inhabited country around the Euxine, and to <lb/>
            take possession of it, allowing those to go home who are <lb/>
            desirous to go, and those who are willing, to settle here, you <lb/>
            have ships at command, so that you may make a sudden descent <lb/>
            upon any part you may think proper." 21. The merchants, <lb/>
            on hearing this account, communicated it to their cities; and <lb/>
            Timasion the Dardanian sent with them Eurymachus, also a <lb/>
            Dardanian, and Thorax the Bœotian, to make the same state­ <lb/>
            ment. The people of Sinope and Heraclea, as soon as they <lb/>
            learned this, sent to Timasion, and engaged him, on receipt of <lb/>
            a certain sum of money, to use his influence in bringing it to <lb/>
            pass that the army might sail out of the Euxine. 22. lie <lb/>
            willingly listened to this proposal, and made a speech, in an <lb/>
            assembly of the soldiers, to the following purport: " We ought <lb/>
            not to give our thoughts, soldiers, to remaining here; or to <lb/>
            esteem any other country as preferable to Greece. I hear, <lb/>
            however, that certain persons are sacrificing with a view to <lb/>
            this object, without informing you of it. 23. But, if you <lb/>
            will sail out of the Euxine, I engage to give each of you <lb/>
            monthly a stater of Cyzicus 1 as pay, computing from the first <lb/>
            day of the month ; and I will then conduct you to Troas, <lb/>
            from whence I am an exile, and my city shall aid you, for my <lb/>
            countrymen will gladly receive me. 24. I will also guide you <lb/>
            to places from which you may get wealth, for I am well <lb/>
            acquainted with Æolia, Phrygia, Troas, and all the satrapy of <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, partly from being a native of that quarter, and <lb/>
            partly from having served there with Clearchus and Dercyl­ <lb/>
            lidas."</p>
          <p>25. Thorax the Bœotian, who was always contending with <lb/>
            Xenophon for the chief command, immediately2 stood up, and <lb/>
            said, that if they sailed out of the Euxine, there would be <note type="footnote"> 1 Worth about 22s. 9d. according to Hussey, ch. vi. sect. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Dindorf, with most other editors, has <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὺϑις</foreign>. I have thought <lb/>

            such as wished might settle there, and such as were unwilling <lb/>
            to do so, might return home; adding that it was ridiculous, <lb/>
            when there was abundance of rich land in Greece, to seek <lb/>
            settlements in a country of Barbarians. 26. " And until you <lb/>
            arrive there,” said he, " I, as well as Timasion, engage that <lb/>
            you shall have pay." This he said from having learned what <lb/>
            the people of Heraelea and Sinope had promised on condition <lb/>
            that they sailed away. Xenophon, in the mean time, was <lb/>
            silent. 27. Philesius and Lycon, however, both Achæans, <lb/>
            rose up and observed that it was intolerable that Xenophon <lb/>
            should privately persuade the soldiers to remain, and sacrifice <lb/>
            with a view to their stay, not allowing the army to participate <lb/>
            in the sacrifice, and saying nothing on the subject to the <lb/>
            general council. Xenophon was in consequence obliged to <lb/>
            rise and speak as follows :</p>
          <p>28. "I sacrifice, as you see, soldiers, to the best of my <lb/>
            ability, both for you and for myself, in order that I may say, <lb/>
            and think, and do such things as may be most honourable and <lb/>
            advantageous both for yourselves and me ; and I was just now <lb/>
            sacrificing about this very consideration, whether it would bo <lb/>
            better to proceed to speak and treat with you on this subject, <lb/>
            or not to touch on the point at all. 29. Silanus the augur in­ <lb/>
            formed me, what was the most important particular, that the <lb/>
            victims were favourable, but added (for he knew that I was <lb/>
            not unskilled in such matters, from being constantly present <lb/>
            at the sacrifices,) that some fraud and treachery was indicated <lb/>
            against me by the sacrifices, as being conscious, forsooth, that <lb/>
            he himself was treacherously purposing to calumniate me to <lb/>
            you ; for he it was that spread the report that I intended to <lb/>
            carry this scheme into execution without gaining your con­ <lb/>
            sent. 30. If indeed I had seen you in want, I should have <lb/>
            meditated some scheme, of which the result might have been <lb/>
            that you, after possessing yourselves of some town,2 might <lb/>
            flail home, such of you as were inclined, immediately, and such <lb/>
            as were not so, after they had acquired sufficient to be of some <lb/>
            benefit to their families. 31. But since I see the people of <lb/>
            Heraclea and Sinope sending you vessels to sail in, and <note type="footnote"> 1 The Thracian Chersonese. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Π</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">λιν</foreign>.] Haken thinks that Xenophon meditated taking posse­ <lb/>

            individuals here promising you pay from the beginning of the <lb/>
            month, it appears to me an excellent thing for us, after getting <lb/>
            safe where we wish to be, to receive pay for allowing ourselves <lb/>
            to be preserved ;1 and I myself, accordingly, give up this <lb/>
            project, and think that all who have come to me saying that <lb/>
            we ought to act in this manner, should give it up likewise. <lb/>
            32. For what I think is this; that while you continue together, <lb/>
            as at present, in large numbers, you are likely to be held in <lb/>
            honour, and to find provisions, (since in superior strength lies <lb/>
            the privilege of taking what belongs to the weaker ;) but if you <lb/>
            are divided, and your force broken into small bodies, you will <lb/>
            neither be able to procure subsistence, nor effect a departure <lb/>
            to your satisfaction. 33. My opinion, consequently, is the <lb/>
            same with your own, that we ought to set out for Greece, and <lb/>
            that if any one remain here, or be found leaving any one be­ <lb/>
            hind, before the whole army is in a place of safety, he be <lb/>
            brought to trial as a criminal. And by whomsoever," he <lb/>
            added, "these sentiments are approved, let him hold up his <lb/>
            hand." They all held them up.</p>
          <p>34. But Silanus cried out in opposition, and attempted to <lb/>
            show that such as wished to leave the army ought to be <lb/>
            allowed to do so. This proposition however the soldiers would <lb/>
            not endure, but threatened that, if they caught him running <lb/>
            away, they would inflict punishment on him. 35. Soon after, <lb/>
            when the Heracleans learned that it was resolved to sail out <lb/>
            of the Euxine, and that it was Xenophon who had put the <lb/>
            matter to the vote, they sent the ships ; but about the money <lb/>
            for pay, which they had promised to Timasion and Thorax, <lb/>
            they broke their word. 36. In consequence, those who had <lb/>
            engaged for its payment were confounded, and in dread of <lb/>
            the army. Taking with them therefore the rest of the <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μισϑὸν τη̃ς σωτηρίας λαμάνειν</foreign>.] An elegant expression, with a <lb/>

            generals, those at least to whom they had communicated what <lb/>
            they were previously attempting, (and these were all except <lb/>
            Neon of Asina,1 who commanded under Cheirisophus, and <lb/>
            Cheirisophus had not yet returned,) they went to Xenophon, <lb/>
            and told him that they were sorry for what had been done, <lb/>
            and that it seemed the best course to them, since they had <lb/>
            vessels, to sail to the river Phasis, and take possession of the <lb/>
            country of the Phasians, of whom a grandson of Æetes 2 <lb/>
            happened then to be king. 37. Xenophon replied that he <lb/>
            would propose nothing of the sort to the troops, "but assemble <lb/>
            them yourselves," said he, "and lay the matter before them <lb/>
            if you please." Timasion the Dardanian then gave his <lb/>
            opinion that they should not call a general assembly, but that <lb/>
            each of the leaders should endeavour, in the first place, to <lb/>
            persuade his own men. They accordingly went off and put <lb/>
            this plan in execution.</p>

          <p>Xenophon, being accused of encouraging the army to sail to the Phasis, de­ <lb/>
            fends himself in a formal speech, and is the means of bringing certain of <lb/>

          <p>i. THE soldiers now learned that these matters were in <lb/>
            agitation; and Neon of Asina told them that Xenophon, <lb/>
            having brought the other generals over to his side, was re­ <lb/>
            solved to deceive the army and take them back again to the <lb/>
            Phasis. 2. The soldiers, on hearing this account, were great­ <lb/>
            ly displeased, meetings began to be held, and knots collected <lb/>
            among them ; and they gave great reason to fear that they <lb/>
            would act as they had done to the heralds of the Colchians <lb/>

            Xenophon observed this state of things, he thought proper to <lb/>
            call the army immediately together, and not to leave them to <lb/>
            collect of their own accord. He therefore ordered the herald <lb/>
            to summon a general assembly, 4. and the troops, when they <lb/>
            heard the herald’s voice, hastened to the meeting with the <lb/>
            greatest alacrity. Xenophon did not accuse the other generals <lb/>
            of having come to him,1 but addressed the troops thus:</p>
          <p>5. “ I hear, soldiers, that some one accuses me of intending <lb/>
            to deceive you, and to take you to the Phasis. Hear me <lb/>
            therefore, in the name of the gods, and if I appear to have <lb/>
            done wrong, I ought not to depart hence till I have suffered <lb/>
            due punishment; but if, on the contrary, my accusers are <lb/>
            proved to be in the wrong, treat them, I beseech you, as they <lb/>
            deserve. 6. You doubtless know," he continued, " where the <lb/>
            sun rises and where it sets, and that whoever intends to go <lb/>
            to Greece must proceed towards the west, and whoever would <lb/>
            go to the Barbarians, in the contrary direction towards the east; <lb/>
            and is there any one, then, who would be able deceitfully to <lb/>
            persuade you that the sun rises in this quarter and sets in that, <lb/>
            sets here, and rises there ? 2 7. You also know that the north <lb/>
            wind carries you out of the Euxine Sea towards Greece, and. <lb/>
            the south wind inwards towards the Phasis ; and you exclaim, <lb/>
            when the north wind blows, that it is fair sailing for Greece. <lb/>
            Is it possible, then, that any one could deceive you with re­ <lb/>
            gard to this, to induce you to embark when the south wind is <lb/>
            blowing? But you will say, perhaps, I shall put you on <lb/>

            you who have been deceived, will be nearly ten thousand; <lb/>

            concerning himself and you ? 10. But these charges proceed <lb/>
            from foolish men, and men who are jealous of me because I <lb/>

            11. What I have said, however, upon this point, is sufficient. <lb/>
            But if any one of you thinks that he could of himself have <lb/>
            been deceived in this matter, or that any other person could <lb/>
            have deceived him in it,2 let him speak and make known his <lb/>

            perse until you have heard something of a sort of conduct, <lb/>
            which, I perceive, is beginning to show itself among the <lb/>

            it is time for us to consider about ourselves, that we may not <lb/>

            to be the basest and most infamous of all men, and bring our­ <lb/>
            selves utterly into contempt." 13. The soldiers, on hearing <lb/>
            these words, wondered what the matter could be, and desired <lb/>
            him to proceed. He accordingly resumed his speech : “ Yoti <lb/>
            are aware that there were some places upon the mountains <lb/>
            belonging to the Barbarians, and in alliance with the people <lb/>
            of Cerasus, from which some of the inhabitants came down <lb/>

            sus. 17. These occurrences happened on the day on which <lb/>
            we set out hither from Cerasus by land, and while some of <lb/>
            those who were to sail1 along the coast were still at Cerasus, <lb/>
            not having as yet weighed anchor. After this, as the people <lb/>
            of Cerasus state, three of the older men came from the place, <lb/>
            desiring to have an interview with our common assembly. <lb/>
            is. As they did not find us, they told the people of Cerasus <lb/>
            that they wondered why we had thought of attacking them. <lb/>
            The people of Cerasus, however, said that when they told. <lb/>
            them that the outrage had not been committed by public au­ <lb/>
            thority, they were delighted, and were going to sail hither to <lb/>
            give us an account of what had happened, and to invite those <lb/>
            who wished it to take their dead and bury them. 19. But <lb/>
            some of the Greeks that had fled happened to be still at Ce­ <lb/>
            rasus, and discovering whither the Barbarians were going, <lb/>
            had the daring to throw stones at them themselves, and en­ <lb/>
            couraged others to do the same. Thus these men, the three <lb/>
            deputies, were stoned to death.</p>
          <p>20. “ When this crime was committed, some of the people <lb/>
            of Cerasus came to us, and gave us an account of the affair. <lb/>
            We, the generals, on listening to it, were greatly concerned at <lb/>
            what had happened, and consulted with the men from Cerasus <lb/>
            how the dead Greeks might be buried. 21. As we were sit­ <lb/>
            ting in council, outside the quarters of the heavy-armed men, <lb/>
            we suddenly heard a great outcry of voices, ‘ Strike, strike, <lb/>
            throw, throw !' and immediately saw a great number of men <lb/>
            running together with stones in their hands, and others pick­ <note type="footnote">' <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̄ν πλεόνυων</foreign>. ] See c. 4, sect. 1; c. 3. sect. I </note> <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            ing them up. 22. The people of Cerasus, as having witnessed <lb/>
            what had happened among themselves, retreated in fear to their <lb/>
            vessels ; and there were some of us, by Jove, who were also <lb/>
            in fear. 23. I, for my part, went up to them, and asked them <lb/>
            what the matter was. Some of them knew nothing about it; <lb/>
            and yet had stones in their hands. When at length I met <lb/>
            with one who did know, he told me that the commissaries of <lb/>
            the market were treating the army in a manner not to be en­ <lb/>
            dured. 24. At this moment one of the soldiers perceived the <lb/>
            commissary Zetarchus retreating towards the sea, and called <lb/>
            out; the rest, hearing the cry, rushed towards him as if a wild <lb/>
            boar or a stag had appeared. 25. The men of Cerasus, seeing <lb/>
            the soldiers hurrying in their direction, and thinking that they <lb/>
            were coming to attack them, fled in all haste, and threw them­ <lb/>
            selves into the sea; when some of our men threw themselves <lb/>
            in likewise, and such as did not know how to swim were <lb/>
            drowned. 26. Why do you think that these men fled ? They <lb/>
            had done no wrong; but they were afraid that some madness, <lb/>
            like that of dogs, must have seized our men. If things are to <lb/>
            go on thus, consider what will be the state of our army. 27. <lb/>
            You, as a body, will not have the privilege either of commencing <lb/>
            war with whom you please, or of breaking it off, but every <lb/>
            man that chooses may lead off troops of his own will, on <lb/>
            whatever enterprise he thinks proper. And if any deputies <lb/>
            come to you, to ask for peace or anything else, whoever <lb/>
            pleases may, by putting them to death, prevent you from hear­ <lb/>
            ing the requests of those who apply to you. as. Besides, those <lb/>
            whom you have all elected generals, will then be of no au­ <lb/>
            thority, but whoever may elect himself general, and be inclined <lb/>
            to cry ' Throw, throw,' will be able to put to death either <lb/>
            officer or private among you, whomsoever he pleases, without <lb/>
            a trial, at least if men be found, as in this recent instance, to <lb/>
            obey him.</p>
          <p>29. " Consider, too, what these self-elected leaders have <lb/>
            done for you. If Zelarchus the commissary has done you <lb/>
            any wrong, he has sailed off without making any atonement <lb/>
            to you ; if he has done you none, he has fled from the camp <lb/>
            for fear of being put to death unjustly and without trial. 30. <lb/>
            Those who stoned the deputies have made it unsafe for you <lb/>
            alone, of all the Greeks, to go to Cerasus, unless with a power­ <lb/>
            ful force; and with regard to the dead, whom, previously <pb n="174"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. V. </note> <lb/>
            those that killed them invited you to bury, they have rendered <lb/>
            it no longer safe for you to carry them off, even though attended <lb/>
            with a herald's staff. Who, indeed, that has killed heralds, <lb/>
            will be willing to go as a herald ? However, we have requested <lb/>
            the people of Cerasus to bury them.</p>
          <p>31. "If these proceedings be right, let them be sanctioned <lb/>
            by you, in order that, as such conduct is to be pursued, every <lb/>
            man may procure a guard for himself, and endeavour to pitch <lb/>
            his tent in a strong and advantageous position.' 32. But if <lb/>
            such acts appear to you rather those of wild beasts than of <lb/>
            men, contrive some mode of putting a stop to them; or, if <lb/>
            J'on do not, how, in the name of Jupiter, shall we sacrifice to <lb/>
            the gods with any satisfaction, while we are guilty of impious <lb/>
            deeds ? Or how shall we fight with our enemies, if we kill <lb/>
            one another ?2 33. Or what city will receive us with friend­ <lb/>
            ship, that sees such lawlessness among us? Or who, with <lb/>
            any confidence, will offer us provisions for sale, if we are <lb/>
            found to offend in things of such moment ?3 Or, in the coun­ <lb/>
            try where we expected to obtain the praise of all, who will <lb/>
            praise us if we bear such a character ? For I am very certain <lb/>
            that we should pronounce others, who should be guilty of such <lb/>
            acts, to be bad men."</p>
          <p>34. In consequence they all stood up and said that the <lb/>
            leaders in these proceedings should suffer punishment ; that <lb/>
            for the future it should be forbidden to enter upon any law­ <lb/>
            lessness of the kind, and that whoever attempted any, should <lb/>
            be put to death ; that the generals should bring all such per <lb/>

            person had been wronged in any way since Cyrus was killed. <lb/>

            Xenophon, too, and with the concurrence of the augurs, it <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>A resolution is passed that the generals shall give an account of their con­ <lb/>
            duct. Xenophon is accused by some of the soldiers of having inflicted <lb/>
            stripes upon them. Xenophon acknowledges the facts, but amply justi­ <lb/>
            fies his conduct.</p>
          <p>1. IT was resolved also that the generals should give an <lb/>
            account of their conduct during the time past; and when <lb/>
            they gave it, Philesius and Xanthicles were condemned, for <lb/>
            their negligent custody of the cargoes of the merchant ships,1 <lb/>
            to pay the sum that was deficient, namely, each twenty minæ ;2 <lb/>
            and Sophænetus was fined ten minæ, because, being chosen a <lb/>
            general, he had neglected his duty.</p>
          <p>Some also brought accusations against Xenophon, alleging <lb/>
            that they had been beaten by him ; and made their charges <lb/>
            on the ground that his conduct had been tyrannical. 2. <lb/>
            Xenophon, standing up, called upon him who had spoken first3 <lb/>
            to say where he had been beaten. He replied, " Where we <lb/>
            were perishing with the cold, and where the greatest fall of <lb/>
            snow was." 3. Xenophon rejoined, "If, during such severe <lb/>
            weather as you mention, when provisions were failing us, <lb/>
            when we had not wine even to smell to,4 when many of us <lb/>

            Did I ask you for anything, and beat you when you would <lb/>
            not give it me ? Or did I demand anything back from you, <lb/>
            or was I fighting about any object of affection, or did I abuse <lb/>
            you in a fit of Intoxication ?" 5. As lie said that there was <lb/>
            nothing of this kind, Xenophon asked him whether lie was <lb/>
            one of the heavy-armed men ? He answered, “ No." Whether <lb/>
            he was one of the peltasts? He said that he was not, but <lb/>
            was a free-man, set to drive a mule by his comrades. 6. <lb/>
            Xenophon now recognised him, and asked him, “ Are you the <lb/>
            man that was carrying the sick person ?" "I certainly am," <lb/>
            replied he, "for you compelled me to do so, and scattered <lb/>
            about the baggage of my comrades." 7. “ The scattering," <lb/>
            rejoined Xenophon, "was something in this way; I distri­ <lb/>
            buted it to others to carry, and directed them to bring it to <lb/>
            me again ; and, on receiving it, I restored it all safe to you, <lb/>
            after you had produced the man that I gave you in charge. <lb/>
            But hear," he continued, " how the affair happened ; for it is <lb/>
            worth your while. s. A man was left behind because he was <lb/>
            no longer able to continue his march; I knew nothing of the <lb/>
            man but that he was one of us; and I obliged you to carry <lb/>
            hiin, that he might not perish; for, as I believe, the enemy <lb/>
            were in pursuit of us." This the man acknowledged. a. <lb/>
            "Then," said Xenophon, “ after I had ordered you to go be­ <lb/>
            fore, I soon overtook you, and found you, as I came up with <lb/>
            the rear-guard, digging a pit for the purpose of burying the <lb/>
            man ; when I stopped and commended you. 10. But as the <lb/>
            man, while we stood by, drew in his leg, all who were present <lb/>
            cried out that he was alive; and you said, ‘He may be as <lb/>
            much alive as he likes, for I shall not carry him.' Upon this <lb/>
            I struck you ; you say but the truth ; for you seemed to me <lb/>
            to have been aware1 that the man was alive." 11. "What <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύϱιϭτότατόν ϭε ὄντα</foreign>. Piscat. 34: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϭελγεϭτέρους τω̃ν ὄνων</foreign>. Kiihner. <lb/>
            The latter quotation however is to be understood de libidine, <lb/>
            with which, as Schneider observes, we have nothing to do here, <lb/>
            the allusion being only to the malice of the animal, which it will <lb/>
            exhibit even under the greatest sufferings. “ Everybody knows," <lb/>
            says Spelman, “ that asses, and mules their offspring, have such an <lb/>
            inbred viciousness that no fatigue can subdue it." Spelman may <lb/>
            he rather too positive in saying that everybody knows; but the pro­ <lb/>
            verb shows that such notion must have prevailed among the Greeks. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 —<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδότ. ἐρικέναι</foreign>. "You seemed to me to be like one <lb/>

            then," exclaimed the accuser, "did he the less die, after I had <lb/>
            shown him to you ? " “ We shall all die," rejoined Xenc­ <lb/>
            phon, "but must we for that reason be buried alive?" 12. <lb/>
            At this all the assembly cried out that Xenophon had not <lb/>
            beaten him enough.</p>
          <p>He then called upon the rest to state on what account each <lb/>
            of them had been struck. is. But as none of them stood for­ <lb/>
            ward, he said, “ I acknowledge, fellow-soldiers, that I have <lb/>
            beaten men for leaving their ranks ; such men as were con­ <lb/>
            tent to be saved by our exertions, and, while we marched in <lb/>
            order and fought where it was necessary, tried, by quitting <lb/>
            their places, and hurrying on before us, to get plunder, and <lb/>
            gain in that respect an advantage over us. Had we all acted <lb/>
            in this way, we should all have perished. 14. I also struck <lb/>
            some, and forced them to march, who were giving way to in­ <lb/>
            action, unwilling to rise, and abandoning themselves to the <lb/>
            enemy ; for I myself, when I was onee waiting, during tIle <lb/>
            excessive cold, for some of the men to pack up their baggage, <lb/>
            and had sat for a considerable time, found that I could hardly <lb/>
            get up and stretch my legs. 15. Having therefore had ex­ <lb/>
            perience in my own person, whenever afterwards I saw any <lb/>
            other sitting down and indulging in sloth, I drove him on ; <lb/>
            for motion and manful exertion created a certain warmth and <lb/>
            suppleness, but sitting and inaction, I observed, contributed <lb/>
            to the congealing of the blood, and the mortification of the <lb/>
            toes, which you know that many have suffered. 16. Others, <lb/>
            perhaps, who had loitered behind from indolence, and who <lb/>
            hindered both you who were in front, and us who were in the <lb/>
            rear, from advancing, I may have struck with my fist, that <lb/>
            they might not be struck with the spear of the enemy. 17. <lb/>
            Those, therefore, who have thus been preserved, may now, if <lb/>
            they have suffered anything from me contrary to justice, ob­ <lb/>
            tain redress; but if they had fallen into the hands of the <lb/>
            enemy, what injury could they have suffered of such magni­ <lb/>

            from a love of tyranny, consider that I have now, through the <lb/>
            favour of the gods, more spirit than I had then, and am <lb/>

            the steersman angry with those in the stern, because, in such <lb/>
            circumstances, even small mistakes are sufficient to ruin every­ <lb/>
            thing? 21. Even you yourselves, however, have pronounced <lb/>

          <p>The Greeks receive an embassy from the satrap of Paphlagonia, with whom <lb/>
            they make peace. They sail from Cotyora to Sinope, where they deter­ <lb/>

            the office; and they then choose Cheirisopitus, who had just returned <lb/>
            with vessels from Anaxibius.</p>
          <p>1. FROM this time the Greeks, during their stay here, sub­ <lb/>

            on their part, secretly intercepted, and with great adroitness, <lb/>

            feelings toward each other. 2. Corylas, however, who was <lb/>
            then governor of Paphlagonia, sent deputies to the Greeks with <lb/>
            horses and beautiful robes, to say that “ Corylas was desirous <lb/>
            neither to injure the Greeks nor to receive injury from them." <lb/>
            3. The generals replied, that “ they would consider of the <lb/>
            matter with the army but received them, at the same time, <lb/>
            with hospitality, and invited such of the officers as they <lb/>
            thought most eligible1 to meet them ; 4. when, having killed <lb/>
            some of the oxen that they had captured, and other cattle, <lb/>
            they set before them a plentiful entertainment, of which they <lb/>
            partook reclining on mats made of grassy and drank out of <lb/>
            horn cups which they had found in the country.</p>
          <p>5. As soon as the libations were over, and they had sung <lb/>
            the pæan, two Thracians rose up, and danced in full armour, <lb/>
            to the sound of a pipe ; they leaped very high, and with great <lb/>
            agility, and wielded their swords; and at last one struck the <lb/>
            other, in such a manner that every one thought he had killed <lb/>
            him, 6. (he fell, however, artfully,) and the Paphlagonians <lb/>
            cried out; the other, having despoiled him of his arms, went <lb/>
            out singing the Sitalces;3 while other Thracians carried <lb/>
            off the man as if lie had been dead; though indeed he had <lb/>
            suffered no hurt. 7. Afterwards some Ænians and Magnesi­ <lb/>
            ans stood up, and danced what they call the Carpæan4 dance, <lb/>
            in heavy arms. 8. The nature of the dance was as follows. <lb/>
            One man, having laid aside his arms, sows, and drives a yoke <lb/>
            of oxen, frequently turning to look back as if he were afraid. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δικαιοτάτους</foreign>. Such as had the best claim or title to be invited, <lb/>

            sung the pæan, and danced in the same manner as in the pro­ <lb/>

            their astonishment that all the dances were performed in <lb/>

            when they replied that it was the women who had driven the <lb/>

            tainments for that night.</p>
          <p>14. Next day the generals brought the deputies before the <lb/>
            army ; and it was resolved by the soldiers that they would <lb/>
            neither injure the Paphlagonians nor suffer any injury from <lb/>
            them." The deputies then took their departure ; and the <lb/>
            Greeks, as a sufficient number of ships seemed to be ready, <lb/>
            went on board, and sailed all that day and the following night, <lb/>
            with a fair wind, keeping Paphlagonia on the left; 15. and <lb/>
            the day after, they arrived at Sinope, and east anchor in Har­ <lb/>
            mene, the harbour of that city. The Sinopeans are situate in <lb/>
            the Paphlagonian territory, but are colonists of the Milesians. <lb/>
            They sent the Greeks, as a mark of hospitality, three thousand <lb/>
            medimni 2 of flour, and fifteen hundred ceramia 3 of wine. 16. <lb/>
            Here Cheirisophus now arrived with some galleys: the soldiers <lb/>
            expected that he was bringing them something; but he <lb/>
            brought them nothing. He announced however that Anaxi­ <lb/>
            bius the admiral, and the rest of the Lacedæmonians, gave <lb/>
            them great praise ; and that Anaxibius4 engaged, if they would <lb/>

            considered that they were now near Greece, it became an <lb/>

            if they made choice of one general, that single person would <lb/>
            be better able to manage the army, whether by night or day, <lb/>
            than it was managed under the existing government of several; <lb/>
            so that if it should be necessary for them, in any ease, to <lb/>

            and if to anticipate the movements of the enemy, they would <lb/>

            had hitherto done everything by the vote of the majority.. <lb/>
            19. While they were contemplating this scheme, they turned <lb/>
            their thoughts to Xenophon ; and the captains came to him <lb/>
            and said that the army was of this opinion, and each, express­ <lb/>
            ing his good-will towards him, endeavoured to induce him to <lb/>
            undertake the command. 20. Xenophon was in some degred <lb/>
            inclined to listen to the proposal, when he reflected that, by <lb/>
            this means, greater honour would fall to him, that his name <lb/>
            would reach his friends and his country with greater glory, <lb/>
            and that possibly he might also be the cause of some advan­ <lb/>
            tage to the army. 21. Such considerations influenced him to <lb/>
            desire to become commander-in-chief. But when, on the <lb/>
            other hand, he remembered how uncertain it is to all men <lb/>
            what the future will produce, and that, consequently, he would <lb/>
            be in danger of losing the reputation which he had already <lb/>
            acquired, he felt uncertain how to act.</p>
          <p>22. While he was perplexed as to his decision, it appeared <lb/>
            to him that the best thing that he could do was to lay the <lb/>
            matter before the gods; and having placed by the altar two <lb/>
            victims,2 he sacrificed to Jupiter the King, who had been <lb/>
            pointed out to him as the god that he should consult, by the <lb/>
            oracle at Delphi; and he thought that he had received from <lb/>
            that god the dream which he saw, when he was first appointed <lb/>
            to take charge of the army. 23. He called to mind also, that <lb/>
            when he was going from Ephesus to join Cyrus, an eagle <lb/>
            cried on his right, in a sitting posture however, which, as the <lb/>
            augur, who accompanied him, said, was an omen portending <lb/>
            something great, above the fortunes of a private individual; <lb/>
            foretelling what was honourable, but toilsome, since other <lb/>
            birds attack the eagle chiefly when sitting; and he added <lb/>
            that the omen was not at all indicative of gain, as the eagle <lb/>
            mostly secured prey when flying. 24. While he was sacri­ <lb/>
            ficing on the present occasion, the god clearly directed him <lb/>
            not to seek any additional command, and not to accept it if <lb/>
            they should elect him ; and this was the issue of the matter. <lb/>
            is. The army however came together, and all suggested that <lb/>
            one commander should be chosen; and, as it was resolved to <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Έκ τη̄ς νικώσης</foreign>.] Sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμης</foreign>, from the prevailing opinion <unclear/> <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            do so, they proposed Xenophon. As it seemed evident too <lb/>
            that they would elect him, if any one should put it to the <lb/>
            vote, he rose up and spoke as follows : 26. “My fellow-soldiers, <lb/>
            I am delighted, as I have the feelings of a man, at receiving <lb/>
            honour from you, and am grateful for it, and pray that the <lb/>
            gods may grant me to be the author of some advantage to <lb/>
            you ; but that I should be preferred to be your leader, when a <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian is present, appears likely to be of no advan­ <lb/>
            tage either to you or me; on the contrary, it seems probable <lb/>
            that if you should require assistance from them, you would <lb/>
            on this very account be less likely to obtain it. I moreover <lb/>
            think such dignity by no means safe for me; 27. for I see <lb/>
            that the Lacedæmonians never ceased making war on my <lb/>
            country until they made the whole people acknowledge that <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians were masters of them as well as of others;1 <lb/>
            28. though, when they made this confession, they at once <lb/>
            desisted from hostilities, and no longer besieged the city. If <lb/>
            therefore, seeing this state of things, I should seem, where I <lb/>
            have the power, to render their supremacy uninfluential, I am <lb/>
            apprehensive lest I should very soon be reminded of my duty <lb/>
            29. As to your opinion, that there will be less faction among <lb/>
            you under one commander than under many, be assured that, <lb/>
            if you choose another, you will not find me factious; for I <lb/>
            consider that he who in war quarrels with his commander, <lb/>
            quarrels with his own safety; whereas, if you should elect <lb/>
            me, I should not wonder if you should find people show <lb/>
            resentment against both you and myself."</p>
          <p>30. After he had thus spoken, far more persons than before <lb/>
            rose up, and said that he ought to take upon him the com­ <lb/>
            mand. Agasias of Stymphalus said that it would be ridiculous <lb/>
            if things should be in such a state, since the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            might then be enraged even if a party met to sup together <lb/>
            did not choose a Lacedæmonian as president of their ban­ <lb/>
            quet. " If such be the case," added he, "it is not proper even <lb/>
            tor us, it would seem, to be captains, because we are Arcadians." <lb/>
            Upon this the assembly showed by a murmur their opinion <lb/>
            that Agasias had spoken well.</p>
          <p>31. Xenophon, seeing that there was need of something <note type="footnote"> I Alluding to the consequences of the Peloponnesian war, by which <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            additional on his part, came forward and said, " But, my <lb/>
            fellow-soldiers, that you may be fully informed on this subject, <lb/>
            I swear to you by all the gods and goddesses, that after 1 <lb/>
            learned your inclination, I sought to ascertain by sacrifice <lb/>
            whether it would be better for you to confer this command <lb/>
            upon me, and for me to undertake it, or not; and they gave <lb/>
            me such manifest signs, by the victims, that even an untaught <lb/>
            person1 would have understood that I ought to decline the <lb/>
            command." 32. They in consequence chose Cheirisophus, <lb/>
            who, when he was elected, stood forward and said, “ Be as­ <lb/>
            sured of this, my fellow-soldiers, that I should have made no <lb/>
            factious opposition, if you had chosen another. However,” <lb/>
            added he, "you have done a service to Xenophon by not <lb/>
            electing him, as Dexippus2 has recently been accusing him <lb/>
            to Anaxibius, as far as he could, although I tried as much as <lb/>
            possible to silence him. Dexippus3 also said that he thought <lb/>
            Xenophon 3 would rather be joined in command with Timasion, <lb/>
            a Dardanian, over the army of Clearchus, than with himself, <lb/>
            a Lacedæmonian. 33. But,” he continued, “ since you have <lb/>
            chosen me, I will endeavour, on my part, to do you all the <lb/>
            service that I can. Prepare yourselves, accordingly, to sail <lb/>
            to-morrow, if it be weather for sailing. Our course will be <lb/>
            for Heraclea, and it is incumbent on you all to do your <lb/>
            utmost to reach it. Of other matters we will consider when <lb/>
            we have arrived there."</p>
          <p>CHAPTER II.</p>
          <p>The Greeks sail to Heraclea, where disagreements arise among them, and <lb/>
            they separate into three parties; one, the most numerous, formed of <lb/>
            Arcadians and Achæans, who create for themselves ten captains; a second <lb/>
            attached to Cheirisophus; and a third to Xenophon.</p>
          <p>1. WEIGHING anchor from hence the next day, they sailed <lb/>
            with a fair wind along the coast for two days. In their <note type="footnote"> 1 A private person; a person who was nnt a profes­ <lb/>

            show his willingness to act with Clearchus in what is related iii <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            course they saw the Beach of Jason, where the Argo is said <lb/>
            to have been moored; and the mouths of certain rivers, first <lb/>
            that of the Thermodon, then that of the Iris, next that of the <lb/>
            Halys, and finally that of the Parthenius. After sailing by <lb/>
            the last, they arrived at Heraclea, a Greek city, a colony of <lb/>
            Megara, situate in the territory of the Maryandyni. 2. They <lb/>
            came to anchor near the Acherusian Peninsula, where Her­ <lb/>
            cules is said to have gone down to bring up the dog Cerberus, <lb/>
            and where they now show marks of his descent to the depth <lb/>
            of more than two stadia. 3. The people of Heraclea sent <lb/>
            the Greeks, as tokens of hospitality, three thousand medimni1 <lb/>
            of barley-meal, and two thousand ceramia2 of wine, with <lb/>
            twenty oxen and a hundred sheep. Here a river named <lb/>
            Lycus runs through the plain, in breadth about two hundred <lb/>
            feet.</p>
          <p>4. The soldiers, assembling together began to deliberate, <lb/>
            with regard to the rest of the way, whether it were proper <lb/>
            to proceed by land or sea, until they were beyond the Euxine. <lb/>
            Lycon, an Achæan, rising up, said, " I wonder at the generals, <lb/>
            my fellow-soldiers, for not endeavouring to procure us money <lb/>
            to buy provisions; for the presents received will not furnish <lb/>
            subsistence to the army for three days ; nor is there any <lb/>
            place from whence we can get provisions as we proceed on <lb/>
            our journey. It appears to me, therefore, that we ought to <lb/>
            ask of the people of Heraclea not less than three thousand <lb/>
            Cyzicene staters."3 5. Another exclaimed, "Not less than <lb/>
            ten thousand," and proposed that, having chosen deputies, we <lb/>
            should send them at once to the city, while we were sitting <lb/>
            there, and hear what report they brought, and take measures <lb/>
            accordingly. 6. They then proposed, as deputies, first Chei­ <lb/>
            risophus, because he was general-in-chief, and others then <lb/>
            named Xenophon; but both resolutely refused; for they <lb/>
            concurred in opinion that they ought not to compel a Greek <lb/>
            city, and one in friendship with them, to supply them with <lb/>
            anything that the inhabitants did not offer of their own <lb/>
            accord. 7. As they showed themselves resolved, therefore, <lb/>
            not to go, the army sent Lycon the Achæan, Callimachus a <lb/>
            Parrhasian, and Agasias of Stymphalus; who, going to the <lb/>
            town, informed the people of the resolutions just passed. It <lb/>
            waS said, too, that Lycon even threatened them with violence, <note type="footnote"> I vi. l. 15. </note><note type="footnote">2 vi. 1. 15. </note><note type="footnote">3 v. 6. 23. </note> <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            if they did not comply with these demands. 8. The Heracleans <lb/>
            listened to them, and said that they would consider of the <lb/>
            matter, and then immediately collected their property out of <lb/>
            the fields, and conveyed the provisions exposed for sale into <lb/>
            the city. At the same time the gates were shut, and armed <lb/>
            men appeared upon the walls.</p>
          <p>9. In consequence, the authors of these dissensions accused <lb/>
            the generals of having defeated their plan ; and the Arcadians <lb/>
            and Achæans began to hold meetings together, Callimachus <lb/>
            the Parrhasian and Lycon the Achæan being mostly at their <lb/>
            head. 10. The remarks among them were, that it was dis­ <lb/>
            graceful that one Athenian, who had brought no force to the <lb/>
            army, should have the command of Peloponnesians and Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians ; that they had the labour, and others the profit, <lb/>
            although they themselves had secured the general safety ; for <lb/>
            that those who had accomplished this object were Arcadians <lb/>
            and Achæans, and that the rest of the army was compara­ <lb/>
            tively nothing; (and in reality more than half the army were <lb/>
            Arcadians and Achæans ;) 11. and therefore these, they said, if <lb/>
            they were wise, should unite together, and, choosing leaders <lb/>
            for themselves, should proceed on their way separately, and <lb/>
            endeavour to secure themselves something to their profit. 12. <lb/>
            To this proposal assent was given; and whatever Arcadians <lb/>
            and Achæans were with Cheirisophus, leaving him and <lb/>
            Xenophon, united with the rest, and all chose ten captains of <lb/>
            their own; and they appointed that these should carry into <lb/>
            execution whatever should be decided by the vote of the ma­ <lb/>
            jority. The command of Cheirisophus over the whole army <lb/>
            was thus ended on the sixth or seventh day after he had been <lb/>
            elected.</p>
          <p>13. Xenophon was inclined to pursue his way in company <lb/>
            with them, thinking that this method would be safer than for <lb/>
            each to proceed separately. But Neon persuaded him to go by <lb/>
            himself, as having heard from Cheirisophus that Cleander the <lb/>
            governor of Byzantium had said that he would come with some <lb/>
            galleys to the harbour of Calpe; 14. and he gave Xenophon <lb/>
            this advice, therefore, in order that no one else might take <lb/>
            advantage of this opportunity, but that they themselves only, <lb/>
            and their own soldiers, might sail on board these galleys. As for <lb/>
            Cheirisophus, who was both disheartened at what had oc­ <lb/>
            curred, and who from that time conceived a disgust at the <pb n="188"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI </note> <lb/>
            army, he allowed Xenophon to act as he thought proper. 15. <lb/>
            Xenophon was also inclined to detach himself from the army <lb/>
            altogether, and to sail away ; but as he was sacrificing to <lb/>
            Hercules the Conductor, and consulting him whether it would <lb/>
            be better and more advisable to march in company with such <lb/>
            of the soldiers as remained, or to take leave of them, the god sig­ <lb/>
            nified by the victims that he should march with them. 16. The <lb/>
            army was thus divided into three bodies; the Arcadians and <lb/>
            Achæans, to the number of more than four thousand five hun­ <lb/>
            dred men, all heavy-armed; the heavy-armed with Cheiriso­ <lb/>
            phus, in number fourteen hundred, with seven hundred pel­ <lb/>
            tasts, the Thracians of Clearchus; and seventeen hundred <lb/>
            heavy-armed men, with three hundred peltasts, under Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, who was the only one that had any cavalry, a body of <lb/>
            about forty horsemen.</p>
          <p>17. The Arcadians, having procured ships from the people <lb/>
            of Heraclea, were the first to set sail, with the view of getting <lb/>
            as much booty as they could by making a sudden descent upon <lb/>
            the Bithynians, and accordingly disembarked at the harbour <lb/>
            of Calpe, somewhere about the middle of Thrace, is. Chei­ <lb/>
            risophus, proceeding straight from the city of Heraclea, <lb/>
            marched through the territory belonging to it; but when h. <lb/>
            entered Thrace, he kept along near the sea, for he was then <lb/>
            in ill-health. 19. Xenophon, having obtained vessels, landed on <lb/>
            the confines of Thrace and the region of Heraclea, and pur­ <lb/>
            sued his way through the inland parts.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The Arcadians land at Calpe, and make an incursion into the territory of <lb/>
            the Bithynians, where they are defeated by the enemy, and in danger of <lb/>
            being cut to pieces; Xenophon proceeds to rescue them. All the Greeks <lb/>
            join Cheirisophus at Calpe.</p>
          <p>1 I. EACH of these three parties fared as follows. The Ar­ <lb/>
            cadians, disembarking by night at the port of Calpe, marched <note type="footnote"> 1 Two or three lines, which occur in some copies at the beginning <lb/>

            off to attack the nearest villages, lying about thirty stadia <lb/>
            from the sea. As soon as it was light, each of the officers led <lb/>
            his own division against a village; but against any village <lb/>
            that appeared larger than the rest, they led two divisions <lb/>
            together. 2. They fixed also upon a hill on which they were <lb/>
            all to re-assemble. As they fell upon the people unexpectedly, <lb/>
            they seized a great number of slaves and surrounded several <lb/>
            flocks of cattle.</p>
          <p>A. But the Thracians,1 as fast as they escaped, collected <lb/>
            themselves into a body; and, as they were light-armed, the <lb/>
            number that escaped, even from the very hands of the heavy- <lb/>
            armed men, was great. As soon as they were collected, they <lb/>
            proceeded, in the first place, to fall upon the division of Smi­ <lb/>
            cres, one of the Arcadian captains, who was marching away <lb/>
            to the place agreed upon, and carrying with him considerable <lb/>
            booty. 5. For a while the Greeks defended themselves as <lb/>
            they pursued their march, but, as they were crossing a ravine, <lb/>
            the Thracians put them to the rout, and killed Smicres and <lb/>
            all his party. Of another division of the ten captains, too, <lb/>
            that of Hegesander, they left only eight men alive, Hegesander <lb/>
            himself being one of those that escaped. 6. The other cap­ <lb/>
            tains joined him at the appointed spot, some with difficulty, <lb/>
            and others without any.2 The Thracians, however, in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of having met with this success, cheered on one <lb/>
            another, and assembled in great spirits during the night. At <lb/>
            day-break, numbers of horsemen and peltasts ranged them­ <lb/>
            selves in a circle round the hill upon which the Greeks had <lb/>
            encamped; 7. and as more came flocking to them, they at­ <lb/>
            tacked the heavy-armed men without danger, for the Greeks <lb/>
            had neither archers, nor javelin-men, nor a single horseman, <lb/>
            while the Thracians, running and riding up, hurled their <lb/>
            darts among them, and when the Greeks offered to attack <lb/>
            them, retreated with ease. 8. Some attempted one part, and <lb/>
            some another; and many of the assailed were wounded, but <lb/>
            none of the assailants. The Greeks were in consequence un­ <lb/>
            able to move from the spot, and at last the Thracians cut <note type="footnote"> 1 The Asiatic or Bithynian Thracians, who inhabited the villages <lb/>

            them off even from water. 9. As their distress was great, <lb/>
            they began to speak of terms of surrender; and other points <lb/>
            were agreed upon between them, but when the Greeks de­ <lb/>
            manded hostages, the Thracians refused to give them; and <lb/>
            upon this the treaty was stopped. Such were the fortunes of <lb/>
            the Arcadians.</p>
          <p>10. Cheirisophus, meanwhile, advancing unmolested along <lb/>
            the coast, arrived at the harbour of Calpe. As for Xenophon, <lb/>
            while he was marching through the middle of the country, <lb/>
            his horsemen, riding on before him, fell in with some am­ <lb/>
            bassadors who were on their journey to some place. As they <lb/>
            were conducted to Xenophon, he inquired of them whether <lb/>
            they had anywhere heard of another Greek army. 11. They <lb/>
            gave him, in reply, an account of all that had occurred, saying <lb/>
            that the Greeks were then besieged upon a hill, and that the <lb/>
            whole force of the Thracians was collected round them. lie <lb/>
            therefore had these men strictly guarded, that they might act <lb/>
            as guides wherever it might be necessary, and then, after <lb/>
            stationing scouts, he called together his soldiers and addressed <lb/>
            them thus:</p>
          <p>12. " Soldiers, some of the Areadians are killed, and others <lb/>
            are besieged upon a hill; and I think that, if they are de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, there will be no hope of safety for us, the enemy <lb/>
            being so numerous and so daring. 13. It seems best for us, <lb/>
            therefore, to march to their relief with all possible speed, that, <lb/>
            if they still survive, we may join with them in their struggle, <lb/>
            and not, being left alone, meet danger alone. 14. Let us for <lb/>
            the present, then, pitch our camp, marching on, however, un­ <lb/>
            til it seems time to sup,1 and whilst we are on the march, let <lb/>
            Timasion, with the horse, ride on before, but keeping us still <lb/>
            in sight, and let him reconnoitre the country in front, that <lb/>
            nothing may take us by surprise." 15. He despatched, at the <lb/>
            same time, some of the most active of the light-armed men to <lb/>
            the parts on either flank, and to the hills, that if they saw any­ <lb/>
            thing threatening in any quarter, they might give notice of it. <note type="footnote"> 1 "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οσον ὐν δοκη̜̃ καιρὸς εἶναι εἰς τὸ δειπνοποιῑσϑαι</foreign> Only so far, <lb/>
            that they would not be fatigued or exhausted before they went to <lb/>
            supper. This is Weiske's interpretation, and better than Krüger's, <lb/>
            who supposes that Xenophon was thinking of a place for pitching <lb/>
            the camp, not too near to the enemy, lest the troops should be <lb/>
            obliged to fight before they could take their supper. </note> <pb n="191"/>

            He ordered them also to burn whatever combustible matter they <lb/>
            met with ; 16. "for," said he, " we could not flee from hence <lb/>
            to any place of refuge; since it is a long way to go back to <lb/>
            Heraclea, and a long way to go over to Chrysopolis ; and the <lb/>
            enemy are close at hand. To the harbour of Calpe, indeed, <lb/>
            where we suppose Cheirisophus to be, if he is safe, tIle dis­ <lb/>
            tance is but short; but even there, there are neither vessels <lb/>
            in which we can sail from the place, nor subsistence, if we <lb/>
            remain, even for a single day. 17. Should those who are be­ <lb/>
            sieged, however, be left to perish, it will be less advantageous <lb/>
            for us to face danger in conjunction with the troops of Chei­ <lb/>
            risophus only, than, if the besieged are preserved, to unite all <lb/>
            our forces, and struggle for our safety together. But we must <lb/>
            go resolved in mind that we have now either to die gloriously, <lb/>
            or achieve a most honourable exploit in the preservation of <lb/>
            so many Greeks. is. Perhaps some divinity orders it thus, <lb/>
            who wishes to humble those that spoke boastfully, ns if they <lb/>
            were superior to us in wisdom, and to render us, who com­ <lb/>
            mence all our proceedings by consulting the gods, more hon­ <lb/>
            onred than they are. You must follow, then, your leaders, and <lb/>
            pay attention to them, that you may be ready to execute what <lb/>
            they order."</p>
          <p>19. Having spoken thus, he led them forward. The <lb/>
            cavalry, scattering themselves about as far as was safe, spread <lb/>
            fire wherever they went, while the peltasts, marching abreast <lb/>
            of them along the heights, burned whatever they found that <lb/>
            was combustible, as did the main body also, if they met with <lb/>
            anything left unburned by the others; so that the whole <lb/>
            country seemed to be on fire, and the Greek force to be very <lb/>
            numerous. 20. As soon as it was time, they mounted a hill <lb/>
            and encamped, when they caught sight of the enemy's <lb/>
            fires, which were distant about forty stadia; and they them­ <lb/>
            selves then made as many fires as they could. 21. But as <lb/>
            soon as they had supped, orders were given to put out all the <lb/>
            fires; and, having appointed sentinels, they went to sleep for <lb/>
            the night. At dawn of day, after praying to the gods, and <lb/>
            arranging themselves for battle, they continued their march <lb/>
            with as much haste as they could. 22. Timasion and the <lb/>
            cavalry, taking the guides with them, and riding on before the <lb/>
            rest, found themselves, before they were aware, upon the hill <lb/>
            where the Greeks had been besieged, but saw no troops, either <pb n="192"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            of friends or enemies, but only some old men and women, and <lb/>
            a few sheep and oxen that had been left behind; and this <lb/>
            state of things they reported to Xenophon and the army. 23. <lb/>
            At first they wondered what could have happened ; but at <lb/>
            length they learned from the people who were left that the <lb/>
            Thracians had gone off at the close of the evening and the <lb/>
            Greeks in the morning, but whither they did not know.</p>
          <p>24. Xenophon and his party, on hearing this account, packed <lb/>
            up their baggage, after they had breakfasted, and pursued <lb/>
            their journey, wishing, as soon as possible, to join the rest of <lb/>
            the Greeks at the harbour of Calpe, As they proceeded, <lb/>
            they perceived the track of the Arcadians and Achæans on <lb/>
            the way to Calpe; and when they met, they were pleased to <lb/>
            see one another, and embraced like brothers. 25. The Ar­ <lb/>
            cadians then asked Xenophon's men why they had put out <lb/>
            their fires, 1 " for we," said they, " thought at first, when we <lb/>
            saw no more fires, that you were coming to attack the enemy <lb/>
            in the night; (and the enemy themselves, as they appeared to <lb/>
            its, went off under this apprehension, for they disappeared <lb/>
            about that time;) 26. but as you did not come, and the time <lb/>
            passed by, we concluded that you, hearing of our situation, <lb/>
            had been seized with alarm, and had retreated to the sea- <lb/>
            coast; and we determined not to be far behind you. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly we also marched in this direction.</p>

          <p>Description of Calpe. The army resolve that it shall be a capital offence to <lb/>
            propose another separation. Neon leads out a party of two thousand men <lb/>
            to get provisions, contrary to the omens ; he is attacked by Pharnabazus, <lb/>
            and obliged to retire with the loss of five hundred men. Xenophon <lb/>
            covers his retreat.</p>
          <p>I. THIS day they remained encamped upon the shore near <lb/>
            the port. The spot which is called the harbour of Calpe, is <lb/>
            situate in Asiatic Thrace; and this division of Thrace, begin­ <lb/>
            ring from the mouth of the Euxine Sea, extends on the right <lb/>
            )f a person sailing into the Euxine, as far as Heraclea. 2. <lb/>
            From Byzantium to Heraclea it is a long day's passage for a <note type="footnote"> ■ This question is not answered. See sect. 21. </note> <pb n="193"/>

            galley with oars; and in the space between these cities there <lb/>
            is no other town belonging to the Greeks or their allies ; but <lb/>
            the Bithynian Thracians occupy it; and whatever Greeks <lb/>
            they capture, cast ashore by shipwreck or any other accident, <lb/>
            they are said to treat with great cruelty. 3. The harbour of <lb/>
            Calpe itself lies half-way between Heraclea and Byzantium, <lb/>
            as people sail from either side.1 On the sea there is a pro­ <lb/>
            montory jutting out; that part of it which reaches down into <lb/>
            the water is a steep rock in height, where it is lowest, not <lb/>
            less than twenty fathoms ; the neck of the promontory, which <lb/>
            reaches up to the mainland, is in breadth about four hundred <lb/>
            feet; and the space within the neck is large enough to afford <lb/>
            accommodation for ten thousand men. 4. The harbour lies <lb/>
            close under the rock, with its coast toward the west. A <lb/>
            spring of fresh water, flowing copiously, is close by the sea, <lb/>
            and under cover of the promontory. Abundance of wood, of <lb/>
            various other sorts, but especially of such as is good for <lb/>
            ship-building,3 grows along the coast. 5. The mountain 4 at <lb/>
            the harbour5 extends inland about twenty stadia, and this <lb/>
            part of it has a soil of mould, free from stones; the other <lb/>
            part along the sea, to the distance of more than twenty stadia, <lb/>
            is covered with plenty of large trees of every kind. 6. The <lb/>
            surrounding country is beautiful and of great extent, and <lb/>
            there are in it many populous villages ; for the soil produces <lb/>
            barley, wheat, all kinds of leguminous vegetables, millet, <lb/>
            sesame, figs in abundance, plenty of vines yielding a sweet <lb/>
            wine, and everything else but olive-trees. 7. Such is the <lb/>
            nature of the country.</p>
          <p>The Greeks took up their quarters on the shore by the <lb/>
            sea. In the part which might have been ground for a city6 <note type="footnote"> 1 'Ev <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέσῳ μὲν κεῑται, ἑκατέρωθεν πλεόντων, κ. τ. λ</foreign>.] " Lies in the <lb/>

            they were unwilling to encamp; for even their approach to it <lb/>
            appeared to have been the effect of some insidious design, from <lb/>
            the belief that certain persons were desirous to found a city <lb/>
            there. 8. For most of the soldiers had sailed from home <lb/>
            upon this service, not from want of subsistence, but from hav­ <lb/>
            ing heard of the merit of Cyrus, some even bringing men <lb/>
            with them, others having spent money on the enterprise, <lb/>
            others having left their fathers and mothers, others their chil­ <lb/>
            dren, in hope of returning when they had collected money for <lb/>
            them, for they heard that other Greeks who were with Cyrus <lb/>
            were acquiring considerable wealth. 1 Being men of such <lb/>
            character, they longed to return in safety to Greece.</p>
          <p>9. When the day after their meeting together began to <lb/>
            dawn, Xenophon offered sacrifice with regard to an expedi­ <lb/>
            tion, for it was necessary to lead out the troops to get provi­ <lb/>
            sions ; and he was also thinking of burying the dead. As the <lb/>
            victims were favourable, the Arcadians also accompanied him, <lb/>
            and buried the greatest part of the dead where they had <lb/>
            severally fallen ; for they had now lain five days, and it was <lb/>
            no longer possible to bring them away; some of them how­ <lb/>
            ever they gathered together out of the roads, and buried as <lb/>
            becomingly as they could with the means at their command; <lb/>
            while for those whom they could not find they erected a large <lb/>
            cenotaph, [with a great funeral pile,] 2 and put garlands upon <lb/>
            it. 10. Having performed these rites, they returned to their <lb/>
            camp, and, after they had supped, went to rest.</p>
          <p>Next day all the soldiers held a meeting; (Agasias of <lb/>
            Stymphalus, one of the captains, and Hieronymus of Elis, also <lb/>
            a captain, and others, the oldest of the Arcadian officers, were <lb/>
            the most active in bringing them together;) 11. and they <lb/>
            passed a resolution, that if any one for the future should pro­ <note type="footnote"> vailed among the troops that Xenophon was desirous to detain them <lb/>

            and that the army should return homewards in the same order <lb/>
            in which it was before,1 and that the former leaders should <lb/>
            resume the command. Cheirisophus was now dead, from <lb/>
            having taken some drug2 during a fever; and Neon of Asina <lb/>
            took his place.</p>
          <p>12. After this Xenophon stood up and said, " It seems evi­ <lb/>
            dent, fellow-soldiers, that we must pursue our journey by <lb/>
            land, for we have no ships; and it is necessary for us to set <lb/>
            out at once, for there are no provisions for us if we remain. <lb/>
            We will therefore," he continued, " offer sacrifice ; and you <lb/>
            must prepare yourselves, if ever you did so, to fight; for the <lb/>
            enemy have recovered their spirit." is. The generals then <lb/>
            offered sacrifice; and Arexion the Arcadian assisted as augur; <lb/>
            for Silanus of Ambracia had already fled, having hired a <lb/>
            vessel from Heraclea. They sacrificed with a view to their <lb/>
            departure, but the victims were not favourable. 14. This <lb/>
            day therefore they rested. Some had the boldness to say that <lb/>
            Xenophon, from a desire to settle a colony in the place, had <lb/>
            prevailed on the augur to say that the victims were unfavour­ <lb/>
            able to their departure, 15. Xenophon, in consequence, having <lb/>
            made proclamation that whoever wished might be present at a <lb/>
            sacrifice on the morrow, and having given notice also, that if <lb/>
            there was any augur among the soldiers, he should attend to <lb/>
            inspect the victims with them, made another sacrifice, and a <lb/>
            great number of persons were present at it; 16. but though <lb/>
            they sacrificed again three times with reference to their de­ <lb/>
            parture, the victims were still unfavourable to it. The soldiers <lb/>
            were on this account extremely uneasy, for the provisions <lb/>
            which they had brought with them were exhausted, and there <lb/>
            was no place near for them to purchase any.</p>
          <p>IT. They therefore held another meeting, and Xenophon <lb/>
            Raid, " The victims, as you see, fellow-soldiers, are not yet <lb/>
            favourable for our departure; and I see that you are in want <lb/>
            of provisions. It seems to me necessary, therefore, to offer <lb/>
            sacrifice with regard to this matter." is. Here some one rose <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, that the soldiers should severally return to the com­ <lb/>
            panies in which they were serving before the secession of the Ar­ <lb/>
            cadians and Achæans took place, and that thus each officer should <lb/>
            nave his own men again. </note><note type="footnote"> ' <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φάρμακον</foreign> Solne interpret <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φάρμακον</foreign> " poison."Kuhns. </note> <note type="footnote"> &gt; 2 </note> <pb n="196"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            up and said, " It is with good reason, indeed, that the victims <lb/>
            are unfavourable ; for, as I heard from a person belonging to a <lb/>
            vessel that came in yesterday by accident, Cleander, the <lb/>
            governor of Byzantium, is on the point of coming hither with <lb/>
            transport vessels and galleys." 19. In consequence they all <lb/>
            resolved to stay. But it was necessary to go out for provi­ <lb/>
            sions ; and to this end sacrifice was again offered three times, <lb/>
            but the victims were still unfavourable.</p>
          <p>The soldiers now came to Xenophon's tent, and told him <lb/>
            that they had no provisions. He however replied, that he <lb/>
            would not lead them out while the victims were adverse. <lb/>
            an. The next day sacrifice was offered again, and, as all <lb/>
            were concerned, almost the whole army crowded around <lb/>
            the sacrifice ; and the victims fell short. Still the generals <lb/>
            did not lead out the troops, but called them, however, together; <lb/>
            21. and Xenophon said, "Perhaps the enemy may be assem­ <lb/>
            bled in a body, and it may be necessary for us to fight: if, <lb/>
            therefore, leaving our baggage in the strong part of the ground, <lb/>
            we march out prepared for battle, the victims may possibly <lb/>
            prove more favourable to us." 22. But the soldiers, on hear­ <lb/>
            ing this observation, cried out that it was of no use to lead <lb/>
            them to the part that he mentioned, but that they ought to <lb/>
            sacrifice without delay. Sheep were no longer to be had, but <lb/>
            they bought an ox that was yoked to a waggon, and sacrificed <lb/>
            it; and Xenophon begged Cleaner the Arcadian to be on the <lb/>
            alert if anything in the sacrifice should appear propitious.1 <lb/>
            But not even on this occasion were the signs favourable.</p>
          <p>23. Neon was now general in the place of Cheirisophus, and <lb/>
            when he saw how the men were suffering from want of food, was <lb/>
            desirous to get them relief, and having found a man of Heraclea, <lb/>
            who said that lie knew of some villages in the neighbourhood, <lb/>
            from which it might be possible to procure provisions, he made <lb/>
            proclamation that wnoever was willing might go out to get a <lb/>
            supply as there would be a guide to conduct them. A party <lb/>
            accordingly proceeded from the camp, to the number of two <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προθυμεῑσθαι εἲ τι ὲν τούτῳ</foreign> " Studiosè rein urgere, si exta <lb/>

            pest of the various explanations that have been attempted of this <lb/>
            passage. Bornemann and Kruger conjecture <foreign xml:lang="grc">προθύεσθαι</foreign>, whicl <lb/>
            Kühner highly approves. No alteration, however, is necessary. <lb/>

            thoasand, equipped with spears, leather bags, sacks, and other <lb/>
            things for holding what they might find. 24. But when they <lb/>
            had reached the villages, and had dispersed themselves to <lb/>
            plunder, the cavalry of Pharnabazus first 1 fell upon them, for <lb/>
            they had come to aid the Bithynians, designing, if they could, <lb/>
            in conjunction with them, to prevent the Greeks from pene­ <lb/>
            trating into Phrygia. These horsemen cut off not less than <lb/>
            five hundred of the Gretks; the rest fled to the mountain.</p>
          <p>25. One of those who escaped immediately carried the news <lb/>
            of the occurrence to the camp ; and Xenophon, as the victims <lb/>
            had not been propitious that day, took an ox from a waggon, <lb/>
            (for there were no other cattle,) and, after sacrificing it, went <lb/>
            forth to give aid, with all the other soldiers not above thirty <lb/>
            years of age. 26. They brought off the rest of the party, and <lb/>
            returned to the camp.</p>
          <p>It was now about sunset, and the Greeks were taking their <lb/>
            supper in great despondency, when some of the Bithynians, <lb/>
            coming suddenly upon the advanced guard through the thick­ <lb/>
            ets, killed part of them, and pursued the rest to the camp. <lb/>
            27. A great outcry arising, all the Greeks ran to their arms; <lb/>
            but it did not seem safe to pursue the enemy, or break up their <lb/>
            camp, in the night, for the country was full of wood; and <lb/>
            they therefore passed the night under arms, covered by sum <lb/>
            dent out-posts.</p>

          <p>The Greeks, moved by their previous dangers, at length consent to encamp <lb/>
            in the strong part of the ground. Xenophon, haying sacrificed, and <lb/>
            placed a guard in the camp, led out the troops, who, after burying the <lb/>
            dead that they found on the way, and possessing themselves of some <lb/>
            booty from the villages, perceive the Barbarians posted upon a hill. They <lb/>
            proceed to attack them, and though obstructed by a valley difficult to <lb/>
            cross, are animated by the valour and eloquence of Xenophon to achieve <lb/>
            a successful issue.</p>
          <p>1. IN this manner they passed the night. At day-break <lb/>
            the generals proceeded to the strong part of the ground; 2 <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρω̃τοι</foreign>] Afterwards some of the Bithynians, as is related in <lb/>

            and the men followed, bringing with them their arms and <lb/>
            baggage. Before it was time for dinner, they completed a <lb/>
            trench on the side where the entrance to the place was, and <lb/>
            fenced the whole length with palisades, leaving three gates. <lb/>
            A vessel meanwhile had arrived from Heraclea, bringing <lb/>
            barley-meal, cattle, and wine.</p>
          <p>2. Xenophon, rising early, had sacrificed with reference to <lb/>
            an excursion, and in the first victim the omens were favour­ <lb/>
            able. Just as the sacrifice came to a conclusion, Arexion of <lb/>
            Parrhasia, the augur, saw a lucky eagle, and encouraged Xe­ <lb/>
            nophon to lead forth. 3. The men, therefore, crossing the <lb/>
            trench, ranged themselves under arms; and the heralds made <lb/>
            proclamation that the soldiers, after taking their dinner, should <lb/>
            march out equipped for battle, and leave the camp-followers <lb/>
            and slaves where they were. 4. All the rest accordingly went <lb/>
            out, except Neon ; for it was thought best to leave him in <lb/>
            guard of the people in the camp. But when the captain? <lb/>
            and soldiers had left them, they were ashamed not to follow <lb/>
            where the others went, and in consequence left only those who <lb/>
            were above forty-five years of age; these therefore remained, <lb/>
            and the rest went forth. a. But before they had proceeded <lb/>
            fifteen stadia, they began to meet with dead bodies, and bring­ <lb/>
            ing up the rear of their line opposite the corpses that were <lb/>
            first seen, they buried all to which the line extended. 6. When <lb/>
            they had interred this first set, they marched on, and again <lb/>
            bringing up their rear against the first of those that they next <lb/>
            found unburied, they buried in like manner as many as the <lb/>
            line took in. When they came to the road that led to the <lb/>
            villages, where the dead bodies lay in great numbers, they <lb/>
            brought them all together and buried them.</p>
          <p>7. It was now past mid-day, and having marched quite <lb/>
            through2 the villages, the men were engaged in taking what­ <lb/>
            ever provisions they found within reach of the line, when, on <lb/>
            a sudden, they caught sight of the enemy marching over <lb/>
            some hills that were facing them, disposed in a line, consisting <lb/>
            of a large number of both cavalry and infantry; for Spithri- <note type="footnote"> I '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αετὸν αίσιον</foreign>.] An eagle on the right. Æsch.

            dates and Rathines had now arrived with a considerable force <lb/>
            from Pharnabazus. 8. As soon as the enemy perceived the <lb/>
            Greeks, they halted at the distance of about fifteen stadia. <lb/>
            Upon this Arexion, the angur of the Greeks, immediately <lb/>
            offered sacrifice, and in the very first victim the omens were <lb/>
            favourable. 9. Xenophon then said, " It appears to me, fel­ <lb/>
            low-captains, that we ought to station some divisions on the <lb/>
            watch behind the main body, in order that, if it should any­ <lb/>
            where be necessary, there may be troops to support that body, <lb/>
            and that the enemy, when thrown into disorder, may be re­ <lb/>
            ceived by men in array and full vigour." This proposal was <lb/>
            approved by all. 10. Advance then," he continued, "on <lb/>
            the road towards the enemy, that, since we have been seen <lb/>
            by them, and have seen them, we may not stand still; and I, <lb/>
            after having arranged the divisions in the rear, as you have <lb/>
            sanctioned, will join you."</p>
          <p>11. The others then advanced quietly forward, and Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, detaching from the main body the three hindmost com­ <lb/>
            panies, consisting of about two hundred men each, ordered <lb/>
            one of them to follow on the right, at the distance of about <lb/>
            a hundred feet behind; this company Samolas the Achæan <lb/>
            commanded. The second he directed to follow in the centre ; <lb/>
            this company Pyrrhias the Arcadian headed. The other he <lb/>
            stationed on the left; this Phrasias the Athenian led. 12. <lb/>
            As the front line, in marching on, came to a woody ravine, of <lb/>
            great extent and difficult to pass, they halted, not knowing <lb/>
            whether it were possible to cross it, and passed the word for <lb/>
            the generals and captains to come to the front. 13. Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, wondering what it was that stopped their progress, but <lb/>
            soon hearing the word passed, rode up as fast as he could. <lb/>
            When the officers came together, Sophænetus, the oldest of <lb/>
            the generals, said that it was not worth considerationI whether <lb/>
            a ravine of such a nature were passable or not. 14. But Xe­ <lb/>
            nophon, eagerly seizing an opportunity to speak, said,</p>
          <p>" You are certain, my fellow-soldiers, that I have never <lb/>
            voluntarily brought danger upon you, for I see that you do <lb/>
            not want reputation for valour, but safety. is. But now the <lb/>
            matter stands thus with us : it is not possible for us to move <lb/>
            from hence without fighting ; for if we do not advance upon the <note type="footnote"> I That is, that no deliberation was necessary; that they ought <lb/>
            certainly to cross the ravine </note> <pb n="200"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI. </note> <lb/>
            enemy, the enemy will pursue and attack us when we retreat. <lb/>
            16. Consider, then, whether it is better for us to proceed <lb/>
            against the foe holding out our arms in front of us, or, when <lb/>
            we have turned them back, to find the enemy following be­ <lb/>
            hind us. it. You know, assuredly, that to flee from an enemy <lb/>
            has no semblance of honour, but that pursuit puts courage <lb/>
            even into cowards. For my own part, I had rather pursue <lb/>
            with half the number of men than retreat with twice as many. <lb/>
            As for these enemies, I know that you yourselves do not ex­ <lb/>
            pect them to make a stand against us, if we charge them ; but <lb/>
            we are all aware that if we draw back they will have courage <lb/>
            enough to follow us.</p>
          <p>is. " But that we, by crossing, should place a difficult ravine <lb/>
            in our rear, when we are going to engage, is not this an ad­ <lb/>
            vantage worth securing ? As for the enemy, I should wish <lb/>
            every spot of ground to appear passable to them, so that they <lb/>
            may retreat; but it is for us to be instructed by the nature of <lb/>
            our position that there is no safety for us unless we conquer. <lb/>
            19. I wonder, too, whether any of us thinks this ravine more <lb/>
            formidable than many other places that we have passed.</p>
          <p>" How, indeed, will the plain be passable, unless we defeat <lb/>
            the cavalry ? How will the hills that we have traversed be <lb/>
            passable, if so many peltasts pursue us ? 20. Even if we ar­ <lb/>
            rive safe at the sea, how large a ravine will the Euxine prove <lb/>
            to us, where there are neither vessels to convey us away, nor <lb/>
            provisions to support us if we remain; and the more haste we <lb/>
            should make thither, the more haste must we make to go out <lb/>
            again to find subsistence. 21. It is better therefore for us to <lb/>
            fight now, when we have dined, than to-morrow, when we <lb/>
            may be without a dinner. The sacrifices,' soldiers, are favour­ <lb/>
            able, the omens encouraging, the victims most auspicious. <lb/>
            Let us march against the foe. Since they have certainly <lb/>
            seen us, they ought not now to sup at their ease, or to encamp <lb/>
            where they like."</p>
          <p>22. The captains then bade him lead on, and no one made <lb/>
            any objection. He accordingly put himself at their head. <lb/>
            ordering each to cross at that part of the ravine where be <lb/>
            happened to be; for he thought that the army would thus <lb/>
            sooner get over the ravine in a body than if they defiled over <figure type="illustration">

              </note>the bridge1 that lay across it. 23. When they had passed <lb/>
              over, he said, as he passed along the line. "Remember, soldiers, <lb/>
              how many battles, with the assistance of the gods, you have <lb/>
              gained by coming to close quarters with the enemy, and how <lb/>
              those fare who turn their backs upon their adversaries. <lb/>
              Reflect also that you are at the very gates of Greece.2 <lb/>
              24. Follow, then, Hercules your Conductor,3 and exhort one <lb/>
              another by name.4 It is pleasing to reflect, that he who now <lb/>
              says and does anything brave and honourable, will preserve <lb/>
              a remembrance of himself among those with whom he would <lb/>
              wish to preserve it."</p>
          <p>25. These exhortations he uttered as he rode along, and at <lb/>
            the same time proceeded to lead forward the troops in column ; <lb/>
            and with the peltasts on each flank, they marched upon the <lb/>
            enemy. He gave orders that they should carry their spears <lb/>
            upon the right shoulder until a signal should be given with the <lb/>
            trumpet, and that then, lowering them for a charge, they should <lb/>
            follow their leaders at a steady pace, and that none should <lb/>
            advance running. The word was immediately after given, <lb/>
            JUPITER THE PRESERVER AND HERCULES THE CONDUCTOR. <lb/>
            The enemy, meanwhile, kept their position, thinking that they <lb/>
            had the ground in their favour. 26. As the Greeks approached <lb/>
            them, the peltasts shouted, and ran forward to charge them <lb/>
            before any one gave orders; and the enemy rushed to meet <lb/>
            them, both the horse and the mass of Bithynians, and put <lb/>
            them to flight. 27. But when the body of heavy-armed men <lb/>
            came up, advancing at a quick pace, and when the trumpet <lb/>
            sounded, and the men sang the paean and shouted, and lowered <lb/>
            their spears, the enemy then no longer awaited their charge. <lb/>
            but took to flight. 28. Timasion and the cavalry pursued <lb/>
            them, and killed as many as they could, being but few. The <lb/>
            enemy's left wing, to which the Greek cavalry were opposed, <lb/>
            was at once dispersed, but the right, not being closely pursued, <lb/>
            rallied upon a hill. 29. As soon as the Greeks, however, saw <note type="footnote"> I Krüger supposes that the ravine (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νάπος</foreign>) was the bed of a <lb/>
            mountain torrent, and that the bridge was constructed to afford a <lb/>
            passage over it when it was inundated by rains in winter. From <lb/>
            what Xenophon says above, it would hardly have been conceived <lb/>
            that there was a bridge. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, close upon Greece. Compare ii. 4. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> * See ch. 2. sect. 15. See also below, sect. 25 </note><note type="footnote"> 4 As in <unclear>II</unclear>, x. 68. </note> <pb n="202"/>

            them making a stand, it appeared to them the easiest and <lb/>
            safest thing they could do, to charge them without delay. <lb/>
            Singing the pæan, therefore, they immediately advanced upon <lb/>
            them; and the enemy withdrew. The peltasts then pursued <lb/>
            them till the right wing was also dispersed; but only a small <lb/>
            number were killed; for the enemy's cavalry, being numerous, <lb/>
            kept the Greeks in awe. so. But when they observed the <lb/>
            cavalry of Pharnabazus still standing in a body, and the <lb/>
            Bithynian cavalry flocking to join them, and looking down <lb/>
            from an eminence on what was going on, they determined, <lb/>
            tired as they were, to make an assault upon them as vigor­ <lb/>
            ously as possible, that they might not take breath and re­ <lb/>
            cover their courage. 31. Drawing up in close order, there­ <lb/>
            fore, they advanced; when the enemy's horse fled down the <lb/>
            hill as if they had been pursued by cavalry; for there was a <lb/>
            valley to receive them, of which the Greeks were not aware, <lb/>
            as they had desisted from the pursuit before they reached it, <lb/>
            it being now late. 32. Returning then to the place where <lb/>
            the first encounter occurred, they erected a trophy, and went <lb/>
            off towards the sea about sunset. The distance to their.camp <lb/>
            was about sixty stadia.</p>

          <p>The Greeks plunder Bithyma. Oleander, the Spartan governor of Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium, arrives, and is prejudiced against the Greeks by Dexippus, but re­ <lb/>
            conciled to them by the efforts of Xenophon. Oleander declines the chief <lb/>
            command, which is offered him, and the army march under their <unclear>former</unclear> <lb/>
            generals through Bithynia to Chrysopolis.</p>
          <p>1. THE enemy now employed themselves about their cwn <lb/>
            affairs, and removed their families and effects as far off as they <lb/>
            could. The Greeks, in the mean time, waited for Oleander <lb/>
            and the galleys and transport vessels that were to come, and, <lb/>
            going out every day with their baggage-cattle and slaves, <lb/>
            brought in, without fear of danger, wheat, barley, wine, legu­ <lb/>
            minous vegetables, millet, and figs ; for the country afforded <lb/>
            every useful production except olives.</p>
          <p>2. While the army lay at rest in the camp, the men had <lb/>
            liberty, individually, to go out for spoil, and those only who <pb n="203"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            went out had a share of it; but when the whole army went <lb/>
            out, and any one, straggling from the rest, took any booty, it <lb/>
            was adjudged to be public property.</p>
          <p>3. They had now abundance of everything ; for provisions <lb/>
            for sale were brought from the Greek cities in every direction, <lb/>
            and people who were sailing along the coast, hearing that a <lb/>
            city was going to be built, and a harbour formed, willingly <lb/>
            put in there. 4. Such of the enemy, too, as lived in the <lb/>
            neighbourhood, sent to Xenophon, hearing that he had the <lb/>
            management of the intended settlement, to ask what they <lb/>
            should do in order to become his friends ; and he introduced <lb/>
            them among the soldiers.'</p>
          <p>5. Oleander now arrived with two galleys, but no transport <lb/>
            vessel. At the time of his coming, it happened that the body <lb/>
            of the army was gone out; while some stragglers, going over <lb/>
            the mountain for plunder, some one way, some another, hail <lb/>
            taken a great number of sheep, and being afraid that they <lb/>
            would be taken from them,2 informed Dexippus of the matter, <lb/>
            (the same that had run away with the fifty-oared galley from <lb/>
            Trebisond,) and requested him to keep the sheep for them, tak­ <lb/>
            ing part for himself, and giving them back the rest. 6. Dexippus <lb/>
            immediately drove off the soldiers3 that stood round, and who <lb/>
            said that the sheep were public property, and, going to Cle­ <lb/>
            ander, told him that they were endeavouring to seize them as <lb/>
            plunder for themselves. Oleander desired him to bring who­ <lb/>
            ever should seize them before him. 7. Dexippus accordingly <lb/>
            laid hold on one of the men, and was taking him off, when <lb/>
            Agasias, meeting him, rescued the man ; the prisoner being <lb/>
            a private of his own troop. The rest of the soldiers that were <lb/>
            there began to throw stones at Dexippus, calling him again <lb/>
            and again, “the traitor." Not only he, in consequence, but <lb/>
            also many of the men belonging to his galleys, were struck <lb/>
            with terror, and fled towards the sea; and Oleander fled like­ <lb/>
            wise. 8. But Xenophon, and the other generals, endeavoured to <lb/>
            stop their flight, and told Oleander that there was no reason <lb/>
            for alarm,4 but that the resolution passed by the army was <note type="footnote"> 1 Xenophon, therefore, had not yet given up hopes of being able <lb/>

            instigated by Dexippus, and vexed with himself for having <lb/>
            shown so much fear, said that he would sail off, and make <lb/>
            proclamation that none of the cities should receive them, as <lb/>
            being public enemies. The Lacedæmonians were at that <lb/>
            time masters of all Greece.</p>
          <p>10. This affair appeared to the Greeks to threaten evil, and <lb/>
            they entreated Cleander not to do so ; but he said that it could <lb/>
            not be otherwise, unless somebody should give up to him the <lb/>
            man that began to throw stones, and the person that rescued <lb/>
            him. 11. The person that he wanted was Agasias, the con­ <lb/>
            stant friend of Xenophon, for which reason Dexippus had ac­ <lb/>
            cused him. As there was much perplexity, therefore, the <lb/>
            generals called together the soldiers; and some of them made <lb/>
            light of Cleander's menaces, but to Xenophon the affair ap­ <lb/>
            peared of no small importance. Rising up, he said,</p>
          <p>12. “It seems to me, soldiers, a matter of no trifling mo­ <lb/>
            ment, if Cleander goes away, as he threatens, cherishing these <lb/>
            feelings towards us; for the Greek cities are close at hand, <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians are the chief people of Greece, and each <lb/>
            individual Lacedæmonian is able to do what he pleases in <lb/>
            these cities. 13. If therefore he first shuts us out of Byzan­ <lb/>
            tium, and then gives notice to the other governors not to ad­ <lb/>
            mit us into their cities, as persons refusing obedience to the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians and submitting to no law, and this character <lb/>
            of us reaches the ears of Anaxibius the admiral, it will be <lb/>
            difficult for us either to remain or to sail away, for at this <lb/>
            moment the Lacedæmonians are masters both by land and sea. <lb/>
            14. We ought not, therefore, for the sake of one or two men, <lb/>
            to exc'ude ourselves from Greece, but to do whatever they <lb/>
            direct; for the cities, from which we come, yield them obedi­ <lb/>
            ence. is. 1, for my own part, (for I hear that Dexippus <lb/>
            assures Cleander that Agasias would have done nothing in <lb/>
            the matter, if I had not instigated him,) for my part, I say, <lb/>
            I am ready to clear you ai.d Agasias from blame, if Aga­ <lb/>
            sias himself shall say that I was at all the cause of these <lb/>
            proceedings, and I am prepared to condemn myself, if I en­ <lb/>
            couraged stone-throwing or any other act of violence, as deserv­ <lb/>
            ing of the severest punishment, and that punishment I will <note type="footnote"> thing dangerous, or, at any rate, something of great moment. <unclear/> <lb/>

            submit to suffer. 16. I say, too, that if Dexippus accuses any <lb/>
            other person, he ought to surrender himself to Oleander to be <lb/>
            tried; for by this means you may be exonerated from all cen­ <lb/>
            sure. Under the present complexion of the case, it will be <lb/>
            hard, if, when we expeet applause and honour in Greece, we <lb/>
            shall, instead of obtaining them, be not even on an equality <lb/>
            with the rest of our countrymen, but be excluded from the <lb/>
            Greek cities."</p>
          <p>17. Agasias then stood up and said, "I swear, my fellow- <lb/>
            soldiers, by all the gods and goddesses, that neither Xenophon, <lb/>
            nor any other person among you, desired me to rescue the <lb/>
            man ; but, when I saw a brave fellow, one of my own troop, <lb/>
            led off by Dexippus, (who, you are aware, has played the <lb/>
            traitor towards you,) it seemed to me, I own, intolerable, and <lb/>
            I set him free. is. You need not, then, deliver me up, for I <lb/>
            will surrender myself, as Xenophon recommends, to Cleander, <lb/>
            to do to me, after having tried me, whatever he pleases. As <lb/>
            far as this matter is concerned, enter into no contention with <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians. May each of you return in safety to <lb/>
            whatever place he would reach! Make choice, however, of <lb/>
            some of your own number, and send them with me to Clean­ <lb/>
            der, that, if I omit anything, they may speak and act for me." <lb/>
            19. Upon this the army allowed him to choose whomsoever he <lb/>
            would, and to go. He chose the generals.</p>
          <p>Agasias and the generals, and the man that had been re­ <lb/>
            leased by Agasias, accordingly proceeded to Cleander ; and <lb/>
            the generals said, 20. “The army has sent us to you, 0 <lb/>
            Oleander, and requests that if you accuse them all, you will <lb/>
            yourself be the judge or them all, and treat them as you may <lb/>
            think fit; or, if you accuse one or two or more, they think it <lb/>
            right that they should surrender themselves to you for judg­ <lb/>
            ment. If therefore you accuse any one of us, we are here <lb/>
            before you ; if any other, let us know; for no man, who is <lb/>
            willing to obey us, shall refuse to submit to yon."</p>
          <p>21. Agasias next stood forward, and said, " I am the per­ <lb/>
            son, 0 Oleander, that rescued this man when Dexippus was <lb/>
            carrying him off, and that incited the men to stone Dexippus ; <lb/>
            22. for I knew that the soldier was a deserving man, and I <lb/>
            knew also that Dexippus, after having been chosen by the <lb/>
            army to command the galley which we begged of the people <lb/>
            of Trebisond for the purpose cf collecting transport vessels to <pb n="206"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VI </note> <lb/>
            save ourselves, had run away and betrayed the soldiers in <lb/>
            common with whom lie had preserved his life. 23. Through <lb/>
            his misconduct, therefore, we have both deprived the people <lb/>
            of Trebisond of their galley, and seem to have acted dishon­ <lb/>
            estly; and, as far as depended upon him, we were utterly un­ <lb/>
            done; for he had heard, as well as we, that it would be im­ <lb/>
            practicable for us, going by land, to cross the rivers and get <lb/>
            safe to Greece. 24. It was from such a character as this that <lb/>
            I rescued the man. If you had been leading him away, or <lb/>
            any one of those belonging to you, and not one of our own <lb/>
            deserters, be assured that I should have done nothing of the <lb/>
            kind. Consider, then, that if you put me to death, you will <lb/>
            put to death a man of honour for the sake of a coward and a <lb/>
            villain.”</p>
          <p>25. Cleander, on hearing this statement, said that he could <lb/>
            not approve of the conduct of Dexippus, if he had acted in <lb/>
            such a way, but observed, at the same time, that even if Dex­ <lb/>
            ippus were the worst of villains, he ought not to suffer any <lb/>
            violence, but to be tried, ("as you yourselves," said he, "now <lb/>
            propose,") and to have his deserts. 26. " For the present <lb/>
            then," he continued, "retire, leaving Agasias with me, and, <lb/>
            when I give you notice, come to witness his trial. I neither <lb/>
            accuse the army, nor any one else, since Agasias himself con­ <lb/>
            fesses that it was he who released the man." 27. The man <lb/>
            who had been released then said, “If you suppose, 0 Clean­ <lb/>
            der, that I was apprehended for doing something wrong, be <lb/>
            assured that I neither struck nor threw stones at any one, but <lb/>
            merely said that the sheep were public property; for it was a <lb/>
            resolution passed by the soldiers, that if, when the whole army <unclear/> <lb/>
            went out, any particular person made any capture by himself, <lb/>
            that capture should go to the public store. 28. This was what <lb/>
            I said ; and Dexippus, in consequence, seized me and was lead­ <lb/>
            ing me off, so that no one might utter a syllable,' but that ho <lb/>
            himself, securing a share of the booty, might keep the rest for <lb/>
            the plunderers, contrary to the resolution of the army." To <lb/>
            this Oleander replied, “Since you are that sort of person, <lb/>
            stay here, that we may consider respecting you likewise."</p>
          <p>29. Cleander and his party then went to dinner; and Xe <note type="footnote">1 "Iva <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὴ φϑέγγοιτο μηδείς</foreign>.] That no one might report anything <lb/>

            nophon assembled the troops, and advised them to send some <lb/>
            persons to Cleander to make intercession for the men. 30. <lb/>
            They accordingly resolved to depute the generals and captains, <lb/>
            with Dracontius1 the Spartan, and such of the rest as seemed <lb/>
            eligible, to entreat Oleander by all means to set the two men <lb/>
            free. 31. Xenophon, going to him, said, “You have the men <lb/>
            in your hands, 0 Oleander, and the army has allowed you to <lb/>
            do what you please with regard both to them and to their whole <lb/>
            force. They now, however, request and entreat of you to <lb/>
            give up the two men to them, and not to put them to death ; <lb/>
            for they exerted themselves greatly, in time past, to be of <lb/>
            service to the army. 32. Should they obtain this favour from <lb/>
            you, they promise you, in return for it, that if you are willing <lb/>
            to be their leader, and the gods are propitious, they will let <lb/>
            you see both how well-disciplined they are, and how incapable, <lb/>
            when obedient to their general, and aided by superior powers, <lb/>
            of fearing an enemy. 33. They also beg of you, that when <lb/>
            you have come and taken the command of them, you will <lb/>
            make trial of Dexippus and the rest of them, ascertain what <lb/>
            sort of person each is, and give every one his desert."</p>
          <p>34. Oleander, on hearing this application, replied, “By the <lb/>
            twin gods,2 I will give you an answer at once. I give up the <lb/>
            men to you, and will come to you myself; and, if the gods <lb/>
            permit, I will lead you into Greece. Your words are very <lb/>
            different from the accounts that I heard of some of you, <lb/>
            namely, that you were alienating the army from the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians." 35. The deputies then took their leave, applaud­ <lb/>
            ing Oleander, and taking with them the two men.</p>
          <p>Oleander offered a sacrifice with reference to the journey, <lb/>
            and associated in a friendly way with Xenophon ; and they <lb/>
            contracted a bond of hospitality between them. When he <lb/>
            saw the Greek soldiers, too, execute their orders with regu­ <lb/>
            larity, he grew still more desirous to become their commander. <lb/>
            36. But as the omens were not favourable to his wishes, though <lb/>
            he offered sacrifices three days, he called the generals together, <lb/>
            and said, "The victims have not been favourable for me to <note type="footnote"> 1 iv. 8. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ναὶ τὼ σιώ</foreign>.] Castor and Pollux, by whom the Lacedæmonians <lb/>

            is given to you, as it appears, to conduct the army home. <lb/>
            Proceed then; and we will receive you at Byzantium when <lb/>
            you arrive there,1 in the best manner that we can." 37. It <lb/>
            was then resolved by the soldiers to make him a present of <lb/>
            the sheep that were public property ; and he, having accepted <lb/>
            them, gave them back to the soldiers again, and then sailed off.</p>
          <p>The army, having disposed of the corn which they had col­ <lb/>
            lected, and the other booty that they had captured, advanced <lb/>
            through the territory of the Bithynians. 38. But as, while they <lb/>
            pursued the straight road, they met with nothing to enable <lb/>
            them to enter the country of their friends with a portion of <lb/>
            spoil, they resolved upon marching back for a day and a night; <lb/>
            and, having done so, they took great numbers both of slaves <lb/>
            and cattle, and arrived, after six days' march, at Chrysopolis <lb/>
            in Chalcedonia, where they stayed seven days to sell their <lb/>
            booty.</p>

            in Asia, has been related in the preceding part of the nar­ <lb/>
            rative.</p>
          <p>a. Pharnabazus, fearing that the army of the Greeks might <lb/>
            make an irruption into his province, sent to Anaxibius the <lb/>
            Spartan admiral, who was at Byzantium, and begged him to <lb/>
            transport the army out of Asia, promising to do for him in re­ <lb/>
            turn whatever he might require of him. 3. Anaxibius, ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, sent for the generals and captains of the troops <lb/>
            to Byzantium, engaging that if they came over to him, pay <lb/>
            should be given to the men. 4. The rest of the officers said <lb/>
            that they would give him an answer after they had considered <lb/>
            of the matter ; but Xenophon told him that he was going to <lb/>
            leave the army, and wanted to sail away. Anaxibius, however, <lb/>
            requested him to come across with the rest, and then to take <lb/>
            his departure. Xenophon therefore said that he would do so.</p>
          <p>5. In the mean time Seuthes1 the Thracian sent Medosades <lb/>
            to Xenophon, requesting that general to join with him in <lb/>
            using his efforts that the army might cross over, and saying <lb/>
            that he should have no cause to repent of assisting him in that <lb/>
            object. 6. Xenophon replied, " The army will doubtless cross <lb/>
            over ; let him give nothing to me therefore, or to any one <lb/>
            else, on that account. When it has crossed, I shall quit it; <lb/>
            so let him address himself to those who stay, and who may <lb/>
            seem able to serve him, in such a manner as may appear <lb/>
            likely to be successful."</p>
          <p>7. Soon after, the whole army of the Greeks crossed over to <lb/>
            Byzantium. Anaxibius however gave them no pay, but made <lb/>
            proclamation that the soldiers should take their arms and <lb/>
            baggage, and go out of the city, signifying that he intended <lb/>
            at once to send them away home, and to take their number. <lb/>
            The soldiers were in consequence greatly troubled, because <lb/>
            they had no money to get provisions for their journey, and <lb/>
            packed up their baggage with reluctance.</p>
          <p>8. Xenophon, who had become a guest-friend to Cleander <lb/>

            sailing away immediately. But Cleander said to him, "By <lb/>
            no means do so, for, if you do, you will incur blame, since <lb/>
            some people, indeed, already accuse you as the cause that the <lb/>
            army proceeds out1 so slowly.” 9. Xenophon replied, "I am <lb/>
            not the cause of this, but the soldiers, being in want of pro­ <lb/>
            visions, are for that reason, of themselves, reluctant to go out." <lb/>
            10. "However I advise you," rejoined Cleander, " to go out <lb/>
            with them, as if you intended to accompany them, and when <lb/>
            the army is clear of the city, then to quit it." “We will <lb/>
            then go to Anaxibius," said Xenophon, "and further the pro­ <lb/>

            was their intention. 11. He recommended that they should act <lb/>
            in conformity with what they said, and that the troops should <lb/>
            go out as soon as possible with their baggage packed up; de­ <lb/>
            siring them to give notice, at the same time, that whoever <lb/>
            should not be present at the review and numbering of the <lb/>
            army, would have himself to blame. 12. The generals then <lb/>
            went out first, and the rest of the army followed them.</p>
          <p>They were now all out except a few, and Eteonicus2 was <lb/>
            standing by the gates, really to shut them, and thrust in the <lb/>
            bar, as soon as they were all outside, 13. when Anaxibius, <lb/>
            summoning the generals and captains, said, " You may take <lb/>
            provisions from the Thracian villages; for there is plenty of <lb/>
            barley and wheat, and other necessaries, in them ; and when <lb/>
            you have supplied yourselves, proceed to the Chersonesus, and <lb/>
            there Cyniscus3 Will give you pay.” 14. Some of the sol­ <lb/>
            diers that overheard this, or some one of the captains, com­ <lb/>
            municated it to the army. The generals, meanwhile, in­ <lb/>
            quired about Seuthes, whether he would prove hostile or <lb/>
            friendly, and whether they must march over the Sacred <lb/>
            Mountain,4 or round about through the middle of Thrace. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Εξέρπει</foreign>.]Non celeriter, sed quasi rependo exit (ex urbe). <lb/>

            snatching up their arms, ran in haste to the gates, with a de­ <lb/>
            sign to make their way back within the walls. Eteonicus, <lb/>
            however, and those about him, when they saw the heavy- <lb/>
            armed men running towards them, shut the gates, and thrust <lb/>
            in the bar. 16. The soldiers then knocked at the gates, and <lb/>
            said that they were treated most unjustly, in being shut out as <lb/>
            a prey to the enemy, and declared that they would split the <lb/>
            gates asunder, if the people did not open them of their own <lb/>
            accord. 17. Some ran off to the sea, and got over into the <lb/>
            city by the pier of the wall; while others of them, who hap­ <lb/>
            pened to be still in the town, when they perceived what was <lb/>
            passing at the gates, cut the bars in twain with their axes, and <lb/>
            set the gates wide open. They then all rushed in.</p>

            lest the army should fall to plundering, and irreparable mis­ <lb/>
            chief be done, not only to the city, but to himself and the <lb/>
            men, ran and got within the gates along with the crowd. 19. <lb/>
            The people of Byzantium, at the same time, when they saw <lb/>
            the army entering by force, fled from the market-place, some <lb/>
            to the ships, and some to their houses, while others, who hap­ <lb/>
            pened to be within-doors, ran out; some hauled down the <lb/>
            galleys into the water, that they might save themselves in <lb/>
            them ; and all believed themselves ruined, regarding the city <lb/>
            as captured. 20. Eteonicus fled to the citadel. Anaxibius, <lb/>
            running down to the sea, sailed round to the same place in a <lb/>
            fishing-boat, and immediately sent for men from the garrison <lb/>
            at Chalcedon ; for those in the citadel did not appear sufficient <lb/>
            to repel the Greeks.</p>
          <p>2t. The soldiers, as soon as they saw Xenophon, ran up to <lb/>
            him in great numbers, and cried, “You have now an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, 0 Xenophon, to become a great man. You are in <lb/>
            possession of a city, you have galleys, you have money, you <lb/>
            have this large number of men. Now, therefore, if you are <lb/>
            inclined, you may benefit us, and we may make you a distin­ <lb/>
            guished man." 22. Xenophon replied, “You say well, and I <lb/>
            will act accordingly ; but if you aim at this object, range your­ <lb/>
            selves under arms as quickly as possible," for he wished to quiet <note type="footnote"> parent from c. 3, sect. 3. “The fort <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερὸν ὄϱος</foreign> is mentioned by <lb/>

            the other officers also to command the men to range themselves <lb/>
            under arms. 23. As the men, too, began to marshal them­ <lb/>
            selves, the heavy-armed troops soon formed eight deep, and <lb/>
            the peltasts ran to take their station on each wing. 24. The <lb/>
            ground, which was called the Thracian Area,' was excellent <lb/>
            for the arrangement of troops, being clear of houses, and <lb/>
            level. When the arms were in their places,2 and the men <lb/>
            somewhat tranquillized, Xenophon called the soldiers round <lb/>
            him, and spoke as follows :</p>
          <p>25. “That you are angry, soldiers, and think you have <lb/>
            been treated strangely in being deceived, I am not at all sur­ <lb/>
            prised ; but if we gratify our resentment, and not only take <lb/>

            than a thousand talents; but though we were masters of all <lb/>

            against us, is there anybody so senseless as to think that we <lb/>
            could get the superiority ? 29. Let us not, in the name of the <lb/>
            gods, act like madmen, and perish with disgrace, by becoming <lb/>
            enemies to our country, and to our own friends and relations ! <lb/>
            For our connexions are all in the cities that will make war <lb/>
            upon us, and that will make war justly indeed, if, when wo <lb/>
            declined to possess ourselves of any Barbarian city, though <lb/>
            we were superior in force, we should plunder the first Greek <lb/>
            city at which we have arrived. so. For my own part, I pray <lb/>
            that, before I see such an atrocity committed by you, I may <lb/>
            be buried ten thousand fathoms under ground. I advise you, <lb/>
            as you are Greeks, to endeavour to obtain justice by submit­ <lb/>
            ting to those who are masters of the Greeks. Should you be <lb/>
            unable to obtain it, however, we ought not, though wronged, <lb/>
            to deprive ourselves of all hope of returning to Greece. 31. <lb/>
            It appears to me, therefore, that we should now send deputies <lb/>
            to Anaxibius, with this message: ‛We came into the city <lb/>
            with no design to commit violence, but, if we could, to obtain <lb/>
            some service from you; but, if we obtain none, we intend to <lb/>
            show that we shall go out of it, not because we have been de­ <lb/>
            ceived, but because we are willing to obey you.'"</p>
          <p>32. This proposal met with approbation ; and they de­ <lb/>
            spatched Ilieronymus the Elean, Eurylochus the Arcadian, <lb/>
            and Philesius the Achæan, to carry the message. They ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly proceeded to deliver it.</p>
          <p>33. But while the soldiers were still seated, Cœratades,1 a, <lb/>
            Theban, came up to them ; a man who was going about the <lb/>
            country, not banished from Greece, but wanting to be a <lb/>
            general, and offering his services wherever any city or people <lb/>
            required a leader; and, as he came forward, he said that he <note type="footnote"> 1 lie had been a commander of the Bœotians towards the end of <lb/>

            to Athens, but contrived to escape. See Hellen. i. 3. 15. Zeune. </note> <pb n="214"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            was prepared to conduct them to that part of Thrace called <lb/>
            the Delta, where they would find plenty of good things, and <lb/>
            that, till they should arrive there, he would supply them with <lb/>
            meat and drink in abundance. 34. The soldiers listened to <lb/>
            this offer, and heard, at the same time, the reply brought from <lb/>
            Anaxibius, for he had sent an answer that " if they complied <lb/>
            with his wishes, they should have no cause to repent; and <lb/>
            that he would report their conduct to the authorities at Sparta, <lb/>
            and would contrive to do for them whatever service he <lb/>
            could." 35. The soldiers, in consequence, took Cœratades as <lb/>
            their leader, and went out of the city, Cœratades engaging to <lb/>
            come to the army next day with victims for sacrifice, an <lb/>
            augur, and meat and drink for the troops. 36. As soon as <lb/>
            they were gone out, Anaxibius caused the gates to be shut, <lb/>
            and proclamation made, that whoever of the soldiers should be <lb/>
            found within, should be sold as a slave.</p>
          <p>37. Next day Cœratades came with the victims and the <lb/>
            augur; and twenty men followed him carrying barley-meal, <lb/>
            and other twenty carrying wine; three also with as large a load <lb/>
            as they could bear of olives ; one with as much as he could <lb/>
            carry of garlic, and another of onions. Having ordered these <lb/>
            things to be laid down, as if for distribution, he proceeded <lb/>
            to offer sacrifice.</p>
          <p>38. Xenophon, meanwhile, having sent for Cleander, urged <lb/>
            him to obtain permission for him to enter the walls, and to <lb/>
            sail away from Byzantium. 39. When Cleander arrived, he <lb/>
            said, “ I am come, after having obtained the permission with <lb/>
            extreme difficulty; for Anaxibius says that it is not proper <lb/>
            for the soldiers to be close to the walls, and Xenophon with­ <lb/>
            in ; and that the Byzantines are split into factions, and at <lb/>
            enmity one with another; yet he has desired you," he added, <lb/>
            "to enter, if you intend 1 to sail with him.” 40. Xenophon <lb/>
            accordingly took leave of the soldiers, and went into the city <lb/>
            with Cleander.</p>
          <p>Cœratades, the first day, had no favourable omens from the <lb/>
            sacrifice, and distributed nothing among the troops. The <lb/>
            next day the victims were placed at the altar, and Cœratades <note type="footnote"> I I read it<foreign xml:lang="grc">μελλοις</foreign> with Krüger, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰμέλλοι</foreign>, the common <lb/>

            took his station with a chaplet on his head, as if intending to <lb/>
            offer sacrifice; when Timasion the Dardaniam, Neon the <lb/>
            Asinæan, and Cleanor the Orchomenian, came forward and <lb/>
            told Cœratades not to sacrifice, as he should not lead the <lb/>
            army, unless he supplied it with provisions. 41. He then or­ <lb/>
            dered a distribution to be made. But as his supply fell far <lb/>
            short of one day's subsistence for each of the soldiers, he went <lb/>
            off, taking with turn the victims, and renouncing the general­ <lb/>

          <p>The generals disagreeing about the route, many of the soldiers desert. <lb/>
            Anaxibius and Xenophon, on their voyage, are met at Cyzicus by Aristar­ <lb/>

            Xenophon returns to the army, and the Greeks, on his advice, agree to <lb/>
            sail back to Asia, but are hindered by Aristarchus. Their services are <lb/>
            solicited by Seuthes, and Xenophon goes to learn his terms.</p>

            of the Thracians, over against Byzantium, encamped there. <lb/>
            a. The generals had now some disagreement, Cleanor and <lb/>
            Phryniscus wishing to lead the army to Seuthes, (for he had <lb/>
            gained them over to his interest, having presented a horse to <lb/>
            the one, and a mistress to the other,) and Neon desiring to <lb/>
            take it to the Chersonesus, as he thought that if they came <lb/>
            into the dominions of the Lacedæmonians, he himself would <lb/>
            get the command of the whole army. Timasion, however, <lb/>
            wanted to cross over again into Asia, expecting by this means <lb/>
            to effect his return home. 3. The army were of the samo <lb/>

            to hear these accounts of the dispersion of the army; for he <lb/>
            thought that by such a state of things he should most gratify <lb/>

          <p>a. As Anaxibius was on his voyage from Byzantium, Aris­ <lb/>

            met him at Cyzicus, and said that Polus, the successor of Anax­ <lb/>
            ibius as admiral, was on the point of entering the Hellespont. <lb/>
            6. Anaxibius desired Aristarchus to sell all the soldiers of <lb/>
            Cyrus, whom he should find remaining in Byzantium, as <lb/>
            slaves. As for Oleander, he had sold none, but had even at­ <lb/>
            tended, from compassion, to such as were sick, and obliged <lb/>
            the inhabitants to receive them into their houses; but Aris­ <lb/>
            tarchus, as soon as he arrived, sold not less than four hundred.</p>

            Parium, sent to Pharnabazus according to an agreement be­ <lb/>
            tween them. But Pharnabazus, when he found that Aris­ <lb/>
            tarchus was going as governor to Byzantium, and that Anax­ <lb/>
            ibius was no longer admiral, neglected Anaxibius, and entered <lb/>
            into a negotiation with Aristarchus about the army of Cyrus, <lb/>
            similar to that which lie had previously made with Anaxibius.</p>
          <p>8. Soon after, Anaxibius called Xenophon to him, and <lb/>
            urged him, by every means and contrivance, to sail back to <lb/>
            the army as soon as possible, to keep it together, to collect as <lb/>
            many of the dispersed soldiers as he could, and then, leading <lb/>
            them along the coast to Perinthus, to transport them without <lb/>
            delay into Asia. He gave him, at the same time, a thirty- <lb/>
            oared galley and a letter, and sent a man with him to tell the <lb/>
            people of Perinthus to despatch Xenophon on horseback to <lb/>
            the army as soon as possible. 9. Xenophon then sailed across, 1 <lb/>
            and arrived at the army. The soldiers gladly welcomed him, <lb/>
            and followed him at once with cheerfulness, in expectation of <lb/>
            passing over from Thrace into Asia.</p>
          <p>10. Seuthes, when he heard of his return, sent Medosades <lb/>
            to him by sea, and begged him to bring the army to him. <lb/>
            promising him whatever he thought likely to prevail on him <lb/>
            Xenophon told him in reply that nothing of the kind was pos­ <note type="footnote">the notion of Sturz and Lion, that the soldiers gave away their arms <lb/>
            among the country people, that they might enter the towns unarm­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            sible; it and Medosades, on receiving this answer, went <lb/>
            away.</p>
          <p>When the Greeks came to Perinthus, Neon, drawing off <lb/>
            from the rest, encamped apart with about eight hundred men. <lb/>
            All the other troops remained together under the walls of <lb/>
            Perinthus.</p>
          <p>12. Xenophon was next engaged in getting vessels, in order <lb/>
            that they might cross over to Asia as soon as possible. But <lb/>
            just at this time Aristarchus the governor, instigated by <lb/>
            Pharnabazus, came with two galleys from Byzantium, and <lb/>
            forbade the masters of the ships to carry over the Greeks, and <lb/>
            then, going to the army, desired the soldiers not to go across <lb/>
            into Asia. 13. Xenophon told him that Anaxibius had or­ <lb/>
            dered them to go, “ and sent me hither,”added he, " with that <lb/>
            view." “ Anaxibius," retorted Aristarchus, “ is no longer <lb/>
            admiral, and I am governor here ; and if I find one of you on <lb/>
            the sea, I will drown him." Having said this, he went off <lb/>
            into the town.</p>
          <p>14. Next day he sent for the generals and captains of the <lb/>
            army; but, as they came up to the wall, somebody gave notice <lb/>
            to Xenophon, that if he went in, he would be apprehended, <lb/>
            and either suffer some injury there, or be delivered to Phar­ <lb/>
            nabazus. Hearing this, he sent the others on before, and said <lb/>
            that he himself had a mind to offer sacrifice. is. Returning, <lb/>
            accordingly, he sacrificed to know whether the gods would <lb/>
            permit him to attempt to lead the army to Seuthes, for he saw <lb/>
            that it was not safe to cross over into Asia, as he who would <lb/>
            hinder him had galleys at his command, nor was he willing to <lb/>
            go to the Chersonesus and be shut up there, or that the army <lb/>
            should be in great want of everything in a place where it <lb/>
            would be necessary to obey the governor, and where the troops <lb/>
            would be able to procure no supplies.</p>
          <p>16. He was engaged about this matter, when the generals <lb/>
            and captains returned from Aristarchus, and brought word <lb/>
            that he had told them to go away for the present, and to come <lb/>
            back to him in the evening. Hence his treacherous intentions <lb/>
            became still more manifest. 17. Xenophon, therefore, as the <lb/>
            sacrifices seemed favourable for himself and the army to go <lb/>
            in security to Seuthes, took with him Polycrates the Athenian, <lb/>
            one of the captains, and from each of the generals, except <lb/>
            Neon, a person in whom they confided, and went in the night <pb n="218"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. BII. </note> <lb/>
            to the camp of Seuthes, a distance of sixty stadia. is. As lie <lb/>
            drew near it, lie met with several watch-fires without guards, <lb/>
            and thought that Seuthes had decamped; but, hearing a <lb/>
            noise, and the men about Seuthes making signals to one <lb/>
            another, he understood that these fires had been kindled by <lb/>
            Seuthes in front of the night-posts, in order that the sentinels, <lb/>
            being in the dark, might not be seen, or show how many or <lb/>
            where they were, while those who approached might not be <lb/>
            concealed, but be conspicuous in the light. 19. When he <lb/>
            found that such was the case, he sent the interpreter whom he <lb/>
            had with him, and told him to let Seuthes know that Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon was there, and desired a conference with him. They <lb/>
            inquired if it was Xenophon the Athenian, from the Grecian <lb/>
            army, 20. As he answered that it was he, they leaped upon <lb/>
            their horses, and hastened off. A little after, about two hun­ <lb/>
            dred peltasts appeared, and conducted Xenophon and his <lb/>
            party to Seuthes.</p>
          <p>21. Seuthes was in a tower, strictly guarded, and round it <lb/>
            stood horses ready bridled; for, through fear, he fed his <lb/>
            horses during the day, and kept on guard with them bridled <lb/>
            during the night. 22. For Teres, one of his ancestors, when <lb/>
            he had once a large army in this country, was said to have <lb/>
            lost great numbers of his men, and to have been stripped of <lb/>
            his baggage by the natives, who are called Thynians, and are <lb/>
            said to be the most formidable of all enemies, especially in the <lb/>
            night.</p>
          <p>23. When they approached, Seuthes gave notice that Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, with any two of his attendants that he chose, might <lb/>
            enter. As soon as they went in, they first saluted one <lb/>
            another, and, according to the Thracian custom, drank to <lb/>
            each other in horns full of wine ; Medosades, who acted as tho <lb/>
            ambassador of Seuthes on all occasions, being present with <lb/>
            him. 24. Xenophon then began to speak as follows. “ You <lb/>
            sent Medosades, who is present here, to me, 0 Scuthes, for <lb/>
            the first time at Chalcedon, requesting me to join my efforts <lb/>
            to yours that the army might cross over out of Asia, and, <lb/>
            promising, as Medosades here said, that if I succeeded, vou <lb/>
            would do me some service in return." 25. When he had said <lb/>
            this, he asked Medosades if it was true ; and he said that it <lb/>
            was. “ When I had gone over again to the army from Pari­ <lb/>
            um, Medosades came to me a second time, assuring me, that if <pb n="219"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            I would bring the army to you, you would not only treat me <lb/>
            as a friend and a brother in other respects, but that the towns <lb/>
            also along the sea, of which you are master, would be assigned <lb/>
            to me from you." 26. He then again asked Medosades <lb/>
            whether he said this, and Medosades acknowledged it. “ Well <lb/>
            then," said Xenophon, "tell Seuthes what answer I gave you, <lb/>
            on the first occasion, at Chalcedon." 27. " You answered <lb/>
            that the army was going to cross over to Byzantium, and that <lb/>
            there would therefore be no occasion oil that account to give <lb/>
            anything either to you or to any other person ; you added that, <lb/>
            as soon as you had crossed, you would quit the army ; and all <lb/>
            took place as you said." 28. " And what did I say," con­ <lb/>
            tinued Xenophon, "when you came to Selybria ?”1 "You <lb/>
            said that what I proposed was impracticable, but that the <lb/>
            army was to go to Perinthus, and pass over into Asia." 29. <lb/>
            “ Well then,” said Xenophon, " I am now present before you, <lb/>
            with Phryniscus here, one of the generals, and Polycrates, one <lb/>
            of the captains; and, without, arc deputies from the other <lb/>
            generals, the most confidential friends of each, except from <lb/>
            Neon the Lacedæmonian. so. If you wish the business to <lb/>
            have greater sanction, call them in also; and do you, Poly­ <lb/>
            crates, go and tell them that I desire them to leave their arms <lb/>
            outside ; and do you leave your sword there, and come in <lb/>
            again."</p>
          <p>31. Seuthes, on hearing this, said that he would distrust no <lb/>
            one of the Athenians, for he knew that they were connected <lb/>
            with him by lineage,2 and regarded them as kind friends. <note type="footnote"> 1 I have adopted this mode of spelling the name with all the mo­ <lb/>

            Afterwards, when those who were wanted had come in, Xe­ <lb/>
            nophon first asked Seuthes what use he proposed to make of <lb/>
            the army. 32. Seuthes then proceeded to speak thus: "Mæ <lb/>
            sades was my father; and under his government were the <lb/>
            Melanditæ, the Thynians, and the Tranipsæ. But when the <lb/>
            power of the Odrysæ declined, my father, being driven from <lb/>
            this country, died of a disease, and I, being left an orphan, <lb/>
            was bred up with Medocus, the present king. 33. As soon <lb/>
            as I became a young man, however, I could not bear to sub­ <lb/>
            sist in dependence upon another person's table; and I sat on <lb/>
            my seat' before him as a suppliant that he would give me as <lb/>
            many troops as he could, in order that, if I found it at all in my <lb/>
            power, I might inflict some evil on those who had expelled <lb/>
            us, and might cease to live by looking, like a dog, to his table. <lb/>
            34. In compliance with my request he gave me the infantry <lb/>
            and cavalry which you will see as soon as it is day. I now <lb/>
            subsist with the aid of these troops, making depredations on <lb/>
            my own hereditary dominions ; and if you join me, I should <lb/>
            expect, with the assistance of the gods, to recover my authority <lb/>
            with ease. This is what I desire of you."</p>
          <p>35. "If we should come, then," said Xenophon, "what would <lb/>
            you be able to give to the soldiers, captains, and generals ? Let <lb/>
            me know, that these who are with me may carry word to them." <lb/>
            36. Seuthes then promised to give every soldier a Cyzicene <lb/>
            stater,2 twice as much to a captain, and four times as much <lb/>
            to a general, with as much land as they should desire, yokes <lb/>
            of oxen, and a walled town near the sea. 37. But if," said <lb/>
            Xenophon, " when we attempt this service, we should not <lb/>
            succeed, but something to deter us should arise on the part of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, will you, if any of us should wish to take <lb/>
            refuge with you, receive them into your country ?" 38. "Xay <lb/>
            more," replied he, " I will even treat them as brothers, make <lb/>
            them guests at my own table, and sharers of all that we may <lb/>

          <p>All the Greeks, except Neon and his party, accept the proposals of Senthea, <lb/>
            and join him. They march with Seuthes against his enemies, whom they <lb/>
            surprise unawares, and take a great number of slaves, and much spoil.</p>
          <p>1. THE party having heard these offers, and having ex­ <lb/>
            changed right hands, rode off. They got back to the camp <lb/>
            before day-break, find made each his report to those who sent <lb/>
            him. 2. As soon as it was light, Aristarchus sent again for <lb/>
            the generals and captains, but they determined to decline <lb/>
            going to him, and to call together the army. All the troops <lb/>
            came, except those of Neon, who were about ten stadia dis­ <lb/>
            tant. 3. When they were met, Xenophon stood up and spoke <lb/>
            as follows :</p>
          <p>" Soldiers ! Aristarchus, having galleys at command, seeks <lb/>
            to prevent us sailing whither we desire ; and in consequence <lb/>
            it is not safe for us to embark. He would have us make our <lb/>
            way by force over the Sacred Mountain into the Chersonesus ; <lb/>
            and, if we should succeed in crossing that mountain, and ar­ <lb/>
            rive there, lie says that he will not again sell any of you, as <lb/>
            he did at Byzantium, or deceive you again, but that you shall <lb/>
            receive pay, and that he will no longer suffer you, as at present, <lb/>
            to be in want of provisions. 4. Thus speaks Aristarchus. <lb/>
            Seuthes, on the other hand, says that if you go to him, lie <lb/>
            will be of service to you. Consider, therefore, whether you <lb/>
            will decide on this point while remaining here now, or after <lb/>
            having gone hack to get provisions. 5. My own opinion is, <lb/>
            that since we have no money here to purchase, and since they <lb/>
            will not allow us to take provisions without money, we should <note type="footnote"> I So Herodotus v. 6: The Thracians buy their wives <lb/>

            return to the villages where the inhabitants, being weaker <lb/>
            than we are, permit us to take them, and that there, when we <lb/>
            have got supplies, and heard what each of them desiresof you,1 <lb/>
            you may choose whatever may seem best. 6. To whomsoever <lb/>
            this proposal is agreeable, let him hold up his hand." They <lb/>
            all held up their hands. "Go then," continued he, "and <lb/>
            prepare your baggage, and when any one gives the signal, <lb/>
            follow your leader."</p>
          <p>7. Soon after, Xenophon put himself at their head, and <lb/>
            they followed him. Neon, however, and some other persons <lb/>
            sent by Aristarchus, tried to persuade them to turn back ; but <lb/>
            they paid no regard to their words. When they had advanced <lb/>
            about thirty stadia, Seuthes met them ; and Xenophon, when <lb/>
            lie saw him, invited him to ride up, that he might state to him, <lb/>
            in the hearing of as many as possible, what he thought for <lb/>
            their advantage. 8. As he came forward, Xenophon said, <lb/>
            " We are going to some place where the army will be likely <lb/>
            to get provisions, and where, after hearing your proposals, <lb/>
            and those of the Lacedæmonian, we shall determine upon that <lb/>
            course which may seem best to us. If therefore you will <lb/>
            conduct us to a place where provisions are in the greatest <lb/>
            abundance, we shall consider ourselves as being your guests." <lb/>
            9. Seuthes replied, " I know of several villages lying close to­ <lb/>
            gether, containing all sorts of provisions, and distant from us <lb/>

            fort." "Conduet us, then," said Xenophon,</p>
          <p>10. When they had reached the villages, in the afternoon, <lb/>
            the soldiers assembled, and Seuthes spoke thus: "I wish you, <lb/>
            soldiers, to take service with me, and propose to give each of <lb/>
            you a Cyzicene stater' monthly, and the captains and generals <lb/>
            what is customary. In addition to this, I will do honour to <lb/>
            every man that proves himself worthy of it. Meat and drink <lb/>
            you shall have, as at present, by taking it from the country; <lb/>
            but whatever spoil may be taken, I shall think proper to keep <lb/>
            myself, that, by disposing of it, I may provide pay for you. <note type="footnote"> 1 'O <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι τις ὑμω̄ν δεῑται</foreign>.] Ad guam rent uterque (Seuthes et Aristar­ <lb/>

            shall be able to pursue and discover;1 and such as resist us, <lb/>
            we shall endeavour, with your assistance, to overcome." 12. <lb/>
            Xenophon then inquired, " How far from the sea shall you re­ <lb/>
            quire the army to follow you?" He replied, "Never more <lb/>
            than seven days' march, and often less."</p>
          <p>13. Liberty was then given to any one that wished, to speak; <lb/>
            and many concurred in saying that Seuthes made proposals <lb/>
            of the greatest advantage, as it was winter, and no longer <lb/>
            practicable, even for such as desired, to sail home; and as it <lb/>
            was impossible for them to iive, though in a country of friends, <lb/>
            if they were to subsist by purchasing, while it would be safer <lb/>
            for them to remain and find subsistence in an enemy's country <lb/>
            jointly with Scuthes than by themselves, so many advantages <lb/>
            offering themselves, and if, in addition to these, they also re­ <lb/>
            ceived pay, it appeared to them an unexpected piece of good <lb/>
            fortune. 14. Xenophon then said, " If any one has aught to <lb/>
            say against this opinion, let him speak at once ; if not, let him <lb/>
            vote for it." As no one said anything against it, he put it to <lb/>
            the vote, and the decision was in favour of it. Xenophon <lb/>
            immediately told Seuthes that they would take the field with <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>15. The soldiers then pitched their tents according to their <lb/>
            divisions; the generals and captains Seuthes, who occupied a <lb/>
            neighbouring village, invited to supper. 16. When they were <lb/>
            at the entrance, going in to supper, a man named Heraclides, <lb/>
            a native of Maronea,2 presented himself before them. This <lb/>
            man, addressing himself to every one whom lie thought pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of anything to present to Seuthes, and first to certain <lb/>
            people from Parium,3 who were come to establish a friendship <lb/>
            with Medocus, king of the Odrysæ, and had brought presents <lb/>
            for Seuthes and his wife, said that Medocus resided up the <lb/>
            country, twelve days'journey from the sea, and that Seuthes, <lb/>
            since he had taken this force into his service, would be master <lb/>
            on the coast; 17. " being your neighbour therefore," he added. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διώκειν</foreign> teat <foreign xml:lang="grc">αϭτεύειν</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διώκειν</foreign>, to pursue, with the aid of the <lb/>

            Accosting, in the next place, Timasion the Dardanian, as he <lb/>
            had heard that he had cups and Persian carpets, he observed <lb/>
            that it was customary, whenever Seuthes invited people to <lb/>
            supper, for those who were invited to make him presents; <lb/>
            " and," said he, " if he becomes powerful in this country, he <lb/>
            will be able either to restore you to yours, or to make you <lb/>
            rich here." In this manner he sued for Seuthes, addressing <lb/>
            himself to each of the guests. 19. Advancing also towards <lb/>
            Xenophon, he said, " You are of a most honourable city, and <lb/>
            your name stands very high with Seuthes; and perhaps you <lb/>
            will desire to have some place of strength, and a portion of <lb/>
            land, in this country, as others1 of your countrymen have. <lb/>
            It will be proper for you, therefore, to honour Seuthes most <lb/>
            magnificently; 20. and I give you this advice as your well- <lb/>
            wisher; for I know that the greater presents you make him,2 <lb/>
            the greater benefits you will receive from him." Xenophon, <lb/>
            on hearing this, was in some perplexity ; for he had come over <lb/>
            from Parium with only one servant and just enough money <lb/>
            for the journey.</p>
          <p>21. When the company went in to supper, consisting of the <lb/>
            chief Thracians who were there, the generals and captains of <lb/>
            the Greeks, and such ambassadors as had come from any city, <lb/>
            the supper was prepared for them as they took their seats in <lb/>
            a circle, and tables with three feet were then brought in for <lb/>
            each. These tables were full of pieces of meat piled up, and <lb/>
            large leavened loaves were attached to the meat. 22. The <lb/>
            tables3 were always placed near the strangers in preference to <lb/>
            others; for such was their custom. Seuthes then first pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to act as follows: taking up the loaves that were set <note type="footnote"> 1 He seems chiefly to allude to Alcibiades. See Corn. Nep. Alc. <lb/>

            by him, he broke them into small portions, and distributed to <lb/>
            those whom he pleased, and the flesh in a similar way, leaving <lb/>
            for himself only just sufficient to taste. 23. The rest of those, <lb/>
            before whom tables were placed, followed his example. But <lb/>
            a certain Arcadian, whose name was Arystas, an extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary eater, took no care about distributing, but taking in <lb/>
            his hand a loaf of about three chœnices,1 and placing some <lb/>
            meat upon his knees, went on with his supper. 24. In the <lb/>
            mean time they carried round horns of wine, and everybody <lb/>
            took some; but Arystas, when the cup-bearer came to him <lb/>
            with the horn, and he observed that Xenophon had finished <lb/>
            his supper, said, " Give it to him, for he is now at leisure; I <lb/>
            am not so yet." 25. Seuthes, hearing the voice, asked the <lb/>
            cup-bearer what he said ; and the cup-bearer (for he knew the <lb/>
            Greek language) told him. A laugh in consequence followed.</p>
          <p>26. As the cup made its way, a Thracian entered leading a <lb/>
            white horse, and, taking up a horn full of wine, said, " I drink <lb/>
            to you, 0 Seuthes, and present you with this horse, mounted <lb/>
            on which, and pursuing whomsoever you please, you will over­ <lb/>
            take him, and, when retreating, you will have no cause to fear <lb/>
            an enemy." 27. Another, bringing in a boy, presented him, <lb/>
            drinking to Seuthes, in like manner, and another vestments <lb/>
            for his wife. Timasion, drinking to him, made him a present <lb/>
            of a silver cup, and a carpet worth ten minæ. 28. But one <lb/>
            Gnesippus, an Athenian, rose up and said, that it was an ex­ <lb/>
            cellent custom in old times, that those who had anything <lb/>
            should give presents to the king to do him honour, and that <lb/>
            the king should give to those who have nothing; I therefore <lb/>
            beg something of you,2 that I may have something to present <lb/>
            you, and to do you honour."</p>
          <p>29. As for Xenophon, he was in doubt how to act, for he <lb/>
            was seated, as a person held in honour, in the place next to <lb/>
            Seuthes ; and Heraclides now desired the cup-bearer to pre­ <lb/>
            sent him the horn. However he stood up boldly, (for he had <lb/>
            by this time drunk rather copiously,) and, taking the horn, <lb/>
            said, so. "I present you, 0 Seuthes, myself, and these my <lb/>
            comrades, to be your faithful friends, no one of them being <lb/>
            reluctant, but all desiring, even more than myself, to be your <note type="footnote"> I See i. 5. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ινα και ἐγω, κ</foreign>. r. X.] Sententia aliqua mente supplenda est, ut <lb/>

            and drank with him.1 and then joined with him in sprinkling <lb/>

            reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭυνέπιε</foreign>, which is given by Suidas sub voce <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καταϭκεδάζειν</foreign>. The <lb/>
            use of the preposition <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ</foreign>, indeed, is not very apparent, unless it be <lb/>
            to signify that Seuthes drained the cup to the bottom. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατεϭκεδάϭατο μετὰ τοῡτο τὸ κέρας</foreign>.] " It was a custom of the <lb/>

            observe an honourable and excellent custom." Plato de Legg. i. 9. <lb/>
            The middle voice, in this passage of Xenophon, signifies that the <lb/>
            Thracians poured whatever remained in the cup, after they had <lb/>
            drunk, not on the garments of their guests, but on their own. Kühner. <lb/>
            This critic accordingly rejects the emendation of Pierson ad Moerin, <lb/>
            p. 217, though approved by Toup and Porson: <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭυγκατεϭκέδαϭε τω̃ν <lb/>

            he has admitted that reading into his text, thus making the sense <lb/>
            of the passage, "Seuthes joined with Xenophon in sprinkling the <lb/>
            wine on himself," i. e. Seuthes sprinkled wine from his own goblet <lb/>
            on his own garments, and Xenophon, imitating him, sprinkled wine <lb/>
            from his own goblet on his own garments. This is perhaps the best <lb/>
            way in which the passage can be read and interpreted, if the verb <lb/>
            be kept in the middle voice, which is in accordance with the passage <lb/>
            just cited from Plato, though somewhat at variance with what is <lb/>
            said by Suidas. But whether they sprinkled the wine over their own <lb/>
            clothes or those of others, or both, we may dismiss the passage with <lb/>
            Spelman's observation, that it was a "ridiculous custom. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Athenæus. iv. c. ult., says, '0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ μάγαδις καλούμενος αὐλὰς</foreign>—<unclear>ξὺε</unclear> </note> <pb n="227"/>

            cry, and sprang out of his place with the utmost agility, like a <lb/>
            man guarding against a missile. Buffoons also entered.</p>
          <p>34. When the sun was near setting, the Greeks rose, and <lb/>
            said that it was time to place the guards for the night, and to <lb/>
            give out the watch-word. They requested Seuthes, at the <lb/>
            same time, to give orders that none of the Thracians should <lb/>
            enter the Greek camp by night; " for," said they, " both your <lb/>
            enemies are Thracians, and so are you, our friends." 1 35. As <lb/>
            they were going out, Seuthes stood up, not at all like a man <lb/>
            intoxicated, and, walking forth, and calling back the generals <lb/>
            by themselves, said to them, "The enemy, my friends, know <lb/>
            nothing as yet of our alliance ; if, then. we should march upon <lb/>
            them before they are on their guard against a surprise, or are <lb/>
            prepared to make any defence, we should be very likely to <lb/>
            take both prisoners and booty." 36. The generals expressed <lb/>
            their assent to what he said, and desired him to lead them. <lb/>
            " Prepare yourselves then," he replied, "and wait for me, and, <lb/>
            when the proper time comes, I will come to you, and, taking <lb/>
            the peltasts and yourselves, will, with the aid of the gods, <lb/>
            conduet you." 37. "Consider however," rejoined Xenophon, <lb/>
            "whether, since we are to march in the night, the Greek <lb/>
            practice is not preferable; for on the march, during the day, <lb/>
            whatever part of the army be suitable for the ground, takes <lb/>
            the lead, whether it be the heavy-armed men, or the peltasts, <lb/>
            or the cavalry ; but in the night it is the custom among the <lb/>
            Greeks for the slowest part of the force to lead the way. 38. <lb/>
            Thus the troops are least likely to be dispersed, and least in <lb/>
            danger of straggling unobserved from one another ; for bodies <lb/>
            that have been separated often fall foul of each other, and both <lb/>
            do and suffer injury unawares." 39. "You say well," replied <lb/>
            Seuthes, " and I will conform to your custom ; I will also pro­ <lb/>

          <p>40. When it was about midnight, Seuthes came to them <lb/>
            with his cavalry clad in their corslets, and his peltasts <lb/>
            equipped with their arms. After he had appointed the guides, <lb/>
            the heavy-armed men took the lead, the peltasts followed, and <lb/>
            the cavalry formed the rear-guard. 41. As soon as it was <lb/>
            day, Seuthes rode up to the front, and extolled the Greek <lb/>
            custom, for he said that he himself, when marching in the <lb/>
            night, though but with a small force, had often been separated, <lb/>
            along with the cavalry, from the infantry; " but now," he <lb/>
            added, " we all appear in a body at break of day, as we ought <lb/>
            to be. But halt here, and take some rest, and I, after having <lb/>
            taken a survey of the country, will return to you." 42. When <lb/>
            he said this, he rode off over a hill, taking a particular road. <lb/>
            Having come to-some deep snow, he examined whether there <lb/>
            were any footsteps of men on it, pointing either forward or <lb/>
            the contrary way. But as he found the way untrodden, he <lb/>
            soon came back, and said, 43. " All will be well, my friends, <lb/>
            if the gods be but favourable ; for we shall fall upon the in­ <lb/>
            habitants unawares. For my own part, I will lead the way <lb/>
            with the cavalry, in order that, if we come in sight of any per­ <lb/>
            son, he may not run off and give notice to the enemy. Follow <lb/>
            me; and, if you are left behind, keep in the track of the <lb/>
            cavalry. When we have crossed these hills, we shall come to <lb/>
            a number of well-stored villages."</p>
          <p>44. When it was mid-day, lie had already reached the sum­ <lb/>
            mit, and, after taking a view of the villages, came riding back <lb/>
            to the heavy-armed men, and said, "I will now send off the <lb/>
            horse to gallop down into the plain, and the peltasts to attack <lb/>
            the villages. Follow therefore as fast as you can, that it any <lb/>
            of the enemy offer resistance, you may give your support." <lb/>
            45. Xenophon, on hearing this, alighted from his horse. " Why <lb/>
            do you alight," inquired Seuthes, " when it is necessary to <lb/>
            make haste ? " "I am sure," replied Xenophon, " that you do <lb/>
            not want me only; and the heavy-armed men will hasten on <lb/>
            with greater speed and alacrity, if I lead them on foot." 46. <lb/>
            Seuthes then rode off, and Timasion, with about forty of the <note type="footnote"> I C. 2, sect. 31. </note> <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            Greek cavalry, went with him. Xenophon called on the most <lb/>
            active men of each company, such as were under thirty years <lb/>
            of age, to come forward, and, taking these, he hurried on, <lb/>
            while Cleanor led up the rest of the Greeks. 47. When they <lb/>
            came to the villages, Seuthes, riding up to Xenophon, with <lb/>
            about fifty horse, said, " What you said,' Xenophon, has hap­ <lb/>
            pened ; the inhabitants are captured; but my cavalry are <lb/>
            gone off without a leader, pursuing the people some one way, <lb/>
            some another ; and I am afraid that the enemy, collecting in a <lb/>
            body somewhere, may do us some mischief. It is necessary, <lb/>
            too, that some of us should remain in the villages, for they are <lb/>
            full of people." 48. " I then," said Xenophon, "with the <lb/>
            force that I have, will possess myself of the heights ; and do <lb/>
            you, meanwhile, order Cleanor to extend his line along through <lb/>
            the plain by the villages." When they had made this arrange­ <lb/>
            ment, about a thousand slaves, two thousand oxen, and ten <lb/>
            thousand head of other cattle, were captured. They then took <lb/>
            up their quarters there for the night.</p>

          <p>Seuthes burns the villages, and takes more spoil. The Greeks suffer from <lb/>
            cold. The Barbarians, who had fled, come down from the mountains on <lb/>
            pretence of wishing to make a truce; they thus reconnoitre the camp, and <lb/>
            then attack the Greeks in the night, by whom they are repulsed; they <lb/>
            make submission to Seuthes, and their Lives are spared.</p>
          <p>I. THE next day, Seuthes, having entirely burned the vil­ <lb/>
            lages, and left not a single house standing, (in order to strike <lb/>
            terror into the rest of the people, when they saw what they <lb/>
            would sutler if they did not submit,) made a retreat, a. The <lb/>
            booty he sent Heraclides to sell at Perinthus, that pay might <lb/>
            be raised for the soldiers. He himself and the Greeks en- <note type="footnote">1 To what this alludes, the critics are not agreed. Zeune refers it <lb/>
            to sect. 38; Schneider to sect. 37 ; Bornemann, perhaps with more <lb/>
            probability, to sect. 31, where Xenophon says, "You will become <lb/>
            master of many men and women," to which he considers that the <lb/>
            words of Seuthes, " the inhabitants are captured," refer. Halbkart, <lb/>
            however, considers that it alludes to somethingwhich Xenophan <lb/>
            has omitted to mention. </note> <pb n="230"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            camped on the plain of the Thynians, who left their dwellings, <lb/>
            and fled to the mountains.</p>
          <p>it. There was now a great fall of snow, and such severe <lb/>
            frost, that the water which the attendants brought in for <lb/>
            dinner, and the wine in the vessels, were frozen, and the noses <lb/>
            and ears of many of the Greeks were bitten off. 4. Hence it <lb/>
            became evident why the Thracians wear the skins of foxes <lb/>
            over their heads and cars, and coats that extend not only <lb/>
            over their breasts, but round their thighs ; and why, when on <lb/>
            horseback, they wear wide garments,1 not cloaks, reaching <lb/>
            down to their feet.</p>
          <p>5. Seuthes, sending some of the prisoners to the mountains, <lb/>
            made it known that if the inhabitants did not come down and <lb/>
            submit to him, he would burn both their villages and their <lb/>
            corn, and that they would then perish with hunger. In con­ <lb/>
            sequence the women, children, and old men came down, but <lb/>
            the younger sort encamped in the villages at the foot of the <lb/>
            hills. 6. Seuthes, on receiving notice of their proceedings, <lb/>
            desired Xenophon to take the youngest of the heavy-armed <lb/>
            men, and to follow him. Starting, accordingly, in the night, <lb/>
            they arrived at the villages by break of day. Most of the <lb/>
            occupants tied, for the mountains were elose at hand. All that <lb/>
            Seuthes took, he put to the spear without mercy.</p>
          <p>7. There was with him on this occasion one Episthenes,2 an <lb/>
            Olynthian, a great lover of boys, who, seeing a handsome youth, <lb/>
            just in his bloom, with a shield in his hand, about to be put <lb/>
            to death, ran up to Xenophon, and begged him to intercede <lb/>
            for so beautiful a young man. 8. Xenophon, going up to <lb/>
            Seuthes, begged him not to kill the youth, and made him ac­ <lb/>
            quainted, at the same time, with the character of Episthenes, <lb/>
            telling him that lie once raised a company in which he made <lb/>
            it his sole object that the men should be handsome; and that <lb/>
            at the head of these he proved himself a man of valour. 9. <note type="footnote"> 1 Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">ειάς</foreign>.] From what is said by Harpocration, that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζειραι</foreign> <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 4.] </note> <lb/>
            Seuthes then put this question to Episthenes : " Would you <lb/>
            be willing, Episthenes, to die for this youth?" Episthenes, <lb/>
            stretching out his neck, replied, " Strike, if the youth desires <lb/>
            it, and will feel grateful to me." to. Seuthes next asked the <lb/>
            youth whether he should kill Episthenes instead of him. The <lb/>
            youth would not consent, but besought him to kill neither. <lb/>
            Episthenes then embraced the youth, and said, "Now, Seuthes, <lb/>
            you must fight with me for him ; for I will not give up the <lb/>
            youth." 11. Seuthes laughed, and did nothing further in the <lb/>
            matter.</p>
          <p>It was resolved by Seuthes that they should encamp where <lb/>
            they were, in order that the people upon the mountains might <lb/>
            not get subsistence from the villages. He himself, going down <lb/>
            a little lower into the plain, pitched his camp there. Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, with the select body of men,1 fixed himself in the village <lb/>
            highest up under the hills. The rest of the Greeks took up <lb/>
            their quarters close by, among the people called the mountain <lb/>
            Thracians.</p>
          <p>12. Not many days had elapsed, when the Thracians, coming <lb/>
            down from the hills to Seuthes, made a treaty with him about <lb/>
            a peace, and the giving of hostages. Xenophon, at the same <lb/>
            time, went and told Seuthes that they were encamped in a <lb/>
            dangerous place, and that the enemy were near at hand, and <lb/>
            said that he would rather encamp in some secure post abroad, <lb/>
            than in a sheltered position with the danger of being cut off. <lb/>
            Seuthes bade him fear nothing, and pointed to the hostages <lb/>
            then in his hands. 13. Some of the people from the moun­ <lb/>
            tains, too, came down and begged Xenophon to assist them in <lb/>
            effecting a treaty. Xenophon assented, told them to keep up <lb/>
            their spirits, and engaged that they should suffer no harm if <lb/>
            they submitted to Seuthes. But they had come with this re­ <lb/>
            quest only for the purpose of acting as spies.</p>
          <p>14. These things took place during the day. In the course <lb/>
            of the following night the Thracians came down from the hills <lb/>
            and attacked them. Each master of a house acted as a leader, <lb/>
            for it would have been difficult for them, under any other ar­ <lb/>
            rangement, to find the houses in the villages in the dark, as <lb/>
            they were surrounded with high palisades to secure the cattle. <lb/>
            15. When they came up to the door of each house, some hurled <note type="footnote"> I Ch. 3, sect. 16 </note> <pb n="232"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            their spears in at them, others struck them with their clubs <lb/>
            which they carried, they said, to knock off the heads of the <lb/>
            spears, while others set fire to the buildings, and calling for Xe. <lb/>
            nophon by name, bade him come forth and be put to death ; or <lb/>
            else they declared that he should be burned to ashes upon the <lb/>
            spot. 16. The fire soon began to show itself through the roof, <lb/>
            and Xenophon and his men were within, with their corslets <lb/>
            on, and their shields, swords, and helmets1 in their hands, <lb/>
            when Silanus, a native of Macestus,2 about eighteen years of <lb/>
            age,3 blew a signal with the trumpet, and they immediately <lb/>
            rushed out, with their swords drawn, as well as those from <lb/>
            the neighbouring houses. IT. The Thracians at once took t- <lb/>
            flight, slinging their shields, as was their custom, over the­ <lb/>
            shoulders ; and some of them, as they were trying to leap ovet <lb/>
            the palisades, were caught and suspended, their shields stick­ <lb/>
            ing fast among the stakes ; some were killed through missing <lb/>
            the outlets; and the Greeks drove the rest out of the village. <lb/>
            IS. A party of the Thynians, however, came back under cover <lb/>
            of the darkness, and hurled their javelins at some of the Greeks <lb/>
            that were running past a burning house, taking aim out- of the <lb/>
            darkness at those who were in the light; they wounded Hiero­ <lb/>
            nymus a Euodean,4 and Theogenes a Locrian, both captains ; <lb/>
            but nobody was killed; though the clothes and baggage of <lb/>
            some of them were burned. 19. Seuthes came to their relief <lb/>
            with seven horsemen, the first that he met, bringing with <lb/>
            him the Thracian trumpeter; and, when he saw how matters <lb/>
            stood, the trumpet, by his orders, continued to sound as long <lb/>
            as he was on the march to give aid; so that this noise also <note type="footnote"> I Perhaps they had been prevented by the lowness of the roofs <lb/>

          <p>20. Xenophon then requested Scuthes to give up the host­ <lb/>
            ages to him,1 and to march with him, if lie was willing, to the <lb/>
            mountains ; if not, to permit him to go himself. 21. The next <lb/>
            day, accordingly, Seuthes gave him the hostages, (who were <lb/>
            men of advanced age, the most considerable persons, as they <lb/>
            said, among the mountaineers,) and joined him with his army. <lb/>
            Scuthes had now a force three times as large as before ;2 for <lb/>
            many of the Odrysæ, on hearing what he was doing, had come <lb/>
            down to take the field with him. 22. The Thynians, when <lb/>
            they beheld from the mountains so vast a force of heavy- <lb/>
            armed men, peltasts, and cavalry, came down and besought <lb/>
            him to make peace with them, engaging to serve him in every <lb/>
            way, and requesting him to accept pledges from them. 23. <lb/>
            Seuthes, calling in Xenophon, communicated to him what <lb/>
            they said, and observed, at the same time, that he would not <lb/>
            make peace, if Xenophon wished to take revenge on them <lb/>
            for their attack. 24. Xenophon replied, " I consider my­ <lb/>
            self sufficiently revenged, if these people, instead of remain­ <lb/>
            ing free, are to become slaves;" adding, however, that he <lb/>
            advised him to take as hostages in future those who had most <lb/>
            power to harm him, and to let the old men stay at home. All <lb/>

          <p>Seuthes, selecting three pairs of mules, (for there were no <lb/>

            him to accept the first for himself, and to distribute the others <lb/>
            among the generals and captains. 3. Xenophon replied, "For <lb/>
            myself it will be sufficient to receive something another time ; <lb/>
            give these to the generals and captains that have followed you <lb/>
            in company with me." 4. Timasion the Dardanian then re­ <lb/>
            ceived one of the pairs, Cleaner the Orchomenian another, <lb/>
            and Phryniscus the Achæan the third ; the pairs of oxen were <lb/>
            divided among the captains. But Seuthes gave the army <lb/>
            only twenty days' pay, though the month was expired; for <lb/>
            Heraelides said that he had been unable to sell any more.3 <lb/>
            5. Xenophon, being concerned at this deficiency, exclaimed, <lb/>
            with an imprecation, "Yon seem to me, Heraclides, not to <lb/>
            have such care for the interests of Seuthes as you ought to <lb/>
            have; for, if you had such care, you would have brought the <lb/>
            full pay, even though you had borrowed money to make it up, <lb/>
            or sold your own clothes, if you could not raise the sum by <lb/>

          <p>6. At this reproach Heraclides was extremely vexed, and <lb/>
            feared that he should be deprived of the friendship of Seuthes ; <lb/>
            and, from that day, in whatever way he could, he laboured to <lb/>
            bring Xenophon into disgrace with Seuthes. 7. The soldiers, <lb/>
            too, threw blame upon Xenophon because they did not receive <lb/>

            and Ncontichos, but, after that period, he alluded to none of <lb/>
            those places ; for Heraclides had maliciously insinuated that <lb/>
            it was not safe to intrust fortresses to a man at the head of <lb/>
            an army.</p>
          <p>9. Xenophon, in consequence, began to consider with him­ <lb/>
            self what he ought to do about the expedition farther up the <lb/>
            country. Heraclides, meantime, was thrusting the other ge­ <lb/>
            nerals upon Seuthes, and urging them to say that they could <lb/>
            lead the army not less effetively than Xenophon ; he assured <lb/>
            them also that, in a few days, their full pay for two months <lb/>
            should be given them, and recommended them to continue in <lb/>
            the service of Seuthes. 10. To this Timasion replied, "For <lb/>
            my part, even if five months' pay were to be given me, I <lb/>
            would not serve without Xenophon." Phryniseus and Cleamor <lb/>
            expressed the same sentiments as Tin.asion.</p>
          <p>II, Seuthes then blamed Heraclides for not calling in Xe­ <lb/>
            nophon with them ; and they accordingly sent for him alone. <lb/>
            But Xenophon, seeing that this was a trick of Heraclides, to <lb/>
            render him unpopular with the rest of the generals, took with. <lb/>
            him, when he went, not only all the generals, but all the cap­ <lb/>
            tains. 12. As they were all moved by the arguments of <lb/>
            Seuthes, they joined him in an expedition, and proceeded <lb/>
            through the country of the Thracians called Melinophagi, <lb/>
            keeping the Euxine Sea on the right, to Salmydessus, Here <lb/>
            many of the ships sailing into the Euxine are grounded and <lb/>
            driven ashore ; for a shoal there stretches far out into the sea.</p>
          <p>13. The Thracians who live in those parts, set up pillars as <lb/>
            boundaries, and each party plunder the wrecks stranded on <lb/>
            their own portion of the coast; but for some time before they <lb/>
            erected the pillars, it was said that they fell in great numbers <lb/>
            by the hands of each other while engaged in plundering. 14. In <lb/>
            this place were found couches, boxes, written books,. and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολλαὶ δὲ βίβλοιγεγραμμέναι</foreign>. If <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεγραμμέναι</foreign> is genuine, as can­ <lb/>

            surprise at the mention of written books in this passage, because they <lb/>
            were extremely scarce in those days, and because it was not at all <lb/>

            again. 15. Seuthes had now an army superior in number to <lb/>
            that of the Greeks; for many more of the Odrysoe had come <lb/>
            down to him, and others, as fast as they submitted, joined his <lb/>
            force. They encamped in a plain above Selybria, at the dis­ <lb/>
            tance of about thirty stadia from the sea. 16. No pay as yet <lb/>
            appeared ; the soldiers were greatly dissatisfied with Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon; and Seuthes no longer treated him with familiarity, <lb/>
            but, whenever he went to desire to speak with him, many en­ <lb/>
            gagements were pretended.</p>

          <p>The Greeks are solicited by the Lacedæmonians to join them in a war with <lb/>
            Tissaphernes, when a certain Arcadian brings a formal accusation against <lb/>
            Xenophon ; he defends himself, and is justified by others. He is requested <lb/>
            by Scuthes to remain in his service with a thousand men, but resolves to <lb/>
            depart.</p>
          <p>I. AT this time, when two months had nearly expired, <lb/>
            Charminus, a Lacedæmonian, and Pulynicus, came from Thi­ <lb/>
            bron, and stated that the Lacedæmonians had resolved to take <lb/>
            the field against Tissaphernes, and that Thibron2 had set sail <note type="footnote"> Some have thought that <foreign xml:lang="grc">βίλοι</foreign> here means merely rolls of bark, as <lb/>

            that of Zeune and Weiske, who think that nothing but paper it <lb/>

            to assume Cyrus's authority, and take vengeance on such as had <lb/>
            supported him. The cities of Ionia, fearing his resentment, had <lb/>
            applied for protection to the Lacedæmonians, who had sent out Thi­ <lb/>
            bron thither as harmost. with an army of 4500 men- See Xen. <lb/>

            for tIle purpose of carrying on the war with him ; adding that <lb/>
            he was in want of this auxiliary force, and promised that a <lb/>
            daric a month should be the pay for each common soldier, <lb/>
            twice as much for the captains, and four times as much for the <lb/>
            generals. a. When these Lacedæmonians arrived, Heraclides. <lb/>
            hearing that they were come for the army, remarked to Seu­ <lb/>
            thes that it was a fortunate occurrence, " for the Lacedæmoni­ <lb/>
            ans," said he, " are in want of the army, and you no longer <lb/>
            require it; by resigning it, therefore, you will gratify them, <lb/>
            and the soldiers will cease to ask you for pay, and will leave <lb/>
            the country."</p>
          <p>3. Seuthes, listening to these representations, desired him to <lb/>
            bring the Lacedæmonians to him; and as they told him that <lb/>
            they were come for the army, he said that he would give it up, <lb/>
            and was willing to be their friend and ally, and invited them <lb/>
            to a banquet, at which he entertained them magnificently, but <lb/>
            did not invite Xenophon, or any of the other generals. 4. <lb/>
            The Lacedæmonians inquiring what sort of a person Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon was, he replied, that in other respects he was not a bad <lb/>
            man, but that he was a great friend to the soldiers, " and on that <lb/>
            account," added he, " it is the worse for him." 1 " Does the <lb/>
            man then," said they, " try to make himself popular with the <lb/>
            soldiers?" " Certainly," replied Heraclides. 5. "Will he not <lb/>
            then oppose us," said they, "respecting the removal of the <lb/>
            army?" But if you call the soldiers together," rejoined He­ <lb/>
            raclides, " and promise them pay, they will show little regard <lb/>
            to him, and will hasten away with you." 6. " How, then," <lb/>
            said they, "can they be assembled to hear us ?" " To-morrow <lb/>
            morning," answered Heraclides, " we will bring you to them, <lb/>
            and I feel assured that, as soon as they see you, they will <lb/>
            readily flock together." Thus ended that day.</p>
          <p>7. Next morning Seuthes and Heraclides conducted the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians to the army, and the soldiers were called to­ <lb/>
            gether. The Lacedæmonians then stated that it was resolved <lb/>
            by their countrymen to go to war with Tissaphernes, " who," <lb/>
            said they, " has injured you. If therefore you join with us, <lb/>
            you will both revenge yourselves on an enemy, and will re­ <lb/>
            ceive, each of you, a daric a month, a captain double, and a <lb/>
            general fourfold." 8. The soldiers listened to this offer will. <note type="footnote"> I He is in a worse condition than he would be, if he paid less re­ <lb/>

            pleasure; and one of the Arcadians immediately rose up to <lb/>
            make an accusation against Xenophon. Semites was also pre­ <lb/>

            terpreter, though he himself understood most of what was <lb/>
            spoken in Greek, a. The Arcadian proceeded to say, " We <lb/>
            should certainly, 0 Lacedæmonians, have been with you long <lb/>
            ago, if Xenophon had not wrought upon us and led us hither, <lb/>
            where, serving through a severe winter, we have had no rest <lb/>
            night or day ; while he has the fruit of our labours, and Seu­ <lb/>
            thes enriches him personally, and deprives us of our pay; 10. <lb/>
            so that if I, who am the first to speak on this occasion, could <lb/>
            see him stoned to death, and paying the penalty for what he <lb/>
            has made us suffer in dragging us about, I should think that I <lb/>
            had received my pay, and should cease to be concerned at <lb/>
            what I have undergone." After him another stood up, and <lb/>
            then another; whell Xenophon proceeded to speak as follows:</p>
          <p>II. " A mail may well, indeed, expect any kind of fate, <lb/>
            since I now meet with accusations from you, at a time when I <lb/>
            am conscious of having displayed the utmost zeal to serve you. <lb/>
            After I had set out homewards, I turned back, not certainly <lb/>
            from learning 'liat you were in a satisfactory condition, but <lb/>
            rather from hearing that you were in difficulties, and with the <lb/>
            intention of aiding you if I could.2 12. When I got back to <lb/>
            the army, though Seuthes here sent many messengers to me, <lb/>
            and promised me many advantages, if I would induce you to <lb/>
            go to him, I made no attempt, as you yourselves know, to do <lb/>
            so, but led you to a place3 from which I thought you would <lb/>
            have the quickest passage into Asia; for I considered that <lb/>
            this course would be best for you, and knew that you desired <lb/>
            it. is. But -hen Aristarehus came with his galleys, and <lb/>
            prevented you from sailing aeross, I then (as was doubtless <lb/>
            proper) calle you together, that we might consider what <lb/>
            measures we ought to take. 14. After hearing then Aristar­ <lb/>
            chus, on the one hand, desiring you to go to the Chersonesus, <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πεπαύμεϑα</foreign>.] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πεπάμεϑα</foreign> has crept into many editions, Henry <lb/>

            and listening to Seuthes, on the other, urging you to take the <lb/>
            field with him, you all said that you would go with Seuthes, <lb/>
            and all gave your votes for that course. In what respect then <lb/>
            did I wrong you on that occasion, by leading you whither you <lb/>
            all resolved to go ?</p>
          <p>is. " Since Seuthes, however, has begun to break his word <lb/>
            concerning your pay, you, if I were to express approbation of <lb/>
            his conduct, would justly accuse and detest me : but if I, who <lb/>
            was previously his greatest friend, am now most of all men at <lb/>
            variance with him, with what reason can I, who have prefer­ <lb/>
            red your interest to that. of Seuthes, incur censure from you <lb/>
            for that very conduct through which I have brought upon me <lb/>
            his enmity? 16. But perhaps you may say that I have re­ <lb/>
            ceived your pay from Seuthes, and am merely deluding you. <lb/>
            This however is certain, that if Seuthes has paid me anything, <lb/>
            he did not pay it with a view of losing what he gave me, and <lb/>
            of paying, at the same time, an additional sum to you ; but, I <lb/>
            should think, if he had given me anything, he would have <lb/>
            given it with this intention, that by bestowing on me a less <lb/>
            sum, he might not have to pay you a greater. 17. If there­ <lb/>
            fore you suppose that such is the ease, it is in your power to <lb/>
            render the compact profitless to both of us, by requiring from <lb/>
            him your pay ; for it is evident that Seuthes, if I have re­ <lb/>
            ceived anything from him, will in that case demand it back <lb/>
            from me, and will demand it justly, if I fail to fulfil the coil­ <lb/>
            tract for which I was bribed? IS. But I am conscious of <lb/>
            being far from possessing anything that belongs to you ; for I <lb/>
            swear to you by all the gods and goddesses, that I have not <lb/>
            even received what Seuthes promised me for myself; and he <lb/>
            is himself present, and as he hears me, knows whether I com­ <lb/>
            init perjury or not; 19. and, that you may be still more sur­ <lb/>
            prised, I swear that I have not even received as much as the <lb/>
            other generals have received, no, nor even as much as some of <lb/>
            the captains. 20. From what motive, then, did I act thus? <lb/>
            I thought, my fellow-soldiers, that the more I participated in <lb/>
            his poverty for the time, the more effectually should I render <lb/>
            him my friend when he should be able to serve me. But <lb/>
            I now see him at once in a state of prosperity, and understand <lb/>
            his real disposition. 21. Possibly some one may say, , Are <lb/>
            you not ashamed, then, of having been thus foolishly deceived ?' <lb/>
            I should indeed be ashamed, if I had been thus deceived by an <pb n="240"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            enemy, but in a friend it appears far more disgraceful to de­ <lb/>
            ceive than to be deceived. 22. If however we are to be on <lb/>
            our guard against friends, I know that we have been on the <lb/>
            strictest guard not to give Seuthes any just pretence for re­ <lb/>
            fusing to pay us what he promised; for we have neither done <lb/>
            him any harm, nor neglected his interests, nor shrunk from <lb/>
            any undertaking to which he called us.</p>
          <p>23. " But, you may say, I ought to have taken pledges at <lb/>
            the time, that even if he had had the will, lie might not have <lb/>
            had the power to deceive. With regard to this point, hear <lb/>
            what I should never have mentioned before him,1 if you had <lb/>
            not shown yourselves either extremely inconsiderate or ex­ <lb/>
            tremely ungrateful towards me. 24. For recollect in what <lb/>
            circumstances you were placed, when I extricated you from <lb/>
            them by conducting you to Seuthes. Did not 2 Aristarchus <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonian prevent you from entering Perinthus, shut­ <lb/>
            ting the gates if you offered to approach the city ? Did you <lb/>
            not encamp without the walls in the open air ? Was it not the <lb/>
            middle of winter? Had you not to buy provisions, when you <lb/>
            found but few commodities for sale, and had but little with <lb/>
            which to buy ? 25. Were you not obliged to remain in <lb/>
            Thrace, because galleys at anchor preveNted you from sailing <lb/>
            across, while, whoever stayed, had to stay in an enemy's <lb/>
            country, where there were numbers of cavalry and numbers of <lb/>
            peltasts to oppose you ? 26. And though we had a heavy- <lb/>
            armed force, with which, going to the villages in a body, we <lb/>
            might perhaps have procured a moderate supply of food, we <lb/>
            had no troops with which we could pursue or capture slaves <lb/>
            or cattle; for I found neither cavalry nor peltasts any longer <lb/>
            existing in a body among you. 27. If, then, when you were <lb/>
            in such straits, I had, without demanding any pay for you, <lb/>
            procured you Seuthes as an ally, who had cavalry and pel­ <lb/>
            tasts, of which you were in want, should I have appeared to <lb/>

            after the cavalry was attached to us, though, before that time, <lb/>
            they pursued us both with horse and peltasts, hindering us <lb/>

            you this security, did not give you, in addition, very high pay <lb/>
            for the security,' is this the dreadful calamity of which you <lb/>
            complain, and do you think that, on this account, you ought <lb/>
            by no means to allow me to live ?</p>
          <p>31. "But under what circumstances is it that you are now <lb/>
            leaving the country? Is it not after having passed the winter <lb/>
            in the midst of abundance, and while you have in your pos­ <lb/>
            session, besides, whatever you have received from Seuthes? <lb/>
            What you have consumed belonged to the enemy; and, while <lb/>
            faring thus, you have neither seen any of your number killed, <lb/>
            nor lost any alive. 32. If any reputation had been gained by <lb/>
            you against the Barbarians in Asia, have you not that still <lb/>
            undiminished, and have you not added to it new glory by sub­ <lb/>
            duing the Thracians, against whom you took the field, in <lb/>
            Europe? I think, indeed, that you may justly return thanks <lb/>
            to the gods, as for so many blessings, for those very things <lb/>
            for which you are incensed against me.</p>
          <p>33. " Such is the state of your affairs; and now, in the <lb/>
            name of the gods, consider what is the condition of mine. <lb/>
            When I first set sail for home, I went off with great praise <lb/>
            from you, and with honour, through your means, from the rest <lb/>
            of the Greeks. I was also trusted by the Lacedæmonians, or <lb/>
            they would not have sent me back to you.2 34. But now I <lb/>
            go away calumniated in the eyes of the Lacedæmonians by <lb/>
            your statements, and at enmity with Seuthes upon your ac­ <lb/>

            to secure as an honourable protector both for myself and my <lb/>
            children, if I should have any. 35. Yet you, for whose sake <lb/>
            chiefly I have incurred hatred, and incurred it from people <lb/>
            far more powerful than myself, and while I do not yet cease <lb/>

            your power, having neither found me fleeing nor attempting <lb/>
            to flee; and, if you do what you say, you will put to death a. <lb/>

            through many toils and dangers in company with yon, accord­ <lb/>

            the gods, has raised with you many trophies over the Bar­ <lb/>
            barians ; and who has exerted himself most strenuously for <lb/>
            you,1 in every way that he could, in order that you might not <lb/>
            make yourselves enemies to any of the Greeks. 37. As it is, <lb/>
            you are at liberty to go whither you please, by set or land, <lb/>
            without censure; and now, when abundance of everything <lb/>
            presents itself before you, when you are going to sail whither <lb/>
            you have long desired to go, when those who are at the <lb/>
            height of power solicit your services, when pay is offered, and <lb/>
            when Lacedæmonians, who are thought to be the best of <lb/>
            leaders, are come to take the command of you, does it seem to <lb/>
            you to be a fit time for putting me at once to death ? 38. You <lb/>
            had no such inclination when we were in the midst of hard­ <lb/>
            ships, 0 men of admirable memories!2 You then called me <lb/>
            father, and promised always to remember me as your bene­ <lb/>
            factor. However, those, who are now come to request your <lb/>
            services, are not void of judgment, so that, as I think, you <lb/>
            will not, by being such as you are towards me, appear better <lb/>

            which account, he observed, it was worse for him1 both with <lb/>

            Arcadian, a native of Lusia,2 rising up after him, exclaimed, <lb/>
            " It seems to me, Lacedæmonians, that your first act of gener­ <lb/>

            either with his consent or against it, and that, till you do so, <lb/>
            you ought not to lead us from hence." 41. Polycrates, the <lb/>
            Athenian, next rose and spoke in favour of Xenophon :3 " I <lb/>
            see," said he, “ soldiers, Heraclides also present here, who, after <lb/>
            receiving the spoil which we obtained by our exertions, and <lb/>
            having sold it, gave the proceeds neither to Seuthes nor to us, <lb/>
            but, having appropriated it to himself, still keeps possession <lb/>
            of it. If therefore we are wise, we shall lay hold of him, for <lb/>

          <p>42. Heraclides, on hearing this remark, was still more4 <lb/>
            alarmed, and, moving towards Seuthes, said, " If we are wise,5 <lb/>
            we shall withdraw from hence, out of the power of these men." <lb/>

            Kiihner, " in behalf of Xenophon, but rather with a covert attempt <lb/>

          <p>The Greeks go to get provisions from the villages. Medosades tries tosend <lb/>

          <p>1. SEUTHES then encamped at a great distance; and the <lb/>
            Greeks quartered in villages from which they intended to get <lb/>
            plenty of provisions, and then to march to the sea. These <lb/>
            villages had been given by Seuthes to Medosades; 2. who, <lb/>

            of the Grecian camp. Xenophon, taking some of the captains, <lb/>
            and other proper persons, came out to meet him. 3. Medosades <lb/>
            then said, "You act unjustly, 0 Xenophon, in laying waste our <lb/>

            the information of this young man, I will reply to you, that he <lb/>
            may know what sort of people you are, and what sort we are. <lb/>

            ed through this country whithersoever we thought fit, laying <lb/>
            waste what we pleased, and burning what we pleased ; 6. and <lb/>
            you yourself, when you came to us as an ambassador, pitched <lb/>
            your tent with us, without fear of any enemy; but your people <lb/>
            never entered this region at all, or, if ever you did venture <lb/>
            into it, used to encamp with your horses still bridled, as in the <lb/>
            territory of those more powerful than yourselves. 7. But <lb/>
            now, since you have become allied with us, and have by our <lb/>
            means, and with the assistance of the gods, got possession of <lb/>
            the country, you would drive us from that very land which <lb/>
            you received from us, when we held it as our own by force of <lb/>
            arms, for, as you are aware, the enemy were not strong enough <lb/>
            to dispossess us. 8. And you would send us away, not only <lb/>
            without offering us a present, or doing us any service in re­ <lb/>

            vent us, when we are just taking our departure. 9. In ad­ <lb/>
            dressing us thus, you show no respect either for the gods or <lb/>
            for the man that accompanies you, who beholds you now <lb/>
            abounding in wealth, but who saw you, before you were our <lb/>

            have acknowledged.1 to. But why do you address yourself <lb/>
            thus to me," added Xenophon, “for I no longer hold the com­ <lb/>

            listen to such a statement. Had I known this before, I should <lb/>
            certainly not have accompanied you, and shall now take my de­ <lb/>
            parture ; for Medocus, my king, would by no means approve <lb/>
            my conduct, if I should assist in expelling his benefactors <note type="footnote">1 C. 2, sect. 34. Kühner, . </note> <pb n="246"/>

            from the country." 12. As he uttered these words, he mounted <lb/>
            his horse and rode off, and all the other horsemen went with <lb/>
            him, except four or five. But Medosades (for the devastation <lb/>
            of the country made him uneasy) requested Xenophon to call <lb/>
            to him the two Lacedæmonians. 13. Xenophon, taking the <lb/>
            most eligible persons to attend him, went to Charminus and <lb/>
            Polynicus, and told them that Medosades wished to speak <lb/>
            with them, intending to warn them, as they had warned him, <lb/>
            to quit the country. 14. "I think, therefore," continued <lb/>
            Xenophon, " that you might secure the pay owing to the <lb/>
            army, if you were to say that the troops have entreated you to <lb/>
            support them in obtaining their dues from Seuthes, whether <lb/>
            with his consent or without it; that they engage to follow you <lb/>
            cheerfully if they gain their object; that they appear to you <lb/>
            to say what is just; and that you have promised them not to <lb/>
            depart until they have received their just demands." IS. The <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians replied that they would say this, and what­ <lb/>
            ever else they might be able to urge with the greatest effect; <lb/>
            and immediately set out, with all proper persons accompany­ <lb/>
            ing them.</p>
          <p>When they arrived, Charminus said, " If you have anything <lb/>
            to say to us, Medosades, speak ; if not, we have something to <lb/>
            say to you." 16. Medosades replied, very submissively, "I <lb/>
            have to say, and Seuthes says the same, that we desire that <lb/>
            those who have become our friends may suffer no evil at your <lb/>
            hands ; for whatever harm you do to them, you do at the same <lb/>
            time to us, as they are our allies.” 17. “ We, then," said the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians, " shall be ready to depart, when those who <lb/>
            have effected such services for you, have received their pay ; <lb/>
            if they do not receive it, we are here even now to take their <lb/>
            part, and to take vengeance on such as have wronged them in <lb/>
            violation of their oaths. If you are of that number, it is from <lb/>
            you that we shall begin to require justice for them." 18. <lb/>
            " Would you be willing, Medosades,” rejoined Xenophon, " to <lb/>
            leave it to the people in whose country we are, (as you say <lb/>
            that they are your friends,) to decide whether it is fit that you <lb/>
            should quit the country, or we ?” 19. To this proposal he <lb/>
            would not consent, but urged the two Lacedæmonians by all <lb/>
            means to go to Seuthes about the pay, and said that he thought <lb/>
            they would succeed with Seuthes; if they did not, he re­ <lb/>
            quested them to send Xenophon with him, and promised to <pb n="247"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 7.] </note> <lb/>
            support their application. In the mean time he begged them <lb/>
            not to burn the villages.</p>
          <p>20. They then deputed Xenophon, and those who appeared <lb/>
            most eligible along with him. When he came to Seuthes, ho <lb/>
            said, “1 am not come, 0 Seuthes, to ask anything of you, <lb/>
            but to convince you, if I am able, 21. that you had no just <lb/>
            cause to be displeased with me for demanding, on behalf of the <lb/>
            soldiers, the pay which you so readily promised them; since <lb/>
            I thought it would be not less advantageous for you to pay it <lb/>
            than for them to receive it; 22. for I knew that, next to the <lb/>
            gods, they have been instrumental in placing you in a con­ <lb/>
            spicuous position, by making you king over a large extent of <lb/>
            country and great numbers of people, so that it is not possible <lb/>
            for you to escape the notice of mankind, whether you do what <lb/>
            is good or what is evil. 23. To a man in such a con­ <lb/>
            dition it seems to me to be of no small importance that he <lb/>
            should not be thought to send away his benefactors with­ <lb/>
            out gratitude; of importance also to have the approbation of <lb/>
            six thousand men; and most important of all to show that you <lb/>
            are never to be distrusted in what you say. 24. For I observe <lb/>
            the words of the faithless wander about without power, influ­ <lb/>
            ence, or regard ; while the words of those who are known to <lb/>
            observe truth, are not less effectual, if they desire anything, <lb/>
            in accomplishing their desire, than the strength of other men ; <lb/>
            if they wish to recall any one to his duty, I know that the <lb/>
            threats of such men are not less influential in producing re­ <lb/>
            form than the actual punishments of others; and if men of <lb/>
            such a character promise anything, they produce no less ef­ <lb/>
            fect by their promises than others by giving at the moment. <lb/>
            25. Consider with yourself: what did you pay us before you <lb/>
            obtained our alliance ? You know that you paid us nothing; <lb/>
            but from confidence being placed in you that you would truly <lb/>
            perform what you said, you induced such a number of men to <lb/>
            join you in the field, and to conquer for you a kingdom not <lb/>
            worth fifty talents merely, the sum which they now think they <lb/>
            ought to receive from you, but many times that sum. 26. <lb/>
            First of all, then, this confidence which was placed in you, <lb/>
            and which secured you the kingdom, is bartered away by you <lb/>
            for this sum of money.</p>
          <p>27. “Consider, too, how great a matter you then thought it <lb/>
            to obtain those dominions which you have now subjugated <pb n="248"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. VIII </note> <lb/>
            and possess. I am well aware that you would have prayed <lb/>
            for the accomplishment of what has now been done for you <lb/>
            rather than for many times such a sum of money. 28. To <lb/>
            me, then, it seems a greater disadvantage, as well as a greater <lb/>
            disgrace, not to retain this power than not to have acquired <lb/>
            it; just as it is more grievous to a man to become poor after <lb/>
            being rich than never to have been rich at all, and as it is <lb/>
            more afflicting to appear as a private man after having been <lb/>
            a king, than never to have been on a throne. 29. You are <lb/>
            sensible, moreover, that those who have now become your <lb/>
            subjects, have not submitted to be governed by you from any <lb/>
            affection for you personally, but from necessity, and that they <lb/>
            would endeavour to make themselves free again, if there were <lb/>
            no fear to restrain them. 30. Whether therefore do you think <lb/>
            that they will be more under the restraint of fear, and act <lb/>
            more sensibly for your interests, if they should see these troops <lb/>
            so disposed towards you, as to be willing to stay now if you <lb/>
            request them, or soon to return again if it should be necessary, <lb/>
            End find that others, hearing many good accounts of you from. <lb/>
            these, are ready to join you at once whenever you wish.; or if <lb/>
            they should form an unfavourable opinion of you, and believe <lb/>
            that no others will engage in your service through distrust <lb/>
            arising from what has now happened, and that the Greeks are <lb/>
            better affected towards your new subjects than yourself? 31. <lb/>
            These people, besides, did not submit to you because they <lb/>
            were inferior in number to us, but because they wanted lead­ <lb/>
            ers. It is now a matter of apprehension, then, that they may <lb/>
            choose some of our men, who think themselves wronged by <lb/>
            you, or the Lacedæmonians, who are still more powerful than <lb/>
            they, as leaders, especially if, on the one hand, our soldiers <lb/>
            promise to serve the Lacedæmonians with greater alacrity, on <lb/>
            condition that they. exact what is due to them from you, and <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, on the other, assent to this condition <lb/>
            from the need which they have of our army. 32. That the <lb/>
            Thracians who have just become subject to you, would march <lb/>
            against you much more willingly than with you, is indisput­ <lb/>
            able ; for, while you hold the mastery, servitude is their lot, <lb/>
            but, if you are conquered, freedom.</p>
          <p>33. " If, again, it be your business to take forethought for <note type="footnote"> That is, the Lacedæmonians. </note> <pb n="249"/>

            the country, as being your own property, whether you do <lb/>
            think that it would be less exposed to harm, if these soldiers, <lb/>
            after having received from you what they claim, should go <lb/>
            away leaving peace behind them, or if they stay in the coun­ <lb/>
            try as in that of an enemy, and you, with other soldiers more <unclear/> <lb/>
            umerous than they, who will be constantly in want of pro­ <lb/>
            visions, proceed to take the field against them ? 34. Or whe­ <lb/>
            ther will more money be expended by you, if what is due to <lb/>
            the Greeks be paid, or if this be left due, and you have at the <lb/>
            same time to take other troops, able to overcome them, into <lb/>
            your service ?</p>
          <p>35. "But this sum, in the opinion of Heraclides, (as he ex­ <lb/>
            pressed himself to me,) appears excessively large. It is <lb/>
            doubtless, however, a much lighter matter for you either to <lb/>
            receive or pay such a sum, than it was, before we joined you, <lb/>
            to receive or pay the tenth part of it. 36. For it is not the <lb/>
            actual amount that defines the much or the little, but the <lb/>
            ability of him who has to pay or to receive. But your annual <lb/>
            income is now greater than the whole of the property which <lb/>
            you formerly possessed.</p>
          <p>37. " In these observations, 0 Seuthes, I have had regard <lb/>
            to your interest as to that of a friend, in order that you may <lb/>
            appear worthy of the advantages which the gods have be­ <lb/>
            stowed upon you, and that I, at the same time, may not lose <lb/>
            all reputation with the army. 38. For be assured, that if I <lb/>
            now wished to do harm to an enemy, I should not be able to <lb/>
            effect it with these troops, and that, if I desired again to give <lb/>
            assistance to you, I should not be in a condition to do so; such <lb/>
            is the feeling of the army towards me. 39. Yet I call both <lb/>
            you yourself, and the gods who know the truth, to witness, <lb/>
            that I have neither received anything from you on account of <lb/>
            the soldiers, nor have I ever asked of you, for my own private <lb/>
            use, what was due to them, nor have I claimed what you pro­ <lb/>
            mised me. 40. I also swear to you, that, even though you had <lb/>
            offered to pay me, I would not have received anything from <lb/>
            you, unless the soldiers had been at the same time to receive <lb/>
            what was due to them ; for it would have been disgraceful in <lb/>
            me to have settled my own business, and to have allowed <lb/>
            theirs to continue in an unsatisfactory condition, especially <lb/>
            when I had received honour from them.</p>
          <p>1 " To Ileraclides, however, everything seems a trifle, in <pb n="250"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. VII. </note> <lb/>
            comparison with the acquirement of money by whatever <lb/>
            means. But I, 0 Seuthes, think no possession more honour­ <lb/>
            able or more glorious to a man than that of virtue, and justice, <lb/>
            and generosity. 42. lie that has these qualities, is rich in the <lb/>
            numerous friends that lie has, and rich in the good-will of <lb/>
            numbers that wish to become his friends ; if he is prosperous, <lb/>
            he has associates ready to rejoice with him ; if he meets with <lb/>
            a reverse of fortune, he is not in want of people to lend <lb/>
            him aid.</p>
          <p>-13. " If you have neither understood from my actions that <lb/>
            I am a friend to you at heart, nor are able to discover it from <lb/>
            my words, yet consider, by all means, the expressions of the <lb/>
            soldiers concerning me; for you were present and heard what <lb/>
            those said who sought to asperse rile. 44. They accused me <lb/>
            to the Lacedæmonians of regarding you more than them ; <lb/>
            they also charged me with taking more care that your affairs <lb/>
            might prosper than their own ; and they added, that I had <lb/>
            received presents from you. 4.5. Whether, then, do you <lb/>
            think that they accused me of having received those presents <lb/>
            from you, because they saw in me some ill-will towards you, <lb/>
            or because they observed in me a great zeal for your good ? <lb/>
            46. I consider, indeed, that all men are of opinion that grati­ <lb/>
            tude ought to be cherished1 towards him from whom they <lb/>
            have received favours. You, before I did you any service, <lb/>
            entertained me favourably with looks, and words, and demon­ <lb/>
            strations of hospitality, and were never satisfied with promis­ <lb/>
            ing how great rewards should be mine; and now, when you <lb/>
            have accomplished what you desired, and have become as <lb/>
            great as I could assist you to become, have you the heart to <lb/>
            allow me to be thus dishonoured among the soldiers ? 47. I <lb/>
            have nevertheless confidence that time will yet teach you to <lb/>
            resolve to pay, and that you, of yourself, will not endure to <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀποκει̃σϑαι</foreign>.] Two manuscripts have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποκει̃σϑαι</foreign>, which Dindorf, <lb/>

          <p>48. Seuthes, on hearing this address, uttered imprecations <lb/>
            on the man who had been the cause that the debt was not dis­ <lb/>
            charged long before ; (and every one surmised that Heracli­ <lb/>
            des was meant ;) " for," said he, " I never meant to deprive <lb/>
            the men of their pay, and will now give it to them." 49. <lb/>
            Xenophon then said again, " Since therefore you are resolved <lb/>
            to pay, I now beg you to make the payment through me, and <lb/>
            not to suffer me, on your account, to bear a different character <lb/>
            with the army from that which I bore when we came to you." <lb/>
            so. Seuthes replied, " You shall not lose more credit with the <lb/>
            army by my means ; and if you will stay with me with only a <lb/>
            thousand heavy-armed men, I will give you the fortresses, and <lb/>
            everything else that I promised." 51. “It cannot be so," re­ <lb/>
            joined Xenophon ; “ let us therefore depart.” “Yet I know," <lb/>
            replied Seuthes, “that it will be safer for you to remain with <lb/>
            me than to go away." 52. "I commend2 your care of me," <lb/>
            rejoined Xenophon, "but it is impossible for me to stay ; yet <lb/>
            be assured that wherever I receive greater honour, there will <lb/>
            be good attendant on it for you." 53. Seuthes then said, "I <lb/>
            have but very little money, and that I give you, one talent;3 <lb/>
            but I have six hundred oxen, four thousand sheep, and a hun­ <lb/>
            dred and twenty slaves; take these, and the hostages4 from <lb/>
            those who were treacherous to you, and depart." 54. “And <lb/>
            if these," said Xenophon, laughing, "are not sufficient to <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τούς σοι προεμένους εὐεργεσίαν</foreign>.] Schneider observes that the <lb/>

            but, though it was not paid, they still continued to give their services <lb/>
            to Seuthes." Krüger, however, observes that Xenophon certainly <lb/>

            You heard the threats." The remainder of that day they <lb/>
            continued there.</p>
          <p>55. The next day Seuthes delivered to them the cattle he <lb/>
            had promised, and sent men with them to drive them. The <lb/>
            soldiers, in the mean time, began to say that Xenophon was <lb/>
            gone to Seuthes to live with him, and to receive what Seuthes <lb/>
            had promised him; but when they saw him returning, they <lb/>
            were rejoiced, and ran to meet him. 56. As soon as Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon saw Charminus and Polynicus, he said, “This property <lb/>
            has been saved for the army through your influence ; I deliver <lb/>
            it to you; dispose of it, and divide the proceeds among the <lb/>
            soldiers." The Lacedæmonians accordingly received the <lb/>
            cattle, and, appointing salesmen, sold it, and incurred much <lb/>
            blame.3 57. As for Xenophon, he took no part in the pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding, but openly prepared to return home; for a vote of <lb/>
            banishment had not yet been passed against him at Athens. <lb/>
            But his friends in the camp came to him, and begged him <lb/>
            not to desert them until he had led off the army and delivered <lb/>
            it to Thibron. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τίνος τάλαντον φήοω ἔχειν</foreign>;] "whose talent shall I say that 1 <lb/>

          <p>The Greeks pass over to Lampsacus. Xenophon, having received no pay, is <lb/>
            obliged to sell his horse. lie sacrifices to Jupiter Meilichius. The Greeks <lb/>
            arrive at Pergamus. Xenophon is prevailed upon to attack Asidates, a <lb/>
            Persian nobleman, and at length takes him prisoner, with a great quantity <lb/>
            of booty, of which he receives a considerable share. He delivers the army <lb/>
            into the hands of Thibron, to be incorporated with the forces assembled <lb/>
            against Tissaphernes.</p>
          <p>I. FROM hence they sailed across to Lampsacus, when Eu­ <lb/>
            elides the augur, a native of Phlius,l the son of Cleagoras, who <lb/>
            wrote THE DREAMS IN THE LYCEUM,2 came to meet Xeno­ <lb/>

            and asked him how much gold lie had. a. Xenophon assured <lb/>
            him, with an oath, that he should not have enough for his ex­ <lb/>
            penses in travelling home, unless he sold his horse, and what <lb/>
            he had about him. Euclides did not believe him. 3. But <lb/>
            after the people of Lampsacus had sent presents to Xenophon, <lb/>
            and Xenophon was proceeding to sacrifice to Apollo, he made <lb/>
            Euclides stand beside him at the time, who, on inspecting the <lb/>

            Meilichius,2 however, said Euclides, “is an obstacle in your <lb/>

            since he had left home he had not sacrificed to that deity. <lb/>
            Euclides then advised him to sacrifice as he had been used to <lb/>

          <p>7. Hence they advanced through Troas, and, passing over <lb/>
            Ida, came first to Antandrus ; then, proceeding along by the <lb/>

            ing from hence through Atramyttiuin and Certorium, by <lb/>
            Atarneus, to the plain of the Caicus, they reached Pergamus <lb/>

          <p>Here Xenophon was hospitably received by Hellas the <lb/>

            with three hundred men, he might take him, with his wife and <lb/>

            him such of the captains as were most attached to him, and <lb/>
            had constantly been his friends, in order that he might do <lb/>

            them any portion of the booty, which they regarded as ready <lb/>
            to their hands.</p>
          <p>12. When they came to the place, about midnight, the slaves <lb/>
            that were about the castle, and the greater part of the cattle, <lb/>
            escaped them, as they neglected these in order that they might <lb/>
            capture Asidates himself and his riches. 13. But as they were <lb/>
            unable to take the building by assault, (for it was high and <lb/>
            large, and had battlements, and many brave men to defend it,) <lb/>
            they proceeded to dig a passage into it. 14. The wall was <lb/>
            eight bricks of earth thick; but a breach was made in it by <lb/>
            day-break ; and the moment an opening appeared, some one <lb/>
            from within pierced the thigh of the man that was nearest <lb/>
            him through with an ox-spit;1 and afterwards, by shooting <lb/>
            showers of arrows, they rendered it unsafe even to approach. <lb/>
            15. As they uttered loud cries, too, and made signals with <lb/>
            torches, Itabelius,2 with his force, came to their assistance, as <lb/>
            well as some Assyrian heavy-armed men, and about eighty <lb/>
            Hyrcanian cavalry, who were in the king's pay, from Coma­ <lb/>
            nia; and other troops, lightly armed, to the number of eight <lb/>
            hundred, with cavalry, some from Parthenium, and others from <lb/>
            Apollonia and the neighbouring parts.</p>
          <p>16. It was now time for the Greeks to consider how they <lb/>
            should retreat; and, taking what oxen and sheep were at hand, <lb/>
            they drove them off, placing them with the slaves, within a <lb/>
            hollow square, not so much because they were anxious about <lb/>
            the booty, but lest, if they went off and left it, their retreat <lb/>
            might appear like a flight, and the enemy might thus be ren­ <lb/>
            dered bolder, and their own men more dispirited ; whereas <lb/>
            they now retired as if resolved to defend their capture. 17. <lb/>
            But when Gongylus observed that the Greeks were but few, <lb/>
            and those who hung upon their rear were numerous, he sallied <lb/>
            forth himself, against the will of his mother, at the head of <lb/>

            were sorely harassed by the enemy's arrows and slings, and as <lb/>
            they marched in a circle to hold their shields as a defence <lb/>
            against the missiles, got with great difficulty across the river <lb/>
            Caicus, nearly half of them being wounded. 19. On this oc­ <lb/>
            casion Agasias the Stymphalian, one of the captains, was <lb/>
            wounded, after making head the whole time against the enemy. <lb/>
            But they at last came off safe, with about two hundred slaves, <lb/>
            and cattle enough for sacrifice.</p>
          <p>20. On the following day Xenophor. offered sacrifice, and <lb/>
            led out his whole force in the night, with a design to go as <lb/>
            far as possible into Lydia, in order that the Persian might not <lb/>
            be in fear from his proximity, but be thrown off his guard. 21. <lb/>
            But Asidates, hearing that Xenophon had again sacrificed with <lb/>
            a view to an attack upon him, and that he would return <lb/>
            with all his strength, went out to encamp in some villages <lb/>
            lying close under the little town of Parthenium. 22. Here <lb/>
            Xenophon and his troop came round upon him, and captured <lb/>
            himself, his wife and children, his horses, and all his property; <lb/>
            and thus the omens of the first sacrifice were verified.</p>
          <p>23. They then marched back to Pergamus ; and here Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon had no cause to complain of the god ;1 for the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
            nians, the captains, the rest of the generals, and the soldiers, <lb/>
            all agreed that he should receive select portions of the spoil, <lb/>
            consisting of horses, oxen, and other things; so that be was <lb/>
            now able even to serve a friend.</p>

            states that “the length of the journey from Ephesus in Ionia to the place where the <lb/>
            battle was fought, was ninety-three days' march, five hundred and thirty-five para­ <lb/>

            that Xenophon has made a mistake in reckoning up the numbers, or that the numbers <lb/>
            themselves have been corrupted by transcribers.</p>

          <p>So Xenophon (Anab. v. 5. 4) saysthat " the length of the journey down the coun­ <lb/>
            try, from the field of battle near Babylon to Cotyora, was a hundred and twenty-two <lb/>
            day march, six hundred and twenty parasangs, and eighteen thousand six hundred <unclear/> <lb/>
            stadia, occupying eight months," i.e. from September 4th, 401, to May 18th, 400. The <lb/>
            voyage from Cotyora to Slnope took two days, May 19th and 20th ; the army stayed at <lb/>

            or Asiatic Thrace; at the beginning of October they crossed over to Byzantium ;and <lb/>

          <p>TilE zeal and critical acumen of scholars and travellers in­ <lb/>
            numerable, have been devoted to the elucidation of the very re­ <lb/>
            markable journey of the Greeks under Cyrus, from Sardes, the <lb/>
            capital of Lydia in Asia Minor, to Babylonia; and the still more <lb/>
            extraordinary and interesting retreat along the river Tigris by <lb/>
            Kurdistan and Armenia to the shores of the Black Sea.</p>
          <p>The survey of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris by the expedition <lb/>
            under Colonel Chesney, gave, however, opportunities for investi­ <lb/>
            gating this very interesting subject, such as had never previously <lb/>
            presented themselves; and these opportunities may be said to have <lb/>
            received their complement, by the advantages which were derived <lb/>
            from a journey in Kurdistan and Armenia, performed in 1840, <lb/>
            under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society and the <lb/>
            Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, by the writer, who, <lb/>
            upon that occasion, followed the track of the gallant little corps, <lb/>
            through the most intricate and difficult portions of their wander­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ings. The result of these researches were first given to the public <lb/>
            in a little book, published in 1844, entitled "Travels in the Track <lb/>
            of the Ten Thousand Greeks."</p>
          <p>Since that time, however, further elucidations have rapidly suc­ <lb/>
            ceeded one another, by far the most important of which are con­ <lb/>
            tained in the great work by Colonel Chesney, " The Expedition <lb/>
            for the Survey of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris," of which the <lb/>
            two first volumes only are yet published. These volumes, how­ <lb/>
            ever, comprise all that refers to the expedition of Cyrus, and con­ <lb/>
            tain an immense mass of matter corroborative or corrective of <lb/>
            what has been before published.</p>
          <p>The brilliant discoveries of Layard in Assyria, and the not <lb/>
            less valuable and important philological researches of Colonel <lb/>
            Rawlinson, have also, during the lapse of the last ten years, <lb/>
            brought a flood of light to bear upon the past history and con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            dition of tne populations that dwelt upon the banks of the Eu. <lb/>
            phrates and the Tigris, which are not without their intimate bear­ <lb/>
            ings upon the narrative left to us by the Athenian historian and <lb/>
            commander.</p>
          <p>Several classical scholars have also contributed their share of <lb/>
            new and valuable critical inquiries; among the most important of <lb/>
            which is a correction made by Professor Maiden, and published in <lb/>
            the Classical Museum, (No. vii. p. 36, et seq.,) of the generally ac­ <lb/>
            cepted version of the passage which occurs in the Anabasis, (iv. 6. <lb/>
            4,) and which has been hitherto read as, After this they marched <lb/>
            seven days' marches, at the rate of five parasangs a day, to the <lb/>
            river Phasis," but which, according to Professor Malden, must be <lb/>
            read as along the river Phasis. There is no real ambiguity, Pro­ <lb/>
            fessor Malden avers, in the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρα</foreign> in such a context.</p>
          <p>The effect which such a correction of seven marches has upon <lb/>
            that portion of the Katabasis which refers to Armenia is consider­ <lb/>
            able. The number of marches between the Euphrates and the <lb/>
            Phasis or Araxes, is reduced to seven, or by one-half what was <lb/>
            previously supposed, and this important correction proportion­ <lb/>
            ately affects the subsequent portion of the route.</p>
          <p>The commentary or exposition now offered to the public is <lb/>
            therefore just as much a commentary on the "Travels in tie <lb/>
            Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks," as it is on those works <lb/>
            which preceded it, and on those inquiries and speculations which <lb/>
            have been entertained since. It is by no means, however, sup­ <lb/>
            posed to carry the subject out of the domain of further inquiry: <lb/>
            milch remains to be done before all the questions connected with <lb/>
            this most perplexing subject can receive a complete and satisfactory <lb/>
            solution.</p>
          <p>SARDES.—Leaving his relatives and friends in charge of the <lb/>
            governments of Lydia, Phrygia, and Ionia, Cyrus is described as <lb/>
            commencing his march from Sardes or Sardis in April, displaying, <lb/>
            as Colonel Chesney remarks, admirable judgment in taking the <lb/>
            more circuitous route along the great plains and through the prin­ <lb/>
            cipal cities of Asia Minor, in preference to that by which Xerxes <lb/>
            advanced through Cappadocia ;since it gave him the support of <lb/>
            his fleet, by which lie could receive supplies and reinforcements <lb/>
            from time to time, besides having a fair chance of concealing for <lb/>
            a longer period his bold design.</p>
          <p>The capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia was situated a <lb/>
            the foot of Mount Tmolus, in a fine plain watered by the river <lb/>
            Pactolus, of gold-bearing celebrity. It was once a great and flour­ <lb/>
            ishing city, and from its wealth and importance was the object of <lb/>
            much cupidity and of many sieges. When taken by Cyrus the <lb/>
            Great, under Crœsus, its last king, who has become proverbial for <lb/>
            his riches, Sardes was one of the most splendid and opulent cities <lb/>
            of the East. After their victory over Antiochus it passed to the <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            Romans, under whom it rapidly declined in rank and importance. <lb/>
            In the time of Tiberius it was destroyed by an earthquake, but <lb/>
            was rebuilt by order of the emperor.</p>
          <p>The inhabitants of Sardes bore an ill repute among the ancients <lb/>
            for their voluptuous habits of life. Hence, perhaps, the point of <lb/>
            the phrase in the Apocalyptic message to the city,—" Thou hast a <lb/>
            few names, even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments." <lb/>
            (Rev. iii. 4.) The place that Sardes holds in this message, as one <lb/>
            of the " seven churches of Asia," is the source of the peculiar in­ <lb/>
            terest with which the Christian reader regards it.</p>
          <p>Successive sieges and earthquakes, and the ravages of Saracens <lb/>
            and Turks, have reduced this once flourishing city to a heap of <lb/>
            ruins, presenting, however, many remains of its former splendour. <lb/>
            When visited by W. J. Hamilton in 1836, with the exception of a <lb/>
            few black Yuruk tents, the only habitation was that of a Greek <lb/>
            miller, who had taken advantage of one of the streams which flow <lb/>
            past the Acropolis, to turn the wheel of his mill.</p>
          <p>The principal ruin is that of the Acropolis, situated on the top <lb/>
            of a crumbling hill. The ruin is, however, itself made up of an­ <lb/>
            cient fragments, the walls and 'gateway of the fortress being, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to Hamilton, probably Byzantine, and there being no traces <lb/>
            of walls of Hellenic construction. Two gigantic Ionic columns, <lb/>
            with other huge fragments, mark the site of the temple of Cybele. <lb/>
            There are also remains of a Roman theatre, but the marble seats, <lb/>
            the proscenium, and scena, are all gone: also of a stadium, the <lb/>
            northern side of which has been artificially formed by a wall sup­ <lb/>
            ported on arches running along the side of the hill. There are <lb/>
            also remains of two early Christian churches, one of which has <lb/>
            been too hastily concluded by travellers to have been the church <lb/>
            of Sardis to which allusion is made in the Apocalypse; but besides <lb/>
            that tho expression can only have referred to the community of <lb/>
            Christians then established, the nature of the structure shows that <lb/>
            its date must have been at least posterior to the overthrow of the <lb/>
            Pagan religion and the destruction of the temples towards the end <lb/>
            of the fourth century. Many other remains are scattered over the <lb/>
            area of the ancient town; amongst which the most remarkable is <lb/>
            the so-called Gerusia, situated near the western limits of the city, <lb/>
            partly built of brick and partly of stone, but of a late period; while <lb/>
            to the west of these two walls are the massive marble fragments of <lb/>
            another building, apparently of much older date.</p>
          <p>A countless number of sepulchral hillocks beyond the Hermus, <lb/>
            heighten the desolateness of a spot which the multitudes lying <lb/>
            there once made busy by their living presence and pursuits.. <note type="footnote"> * The late Captain Newbold called the attention of the Royal Asiatic <lb/>

          <p>MAEANDER.—The direction of Cyrus' march appears to have <lb/>
            been parallel to the Cogamus, and having made in three days <lb/>
            twenty-two parasangs, he arrived at the river Maeander, which he <lb/>
            passed on a bridge of seven boats, probably above the junction of <lb/>
            the Lycus. The Maeander was celebrated in classic poetry for its <lb/>
            tortuousness, whence our term—meandering. Ovid, in describing <lb/>
            the Minotaur's labyrinth, compares it with the Maeander. <lb/>
            As soft Macander's wanton current plays, <lb/>
            When through the Phrygian fields it loosely strays; <lb/>
            Backward and forward rolls the dimpled tide, <lb/>
            Seeming at once two different ways to glide: <lb/>
            While circling streams their former banks survey, <lb/>
            And waters past succeeding waters see; <lb/>
            Now floating to the sea with downward course, <lb/>
            Now pointing upward to its ancient source. <lb/>
            It may be remarked here, that considering the stadium and para­ <lb/>
            sang as fragments of the earth's true meridional circumference, as <lb/>
            more particularly developed by Colonel Jervis, the amount admit­ <lb/>
            ted in the Travels in the Track of the Ten Thousand Greeks, was <lb/>
            G07.G2977 English feet for the first, 5468.668 English feet for the <lb/>
            second.</p>
          <p>The principle upon which this estimate is founded is this: that <lb/>
            the Jewish itinerary measure was the Parsah of 3 Bereh; each <lb/>
            Bereh of 7½ Khebel, or 3000 measures. The Parsah, correspond­ <lb/>
            ing to the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρασγγα</foreign>, or the Persian Farsakh, the Bereh to <lb/>
            the Turkish Beré, and the Khebel, or rope, to the stadium. The <lb/>
            Jewish Bereh was the 24,000th of the earth's true meridional cir­ <lb/>
            cumference; the fundamental measure, therefore, the 72,000,000th <lb/>
            of the meridional circumference, which Colonel Jervis having com­ <lb/>
            puted to the ellipticity from a comparative summary of the <lb/>
            results of the Lapland, British, French, and Indian measurements, <lb/>
            is <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_83_fig10.jpg"/></figure>or 21.8724876 inches English. Now the <lb/>
              element is to the common element, of all those itinerary measures <lb/>
              alluded to by Eratosthenes, Cleomedes, Posidonins, and othei <lb/>
              historians and other writers, whether Egyptian, Jewish, Greek, <lb/>
              Roman, or the earlier Arabian, as 5 to 9,—that is, they were, one <lb/>
              and all, the 40,000,000th, the Jewish the 72,000,000th, of the <lb/>
              earth's meridional circumference; and hence the true length of the <lb/>
              Roman and Greek foot, and cubit, and stadium may be immedi­ <lb/>
              ately inferred.</p>
          <p>For the Jewish Parsah being the eight-thousandth part of the <lb/>
            circumference, or 24,000 such measures above stated, was 5468.668 <lb/>
            feet English. The Bereh, 1-24,000th of the meridional circumfer­ <lb/>
            ence, or 3000 such measures, was 5468.668 feet English. The <lb/>
            Khebel, or stadium =729.15584 feet English (the side,-i. e. the <note type="footnote"> found to correspond with those singular tombs (supposed those of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            pides) in the hills near Burnabat, overlooking the Gulf of Smyrna. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            length and breadth, of the greatest pyramid, or that of Cheops). <lb/>
            One-ninth of this was the Greek and Roman stadium, 607,62977 <lb/>
            feet English; the 600th part, the true Greek foot, 12.156 English <lb/>
            inches; the 6'25th part, the true Roman foot, 11.67 English inches. <lb/>
            The Greek and Roman cubits respectively 18.2289 and 17.4997 <lb/>
            English inches.</p>
          <p>Colonel Jervis felt satisfied that these data would serve to clear <lb/>
            up many difficulties in the writings of Herodotus, Xenophon, <lb/>
            Strabo, Pliny, Diodorus, Curtius, and others, whose apparent <lb/>
            discrepancies he believed to be due rather to our misapprehen <lb/>
            sion, than to any obscurity or inaccuracy in those authors. For <lb/>
            either we must suppose the earth to have altered in dimension, the <lb/>
            situation of remarkable places to have changed, or the ancients to <lb/>
            have been wholly devoid of intelligence; or we must resort to the <lb/>
            conclusion that the misapprehension of these difficulties is rather <lb/>
            to be sought for in our own want of patient consideration.</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney has proceeded upon a much more latitudina­ <lb/>
            rian system. " The modern farsang or barsakh of Persia," he says <lb/>
            in his great work, "The Expedition for the Survey of the Rivers <lb/>
            Euphrates and Tigris," vol. ii. p. 207, "varies according to the <lb/>
            nature of the ground, from three and a half to four English miles <lb/>
            per hour; and being always calculated for mules, or good horses, <lb/>
            under favourable circumstances, it frequently exceeds four miles. <lb/>
            The ancient parasang appears to have been fixed at thirty stadia, <lb/>
            which at 202.84 yards would give three geographical miles. But <lb/>
            this being also a road measure, it no doubt varied as at present, <lb/>
            and was regulated according to the nature of the country ; and for­ <lb/>
            tunately we have the means of ascertaining this difference with <lb/>
            considerable precision. A line drawn along the map so as to touch <lb/>
            the river, at short distances, from Thapsacus to the river Araxes, <lb/>
            is about one hundred and five miles, which for the fifty parasangs <lb/>
            of Xenophon, give 2.10 geographical miles each. By the route <lb/>
            followed from Sardis to Thapsacus, it is eight hundred and fifty- <lb/>
            three geographical miles, which will give 2.608 geographical miles <lb/>
            for each of the three hundred and twenty-seven parasangs. Again, <lb/>
            from Thapsacus to the mounds of Muhammad, thirty-six miles <lb/>
            from Babylon, where, for the sake of water, the route constantly <lb/>
            follows and almost touches the river Euphrates, it is four hundred <lb/>
            and twelve geographical miles, thus giving 1.98 geographical miles <lb/>
            for each of the two hundred and eight parasangs, or 2.294 geogra­ <lb/>
            phical miles for the mean of both."</p>
          <p>" This scarcely differs from the result obtained by the laborious <lb/>
            and discriminating geographer, Major Rennell, who, without our <lb/>
            present advantages, estimated the parasang at 2.25 miles; which, <lb/>
            in fact, approaches an average of the whole march of Cyrus. We <lb/>
            find that the distance from Sardis to Cunaxa, or the mounds of <lb/>
            Muhammad, cannot be much under or over 1265 geographical <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            miles, making 2.364 geographical miles for each of the five hun­ <lb/>
            dred and thirty-five parasangs given by Xenophon between those <lb/>
            places."</p>
          <p>"From the preceding calculations," continues Colonel Chesney, <lb/>
            " it appears that we are warranted in taking the average value of <lb/>
            the parasang at 2.608 geographical miles throughout the march to <lb/>
            Thapsacus, and at 1.98, or almost two miles, from thence to Cu­ <lb/>
            naxa; but subsequently it is less than two geographical miles. <lb/>
            The greater speed in the first part of the march, was the natural <lb/>
            consequence of moving during the most favourable season of the <lb/>
            year, (April and May,) with the additional advantage of roads. <lb/>
            The want of the latter must have been a serious impediment to <lb/>
            the carriages during the next fortnight; for, although the marches <lb/>
            were pressing, the heavy-armed men, with their weapons, would <lb/>
            have been greatly retarded, by the almost insupportable heat of the <lb/>
            summer months ; in the subsequent retreat, the mountains, the <lb/>
            rivers, and unknown tracts, as well as the snow on the ground, <lb/>
            must have caused still greater retardations." This is a view of the <lb/>
            subject which I have also been obliged to adopt in the present <lb/>
            commentary.</p>
          <p>COLOSSAE.—Advancing from the Maeander through Phrygia, <lb/>
            the army made in one day's march eight parasangs, to Colossae, <lb/>
            described as being at that time a large city, rich and well inhabit­ <lb/>
            ed. This city had indeed been previously noticed by Herodotus, <lb/>
            (vii. 30,) as a large city of Phrygia oil the Lycus, a tributary to <lb/>
            the Maeander. Xerxes, on his march to Sardis, B. C. 481, reached <lb/>
            Colossae after leaving Anaua. Colossae had become a place of <lb/>
            comparatively little importance in Strabo's time.</p>
          <p>A Christian church was formed here very early, probably by <lb/>
            Epaphras, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, to whom Paul, who <lb/>
            docs not appear to have ever visited Colossac in person, addressed <lb/>
            an Epistle from Rome. Not long after, the town was, together with <lb/>
            Laodicea and Hierapolis, destroyed by an earthquake. This, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to Eusebius, was in the ninth year of Nero; but the <lb/>
            town must have been immediately rebuilt, for in his twelfth year <lb/>
            it continued to be named as a flourishing place. In the middle <lb/>
            ages there arose near it a town called Chonae, and Colossae dis­ <lb/>
            appeared. Chonae was the birth-place of Nicetas Choniates, one <lb/>
            of the Byzantine historians.</p>
          <p>Arundel (Asia Minor, vol. ii. p. 139, &amp;c.) supposed that the ruins <lb/>
            at the modern Khonos, which corresponds to Chonac, were also <lb/>
            the ruins of Colossac, but Hamilton (Res. &amp;c. i. 508) found exten­ <lb/>
            sive ruins of an ancient city about three miles north of Khonos, <lb/>
            which appear from certain hydrographical peculiarities alluded to <lb/>
            by Herodotus and Pliny, and verified by Hamilton, to be undoubt­ <lb/>
            edly the site of Colossac.</p>
          <p>CELAENAE.-From Colossac Cyrus made in three days' march <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            twenty parasangs, to Cclacnae, a city of Phrygia, large, rich, and <lb/>
            well inhabited, and where was the fortified palace of Xerxes, the <lb/>
            palace of Cyrus, the hunting park, and the cave of Marsyas. He­ <lb/>
            rodotus speaks of Celaenae in describing the march of Xerxes to <lb/>
            Sardes. He says (vii. 26) that the sources of the Maeander are <lb/>
            here, and those of a stream not less than the Maeander: it is <lb/>
            named Catarrhaetes, and rising in the Agora of Celaenae, flows into <lb/>
            the Macander. The Cattarrhactes of Herodotus is clearly the <lb/>
            Marsyas of Xenophon. Hamilton, who visited the source at a <lb/>
            place called Deenair or Dinair, describes it as a considerable <lb/>
            stream of water gushing out with great rapidity at the base of a <lb/>
            rocky cliff. It appeared as if it had formerly risen in the centre <lb/>
            of a great cavern, and that the surrounding rocks had fallen in <lb/>
            from the cliffs above. In Livy's description (xxxviii. 13) the <lb/>
            Maeander rises in the acropolis of Celaenae, and runs through the <lb/>
            middle of the city; and the Marsyas, which rises not far from the <lb/>
            sources of the Macander, joins the same river. Leake thinks that <lb/>
            it clearly appears from Strabo that both the rivers (Marsyas and <lb/>
            Macander) ran through Celaenae, and that they united in the <lb/>
            suburb which afterwards became the new city Apameia. It did <lb/>
            not appear to Hamilton that the cliff above the source of the <lb/>
            Marsyas could be the acropolis of Celaenae, which Alexander con­ <lb/>
            sidered to be impregnable, and came to terms with the inhabitants. <lb/>
            He supposes that the acropolis may have been further to the <lb/>
            N. E., a lofty hill about a mile from the ravine of the Marsyas.</p>
          <p>The town of Apameia Cibotus, which was built by Antiochus <lb/>
            Soter out of the ruins of Celaenae, was positively stated by Strabo <lb/>
            to lie at the source of the Marsyas. Arundel was the first who <lb/>
            clearly saw that Apameia must be at Dinair; and his conclusions <lb/>
            were confirmed by a Latin inscription which he found record­ <lb/>
            ing the erection of a monument by the merchants residing there. <lb/>
            Leake has also collected the ancient testimonies as to Apa­ <lb/>
            meia. Hamilton investigated the hydrographic and other fea­ <lb/>
            tures of the place most carefully, and obtained several Greek <lb/>
            inscriptions from the same neighbourhood.</p>
          <p>PELTAE—From Celaenae Cyrus made in two days' march ten <lb/>
            parasangs, and arrived at Peltae, a city well inhabited. Peltac, or <lb/>
            rather the Peltenus Campus, has been identified with the plain <lb/>
            now called Baklan uvah, which is watered by the Macander. <lb/>
            Hamilton (ii. 163) describes himself as much struck with its level <lb/>
            extent, and capabilities for manoeuvring cavalry. It may be, he <lb/>
            says, the plain on which Cyrus reviewed his troops, and celebrated <lb/>
            martial games after leaving Apameia: * for although he was <lb/>
            marching to the east, it appears that he did not proceed thither <note type="footnote"> * At page 203, vol. ii. of his Researches, &amp;c., Mr. Hamilton says he is in­ <lb/>
            clined to place Peltae either in the groat plain to the south of Ishakli, or <unclear/> <lb/>
            it the foot of the mountainstwo miles on the road from Ishakli to Dinair. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            direct; as Xenophon says that lie passed through Ceramorum <lb/>
            Agora, a town on the frontiers of Mysia, twenty-two parasangs <lb/>
            from Apameia, which must have been to the N. N. W.</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney (ii. 206) attributes these two retrograde marches <lb/>
            to the necessity of rounding a difficult portion of the Taurus.</p>
          <p>Hamilton met on this plain burial-grounds with large blocks of <lb/>
            stone, and broken columns, on one of which he found a mutilated <lb/>
            inscription ; but a whole month, he says, dedicated to the examina­ <lb/>
            tion of the numerous villages and burial-grounds which fill this <lb/>
            extensive plain, and which increase in number as you advance <lb/>
            eastwards, would not be too much to determine the name and sites <lb/>
            of the ancient towns which once flourished here.</p>
          <p>CERAMON OR CERAMORUM AGORA.—After halting three days to <lb/>
            celebrate the Lupercalian sacrifice, Cyrus advanced twelve para­ <lb/>
            sangs to Ccramon Agora, (the market of the Cramians,) the site of <lb/>
            which, according to the back distances from Koniyah, would be <lb/>
            a little east of the actual town of Ushak, but allowing for variation <lb/>
            in the value of the parasang, at Ushak itself.</p>
          <p>Pliny having noticed a town called Carinae in Phrygia, Cramer <lb/>
            conjectured that this might be the Ceramon Agora. It has also <lb/>
            been supposed to be the same as the Caris or Carides of Stephanus, <lb/>
            but that name corresponds to the Carina of Pliny, or Caria, as it <lb/>
            perhaps should be read.</p>
          <p>Hamilton (ii. 204) describes Ushak as a place of considerable <lb/>
            commerce and traffic in the present day; many of the high roads <lb/>
            of Asia Minor passing through it. He also adds, that to a person <lb/>
            going to Mysia from Apameia, (Celaenae,) and supposing, as Strabo <lb/>
            says, that Mysia extended to Ghiadiz, (Kadi,) Ushak would be the <lb/>
            last town through which lie would pass before entering Mysia, <lb/>
            from which it is separated by a mountainous and uninhabited <lb/>
            district.</p>
          <p>PLAIN OF CAYSTRUS.—From the market of the Cramians, Cy­ <lb/>
            rus made in three days<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign> march 30 parasangs, and arrived at a <lb/>
            well-peopled city, called the Plain of Caystrus. (Caystri Campus.)</p>
          <p>It has been previously observed, that the site of the market of <lb/>
            the Cramians has been determined by back distances, owing to the <lb/>
            difficulty entailed by Cyrus having deviated from his course at <lb/>
            Celaenae. Thus the march from Celaenae to Peltae is 10 para­ <lb/>
            sangs; from Peltae to Ccramon Agora 12 parasangs; and from <lb/>
            Ceramon Agora to the Plain of Caystrus, was 30 parasangs. From <lb/>
            the Plain of Caystrus, Cyrus marched 10 parasangs to Thymbrium, <lb/>
            then tO to Tyraeum, and then 20 to Iconium, the last city in <lb/>
            Phrygia in the direction of his march; for after leaving Iconium, <lb/>
            he entered Cappadocia. Iconium is Koniyah, a position well <lb/>
            known. Celaenae may also be considered as a well-determined <lb/>
            position. Now the march of Cyrus from Celaenae to Iconium was <lb/>
            92 parasangs. The angle thus obtained drives the site of the mar­ <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            ret of the Cramians more or less to the N. W. of Ushak, according <lb/>
            to the estimate taken of the parasang, 2.6 geog. miles according to <lb/>
            Chesney, 2.455 geog. miles according to Hamilton, or 3 according <lb/>
            to Colonel Jervis, but I have with others adopted the site of Ushak, <lb/>
            as the most likely.</p>
          <p>This question has been made the subject of some critical re­ <lb/>
            marks by Mr. Long in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geo­ <lb/>
            graphy, which I willingly give insertion to here.</p>
          <p>" Two recent attempts,” Mr. Long writes, " have been made to <lb/>
            fix the places between Celaenae and Iconium, one by Mr. Hamil­ <lb/>
            ton,(Researches, &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 198,) and another by Mr. Ainsworth <lb/>
            (Travels in the Track of the Ten Thousand, &amp;c., p. 24). The ex­ <lb/>
            amination of these two explanations cannot be made here for want <lb/>
            of space. But it is impossible to identify with certainty positions <lb/>
            on a line of road where distances only are given, and we find no <lb/>
            corresponding names to guide us. Mr. Hamilton supposes that <lb/>
            the Caystri Campus may be near the village of Chai Kieui, ' and <lb/>
            near the banks of the Eber Ghieulin the extensive plain between that <lb/>
            village and Polybotum.' Chai Kieui is in about 38° 40' N. lat."</p>
          <p>"Mr. Ainsworth places the Caystri Campus farther west, at a <lb/>
            place called Surmeneh, ‘a high and arid upland, as its ancient name <lb/>
            designates,' which is traversed by an insignificant tributary to the <lb/>
            Eber Göl,’ Mr. Hamilton's Eber Ghieul. The neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Surmeneh, abounds in ancient remains ; but Chai Kieui is an insig­ <lb/>
            nificant place, without ruins."</p>
          <p>"Both Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Ainsworth, however, agree in <lb/>
            fixing the Caystri Campus in the basin of this river, the Eber Ghieul, <lb/>
            and so far the conclusion may be accepted as probable. But the <lb/>
            exact site of the place cannot be determined without further evi­ <lb/>
            dence. Cyrus stayed at Caystri Campus five days, and he certainly <lb/>
            would not stay with his troops five days in a high and arid upland. As <lb/>
            the plain was called the Plain of Cayster, we may assume that there <lb/>
            was a river Cayster, where Cyrus halted. One of Mr. Ainsworth'a <lb/>
            objections to Mr. Hamilton's conclusion is altogether unfounded. <lb/>
            He says that the plain which Mr. Hamilton chooses as the site of <lb/>
            the Caystri Campus is 'an extensive plain, but very marshy, <lb/>
            being in one part occupied by a perpetual and large lake, called <lb/>
            Eber GoI, and most unlikely at any season of the year to present <lb/>
            the arid and burnt appearance which could have led the Greeks <lb/>
            to call it Caustron or Caystrus, the burnt or barren plain.' But <lb/>
            the word Caystrus could not mean burnt, and Stephanus is guilty <lb/>
            of originating this mistake. It means no male a burnt plain here <lb/>
            than it does when applied to the plain above Ephesus. Both were <lb/>
            watery places ; one we know to be so, and the other we may with <lb/>
            great probability conclude to be."</p>
          <p>As it appears that I was misled in the reading of Cayster, I do <lb/>
            not wish to insist upon this special identification in the “ Track of <note type="footnote"> VOL. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> or </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            the Ten Thousand Greeks." I may however be permitted to ob­ <lb/>
            serve, that the identification was not solely founded upon the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance of Surmanah being a dry upland. It was also founded <lb/>
            on back distances from Iconium 20 parasangs to Tyriaeum, 10 to <lb/>
            Thymbrium, and tO to the plain of Caystrus, or 120 geographical <lb/>
            miles. Eber Göl, or Ibar Gül, being at a less distance. There is <lb/>
            a stream of water at Surmanah as well as at Chai Kiui, and <lb/>
            Xenophon tells us there was also in Cyrus's time a well-peopled <lb/>
            city. So that it was not because it was an arid plain that it can <lb/>
            be also shown not to have been a fit place for a delay of five days. <lb/>
            I may also add that so marshy is the plain of Bulavadin, that the <lb/>
            road from the N. W. to that town has to be carried in great part <lb/>
            over a raised causeway. Hamilton (ii. 177) describes Surmanah <lb/>
            as “a rich mine of antiquarian treasures," as is also the case with <lb/>
            Afyum Kara Hissar in the same neighbourhood, which he looks <lb/>
            upon as the site of ancient Synnada. The same observing traveller <lb/>
            however makes mention of no ruins at or near Chai Kiui, which <lb/>
            he also identifies with the Holmi of Strabo.</p>
          <p>THYMBRIUM.—During a halt of five days on the plain of Cays­ <lb/>
            trus, Cyrus received Epyaxa, the queen of Cilicia ; whose mysteri­ <lb/>
            oils visit and opportune supply of treasure enabled him to appease <lb/>
            the Greeks by giving them three months’ arrears of pity. Ac­ <lb/>
            companied by Epyaxa, lie advanced thence, ten parasangs, to <lb/>
            Thymbrium, on the borders of Lycaonia.</p>
          <p>Estimating the parasang at three geographical miles, I have iden­ <lb/>
            tified Thymbrium with the modern Ishakli, reckoning back from <lb/>
            leonium. Even at the reduced estimate of Hamilton, ten parasangs, <lb/>
            equal upon his scale to 24 or 25 geographic miles, measured from <lb/>
            the site of Ilghun, or from the hot baths, brings us beyond Philo­ <lb/>
            melium at Ak-Shahir, and nearly half way between that town and <lb/>
            the fountain of Ulu Bunar Darbund. Hamilton describes that <lb/>
            fountain as only four or five miles from Ak-Shahir, whereas I was <lb/>
            upwards of two hours travelling from the one to the other. Colo­ <lb/>
            net Chesney (ii. 208) places Thymbrium " at or a little south-east­ <lb/>
            ward of the present town of Ak-Shahir,”</p>
          <p>The expression used by Xenophon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνταυ̃θα ην παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν</foreign>, <lb/>
            would certainly appear to denote that lie passed the fountain of <lb/>
            Midas on the road to Thymbrium, although Spelman translates it <lb/>
            " Here was a fountain near the road, called the fountain of Midas." <lb/>
            "There seems, therefore,” says Hamilton, (ii. 202,) “every reason <lb/>
            for placing Thymbrium at the foot of Sultan Tagh, between the <lb/>
            fountain of Midas and Ak Shehr (Shahir), if indeed it be not an <lb/>
            an older name for Philomelium itself." There certainly seems, <lb/>
            however, taking the reduced estimate of the value of the parasang <lb/>
            adopted by Hamilton and Colonel Chesney, still to remain more <lb/>
            reasons for approximating the site of Thymbrium to the fountain <lb/>
            of Midas than to Ak-Shahir, only that towns have mostly sue­ <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            ceeded to one another at the same site. The road, it is to be re­ <lb/>
            marked upon this assumption of the value of the parasang, pre­ <lb/>
            sents few difficulties, and it improves still more on approaching <lb/>
            Iconium. I can understand the parasang covering little plane <lb/>
            surface in the passes of Kurdistan or the snows of Armenia, but I <lb/>
            cannot help feeling, with Colonel Jervis, that to suppose a varying <lb/>
            estimate of that value on the plains of Asia Minor, argues a great <lb/>
            want of intelligence on the part of the ancients, and reduces them <lb/>
            to the semi-barbarous position of the modern Turk and Persian, <lb/>
            who, reckoning by time and not by distance, leave it impossible, <lb/>
            without actual investigation, to determine from such data the <lb/>
            geographical position of places. It is obvious, therefore, in the <lb/>
            instances of Peltae, Ceramon Agora, Caystri Campus, Thymbrium, <lb/>
            and Tyriaeum, where we have only distances to go upon, we must <lb/>
            remain more or less in a state of uncertainty as to their true posié <lb/>
            tions. The fountain of Midas helps to throw some additional <lb/>
            light upon the positioning of Thymbrium, that of Tyriaeum is <lb/>
            confirmed by Strabo, and Ushak, as representing the market of <lb/>
            the Cramians, remains to the present day a place of considerable <lb/>
            traffic and commerce, and a place of meeting of high roads. These <lb/>
            circumstances must be taken into consideration in determining the <lb/>
            position of the sites noticed by Xenophon between Celacnae and <lb/>
            Iconium, two known positions.</p>
          <p>TYRIAEUM.—Cyrus made in two days' march ten parasangs, <lb/>
            and arrived at Tyriaeum, a populous town. Hamilton and Colonel <lb/>
            Chesney, upon the evaluation of distances before alluded to, think <lb/>
            that Tyriaeum is probably represented by Ilghun. I sought for <lb/>
            the site at Arkut Khan, but without wishing to put much stress <lb/>
            upon so indefinite a point. Neither Hamilton nor myself saw <lb/>
            any remains of ancient times at either Arkut Khan or Ilghun. <lb/>
            There is this to be said of Ilghun, that there is beyond that town <lb/>
            a plain much better adapted for the review of the Greek and Bar­ <lb/>
            barian forces described by Xenophon, than at Arkut Khan, where <lb/>
            the surface of the soil is broken up by slabs of horizontal lime­ <lb/>
            stone. Hamilton also remarks that their identification is confirm­ <lb/>
            ed by Strabo's account of the great road from Ephesus to Mazaca ; <lb/>
            for he clearly places Tyriaeum between Philomelium and Laodicea, <lb/>
            and near the borders of Lycaonia. Another argument in favour <lb/>
            of this site is, that Strabo states that Holmi was at the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of Phrygia Paroreius, which would therefore be at the west­ <lb/>
            ern extremity of Sultan Tagh, and he gives the distance from <lb/>
            Holmi to Tyriaeum as rather more than 500 stadia. Now the <lb/>
            distance from the commencement of the Sultan Tagh to Ilghun is <lb/>
            55 miles, and from Chai Kiui, which Hamilton identifies with Hol­ <lb/>
            mi, just about 50 miles, or 500 stadia.</p>
          <p>ICONIOM.—From Tyriacum Cyrus made in three days march <lb/>
            twenty parasangs, and came to Iconium, the last city of Phrygia. <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            This, as one of the most ancient and remarkable cities of Asia <lb/>
            Minor, requires little notice at our hands. Pliny calls it urbs cele­ <lb/>
            berrima Iconium. Strabo speaks of it as small but well built.</p>
          <p>When visited by the apostle Paul in A. D. 45, it is described as <lb/>
            inhabited by a great multitude of Jews and Greeks. (Acts xiv. 1.) <lb/>
            The most remarkable era in the history of Iconium is that of the <lb/>
            Seljukian Turks or Tartars, a branch of whom founded a dynasty <lb/>
            at Koniyah in Karaman, before the rise of the Osmanli Turks.</p>
          <p>Modern Koniyah is still a large town, the seat of a pasha, and <lb/>
            of a Greek metropolitan, and it contains many interesting relies <lb/>
            of olden times. Among the most remarkable of which is the <lb/>
            mosque built by Sultan Aladin, the mausoleum of Hazrit Mavlana, <lb/>
            the founder of the Mavlani darvishes or dervishes, the old Turkish <lb/>
            prison, and the Injami Minareh Jami, "the mosque with the <lb/>
            minarets towering to the stars."</p>
          <p>LYCAONIA.—From Iconium, Cyrus made in five days' march <lb/>
            thirty parasangs through Lycaonia, which being an enemy's <lb/>
            country, he gave the Greeks leave to plunder it. From hence he <lb/>
            sent the Cilician queen into Cilicia the shortest way. Now as the <lb/>
            next place reached by Cyrus—Dana—is a well-known site, we <lb/>
            have only to mark off thirty parasangs from Iconium and twenty­ <lb/>
            live to Dana on the map, and the point of intersection will be the <lb/>
            spot where Cyrus parted with the queen of Cilicia.</p>
          <p>This spot may therefore, if Cyrus kept a northern road, have <lb/>
            been at or near the now small town of Kara Bunar, “ the Black <lb/>
            Spring;” or if gallantry led him to take a southerly route, the part­ <lb/>
            ing may have taken place at or near Tchurla or Churla, north of <lb/>
            Karaman, near which Hamilton found many ruins of ancient sites, <lb/>
            notoriously those of Lystra and Derbe, whither Paul and Barna­ <lb/>
            has fled after their expulsion from Iconium. I am most inclined <lb/>
            to the latter view of the case.</p>
          <p>From this point Epyaxa returned to her husband Syennesis, <lb/>
            the king of Cilicia, across the Taurus by Kizil Chasmah, Alan <lb/>
            Buzuk, Mazatli, Soli or Pompeiopolis, and onward to Tarsus.</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney remarks upon this incident in the march of <lb/>
            Cyrus, that it may be inferred from what subsequently passed in <lb/>
            Cilicia, that the object of this remarkable mission and the timely <lb/>
            supply of treasure, was to induce Cyrus to take another route, that <lb/>
            Syennesis might not be embroiled with Artaxerxes, by permitting <lb/>
            the march through his territory; and it is not improbable that, <lb/>
            from her peculiar intimacy with the prince, the queen believed she <lb/>
            had been successful. Cyrus, however, availed himself of her re­ <lb/>
            turn, to send a body of Greeks under Menon, nominally as a guard <lb/>
            of honour, but in reality to turn the Cilician Gates, the only pass <lb/>
            which was practicable for an army through this part of Taurus. <lb/>
            Two companies, amounting to one hundred heavy-armed men, <lb/>
            were lost in this undertaking, and the rest, arriving before the <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            main body of the army, and resenting the loss of their companions <lb/>
            plundered both the city of Tarsus and the palace that stood there</p>
          <p>DANA.—Cyrus, with the rest of his army, moved on through <lb/>
            Cappadocia, and, in four days' march, made five and twenty para­ <lb/>
            sangs to Dana, a large and rich city, well inhabited.</p>
          <p>Tyana was well known to all antiquity, not only as the residence <lb/>
            of Apollonius and the site of a temple of the Asbamaean Jupiter, <lb/>
            but also as the town nearest to the Cilician Gates. Strabo says <lb/>
            it was also called Eusebia ad Taurum, and that it was built on a <lb/>
            mound raised by Semiramis, or called Semiramis, probably a heap <lb/>
            of Assyrian ruins. Cellarius argued that <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δανα</foreign> was a contraction <lb/>
            made by the copyists for <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τύανα</foreign>, and the correction thus made has <lb/>
            been strengthened by subsequent inquiry.</p>
          <p>Thus Hamilton was enabled to identify the ruins at the site now <lb/>
            called Kiz Hissar, "Girls Castle," or Kilis Hissar, “ Castle of the <lb/>
            Church," with Tyana, by the existence there of a small lake or <lb/>
            pool which presents the peculiar phenomenon ascribed to the <lb/>
            fountain of Asmabaeus sacred to Jupiter by Ammianus Marcelli­ <lb/>
            nus, of never overflowing its banks, and of bubbling up like a <lb/>
            boiling cauldron as described by Philostratus. (Res. ii. 303.) An <lb/>
            identification which is further confirmed by the mound on which <lb/>
            the ruins stand.</p>
          <p>The site of Tyana being then determined, the distance from <lb/>
            Iconium, the situation of the town at the entrance of the pass of <lb/>
            Taurus, and its olden celebrity, point it out as the Dana of Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, or as Cellarius more probably opines, that Dana was a mis­ <lb/>
            cript for Tyana.</p>
          <p>CILlClAN GATES.—Cyrus is described as preparing at Dana to <lb/>
            penetrate into Cilicia ; the entrance was broad enough for a cha­ <lb/>
            riot to pass, very steep, and inaccessible to an army if there had <lb/>
            been any opposition; and Syennesis was said to have possessed <lb/>
            himself of the eminences, in order to guard the pass; for which rea­ <lb/>
            son, Cyrus stayed one day in the plain. The day after, news was <lb/>
            brought by a messenger that Syennesis had quitted the eminences, <lb/>
            upon information that both Menon's army were in Cilicia, within <lb/>
            the mountains, and also that Tamos was sailing round from Ionia <lb/>
            to Cilicia with the galleys that belonged to the Lacedæmonians and <lb/>
            to Cyrus, who immediately marched up to the mountains without <lb/>
            opposition, and made himself master of the tents, in which the <lb/>
            Cilicians lay to oppose his passage.</p>
          <p>The Cilician Gates, called by the Turks in the present day, <lb/>
            Kulak Bughaz, constitute perhaps one of the most remarkable <lb/>
            and picturesque mountain-passes in the world. Colonel Chesney <lb/>
            adds to this, (ii. 210,) that it is one of the longest and most difli­ <lb/>
            cult passes in the world.</p>
          <p>The road through the pass ascends more or less across a wild <lb/>
            country from Harakli to Kulu Kushla, a distance of about 28 <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            miles, and up to which point the rivulets are tributary to the Ak <lb/>
            Güli, or white lakes, the outlet of which may be justly suspected to <lb/>
            be a subterranean channel, having a cavernous exit towards the <lb/>
            plain of Adana.</p>
          <p>Beyond Kulu Kushla, or “ place of winds," the road descends <lb/>
            by a narrow glen into the valley of a tributary to the Sihun or Sa­ <lb/>
            rus. This valley is wooded, and bordered by precipitous clifls. <lb/>
            At a place called Shiftla Khan, some nine or ten miles beyond <lb/>
            Kulu Kushla, two valleys meet to form a third, which is an open, <lb/>
            wooded, pleasant vale, that leads through the very heart of the <lb/>
            Bulghar Tagh.</p>
          <p>The road leaves this picturesque valley at a distance of eight or <lb/>
            nine miles, to ascend in a south-westerly direction, an open valley <lb/>
            bearing a small tributary to the Sihun, which is left behind flow­ <lb/>
            ing to the south-east, till an upland is reached, where the celebrated <lb/>
            defences of the Egyptians were situated. Immediately beyond <lb/>
            this, a rivulet, flowing in a southerly direction, leads to a pass in <lb/>
            the mountains so narrow as to be just broad enough, as Xenophon <lb/>
            describes it, for a chariot to pass—if disencumbered of fallen rocks. <lb/>
            This pass is the true Kulak Bughaz; high precipitous cliffs tower <lb/>
            up on both sides; on the summit of one of which are the remains <lb/>
            of a castle with round towers, and a tablet, which once bore an in­ <lb/>
            scription, is still to be seen on the face of a large mass of detached <lb/>
            rock that lies in the rivulet. Beyond this, two roads lead, one <lb/>
            over hills by Mizarluk, “ the place of graves," chiefly sepulchral <lb/>
            grottoes, to Tarsus; the other along open winding wooded vales, <lb/>
            and at first rocky, then low rounded undulating hills, to the great <lb/>
            plain of Adana, which is but slightly elevated above the level of <lb/>
            the waters of the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p>PLAINS OF CILICIA.—Cyrus is described by his historian as de­ <lb/>
            scending from the mountains into a large and beautiful plain, well <lb/>
            watered, and full of all sorts of trees and vines; abounding in <lb/>
            sesame, panic, millet, wheat, and barley.</p>
          <p>The plain of Adana, as it is now called, is still remarkable for <lb/>
            its beauty and fertility. Portions, especially in the upper parts <lb/>
            and around Anazarba, are merely meadow land, or covered with <lb/>
            greensward, with, in the least watered portions, a good deal of <lb/>
            mimosa, and here and there a lonely dark-leaved carob-tree, a <lb/>
            great feature in the scenery. But a considerable portion of the <lb/>
            plain is cultivated, furnishing sesame, panic, millet, wheat, and <lb/>
            barley, as in olden time, as also rice, cotton, and sugar-cane, since <lb/>
            introduced. Near Tarsus, or the valley of the Cydnus, there is a <lb/>
            good deal of wood, and at Adana a few date-trees speak volumes <lb/>
            of a change of climate. The flocks of small bustards and the <lb/>
            numerous gazelles impart another peculiar feature to the plain, as <lb/>
            do also its rocky castle-bearing knolls in another direction.</p>
          <p>This plain is described by Xenophon as surrounded by a strong <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            and high ridge of hills. It is, indeed, as well as the Bay of Issus, <lb/>
            or Gulf of Alexandretta, perfectly enclosed by Taurus to the west <lb/>
            and north, Amanus to the east, and Rhosus to the south.</p>
          <p>TARSUS.—Cyrus having left the mountains, he advanced through <lb/>
            the plain, and having made five and twenty parasangs in four days' <lb/>
            march, arrived at Tarsus, a large and rich city of Cilicia, where <lb/>
            stood the palace of Syennesis, king of Cilicia; having the river <lb/>
            Cydnus running through the middle of it, which river is two hun­ <lb/>
            dred feet in breadth.</p>
          <p>Tarsus is a city of such great antiquity that its origin is involved <lb/>
            in fable. While Scripture historians affirm that the sons of Tar­ <lb/>
            shish, the great-grandson of Noah, settled on this coast, classic <lb/>
            mythology insists that Tarsus was built by Perseus son of Jupiter <lb/>
            by Danae. Hypacheans, according to Herodotus; a colony of Ar­ <lb/>
            gives, according to others; it is certain that it was a city favoured <lb/>
            by the Assyrians.</p>
          <p>Grotefend states that after Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, had <lb/>
            reigned twenty-five years, he extended his conquests over Asia <lb/>
            Minor, and took up his abode in the city of Tanakan, a strong <lb/>
            place in Etlak, by which, perhaps, Tarsus in Cilicia is meant, <lb/>
            of the building of which by Sennacherib a fabulous account is <lb/>
            given by Alexander Polyhistor and Abydenus in the Armenian <lb/>
            version of Eusebius. After he had introduced into that place the <lb/>
            worship of Astarte or Nisroch, and received tribute, he reduced the <lb/>
            neighbouring provinces to subjection, and appointed Akharrizadon, <lb/>
            or Assarhaddon, as king over them. This is one of the triumphs <lb/>
            supposed to be alluded to in the celebrated obelisk of Nimrud or <lb/>
            Athur. No traces exist of the statue described by Arrian as com­ <lb/>
            memorating the building of this city and Anchiale by Sardanapa­ <lb/>
            lus in one day.</p>
          <p>No contribution to the history of Tarsus has been so rich in re­ <lb/>
            suits as the publication of the 11 Lares and Penates” of Cilicia from <lb/>
            terra cottas discovered on the spot by Mr. William Burckhardt <lb/>
            Barker. We have among these, evidences of Assyrian mythology, <lb/>
            in the presence of the Assyrian Perseus, Sandon or Hercules, <lb/>
            (Dayyad the Hunter, and the same as Nimrod,) the Assyrian <lb/>
            Bellerophon and Pegasus, and horses of the sun. We have evi­ <lb/>
            dences of Egyptian mythology in representations of Isis, Osiris, <lb/>
            Horus, Anubis, and Phre the Hawk-the Egyptian sun. With <lb/>
            these we have, as might be anticipated, a whole host of illustrations <lb/>
            of the mythology of Syria and Phœnicia, of Lesser Asia, Greece, <lb/>
            and Rome. Tarsus was a well-known and distinguished seat of <lb/>
            Greek philosophy and literature, and from the number of its schools <lb/>
            and learned men, was ranked by the side of Athens and Alexan­ <lb/>
            dria. (Strabo, xiv. pp. 673, 674.)</p>
          <p>To the Christian, Tarsus derives its greatest Interest from being <lb/>
            the birth-place of the apostle Paul. Augustus made Tarsus free <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            This seems to have implied the privilege of being governed by its <lb/>
            own laws and magistrates, with freedom from tribute, but did not <lb/>
            confer the jus coloniarum, nor the jus civitatis: and it was not <lb/>
            therefore, as usually supposed, on this account that Paul enjoyed <lb/>
            the privilege of Roman citizenship. Tarsus, indeed, eventually <lb/>
            did become a Roman colony, which gave to the inhabitants this <lb/>
            privilege; but this was not till long after the time of Paul. We <lb/>
            thus find that the Roman tribune at Jerusalem ordered Paul to be <lb/>
            scourged, though he knew he was a native of Tarsus, but desisted <lb/>
            on learning that he was a Roman citizen. (Acts ix. It ; xxi. 39; <lb/>
            xxii. 24, 27.)</p>
          <p>In the time of Abulfeda, that is, towards the end of the thir­ <lb/>
            teenth and beginning of the fourteenth century, Tarsus was still <lb/>
            large and surrounded by a double wall, and it was chiefly inhabited <lb/>
            by Armenian Christians.</p>
          <p>Tarsus has always been a city of considerable commercial im­ <lb/>
            portance. Albertus Aquensis speaks of three thousand ships sail­ <lb/>
            ing from the port of Tarsus, and even in the present day a much <lb/>
            greater extent might be given to the commerce and the mercantile <lb/>
            and agricultural resources of the place.</p>
          <p>CYDNUS.—The river Cydnus which flows through Tarsus, do­ <lb/>
            riving its waters from the snows of Taurus at no very great distance <lb/>
            from the city itself, are extremely cold, and bear an evil repute <lb/>
            since the days of Alexander the Great. Malaria prevails however <lb/>
            to a great extent in the city, quite independent of any more im­ <lb/>
            mediate contact with its waters.</p>
          <p>CASTLE OF NIMRUD.— Tarsus is described by Xenophon as <lb/>
            abandoned by its inhabitants, who, with Syennesis, fled to a fast­ <lb/>
            ness upon the mountains, those only excepted who kept the public- <lb/>
            houses. The fastness here alluded to has been identified with the <lb/>
            castle of Nimrud in the adjacent mountains, partly on account of <lb/>
            its antiquity, partly because no other likely place is known. The <lb/>
            castle of Nimrud has not however been visited by any competent <lb/>
            traveller.</p>
          <p>SOLL.—The inhabitants of Soli and Issus, who lived near the sea, <lb/>
            did not quit their habitations. Issus will be noticed in due course. <lb/>
            Soli was a colony, according to Pomponius Mela and others, found <lb/>
            ed by the Argives and Rhodians; but according to Diogenes Laer­ <lb/>
            tius, by Solon, who founded there a colony of Athenians, who <lb/>
            gradually corrupting their own language, gave origin to the term <lb/>
            Solœcism.</p>
          <p>This city was afterwards put under contribution by Alexander <lb/>
            and devastated by Tigranes, and Pompey confined to the same <lb/>
            locality the pirates who troubled the neighbouring seas, and gave <lb/>
            the place his own name—Pompeiopolis.</p>
          <p>The ruins of the ancient city still exist near a place now called <lb/>
            Aski Shahir, "the old city," near Mazatli on the coast. They <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            have been minutely described by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort in <lb/>
            his Karamania (pp. 246—259, et scq.). Many additions have <lb/>
            been made to these descriptions in Mr. W. B. Barker's work be­ <lb/>
            fore alluded to,“ Lares and Penates : or, Cilicia and its Gorernors” <lb/>
            (p. 130 et seq.). A plan and description of the ruins by Captain <lb/>
            Prissick are also to be found, in Dr. Holt Yates' “Modern His­ <lb/>
            tory and Condition of Egypt."</p>
          <p>RIVER PSARUS.—Cyrus is described as making from Tarsus, <lb/>
            in two days' march, ten parasangs to the river Psarus, which <lb/>
            therefore corresponds to the river of Adana, now called Sihun, or <lb/>
            Saihun, to distinguish it from its neighbour the Pyramus, called <lb/>
            Jihun, or Jaihun, just as the Oxus or Amu of the Turks and <lb/>
            Tartars is called Jihun to distinguish it from the Jaxartes, Sir <lb/>
            Darah, or head valley, of the Turks, the Sihun of the Arabs. Jihun <lb/>
            is the Arabic corruption for the Hebrew Gihon, the name of one <lb/>
            of the rivers of Paradise.</p>
          <p>This river is, by my own admeasurements, three hundred and <lb/>
            twenty-five feet wide at Adana. My idea of the distance by road <lb/>
            from Tarsus to Adana corresponds more closely to the evaluation <lb/>
            of 3 geographical miles to the parasang than of 2½ miles. Colonel <lb/>
            Chesney (ii. 210) himself says it is rather more than twenty-nine <lb/>
            miles between the two places.</p>
          <p>RIVER PYRAMUS.—From the Psarus, Cyrus made, in one day's <lb/>
            march, five parasangs to the river Pyramus, which was a stadium <lb/>
            in width. The distance here between two well-established points <lb/>
            is also at the rate of 3 geographical miles to the parasang. From <lb/>
            whatever point the Greeks crossed the Sihun there would be 15 <lb/>
            geographical miles of nearly level plain to reach the Jihun or <lb/>
            Jaihun, as the Pyramus is now called.</p>
          <p>“ The width given by Xenophon," says “ Colonel Chesney, indi­ <lb/>
            cates that the passage of the Psarus was effected somewhere about <lb/>
            the place now occupied by the city of Adana, and that of the Pyra­ <lb/>
            mus in the vicinity of the present town of Mallus or Misis; and <lb/>
            neither of the rivers being fordable, it may be presumed that they <lb/>
            were, as in the case of the Maeander, crossed on some kind of tem­ <lb/>
            porary bridge."</p>
          <p>Issi, or ISSUS.—From the river Pyramus Cyrus advanced in <lb/>
            two days' march, a distance of fifteen parasangs, to Issi, the last <lb/>
            city in Cilicia, situate upon the sea-coast, a populous, large, and <lb/>
            rich place.</p>
          <p>We are here placed in the dilemma of diminishing the value of <lb/>
            the parasang, over a country presenting no particular difficulties, <lb/>
            or of supposing, as I have done in the “ Travels in the Track," &amp;c., <lb/>
            that Cyrus forded the river in its lower parts, and at a time when <lb/>
            its embouchure was at Kara Tash. This would have taken them <lb/>
            across the plain of Ayas, ancient Campus Alieus, by which Philotas, <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            as recorded by Arrian, led the horse, on the occasion of the ad­ <lb/>
            vance of the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, and which <lb/>
            would give forty-five miles between the Pyramus and Issus, whilst <lb/>
            from Misis there is only thirty-three or thirty-four miles. I do <lb/>
            not wish however to lay particular stress upon this view of the <lb/>
            case, especially since all other commentators now agree in varying <lb/>
            the value of the parasang according to the nature of the ground, <lb/>
            and there are on the road from Misis to Issus two ranges of hills <lb/>
            to cross. The first the Jibal an Nur, or mountain of light, presents <lb/>
            a little pass that would present obstacles to chariots; the second <lb/>
            also presents a narrow pass, where is the ancient Cyclopean arch, <lb/>
            called the Iron gate, or the Black gate, and which corresponds to <lb/>
            the Amanian gates with a station, (the latter represented by the ruins <lb/>
            at Matakh,) and a further detour is occasioned by the marshes at the <lb/>
            end of the plain, on which are situated the ruins of Epiphanea, <lb/>
            originally called Oeniandos and Castabala. These two sites are <lb/>
            determined from the distances given in the Antonine Itinerary, <lb/>
            and the Theodosian Tables. The latter place, Epiphanea, 30 M. P. <lb/>
            from Anazarbas, and the same distance from Alexandria ad Issuni, <lb/>
            now Iskandarun or Alexandretta.</p>
          <p>The positioning of Issus gave much more trouble, and involved <lb/>
            the careful discussion of the historians of Alexander as compared <lb/>
            with Cicero and other accessible authorities. All the circum­ <lb/>
            stances of the case pointed however tolerably satisfactorily to a <lb/>
            great extent of ruins scattered over the plain, north of the Dali- <lb/>
            chai, or mad river, as the Pinarus is now called. The only <lb/>
            point not satisfactorily cleared up was the position of the altars of <lb/>
            Alexander. It has been suggested that these may be the ruin <lb/>
            called Jonas' Pillars, a point which Alexander had reached before <lb/>
            he heard that Darius had crossed the Amanus in his rear, and <lb/>
            from whence he returned to engage in the battle of Issus, so fatal <lb/>
            to the Persian hosts. Quintus Curtius said that these altars were <lb/>
            erected on the banks of the Pinarus, but Pliny describes the <lb/>
            Domitae or altars as between Amanus and Rhosus, which would <lb/>
            point to the locality here suggested. Another difficulty remains <lb/>
            with regard to Nikopolis, which Stephanus says was a name given <lb/>
            to Issus after the great battle fought there by the Macedonians, <lb/>
            but Strabo and Ptolemy both agree in making it a different place.</p>
          <p>GATES OF CILICIA AND SYRIA.—From Issus Cyrus proceeded <lb/>
            one day's march, five parasangs, to the Gates of Cilicia and Syria. <lb/>
            "These were two fortresses; of the part within them, towards <lb/>
            Cilicia, Syennesis and a guard of Cilicians had the charge ; the <lb/>
            part without, towards Syria, a garrison of the king's soldiers was <lb/>
            reported to occupy. Between the two runs a river called Carsus, <lb/>
            a plethrum in breadth. The whole space between the fortresses <lb/>
            was three stadia; and it was impossible to pass it by force; for the <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            passage was very narrow, the walls reached down to the sea, and <lb/>
            above were inaccessible rocks. At each of the fortresses were <lb/>
            gates."</p>
          <p>Dr. Anthon says the common text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κέρσος</foreign>, but the reading <lb/>
            of the best MSS. is <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καρσος</foreign>. The Rev. J. T. Macmichael has <lb/>
            adopted the correction of Psarus for Pharus, but not that of Kar­ <lb/>
            sus for Kersus. There is every reason to believe that this river, <lb/>
            now called Markaz su, corresponds to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κέρσίας</foreign> of Ptolemy, and <lb/>
            the Crocodilon flumen of Pliny. It was at the foot of that part <lb/>
            of Amanus called Mons Crocodilns. The French annotators of <lb/>
            Pliny have suggested an identity between a Syriac word analogous <lb/>
            to Kersus, and the Egyptian Kamses, a crocodile, hence Kersus or <lb/>
            Karsus would be the same as the Crocodilon flumen.</p>
          <p>The Gates of Cilicia and Syria occur at a point where the Ama­ <lb/>
            nus approaches most closely to the sea-shore. Coming from the <lb/>
            north, we have the Markaz su, or Karsus, which flows from a gap <lb/>
            in the rocks, between high perpendicular precipices, past the mo­ <lb/>
            dern village of Markaz, and then divides into two branches, one of <lb/>
            which goes nearly directly to the sea; the other, after losing itself <lb/>
            in a marshy lagune, finds its exit into the sea at a distance of about <lb/>
            a mile and a half north of the direct branch. This first or northerly <lb/>
            stream is passed by a bridge, and a little distance farther south <lb/>
            are ruins on the shore of the termination of a wall with a gate. <lb/>
            At a distance of about six hundred yards, corresponding to the <lb/>
            three stadia of Xenophon, are the more perfect ruins of a wall, <lb/>
            which can be traced amid a dense shrubbery, from the mountains <lb/>
            down to the sea-shore, where it terminates in a round tower.</p>
          <p>A little beyond to the right, and on the slope of the hills, is a <lb/>
            Saracenic castle, noticed under the same name of Markaz in the <lb/>
            Mecca Itinerary, published by the Geographical Society of Paris. <lb/>
            From this castle the rocks advance directly to the shore, leaving a <lb/>
            narrow pass over which a paved road is now carried, and upon <lb/>
            which stands the ruined gateway called Jonas' Pillars, or Sakal <lb/>
            Tutan, “ Beard-catcher," an Oriental expression for a difficult pass.</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney remarks that “ the Markaz or Mer<foreign xml:lang="grc">κ</foreign>ez su, anci­ <lb/>
            ent Karsus, determines the sites of the so-called gates or fortresses, <lb/>
            which were erected to defend the ground; the one being in Cilicia, <lb/>
            and the other in Syria, the river flowing between them."</p>
          <p>When we consider the important events of which these gates <lb/>
            were the scene, in the time of Cyrus the younger, as also in that <lb/>
            of Alexander the Great; the mystical name of the river, which <lb/>
            associates it with ancient crocodile worship, and the Axio-Kersian <lb/>
            or Samo-Thracian mysteries, and the ruined edifice correspond­ <lb/>
            ing to the Bomitae of Pliny, all domineered over by the castle of <lb/>
            Saracenic times, it would be difficult to imagine a more interesting <lb/>
            mass of ruins, both in a classical and archœological point of view, <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            grouped together in so small a compass. Nor is the scene so re­ <lb/>
            plete with historical associations wanting in picturesque acces­ <lb/>
            sories.</p>
          <p>MYRIANDRUS.—Cyrus is described as proceeding from the Gates <lb/>
            of Cilicia and Syria, through Syria, one day's march, five parasangs, <lb/>
            to Myriandrus, a city near the sea, inhabited by Phœnicians: this <lb/>
            place was a public mart, and many merchant-vessels lay at anchor <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>The site of Myriandrus has not yet been satisfactorily deter­ <lb/>
            mined. According to the distances given by Xenophon of five <lb/>
            parasangs from the Gates of Cilicia and Syria, it would be, if on <lb/>
            the sea-shore, either some way beyond Alexandretta on the way to <lb/>
            Arsus, or if the sea, as was probably the case, extended further in­ <lb/>
            land at that time, and occupied the now pestilent marshes of <lb/>
            Alexandretta, beyond Godefroy de Bouillon's Castle; at the foot <lb/>
            of the hills near Jacob or Joseph's well, where Rennell sought for <lb/>
            the site in question, or a little beyond that, and nearer to the foot <lb/>
            of the pass of Baylan. It is evident that Myriandrus and the <lb/>
            town subsequently named after the Macedonian hero, were not the <lb/>
            same, for Strabo mentions both, and in the following succession: <lb/>
            Rhosus (Arsus), Myriandrus, and Alexandria. The ruins may per­ <lb/>
            chance yet be found in the wooded country that lies between Alex­ <lb/>
            andretta and Rhosus, at or near the coast, about opposite the <lb/>
            entrance of the pass of Baylan. This is a region which has not <lb/>
            yet been satisfactorily explored.</p>
          <p>RIVER CHALUS.—Cyrus proceeded four days'march, a distance <lb/>
            of twenty parasangs, to the river Chalus, which was a plethrum in <lb/>
            breadth, and full of large tame fish, which the Syrians looked upon <lb/>
            as gods, and allowed no one to hurt either them or the pigeons.</p>
          <p>This is a long journey, of from 50 to 60 miles, in which several <lb/>
            objects of interest are passed over without an observation. Among <lb/>
            the first of these is the pass between Amanus and Rhosus, the true <lb/>
            Syrian Gates, in which are situated vestiges of the strong town <lb/>
            called Pinara by Pliny and Ptolemy, and by corruption Erana by <lb/>
            Cicero, who describes it as being in the mountain above the region <lb/>
            in which the altars of Alexander were situated-another proof that <lb/>
            the “ Bomitae” were at the foot of Amanus and Rhosus, and not, <lb/>
            as Quintus Curtius relates, on the banks of the Pinarus.</p>
          <p>Pinara was the Pictanus of the Jerusalem Itinerary, and it is <lb/>
            now represented by the town of Baylan, whose mosque was built, <lb/>
            according to the Mecca Itinerary, by Sultan Selim, and the Khan <lb/>
            by Sultan Sulaiman the Magnificent. There are also remains of <lb/>
            a causeway, of an aqueduct, and of a bridge.</p>
          <p>Beyond the Syrian Gates was Pagras or Pangrios, represented <lb/>
            apparently by the castle of Ibn Abu Daud; and at the foot of the <lb/>
            mountains, the great plain watered bv three different rivers. the</p><pb n="285"/>
            
          <p>Karasu, the Aswad, and the Afrin, corresponding to the Labotas, <lb/>
            the Aenoporas, and Arceuthus of the Romans, and in the centre of <lb/>
            which is the great expanse of the lake of Antioch.</p>
          <p>The silence of Xenophon with regard to this mountain-pass, <lb/>
            the rivers and lake of the plain of Antioch, and the rocky region <lb/>
            beyond, now called St. Simon or Shaikh Barakat, has given origin <lb/>
            to various surmises on the part of commentators on the Anabasis. <lb/>
            Rennell has supposed, in consequence of this silence and that of <lb/>
            Straho, that the lake did not exist at that time; and Forster, in <lb/>
            his Geographical Dissertation, has made this one of the grounds <lb/>
            for supposing that Xenophon kept no journal, or at least no regu­ <lb/>
            lar one, of the expedition, but that he drew it up a great many <lb/>
            years afterwards. I think it more likely, from the general charac­ <lb/>
            ter of the work, that something occurred, sickness or despondency, <lb/>
            and the latter might naturally have been brought about by the <lb/>
            clandestine departure of Xenias and Pasion, to distract the atten­ <lb/>
            tion of our historian or to make him disinclined to write. Con­ <lb/>
            trast, for example, the indifference of the present moment, with <lb/>
            the energy displayed and the minuteness of description indulged <lb/>
            in when Xenophon became a leader in the passes of Kurdistan.</p>
          <p>A tributary to the river Sajur having been found during the <lb/>
            survey of northern Syria by the Euphrates Expedition, to still <lb/>
            preserve the name of Baluk or Baluklu su, "Fish River," Colonel <lb/>
            Chesney makes Cyrus march in a north-easterly direction, over <lb/>
            a very difficult country, to that insignificant rivulet, to turn almost <lb/>
            back again in a direction south, a little west, to the Chalib or Ku­ <lb/>
            wait—the river of Aleppo, at the point where a large group of <lb/>
            tells,. or mounds of ruin, give evidence of the existence of a once <lb/>
            prosperous and flourishing community,</p>
          <p>I do not, however, see any reason for changing the opinion I <lb/>
            had adopted in common with other geographers, that the Chalib <lb/>
            or Kuwait represents the Chains of Xenophon. The direct dis­ <lb/>
            tance is perhaps not sufficient, but the difficulties of the road pre­ <lb/>
            sented by the pass of Baylan, the marshy plain of Antioch, and <lb/>
            the necessity of turning northwards up the valley of the Afrin, to <lb/>
            avoid the rocky deserts of Shaikh Barakat, give in detail a distance <lb/>
            between the Mediterranean and the river Chalib of at least sixty <lb/>
            geographical miles, or of three miles to a parasang.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding a statement of Rauwolf's, that fish were scarce <lb/>
            in the market of Aleppo, I stated as the results of my own observ­ <lb/>
            ation in the Travels in the Track, &amp;c., that the Chalib abounded <lb/>
            in fish, and I have since found in Dr. Russell's Natural History of <lb/>
            Aleppo, 1794, vol. ii. p. 207, that not only do fish abound in the <lb/>
            Chalib, but that there is a fountain called Haïlan, a Syriac word <lb/>
            signifying.“ the powerful," (see my Travels and Researches in <note type="footnote"> * Tel or Tell of the Arabians, Tuppah, vulgo Teppeh, of the Turks, <lb/>
            Thupo in Pali, Stupa in Sanscrit, vulgo Topes in India. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, &amp;c. vol. ii. p. 101,) where, as in the <lb/>
            fountain of Birkat a! Ibrahim or Abraham, the beloved, at Urfah, <lb/>
            of Mambij ancient Hierapolis, at the tomb of Daniyali Akbar, <lb/>
            " the greater Daniel," (see Rawlinson in Journal Roy. Geo. Soc. <lb/>
            vol. ix. p. 83,) and elsewhere, fish are still, or were till lately, pre­ <lb/>
            served unmolested, and therefore more or less reverenced or sacred <lb/>
            in the eyes of the true believers.</p>
          <p>Dr. Russell says, "From what I had cursorily remarked in the <lb/>
            markets, or at the tables of the inhabitants, and from the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of the Kowick (Kuwait), I hardly expected to find so great a <lb/>
            variety of fish in that river; but, upon examination, it was found <lb/>
            to produce seventeen species, and amongst those, some hitherto <lb/>
            undeseribed.”</p>
          <p>"To the assiduity of the fishermen, which is restrained to no <lb/>
            particular season, and exercised with little discretion, may be <lb/>
            partly ascribed the small size of the fish in general; for at Heylan <lb/>
            (Hailan), and the fountain of fishes, where they are suffered to re­ <lb/>
            main unmolested, they grow considerably larger."</p>
          <p>It is almost needless to remark, that this superstitious reverence <lb/>
            for fish is a remnant of the Assyrian and Syro-Arabian worship of <lb/>
            fish gods. Berosus (see Cory's Ancient Fragments, p. 22 and 31) <lb/>
            makes Oannes the first and Odakon the last of these. Selden (De <lb/>
            Diis Syris, p. 2G5) is persuaded that this Odakon is the Philistine <lb/>
            god Dagon. The further resemblance between Dagon and Ater­ <lb/>
            gatis or Derketo is so great in other respects, that the same au­ <lb/>
            thority accounts for the only important difference between them— <lb/>
            that of sex—by referring to the androgynous nature of many hea­ <lb/>
            then gods. The Greeks embodied their worship, as usual, into <lb/>
            their mythology, by a poetic story of the loves of the goddess <lb/>
            Derketa or Derceta.</p>
          <p>RIVER DARADAX, or DARDES.—From the villages of Parysatis <lb/>
            on the Chalus, Cyrus advanced, five days' march, a distance of <lb/>
            thirty parasangs, to the sources of the river Dardes, which is a <lb/>
            plethrum in breadth. Here was the palace of Bclesys, the governor <lb/>
            of Syria, and a very large and beautiful garden, containing all <lb/>
            that the seasons produce.</p>
          <p>The common text has <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δαραδακος</foreign>, but Anthon * gives <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δάρδητος</foreign> <lb/>
            with Dindorf, on good MS. authority. Colonel Chesney's view of this <lb/>

            to the fountain of Bab, near the source of the stream called Dhahab <lb/>
            or Dabb, it is about sixty-one miles to the last, the presumed Dara­ <lb/>
            dax: and if the windings of the Koweik (Kuwait) be followed in <lb/>
            the earlier part of the march, it would be seventy or eighty miles <lb/>
            from the higher part of the Chalib or Chains, which, as in the time <lb/>
            of Xenophon, still abounds in fish. The distance (thirty para­ <lb/>
            sangs) given by Xenophon between the rivers Chains and Dara­ <lb/>
            dax, which was accomplished in five marches, agrees with the <lb/>
            nature of the intervening country; for whether the windings of <lb/>
            the upper part of the Koweik were followed, or the stream forded <lb/>
            two or three times in preference, a fifth march would be requisite, <lb/>
            as already mentioned." (ii. p. 213.)</p>
          <p>Some difficulties present themselves in accepting this determina­ <lb/>
            tion. In the first place, the distance given would accord better <lb/>
            with the idea of Cyrus having crossed the Syrian plains from the <lb/>
            Chalus to the Euphrates, notwithstanding Xenophon's silence <lb/>
            upon the subject. The same silence, or rather passing over all <lb/>
            notice of the river Euphrates until the army came to Thapsaeus­ <lb/>
            is observed throughout, and may have been an inadvertence, for <lb/>
            the nature of the country would oblige an army to keep along the <lb/>
            banks of the river; and Colonel Chesney, who identifies the foun­ <lb/>
            tain of Dhahab with that of Dardes, still makes Cyrus, notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the silence of Xenophon upon the subject, join the Eu­ <lb/>
            phrates at Balls.</p>
          <p>The name of the site—Balis—corresponding to the Barbalissus <lb/>
            or Barbarissus of the Romans, and the ruins existing there, would <lb/>
            point to that place as the site of the palace of the Persian satrap. <lb/>
            Then again, at that point there is a great alluvial plain, which to the <lb/>
            present day abounds in boars and other game, while all beyond, or <lb/>
            westward, is a dry arid upland, a perfect wilderness, which, how­ <lb/>
            ever, may be modified somewhat by the waters of the Dhabab.</p>
          <p>Lastly, there was a canal, taken from the Euphrates at Balis, <lb/>
            which might be a hundred feet wide at its origin, as described by <lb/>
            Xenophon, and which it is difficult to imagine the fountain of Fay, <lb/>
            as Rennell calls it—al Bab, or Taidiff—could present at its origin.</p>
          <p>There is to be added to all this, that the back distance from <lb/>
            Thapsacus (Al Hammam) to Balis corresponds precisely with the <lb/>
            distance given by Xenophon between the palace of Belesis and <lb/>
            Thapsacus, that is, fifteen parasangs or forty-five miles by the bends <lb/>
            of the river. Notwithstanding the points in favour of one and the <lb/>
            other view of the subject, common sense would point to a probable <lb/>
            visit to the fountain of Dhahab, or Dardes, on the way to the pa­ <lb/>
            lace of Belesis at Balis. <unclear/> But so common sense would also point <lb/>
            to the identity of Bayas, or Baiae, with Issus, where is a river to <lb/>
            represent the Pinarus, a plain large enough to fight a battle, with­ <lb/>
            out being cut up by deep ruts like the plain of Dali-ehai, and <lb/>
            where the ships could be moored opposite Cyrus' tent, a proceed­ <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            ing scarcely possible at the mouths of the Dali-chai, only that <lb/>
            other circumstances do not uphold this hypothesis.</p>
          <p>THAPSACUS.—Having wantonly destroyed the palace and park <lb/>
            of Belesis, Cyrus is described by Xenophon as proceeding, in three <lb/>
            days' march, a distance of fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, <lb/>
            which is there four stadia in breadth, and on which was situ­ <lb/>
            ated a large and rich city, named Thapsacus. Colonel Chesney <lb/>
            (ii. 213) describes these as “ pressing marches, following and <lb/>
            constantly touching the Euphrates from Balis," which accords with <lb/>
            the view previously taken of this portion of the march.</p>
          <p>The distance here given of forty-five miles, corresponds with the <lb/>
            overland distance from Balis to the ford celebrated among the <lb/>
            Arabs, as that of the Anazah or Badawin. This ford, as such or <lb/>
            as a bridge, was used for the passage alike of Persian, Greek, and <lb/>
            Roman armies, and more lately of Arabs, Tartars, and Turks. <lb/>
            Xerxes, who, according to Herodotus, crossed the Hellespont by <lb/>
            a bridge of boats, in which one was tied to the other, had con­ <lb/>
            structed a similar one at Thapsacus, but this was destroyed by <lb/>
            Abrocomas on the approach of Cyrus. Alexander dragged over <lb/>
            the boats necessary for the passage of the river from the Medi­ <lb/>
            terranean.</p>
          <p>The remains of a paved causeway are still to be observed on <lb/>
            both banks of the river, which is here eight hundred yards, or four <lb/>
            stadia, in width. This causeway is marked in the Augustan and <lb/>
            Theodosian Tables as part of a road carried by Palmyra to Ba. <lb/>
            bylonia, as also northwards to Carrhae, Edessa, and to more re­ <lb/>
            mote countries.</p>
          <p>A congregation of mounds, well worthy of archœological explor­ <lb/>
            ation, are all that remain of the ancient Tiphsah, which was taken <lb/>
            possession of by Solomon, probably in connexion with the series <lb/>
            of operations (of which the building or fortification of Tadmor <lb/>
            was one) adopted by him for the purpose of drawing the Eastern <lb/>
            trade into his own dominions. Tiphsah became afterwards Thap­ <lb/>
            sacus, both signifying the same thing, “the ford." The same <lb/>
            place is called Sura by Pliny and by Ptolemy, and this was its <lb/>
            name in medieval times, for it is called in the Ecclesiastical notices <lb/>
            of the Lower Empire, Flavia firma Sum. It was also, according <lb/>
            to Stephanus, called Turmeda by the Syrians, and Amphipolis <lb/>
            under the successors of Alexander. The ruins are now called Su­ <lb/>
            riyah.</p>
          <p>Rennet and D’Anville were induced from the supposed exist­ <lb/>
            ence of a ford or pass of the Euphrates at Dair, “ the monastery," <lb/>
            and in ignorance of the existence of this ford, to identify Thapsa­ <lb/>
            cus with that little Arabic town, which is built upon a vast mound <lb/>
            of ruin-the remains of some site of antiquity. But it is two hun­ <lb/>
            dred and eleven miles by the river from Balis to Dair, and to get <lb/>
            over this difficulty, these two distinguished geographers were <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            obliged to suppose that Xenophon had, by an oversight, misplaced <lb/>
            the distances of Belesis to Thapsacus, (fifteen parasangs,) and from <lb/>
            Thapsacus to the Araxes—Xenophon’s name for the Khabur- <lb/>
            (fifteen parasangs,) and that it should have been fifty parasangs <lb/>
            from Balis to Thapsacus, and fifteen from Thapsacus to the <lb/>
            Araxes. It is satisfactory to find by the true determination of the <lb/>
            position of Thapsacus at fifteen parasangs from Balis, that there <lb/>
            is no necessity whatsoever for this violation of the accuracy of the <lb/>
            historian.</p>
          <p>RIVER ARAXES.—Cyrus having with his army forded the Eu­ <lb/>
            phrates at Thapsacus, the waters rising no higher than the breast; <lb/>
            he is described by Xenophon as advancing through Syria, nine <lb/>
            days’ march, a distance of fifty parasangs. to the river Araxes, <lb/>
            where were a number of villages, stored with corn and wine.</p>
          <p>Having crossed the Euphrates, it is manifest that the country <lb/>
            the army was marching in was in reality Mesopotamia, but it was <lb/>
            by no means an uncommon thing for the Romans to describe the <lb/>
            districts in question sometimes as in Syria, at others in Mesopota­ <lb/>
            mia. Pliny and Strabo both speak of the country lying between <lb/>
            Thapsaeus and the Seenite or nomade Arabs, as Syria.</p>
          <p>Wherefore Xenophon called the river Khabur, Araxes, it is diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to determine. The name was by no means an uncommon one, <lb/>
            and Strabo, in accordance with the national custom of referring <lb/>
            foreign names to a Greek origin, connects the word with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀράσσω</foreign>, <lb/>
            and adds that the Peneus was once called Araxes, on account of its <lb/>
            having separated Ossa from Olympus at the gorge of Tempe.*</p>
          <p>This river was, however, known to antiquity generally by other <lb/>
            names, approaching more or less to its present appellation. Thus, <lb/>
            it is described in the Old Testament (2 Kings xxiv. 15; Ezek. i. l, <lb/>
            3; iii. 15, 23; x. 15, 20) under the name of Chebar, as a river <lb/>
            of Mesopotamia, upon the banks of which Nebuchadnezzar plant­ <lb/>
            ed a colony of Jews, among whom was the prophet Ezekiel. <note type="footnote"> * Rawlinson has shown the prefix Ar, Ara, and Arta, to be of transcend­ <lb/>
            ental use in every single branch of Arian Paleography, with the exception of <lb/>
            the Zend. (Journ. of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. x. p. 55, and vol. xi. p. <lb/>
            33, ct seq.) Ar, or liar, he says, significs mountain, as in Arburz, (El Burz,) <lb/>
            Arakadrish, (Aracadres,) Ar Parsin, the mountains of Persia. Bochart long <lb/>
            ago showed (I'haleg i. I) that the first syllable in Armenia (Armina in the <lb/>
            cuncifonn) signified in Semitic “a mountain." Burnouf and Lassen have <lb/>
            traced Arius (Ariya of the cuneiform) to the root signifying “ man." We <lb/>
            have another form in Arabia, the cuneiform Arabaya. Arta, so much used <lb/>
            as aprefix to names, as in Artakhshatra, (Artaxerxes,) signifies, according to <lb/>
            Rawlinson, aking.There can be little doubt then of the native origin of <lb/>
            the name Aras, the Araxes of the Greeks, although there might be some <lb/>
            doubt if it meant mountain river, or a head or chief river ; assuming the <lb/>
            prefix Ar to have somewhat the same power as Syr, Sir, or Sar, used by the <lb/>
            Turks in Syr Damah, (Jaxartes,) as head valley or river; and by the Kurds, <lb/>
            as head mountain or stream indifferently. Araxes has been generally sup­ <lb/>
            posed to be a Greek modification of the Armenian Arasch or Eraschs. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> U </note> <lb/>

            Layard says that in the Hebrew text the name is spelt in two dif­ <lb/>
            ferent ways. In Kings we have Khabour. In Ezekiel it is written <lb/>
            Kebar. So also in the Septuagint it is written <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χοβάρ</foreign>. It is called <lb/>
            Aboras and Abboras by Strabo, Zosimus, Ammianus, Procopius, <lb/>
            and others. Ptolemy writes it Khaboras.</p>
          <p>Layard, whilst carrying on his archæological explorations in <lb/>
            Assyria, having been informed by the Arabs that two colossal idols, <lb/>
            similar to those at Nimrud, had been laid bare by the waters of <lb/>
            the Khabur; he repaired to the spot, and was rewarded by the <lb/>
            discovery of a considerable number of monuments of Assyrian <lb/>
            times, of which he says, "the Archaic character of the treatment <lb/>
            and design, the peculiar form of the features, the rude though for­ <lb/>
            cible delineation of the muscles, and the simplicity of the details, <lb/>
            certainly convey the impression of greater antiquity than any <lb/>
            monuments hitherto discovered in Assyria Proper."</p>
          <p>The Khabur is a large river having its sources in the Karajah <lb/>
            Tagh in northern Mesopotamia, and receiving in its course down <lb/>
            wards tributaries from Kuhrasar (Sinna) and Has al Ain (Resaina) <lb/>
            from the west; from Masku, Mardin, Dara, Nisibin, (ancient Myg­ <lb/>
            donius,) Asnawur, and Cliil Agha from the east, besides a rivulet <lb/>
            called Al Hauli or Holi from the marshes of Khatuniyah in the <lb/>
            Sinjar. The main branch of the river is by accident omitted <lb/>
            in the map accompanying Layard's account of his discoveries in <lb/>
            Nineveh and Babylon. (1853.)</p>
          <p>At the junction of the Khabur and he Euphrates, we have on <lb/>
            the north the ruins of Carchemish of Scripture, called by the Greeks <lb/>
            Kirkesion, and by the Romans, with whom it was long a frontier <lb/>
            town, Cerensinm. The place is called by the Arabs in the presen: <lb/>
            day Kirkisiyah, and also from the abundance of ruins, Abu Sarai, <lb/>
            “ the father of palaces." Layard, who did not visit it, says " Abou <lb/>
            Psera.” Al Wakidi, in his History of the Conquest of Mesopotamia <lb/>
            by the Arabs, ealls it Karkisha.</p>
          <p>To the south are the mounds of Kalneh, supposed by Colonel <lb/>
            Chesney (i. 52; 117, 118) to be the site of Calneh, or Chalneh, <lb/>
            the fourth of Nimrod’s cities. (Gen. x. 10.)</p>
          <p>According to the Chaldee version, with which Eusebius and <lb/>
            Jerome agree, this is the same place that was subsequently called <lb/>
            Ctesiphon.</p>
          <p>Colonel Rawlinson has however, by the aid of those important <lb/>
            paleographic researches which promise to throw an entirely new <lb/>
            light on Assyro-Babylonian and Chaldean history and geography, <lb/>
            discovered the ideograph for Calneh among the inscribed bricks <lb/>
            of a place called Niffer. (Ann. Report of the Royal Asiatic Society <lb/>
            vol. xv. p. xix.) He had previously (Jour, of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vo.. <lb/>
            x. p. 22) identified, as he also said from the evidence of the bricks, <lb/>
            the same primeval site with the Chaldean ruins of Kalwadha near <lb/>
            Baghdad.</p><pb n="291"/>
            
          <p>ARABIA.—Cyrus advanced from the Khabur through Arabia, <lb/>
            naving the Euphrates on his right, five days' march through the <lb/>
            desert, a distance of five parasangs.</p>
          <p>Rawlinson remarks that in the cuneiform inscriptions the name <lb/>
            of Arabia (Arabaya) is sometimes introduced between those of <lb/>
            Babylon and Assyria, sometimes between Assyria and Egypt; and <lb/>
            lie adds, “ I think, therefore, we may suppose the title to apply to <lb/>
            the Mesopotamian Desert, and the basin of the Euphrates, which <lb/>
            have always been inhabited by Arab tribes, rather than to the vast <lb/>
            Southern Peninsula. The Jews, in the same way, whose geogra­ <lb/>
            phical notions were very limited, designated as Arabia, or the <lb/>
            country of the Arabs, the region immediately joining Palestine, and <lb/>
            stretching southwards to the Red Sea." (Journ. of Roy. Asiatic <lb/>
            Society, vol. xi. p. 38.)</p>
          <p>Thus it was that, in accordance with the views entertained at that <lb/>
            epoch, we find Xenophon describing those regions of Mesopotamia <lb/>
            which lie north-westward of the Khabur, as Syria; and those to <lb/>
            the south, as Arabia. The Athenian historian's description of <lb/>
            the desert is so concise, and so graphic, as to be familiar to every <lb/>
            one, and, as a consequent penalty, has been often quoted as descrip­ <lb/>
            live of regions which have little in common with the particular <lb/>
            territory in question.</p>
          <p>RIVER MASCAS AND CITY OF CORSOTE.—Marching through this <lb/>
            region, Xenophon relates, they came to the river Mascas, the <lb/>
            breadth of which is a plethrum. Here was a large deserted city, <lb/>
            of which the name was Corsote, and which was entirely surround­ <lb/>
            ed by the Mascas.</p>
          <p>At a distance of sixty-three miles touching the river curves, or <lb/>
            of one hundred miles and upwards by the river's winding, a con­ <lb/>
            siderable tract of alluvium is cut off from the main-land, by a <lb/>
            canal, which drawn from the river at a northerly point, empties <lb/>
            itself by three different embouchures to the south. Beyond are <lb/>
            cliffs of marls and gypsum, upon which traces of ruins of older <lb/>
            time are still to be met. The place is called in the present day <lb/>
            Irzah or Izrah, and also by corruption Werdi.</p>
          <p>It is not at all improbable from this site being nearly opposite <lb/>
            to Al Kayim, the Agamana of Ptolemy, where the great desert <lb/>
            route from Palestine to Babylon first touches the Euphrates, that <lb/>
            this was one of the cities of bondage, where the captive Israelites <lb/>
            awaited the coming of Ezra, with the glad message that was to <lb/>
            enable them to return to their own country. In this case the <lb/>
            Masca would correspond to the Ahava of Scripture.</p>
          <p>The ruins of Corsote of Xenophon would appear to have been <lb/>
            on the plain, being described as entirely surrounded by the Mas­ <lb/>
            cas, unless we are to understand, as is more probable, that this <lb/>
            description allides to the great bend of the river at this point, <lb/>
            and which is described by Balbi, who descended the Euphrates in <note type="footnote"><unclear/> 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            1579, as keeping them from morning to noon in sight of the ruins. <lb/>
            When Balbi, however, speaks of these ruins as of greater extent <lb/>
            than the city of Cairo, and presenting nothing to view but portions <lb/>
            of massy walls and lofty towers, we must conclude that he mis­ <lb/>
            took the cliffs and great broken masses of gypsum for fragments <lb/>
            of ruin. Rauwolf, who travelled in 1574, also described the penin­ <lb/>
            sula as occupying more than half a day to encompass it.</p>
          <p>GATES OF BABYLONIA.—From Corsote Cyrus proceeded, thir­ <lb/>
            teen days' march, through the desert, a distance of ninety para­ <lb/>
            bangs, still keeping the Euphrates on the right, and arrived at a <lb/>
            place called the Gates.</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney is inclined to think, that as it appears by the <lb/>
            subsequent movements, that the “Gates” were about twenty-four <lb/>
            miles short of the Median Wall, the past, in question may safely <lb/>
            be placed about twenty-seven miles below Hit, or nearly opposite <lb/>
            to the village of Jarrah, from which, by the map, there are about <lb/>
            one hundred and seventy-five or one hundred and seventy-seven <lb/>
            geographical miles to represent the ninety parasangs from Corsote <lb/>
            to the Pylae, which at 1.98 each, give 178.2 geographical miles. <lb/>
            (ii. 214.)</p>
          <p>The banks of the Euphrates in this part of the route, and more <lb/>
            particularly in the lower portion, are exceedingly rocky and irre­ <lb/>
            gular, till we arrive at the level alluvial plains of Babylonia. It <lb/>
            is difficult among these irregular hills to distinguish one place as <lb/>
            more worthy of being designated as a pass than the other, and I <lb/>
            had hence been induced by that circumstance, and by a consider­ <lb/>
            ation of the distance travelled, (and which, by supposing the troops <lb/>
            to have been compelled to keep to the banks of the river, I had <lb/>
            given a much greater length to than Colonel Chesney,) to identify <lb/>
            the Pylae with the pass or descent from the hills upon the plain <lb/>
            of Babylonia itself.</p>
          <p>Rennell, it is to be observed, coincides in this view of the subject, <lb/>
            as he conjectures that the term pylae refers to the shutting up of <lb/>
            the river itself between the mountains, which terminate at the <lb/>
            same place on both sides of the river. This termination of the <lb/>
            hilly country at the level alluvial plain of Babylonia constitutes <lb/>
            indeed a very remarkable feature in the physical aspect of these <lb/>
            regions.</p>
          <p>The Rev. J. F. Maemichael,in his edition of Xenophon, (Appen­ <lb/>
            dix, p. 336,) suggests the conclusion that Pylae was neither city <lb/>
            (as Larcher surmised) nor mountain defile, but the ancient pass <lb/>
            into Babylonia through the Median Wall, at a time when it ex­ <lb/>
            tended—as when entire it must have done—to the Euphrates. <lb/>
            There is a great deal of plausibility in this suggestion.</p>
          <p>CHARMANDE.— On this long march through the desert, the <lb/>
            troops are described as passing over on rafts of skins to an opulent <lb/>
            and extensive city, called Cliarmande. As no distances are given, <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            I was inclined to identify this site with the most important posi­ <lb/>
            tion on the right bank of the Euphrates, that occurs within the inter­ <lb/>
            val between Corsote and the “ Gates," viz. the city of Iz or Izaneso­ <lb/>
            polis, whose bitumen fountains were visited by Alexander, by <lb/>
            Trajan, by Severus, and by Julian; but Colonel Chesney (ii. 214) is <lb/>
            more inclined to seek for the site at some ruins, which occur on <lb/>
            the right bank opposite to the island of Jibbah or Jubbah. This <lb/>
            is evidently, at the present moment, a position that is not satisfac­ <lb/>
            torily determined.</p>
          <p>FIELD OF REVIEW IN BABYLONIA.—Cyrus is described as pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding through Babylonia, three days' march, a distance of twelve <lb/>
            parasangs; and at the end of the third day's march, he reviewed <lb/>
            his army, both Greeks and Barbarians, in the plain, about mid­ <lb/>
            night; for he expected that with the ensuing dawn the king would <lb/>
            come up with his army to offer him battle.</p>
          <p>The spot at which this review took place would, allowing 3 <lb/>
            geo. miles to the parasang, be 36 miles beyond the Pylae, 32 miles <lb/>
            south of the Wall of Media, 36 miles north of Cunaxa, and 72 <lb/>
            miles north of Babylon. If we allow only 2.5 geo. miles, or place <lb/>
            the Pylæ north of the plain of Babylonia, the distances will be <lb/>
            proportionately diminished. We have, however, a means of deter­ <lb/>
            mining the positioning of the army of Cyrus on the plain of Baby­ <lb/>
            lonia a little more accurately, from the events recorded in the next <lb/>
            day's march.</p>
          <p>TRENCH OF ARTAXERXES.—Cyrus proceeded from the field of re­ <lb/>
            view on the plain of Babylonia, one day's march, a distance of <lb/>
            three parasangs, with all his forces, as well Greek as Barbarian, <lb/>
            drawn up in order of battle; for he expected that on this day the <lb/>
            king would give him battle; as about the middle of the day's <lb/>
            march, there was a deep trench dug; the breadth of it was five <lb/>
            fathoms, and the width three. This ditch extended up through the <lb/>
            plain, to the distance of twelve parasangs, as far as the Wall of <lb/>
            Media. Here are the canals which are supplied from the river <lb/>
            Tigris; there are four of them, each a plethrum in breadth, and <lb/>
            very deep; boats employed in conveying corn sail along them. <lb/>
            They discharge themselves into the Euphrates, are distant from <lb/>
            each other one parasang, and there are bridges over them. Near <lb/>
            the Euphrates was a narrow passage between the river and the <lb/>
            trench, about twenty feet in breadth. This trench the Great King <lb/>
            had made to serve as a defence, when he heard that Cyrus was <lb/>
            marching against him. By this passage Cyrus and his army made <lb/>
            their way, and got within the trench.</p>
          <p>If the trench or ditch, here spoken of, had been a canal drawn <lb/>
            diagonally from the river Tigris, such a canal 36 geo. miles in <lb/>
            length, starting from the N. E. or Tigris end of the Median Wall, <lb/>
            would just touch on the maps attached to the Expedition for the <lb/>
            Survey of the Euphrates and Tigris, the Nahr Isa or Saklawiya <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            canal at or about the ruins of Sifairah, ancient Sippara. But <lb/>
            there seems no reason to suppose that it was a canal. Xenophon <lb/>
            appears to distinguish this trench or ditch from the four canals <lb/>
            derived from the river Tigris which he describes in the same para­ <lb/>
            graph. This, however, may be open to doubt. In such a situation <lb/>
            a trench or ditch mignt naturally be supposed to be full of water. <lb/>
            But whichever may be the case, it is not said that it was drawn <lb/>
            from the Tigris, but merely that it extended upwards to the Me­ <lb/>
            dian Wall. Now a distance of 36 geo. miles laid down on the <lb/>
            Expedition map from a central portion of the Median Wall, would <lb/>
            carry the trench to the Abu Gharib country, somewhere about <lb/>
            where the Nahr Malka or Malik has its origin. This would place <lb/>
            the field of review in the same region, some seven or eight miles to <lb/>
            the northward, and would lead us to suppose, as would be most <lb/>
            naturally the case, that the four canals were drawn from the great <lb/>
            overflow of the Tigris near Accad, called Al Hur, and from the <lb/>
            Tigris itself between that and Al Ghirarah, in the very line in fact <lb/>
            of Colonel Chesney's proposed line of communication. All the com­ <lb/>
            mentators on Xenophon have found great difficulty in admitting <lb/>
            the historian's accuracy in this point, because he differs from other <lb/>
            authorities, as Herodotus, Diodorus, Arrian, Pliny, and Ammianus, <lb/>
            in making the canals flow from the Tigris; all others describing <lb/>
            them as flowing from the Euphrates. But this difficulty loses its <lb/>
            force, when we consider that the alluvial plain between the two <lb/>
            rivers is so level that it merely requires to alter the diagonal direc­ <lb/>
            tion of a canal to determine which way its waters shall flow, and <lb/>
            thus the marsh of Al Hur is flooded at one season by the Tigris, <lb/>
            at another by the Euphrates through the Isa canal. Thus also <lb/>
            the Isa, Nahr Malik and other canals flow from the Euphrates to <lb/>
            the Tigris, while the Shat al Hai flows from tke Tigris to the <lb/>
            Euphrates. It is probable that, at the time of Artaxerxes, the <lb/>
            usual canals may have also flowed from Euphrates to Tigris, and <lb/>
            that the four canals of Xenophon described as only 2½ or 3 miles <lb/>
            from one another, were exceptions to the Nile, and drawn from the <lb/>
            marsh of Accad and the Tigris, above the canals of Babylon itself, <lb/>
            which may have flowed from the Euphrates to the Tigris.</p>
          <p>BATTLE-FIELD OF CUNAXA.—As the king made no attempt at <lb/>
            the trench to prevent the passage of Cyrus's army, it was thought <lb/>
            both by Cyrus and the rest that he had given up the intention of <lb/>
            fighting; so that on the day following Cyrus proceeded on his <lb/>
            march with less caution. This was still more the case on the next <lb/>
            day's march ; when news came that the Great King was approach­ <lb/>
            ing, and the battle so fatal to Cyrus took place.</p>
          <p>We have here an account of short desultory and irregular <lb/>
            marches, which would have brought the allies, according to Colo­ <lb/>
            nel Chesney, to at or near the mounds of Muhammad, 34 or 36 <lb/>
            miles along the river from the Median Wall; but, according to my <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            former estimate of the value of the parasang, nearer to the site <lb/>
            of Imsayab or Mussayib about 15 miles direct, but upwards of <lb/>
            20 by the bends of the river north of Babylon. It is evident <lb/>
            that Cyrus deemed himself very near to Babylon, since he had <lb/>
            almost given up any thoughts of resistance on the part of Artax­ <lb/>
            erxes.</p>
          <p>Xenophon describes the battle fully, but does not mention the <lb/>
            name of the place where it was fought. Plutarch, in his Life of Arta­ <lb/>
            xerxes, has alone preserved it, and states that it was 500 stadia from <lb/>
            Babylon. This would make it fifty miles north of Babylon. <lb/>
            Xenophon, however, says that the distance from the field of battle <lb/>
            to Babylon was only 360 stadia, or 36 miles, a distance which <lb/>
            would tally best with that of the before-mentioned mounds of <lb/>
            Muhammad.</p>
          <p>MOUND, ON PLAIN OF BABYLONIA.—The night of the battle, the <lb/>
            Greeks pursued the Persians as far as a certain village, where they <lb/>
            hailed; for above the village was a hill, upon which the king's <lb/>
            troops had checked their flight. The hill here alluded to appears <lb/>
            to have been one of the numerous artificial mounds, topes, or tells, <lb/>
            sometimes sepulchrai sometimes heaps of ruin, which abound on <lb/>
            the plain of Babylonia. The word used to designate the hill is <lb/>
            sufficiently descriptive, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γηλοφος</foreign>, a compound of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γη</foreign>, earth, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λοφοι</foreign>, <lb/>
            hill, mound, or tumulus, “ a heap of earth."</p>
          <p>It is the more important to establish this fact, as there are no <lb/>
            natural hills on the plain of Babylonia; and therefore the mention <lb/>
            made by Xenophon of a hill at this place, has led the distinguished <lb/>
            traveller, Baillie Fraser, to consider it as furnishing evidence of <lb/>
            the battle having been fought to the north of the Median Wall.</p>
          <p>BABYLONIAN VILLAGES.—As soon as a retreat had been decided <lb/>
            upon between the Greeks and the Barbarians, and the line of route <lb/>
            to be followed determined by Ariaeus, they started on a long day's <lb/>
            journey to certain villages, the position of which would be in a great <lb/>
            measure determined by a more satisfactory conclusion as to the <lb/>
            site of Cunaxa. Colonel Chesney places these villages on the Abu <lb/>
            Gharib or Nahr Sarsar of Abulfeda, near the extensive mounds <lb/>
            and ruins of Kusli or Sindiyah.</p>
          <p>The direction of the next march is not given, but it is stated <lb/>
            that the army met with ditches and canals, so full of water, that <lb/>
            they could not cross without bridges; but they made crossings of <lb/>
            the palm-trees which had fallen, and others which they cut down. <lb/>
            There is every reason to believe from this statement that the <lb/>
            Greeks were led into the interior of Babylonia, and Clearchus ap­ <lb/>
            pears justly to have suspected that the ditches had been filled with <lb/>
            water purposely, as it was not the season for irrigating the land. <lb/>
            At last they arrived at some villages, where was plenty of corn, <lb/>
            hnd wine made from dates, and where it would appear they re­ <lb/>
            mained twenty-three or twenty-four days.</p><pb n="296"/>
            
          <p>WAI.L OF MEDIA.—At length, after marching three days, they <lb/>
            arrived at the Wall of Media, as it is called, and passed to the <lb/>
            other side of it. This wall was built of burnt bricks, laid in bitu­ <lb/>
            men ; it was twenty feet in thickness, and a hundred in height, <lb/>
            and the length of it was said to be twenty parasangs; and it was <lb/>
            not far distant from Babylon.</p>
          <p>“ Not the least remarkable of the discoveries," says the Rev. J. <lb/>
            F. Macmichael in the Appendix to his Xenophon," which of late <lb/>
            years have marked the progress of geographical inquiry in this <lb/>
            most interesting—but, till of late, unexplored—region, is the actual <lb/>
            existence at the present time of an ancient wall stretching across <lb/>
            Mesopotamia at the head of the Babylonian plain. Mr. Ross, <lb/>
            who first examined it at its eastern terminus, in 1836, describes it <lb/>
            under the name of Khalu or Sidd Nimrud, (wall or embankment of <lb/>
            Nimrod.) and as a straight wall 25 long paces thick, and from 35 <lb/>
            to 40 feet high, running S. W. J N. as far as the eye could reach, <lb/>
            to two mounds called Ramelah, (Sifairah, Ainsw. p. 81-2,) on the <lb/>
            Euphrates, some hours above Felujah.—The eastern extremity <lb/>
            was built of the small pebbles of the country, cemented with lime <lb/>
            of great tenacity; and farther inland, his Bedwin guides told him <lb/>
            it was built of brick, and in some places worn down level with <lb/>
            the desert,—and was built by Nimrod to keep off the people of <lb/>
            Nineveh, with whom he had an implacable feud. (Journal of It. <lb/>
            Geog. S. ix. p. 446.) It was further examined by Captain Lynch, <lb/>
            and its eastern extremity determined to be in lat. 34° 3'30", and <lb/>
            long. 21' 50" W. of Baghdad. (Ibid. p. 472.)</p>
          <p>" The identity of this wall with Xenophon's Wall of Media was <lb/>
            assumed by the explorers tacitly, but with strong ground of pro­ <lb/>
            bability. Of the great antiquity of the Sidd Nimrud there can be <lb/>
            no question; record of its origin there is none, except local tra­ <lb/>
            dition assigning it to Nimrod. On the other hand, the continued <lb/>
            existence of a wall (corresponding to the Median) from Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon’s age down to comparatively recent times, is attested by a <lb/>
            chain of scattered notices in later writers. Such a wall is men­ <lb/>
            tioned by Eratosthenes, (in the third century B. C., quoted by <lb/>
            Strabo ii. l, and xi. 14,) as <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ τὴς Σεμιράμιδος διατειχισμα</foreign>, having its <lb/>
            eastern terminus at or near Opis. Again, its western terminus <lb/>
            was noticed (in a state of ruin) by Amm. Marcellinus (363 A. <unclear>D</unclear>.) <lb/>
            at Macepracta on the Euphrates, near the head of a canal, which <lb/>
            he distinguishes from the Naha Malcha, (Nahr Malik,) doubtless <lb/>
            the Saklawiyeh, a few miles north of which is the S. W. extremity <lb/>
            of the Sidd Nimrud."</p>
          <p>.. Their identity is further attested by their occupying the same <lb/>
            general position as a partition-line between the rocky desert of <lb/>
            Arabia and the fertile alluvial plain of Babylonia :the Sidd Nim­ <lb/>
            rud, for all practical purposes, distinguishes the Babylonian plain <lb/>
            from the hilly and rocky country. (Ainsw. p. 82, note 2.)—And <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            that a like position must be assigned to the Median Wall is strong­ <lb/>
            ly indicated by the name it bears, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μηδιας τεἵχος</foreign>. For the <lb/>
            Medes under Cyaxares had conquered all Assyria up to Babylonia, <lb/>
            a tract which, in Herodotus, includes the entire canal distinct, (i. <lb/>
            193,) and in Xenophon commences where the desert of Arabia <lb/>
            terminates—at or near a place called Pylae, (i. 5. 5,) where, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, we should look for the western terminus of the Median <lb/>
            Wall.”</p>
          <p>From a consideration of the different circumstances detailed by <lb/>
            Xenophon of the first retrograde steps taken after the battle of <lb/>
            Cunaxa, I was induced to believe that Tissaphernes, having arrived <lb/>
            with his army and the guides, marched, as Xenophon expresses it, <lb/>
            as if he designed to return home; that he led the Greeks three <lb/>
            days' march, or about thirty-six miles, towards Sifairah, at which <lb/>
            point he turned round, and conducted them through the Wall into <lb/>
            Sitacene, thus leaving them in perplexity with regard to the rela­ <lb/>
            tions of that rich and fertile province to the city of Babylon. <lb/>
            (Trav. in the Track, &amp;c., p. 108-9.)</p>
          <p>The following is the account given by Colonel Chesney of this <lb/>
            the first portion of the Katabasis, and which is so difficult to un­ <lb/>
            derstand. “In taking a northerly direction from the presumed <lb/>
            position of the camp, it would be necessary to cross the Nalir <lb/>
            Malka; and on account of this obstruction, as well as the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of an enemy, the distance made would scarcely exceed ten <lb/>
            miles. Fatigued by the march, and without sustenance, a slight <lb/>
            circumstance was sufficient to cause a tumult, and almost a panic, <lb/>
            among the Greeks. The panic was, however, speedily calmed by <lb/>
            the ingenuity of Clearchus, and at day-break he marched with the <lb/>
            intention of becoming the assailant. This bold manœuvre led to <lb/>
            a negotiation with the king on equal terms, and guides were in <lb/>
            consequence appointed to conduct the Greeks across the Nahr <lb/>
            Sersar, and its affluents, which intersect this part of the country. <lb/>
            These cuts appear to have been filled with water, but the difficulties <lb/>
            were overcome by cutting down the palm-trees to make bridges, <lb/>
            in which operation Clearchus set the example; and the army <lb/>
            reached the intended halting-place in some villages probably not <lb/>
            more than ten miles from the preceding station. These were <lb/>
            abundantly provided with corn, vinegar, and wine made from dates <lb/>
            After spending about twenty-three days in negotiations, having <lb/>

            tained supplies, the Greeks, the troops of Ariacus, and those of <lb/>
            the king under Tissaphernes, commenced what seemed a peace­ <lb/>
            able march, although certain circumstances attending it gave <lb/>
            rise to suspicion, and some precautions were adopted in conse­ <lb/>
            quence by the Greeks. In three days, probably, taking, as in the <lb/>
            preceding march, a westerly direction, in order to round the marshes <lb/>
            and inundations near Akar Kuf, the armies came up to and de <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            parted from the Median Wall into the interior. This wall, whose <lb/>
            remains are described in Xenophon, was of bricks, and once 100 <lb/>
            feet high and 20 feet thick : it is still to be traced, with its towers <lb/>
            and ditch, running south-westward from the Tigris, nearly opposite <lb/>
            Kadisiyeh, to the Euphrates, near Felujah, a distance of forty­ <lb/>
            two or forty-three miles."</p>
          <p>This view of the subject is illustrated by the following note. <lb/>
            "The translation of this passage of Xenophon, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφικοντο πρὸς τὀ <lb/>
            Μηδιας τεῑχος, καὶ παρη̃λθον αυτου εισω</foreign>, (Anabasis, lib. ii. cap. iv.,) has <lb/>
            been much discussed and variously rendered. In Allpress's Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon. p. 80, the army is made to arrive at, and pass along within, <lb/>
            the Median Wall; which translation is also given in the Anabasis <lb/>
            of Xenophon, by Charles Anthon, L.L. D. William Tegg and Co. <lb/>
            Cheapside (By passing within this wall, Dr. Anthon does not <lb/>
            appear to understand keeping to the south side of it, but passing <lb/>
            through it, for he says in a note, (p. 157 of the 1st edition,) Ains­ <lb/>
            worth thinks that this going throughtheMedian Wall, &amp;c. W. F.A.); <lb/>
            by the Rev. Dr. Butcher, Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin; as <lb/>
            well as by Schneider, who, in a note on this passage, condemns <lb/>
            Halbkardt for translating it, 'Kamen sie zur Medischen Mauer, <lb/>
            nnd setzen nu<foreign xml:lang="grc">̆</foreign>n jenseit derselben ihren Marsch fort.'"</p>
          <p>Viger, in his Greek Idioms, also quotes an instance from Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, where the verb occurring in the passage in question joined <lb/>
            with a substantive in the genitive case, signifies “departure from" <lb/>
            or deflection; and Donnegan’s Greek Lexicon gives <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴσω</foreign> as an ad­ <lb/>
            verb, with the signification of “ in the interior," “ inside," or with­ <lb/>
            in, which renderings of the passage are in conformity with the <lb/>
            relative geographical positions of the Median Wall and Sitace, <lb/>
            On the other hand, Hutchinson, in his edition of Xenophon, p. 139, <lb/>
            (Hutchinson’s translation is “ intr<foreign xml:lang="grc">ά</foreign>que eum ingressi sunt,” p. 145, <lb/>
            Oxford edition, 1745. W.F.A.,) and Mitford, History of Greece, <lb/>
            vol. iv. p. IS!:!, state that the Greeks came up to and passed through <lb/>
            the Median Wall; and this interpretation has been followed by <lb/>
            Bishop Thirlwall, in his History of Greece, vol. iv. p. 335, cd. Lon <lb/>
            don, 18-17, since he conceives, in accordance with Passow, in his <lb/>
            Greek Lexicon, that when joined with a verb of motion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴσω</foreign> must <lb/>
            bear the signification of to the inside, not on the inside. The bishop <lb/>
            of St. David's considers that Schneider's condemnation of Halb­ <lb/>
            kardt arises solely from the great difficulty of reconciling his trans <lb/>
            lation with the geographical position of Sitace, but that the philo. <lb/>
            logical difficulty thus raised by Schneider, is quite as great as the <lb/>
            geographical difficulty of the ether. The same opinion appears to <lb/>
            be held by other Grecian scholars; the Right Rev. Dr. Wilson, <lb/>
            Lord Bishop of Cork and Cloyne, and the Rev. Dr. Mac-Donnell, <lb/>
            Senior Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, among the number.” <lb/>
            (Vol. ii. p. 219 et seq.)</p>
          <p>To this array of authorities I may add that of the Rev. J. F. <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            Macmichael, Head-master of the Grammar School, Burton on Trent, <lb/>
            who says, “ We gather from the narrative, that they commenced <lb/>
            the retreat (after joining Ariaeus) in a northerly direction, (ii. 2. 8,) <lb/>
            and continued it with Tissaphernes—who was journeying home­ <lb/>
            wards (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ώς εις οικον ἀπιών</foreign>, iv. 8)—far enough in this direction to <lb/>
            pass out of Babylonia ; for on the sixth day of the retreat, they <lb/>
            passed within the Median Wall (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρη̃λθον εἵσω αὐτοῡ</foreign>, iv. 12)—an <lb/>
            expression which can only signify an entry through it into Baby­ <lb/>
            lonia. (Cf. 1. iv. 4, 5—vii. 16.) The line of route suggested by <lb/>
            Mr. Ainsworth, viz. back by Pylae, and then for some distance on <lb/>
            the, N. side of the Wall, is apparently the only one consistent with <lb/>
            the data, geographical and historical, of the problem,” P. 339.</p>
          <p>Apart, however, from the respect due to Colonel Cliesney's views <lb/>
            of the matter—it remains quite an open question, whether a north- <lb/>
            westerly route, to avoid the Hur or marshes of Akka Knf, would <lb/>
            not have taken the Greeks to a position so near to the Median <lb/>
            Wall as to be described by them as within that wall, before they <lb/>
            turned to the eastward towards Sitaee,</p>
          <p>SITACE.—From the Wall of Media they proceeded, in two days' <lb/>
            march, the distance of eight parasangs; crossing two canals, the <lb/>
            one by a permanent bridge, the other by a temporary one, formed <lb/>
            of seven boats. These canals were supplied from the river Tigris ; <lb/>
            and from one to the other of them were cut ditches across the <lb/>
            country, the first of considerable size, and the next smaller; and <lb/>
            at last diminutive drains, such as are cut in Greece through the <lb/>
            panic fields. They then arrived at the Tigris ; near which there <lb/>
            was a large and populous city, called Sitace, distant from the <lb/>
            banks of the river only fifteen stadia.</p>
          <p>Xenophon, by repeating the circumstance here, that the canals <unclear/> <lb/>
            ere derived from the Tigris, lends additional weight to his prior <lb/>
            statement, that at that time the northerly part of the plain of <lb/>
            Babylonia was watered from the Tigris. The Arabs of Balad in. <lb/>
            formed Captain Lynch, that there were anciently two canals, which <lb/>
            ran across from the Tigris to the Euphrates—one from Istabalat, <lb/>
            called Jalilu-i-Darb, near where the Dnjail, "Little Tigris," leaves <lb/>
            the Tigris, and one that ran from the Dujail itself, called Bu Khai­ <lb/>
            mah. (Journal of It. G. S., vol. ix. p. 474.)</p>
          <p>There are also in the same district the remains of several canals <lb/>
            which were drawn in olden time from the river Tigris to flow back <lb/>
            into the same river. Among the most remarkable are the Dujail, or <lb/>
            Dijail,or Little Tigris; the Shat Aidha and the Ishakli. Akbara, <lb/>
            a favourite residence of the Khalifs, was on the Shat Aidha.</p>
          <p>Mr. Ross sought for Sitace at Shiriat at Baidha, or the White <lb/>
            River, where there are extensive ruins, consisting of mounds and <lb/>
            embankments, and the dry ditch of a canal extending northwards <lb/>
            some miles, and westwards almost to the colossal ruin of Akka Knf <lb/>
            or Accad—the only remaining examine of an Assyrian or Baby- <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            Ionian ruin not converted by the lapse of time and disintegration <lb/>
            of materials into a tel or mound.</p>
          <p>Having been led to reject the identification of the river Physcus <lb/>
            with the modern Athaim, as surmised by Mr. Ross and Captain <lb/>
            Lynch, upon the grounds advanced by Colonel Rawlinson, that if <lb/>
            the Katur or Nahrawan canals existed in the time of Xenophon, <lb/>
            they would represent the Physcus and not the Athaim, I was <lb/>
            further induced, by considering the incompatibility of the distance <lb/>
            between Shiriat al Baidha and Opis at the confluence of the <lb/>
            Athaim, with that reported by Xenophon, to seek for the ruins of <lb/>
            Sitace at or near the site of Akbara. Colonel Chesney has, by <lb/>
            placing Opis at or a little above Kayim or Kaim, and close to the <lb/>
            head of a second or lower branch of the Nahr-wan, called the <lb/>
            Nahr al Risas, and which he identifies with the Physcus, got over <lb/>
            this difficulty.</p>
          <p>"In taking the distance backward," says Colonel Chesney, vol. <lb/>
            ii. p. 221, “ at the average rate of the march through Asia Minor, <lb/>
            or 2.608 geographical miles per parasang along the Upper Tigris, <lb/>
            (at the favourable season of the year,) from the Known point of the <lb/>
            river Zab, there would be 130 geographical miles for the fifty <lb/>
            parasangs to Opis, which places that city a little above Kaim, and <lb/>
            close to the head of the Nahrawan, instead of being, as before sup­ <lb/>
            posed, some miles lower down near the river Athaim. Twenty <lb/>
            parasangs, or fifty-two geographical miles, from the latter, the anci­ <lb/>
            ent bed of the Tigris, would place Sitace about ten miles north- <lb/>
            west of Baghdad, near Sheriat el Beidha, the presumed site of the <lb/>
            Sitace of Xenophon."</p>
          <p>This identification, it will be observed, establishes the correspond­ <lb/>
            ence of the old bed of the river Tigris—the Shat Aidha—with the <lb/>
            Tigris of Xenophon.</p>
          <p>OPIS.—From the Tigris, the Greeks are described as proceeding <lb/>
            in four days' march, a distance of twenty parasangs, to the river <lb/>
            Physcus, which was a plethrum in breadth, and over which was a <lb/>
            bridge. Here was situate a large town, called Opis.</p>
          <p>The discussion of the true positioning of Sitace involved, it has <lb/>
            ocen seen, a knowledge of the site of Opis, which was situated at <lb/>
            the issue of the Katur, or Nahrawan, from the Tigris.* The Rev. <lb/>
            Mr. Macmichael remarks upon this identification of a river with a <lb/>
            canal, that it is not improbably the third instance in the work of <lb/>
            Xenophon. “ Ainsworth," he says in the Appendix, (p. 339,) "fol­ <lb/>
            lowing Colonel Rawlinson, who is inclined to identify the Physcus <lb/>
            with the ancient canal, Katur or Nahrawan, (compare the case of <lb/>
            the Daradax and Masca, called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποταμοί</foreign>, 1. iv. 10, n., and v. 4; the <note type="footnote"> * Colonel Chesney's Al Kayim is situated, it has been observed, on the <lb/>
            Nahr al Risas, a tributary to the Katur or Nahrawan; the ruins of Dura, and <lb/>
            those called now Old Baghdad, are upon the Katur or Nahrawan proper. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            breadth also, (a plethrum,) which is uniformly that of canals, (v. 1; <lb/>
            vii. 15,) somewhat favour the supposition."</p>
          <p>Opis was a city of considerable commercial importance at one <lb/>
            time, having, according to the learned Dr. Vincent, risen into emi. <lb/>
            nence upon the decline of the Assyrian cities on the Tigris, and <lb/>
            then again decayed in its turn, as Seleucia, and Apamea, the erea- <lb/>
            Lion of the Seleucidae, became conspicuous ; hence its positioning <lb/>
            is of great interest to comparative geography generally.</p>
          <p>VILLAGES OF PARYSATIS.—From Opis the Greeks proceeded <lb/>
            through Media, six days' march through a desert country, a dis­ <lb/>
            tanqe of thirty parasangs, when they arrived at the villages of <lb/>
            Parysatis, the mother of Cyrus and the king.</p>
          <p>At 2.608 geographical miles for each of the thirty parasangs, or <lb/>
            78.24 geographical miles, the villages in question would have been <lb/>
            situated, according to Colonel Chesney, (ii. 222,) about three miles <lb/>
            beyond the Lesser Zab — a river concerning the existence of <lb/>
            which Xenophon is as silent as he was regarding the Lake of <lb/>
            Antioch and its tributaries.</p>
          <p>The position of these villages, according to the distance stated in <lb/>
            the text, would, says Dr. Anthon, (note to Xenophon, p. 163,) both <lb/>
            in Lynch's and in Rich's maps, fall pretty nearly at the position <lb/>
            marked Tel Kunus in the first, and Tel Geloos in the second. <lb/>
            This is the same identification as in the “ Travels in the Track." <lb/>
            It is however over-estimated, being laid down in the maps, in­ <lb/>
            stead of as in other cases corrected for the difficulties of road, <lb/>
            which in most cases render my estimate of 3 geo. miles equal to <lb/>
            not more than 2.5 on the map, making them really of the same <lb/>
            value as accorded by Rennell, Colonel Chesney, Hamilton, and <lb/>
            Layard.</p>
          <p>CAENAE.—From the villages of Parysatis the Greeks advanced <lb/>
            in a march of five days more through the desert, a distance of <lb/>
            twenty parasangs, having the Tigris on their left. At the end of <lb/>
            the first day's march, there was situate on the opposite bank of the <lb/>
            river, a large and opulent city, called Caenae, whence the Barba­ <lb/>
            rians brought over, on rafts made of hide, a supply of bread, cheese, <lb/>
            and wine.</p>
          <p>Captain Lynch having found some ruins with a canal called <lb/>
            Senn, not far from the embouchure of the Great Zab on the oppo­ <lb/>
            site side of the Tigris, I was induced to identify the Gaenae of the <lb/>
            Greeks with that spot, puzzled however at the same time to iden­ <lb/>
            tify this site with the Scena of Strabo, and which according to the <lb/>
            Amasian geographer was a remarkable city—the capital of the <lb/>
            Seenite Arabs — eighteen schaeni or one hundred and eight milt.! <lb/>
            from Seleucia, and with a canal which was carried thence to the <lb/>
            confines of Babylonia.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the difficulty of getting a canal through tho <lb/>
            hilly ranges south of Kalah Shirgat, still, considering the correc­ <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            lion given to the distances by Colonel Chesney, I am inclined to <lb/>
            suppose that the site must be the same as the ruins at the last­ <lb/>
            mentioned place, and not exactly, as Colonel Chesney has it, at the <lb/>
            ruins of the Ur of the Persians, which he says arc three or four <lb/>
            miles below Shirkat—or Toprak Kalahsi. (ii. p. 222.)</p>
          <p>Kalah Shirgat, since the time when I first visited it in company <lb/>
            with Layard, in 1840, has been the scene of many most remark­ <lb/>
            able and interesting discoveries in Assyrian Archaeology, made by <lb/>
            that most successful explorer.</p>
          <p>Among other monuments of olden time, a cylinder, a splendid <lb/>
            relic, containing 800 lines of beautiful writing, at least 100 years <lb/>
            older than the oldest monument hitherto discovered in Assyria, <lb/>
            was found here. It was, when found, broken into a hundred frag­ <lb/>
            ments, and in some parts even reduced to powder; but the whole <lb/>
            bas been carefully joined together, and barely a dozen lines lost.</p>
          <p>Colonel Rawlinson states (Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, vol. <lb/>
            xv. p. xvi. et seq.) that it contains the bulletins of Tiglath Pile­ <lb/>
            ser 1., a king who is mentioned in the annals of Assur-akh-pal, <lb/>
            as a remote ancestor; and as Divanuras, the builder of Calah, must, <lb/>
            Colonel Rawlinson thinks, intervene between the connected series <lb/>
            and this king, and as there is no mention on the cylinder either of <lb/>
            Calah or Nineveh; the Colonel is led to believe that the capital of <lb/>
            the empire at that early period, that is, before the building of <lb/>
            Nineveh, was Kilch Shirgat, as he spells it, itself, and which is <lb/>
            everywhere on the cylinder named Assur, as it is also in the well- <lb/>
            known sitting figure obtained from the same place by Layard, and <lb/>
            now in the British Museum.</p>
          <p>This ancient and pre-Ninevite capital of the Assyrian empire <lb/>
            being then named Assur, was also, according to Colonel Rawlinson, <lb/>
            the Allasar of Genesis, of which Arioch was the king. It is also <lb/>
            the Tel Assur of the Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resell; <lb/>
            and instead, therefore, of Resell being between Nineveh and Calah, <lb/>
            it should be Calah, which was between Nineveh and Resen. “ I <lb/>
            consider,” adds the Colonel, "these three sites to be now determin­ <lb/>
            ately fixed—Nineveh at Nebbi Yunus, Calah at Nimrud, and <lb/>
            Resen at Shirgat."</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding such high authority, I cannot help feeling <lb/>
            that there will yet be found no reason for thus forcing the reading <lb/>
            of the Mosaic record. The term Assur has been found at Nimrud <lb/>
            as well as at Shirgat.* And it is very likely to apply to the coun­ <note type="footnote"> * Ross (Jour. It. G. S. vol. ix. p. 451) calls it Kalah Sherkat. Rich, <lb/>

            to be the case, Nimrud is ever identified by satisfactory paleogra­ <lb/>
            phic research with Resen, and Kalah Shirgat with Calah, the <lb/>
            Biblical expression will be found to be correct. Colonel Rawlinson <lb/>
            has himself been induced to change his opinions with progressive <lb/>
            inquiry, he having in 1839 identified Calah with Holwan near Sar <lb/>
            Puli Zohab (Journ. 'of Roy. Geo. Soc. ix. p. 35 et seq.); and in <lb/>
            1849 or 50, identified the same place with Nimrud. (Journ. of Roy. <lb/>

          <p>In the “Memoir on Cuneiform Inscriptions," published in the <lb/>
            eleventh volume of the Jour. Roy. Asiat. Soc., Colonel Rawlinson <lb/>
            speaks of Athur-a and Athur-aya as the cuneiform expression for <lb/>
            our Assyria. He then adds in a note, the Arabic geographers <lb/>
            always give the title of Athur to the great ruined capital near the <lb/>
            mouth of the Upper Zab. If so, that place is just as likely to be <lb/>
            the Tel Assur of the Targums as Kalah Shirgat, and consequently, <lb/>
            as far as any identification founded on such data will go-the <lb/>
            same as Resen.</p>
          <p>RIVER ZABATUS. Soon after, they arrived at the river Zabatus, <lb/>
            the breadth of which was four plethra. The river Zab is too well <lb/>
            known to detain us long. It is in the present day called Zab Ala. <lb/>
            Thevenot and Tavernier called it Zarb and Zarbe. It is the Lycus <lb/>
            of the older geographers, with the exception of Pliny, who calls it <lb/>
            Zerbis, and Marcellinus, who mispells it Diaba. The Zab is one of <lb/>
            the principal confluents of the Tigris, and at certain seasons of <lb/>
            the year brings down a larger body of water than the main <lb/>
            stream.</p>
          <p>There are many tels or mounds of ruin on the south side of the <lb/>
            Zab near its confluence with the Tigris, in the plain of Shumanuk, <lb/>
            or Shomanok, now tenanted by the Tai Arabs, some of which the <lb/>
            indefatigable Layard caused to be excavated by the Jehesh Arabs <lb/>
            under his pay. Among the most remarkable of these is the lofty <lb/>
            mound of Kashaf or Keshaf, an artificial platform of earth and <lb/>
            unbaked bricks resting upon limestone rock, and crowned by the <lb/>
            remains of a deserted fort, — the mounds and ruins called Muk­ <lb/>
            hamur or Mokhamour, in the pastoral plains between the Kara­ <lb/>
            juk hills and the Tigris—the mound of Abu Jerdah—that of Abu <lb/>
            Shitha or Abou Sheetha, and eight others enumerated by Layard, <lb/>
            all indicative of a large and prosperous population in olden times.</p>
          <p>Speaking more particularly of the mound called Abu-Shitha, <lb/>
            Layard says, (p. 225,) " Near this ruin, perhaps at its very foot, <lb/>
            must have taken place an event which led to one of the most cele­ <lb/>
            brated episodes of ancient history. Here were treacherously <lb/>
            seized Clearchus, Proxenus, Menon, Agias, and Socrates ; and <lb/>
            Xenophon, elected to the command of the Greek Auxiliaries, com­ <lb/>
            menced the ever-memorable retreat of the Ten Thousand. The camp <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            of Tissaphernes, dappled with its many-coloured tents, and glitter­ <lb/>
            ing with golden arms and silken standards, the gorgeous display of <lb/>
            Persian pomp, probably stood on the Kordereh, (Kur Darah, valley <lb/>
            of Cyrus ?) between Abou Shcetha and the Kasr. The Greeks <lb/>
            having taken the lower road to the west of the Karaehok range, <lb/>
            through a plain even then as now a desert, turned to the east, and <lb/>
            crossed the spur of the mountain, where we had recently seen the <lb/>
            tents of the Howar, in order to reach the fords of the Zab."</p>
          <p>PASS OF THE ZABATUS.— Misfortunes awaited the Greeks at <lb/>
            this point, and active hostilities ensuing upon the passage of the <lb/>
            Zab, that passage was deferred for a short time. The Persians <lb/>
            having been described by Xenophon as taking up a position at <lb/>
            the ford over the Zab, I was induced to identify the place of pass­ <lb/>
            age, not withstanding its distance from the confluence of the Zab <lb/>
            and Tigris, with the ford at Kulak Kupar, which is beyond the <lb/>
            ferry called Kulak Izidi, or the pass of the Yezidees.</p>
          <p>“ The fact of their leaving the Tigris," says the Rev. Mr. Mac­ <lb/>
            michael in the Appendix to the Xenophon, (p. 340,) “ and marcit­ <lb/>
            ing up the Zab before crossing it, though not expressly stated, la <lb/>
            sufliciently indicated by the remark that they arrived at the Tigris <lb/>
            near Larissa (iii. 4. 6) after two marches from the ford. It is <lb/>
            also to be added to this, that it seems probable that they crossed <lb/>
            above the junction of the Khazir su or Bumadus, as they are de­ <lb/>
            scribed as passing on their way to Larissa, a valley formed by a <lb/>
            torrent. ”</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney makes the Greeks cross the Zab near its con­ <lb/>
            fluence, “ probably in boats," (ii. 222). Layard, who has examined <lb/>
            the country about the confluence of the two rivers with great care, <lb/>
            says, “ the ford by which the Greeks crossed the great Zab <lb/>
            (Zabates) may, I think, be accurately determined. It is still the <lb/>
            principal ford in this part of the river, and must, from the nature <lb/>
            of the bed of the stream, have been so from the earliest periods. <lb/>
            It is about twenty-five miles from the confluence of the Zab and <lb/>
            Tigris. A march of twenty-five stadia, or nearly three miles, in <lb/>
            the direction of Larissa, would hive brought them to the Ghazer <lb/>
            or Burmadus; and this stream was, I have little doubt, the deep <lb/>
            valley formed by the torrent where Mithridates, venturing to <lb/>
            attack the retreating army, was signally defeated." (Discov. in the <lb/>
            Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, p. 60.)</p>
          <p>Layard is wrong in saying that “ Mr. Ainsworth would take <lb/>
            the Greeks up to the modern ferry, where there could never have <lb/>
            been a ford." I said distinetly (Trav. in the Track, &amp;c., p. 119) <lb/>
            the actual ferry is at Kelek Izedi, (or Kulak Izidi,) but beyond <lb/>
            this, at Kelek Gopar, (Kulak Kupar,) the river is said to be ford­ <lb/>
            able at favourable seasons. This Mr. Rassam and myself ascer­ <lb/>
            tained on the spot. As it appears, nowever, that there is a ford <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            lower down the river, and yet above the confluence of the Khazir­ <lb/>
            su, it is evidently useless to go higher up the river in search of a <lb/>
            spot for the passage of the Greeks.</p>
          <p>LARISSA.—Having crossed the Zabatus, the Greeks were only <lb/>
            enabled, owing to the hostile front presented by Mithridates, the <lb/>
            satrap of the new district they had entered upon, to advance some <lb/>
            five and twenty stadia to some villages on the plain. The next <lb/>
            morning they started earlier than usual on account of the ravine, <lb/>
            but the Persians did not attack them till they had crossed the <lb/>
            torrent, and being driven back, the Greeks travelled the rest of the <lb/>
            day without molestation, arriving at the river Tigris, where was a <lb/>
            large deserted city, the name of which was Larissa, and which the <lb/>
            Modes had formerly inhabited.</p>
          <p>The identity of the Larissa of Xenophon with the ruins of Nim­ <lb/>
            rud, the scene of Layard's most remarkable discoveries, appearing <lb/>
            to be undisputed by those who have written since the publication <lb/>
            of the " Travels in the Track," it only remains to notice some facts <lb/>
            that have sprung out of more recent researches.</p>
          <p>The learned Boehart first advanced the supposition that this <lb/>
            Assyrian city was the same as the primeval city, called Resen in the <lb/>
            Bible, and that the Greeks having asked its name, were answered. <lb/>
            At Resen, the article being prefixed, and from whence they made <lb/>
            Larissa, in an easy transposition. I adopted this presumed identity <lb/>
            as extremely probable, and Colonel Chesney (ii. 223) has done the <lb/>
            same—not as an established fact, but as a presumed identity.</p>
          <p>Layard was satisfied with looking upon Nimrud as a quarter of <lb/>
            Nineveh. " That the ruins at Nimroud were within the preeincts <lb/>
            of Nineveh," he says in Nineveh and its Remains, (vol. ii. p. 243,) <lb/>
            " if they do not alone mark its site, appears to be proved by Strabo, <lb/>
            and by Ptolemy's statement, that the city was on the Lycus, cor­ <lb/>
            roborated by the tradition preserved by the earliest Arab geogra­ <lb/>
            phers. Yakut, and others, mention the ruins of Athur, near Sela­ <lb/>
            miyah, which gave the name of Assyria to the province; and Iun <lb/>
            Said expressly states, that they were those of the city of the As­ <lb/>
            syrian kings who destroyed Jerusalem. They are still called, as it <lb/>
            has been shown, both Athur and Nimroud."</p>
          <p>Certain cuneiform characters represented in Layard's Nineveh <lb/>
            and its Remains, (vol. ii. p. 228, 229,) were, from their frequent <lb/>
            recurrence both in the sculptures and the bricks, supposed to re­ <lb/>
            present the name of Asshur. Dr. Hineks deemed them to repre­ <lb/>
            sent either the name, or an abbreviation of the name, of Athur, <lb/>
            the country of Assyria. " It is possible," Layard remarks upon <lb/>
            this, " that Nineveh, or Athur, may be indiscriminately used in <lb/>
            speaking of the country."</p>
          <p>Athor, or Athyr, has also been read by Dr. Hincks as the name <lb/>
            of the presiding divinity on the monuments of Assyria, somewhat <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            we suppose, in the same way, only wIth more religious feeling <lb/>
            mixed up with it, that Britannia represents Great Britain.</p>
          <p>In 1846, Colonel Rawlinson, speaking of Nimrud, noticed it as <lb/>
            probably the Rehoboth of Scripture, but he added in a note, " I <lb/>
            have no reason for identifying it with Rehoboth, beyond its evident <lb/>
            antiquity, and the attribution of Resen and Calah to other sites. <lb/>
            (Journal of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. x. p. 26.) At this time Colonel <lb/>
            Rawlinson identified Calah with Holwan or Sir Pul-i-Zohab, and <lb/>
            hesen, or Dasen, with Yasin Teppeh in the plain of Shahrizur in <lb/>
            murdistan. (See note to p. 23 op. cit.)</p>
          <p>In 1849, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. xi. p. 10,) Colonel <lb/>
            Rawlinson said, " The Arabic geographers always give the title of <lb/>
            Athur to the great ruined capital near the month of the Upper <lb/>
            Zab. The ruins are now usually known by the name of Nimrud <lb/>
            It would seem highly probable that they represent the Calah of <lb/>
            Genesis, for the Samaritan Pentateuch names this city Lachisa, <lb/>
            which is evidently the same title as the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λαρισσα</foreign> of Xenophon, the <lb/>
            Persian <foreign xml:lang="grc">Υ</foreign> being very usually replaced both in Median and Baby­ <lb/>
            lonian by a guttural."</p>
          <p>In 1850, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. xii.,) Colonel Rawlin. <lb/>
            son added the discovery of a cuneiform inscription bearing the <lb/>
            title Levekh, which lie reads Halukh. "Nimrud," says the distin­ <lb/>
            guished palaeographist, " the great treasure-house which has <lb/>
            furnished us with all the most remarkable specimens of Assyrian <lb/>
            sculpture, although very probably forming one of that group of <lb/>
            cities, which, in the time of the prophet Jonas, wore known by the <lb/>
            common name of Nineveh, has no claim itself, I think, to that <lb/>
            particular appellation. The title by which it is designated on the <lb/>
            bricks and slabs that form its buildings, I read doubtfully as Le­ <lb/>
            vekh, and I suspect this to be the original form of the name which <lb/>
            appears as Calah in Genesis, and Halah in Kings and Chron­ <lb/>
            icles, and which indeed, as the capital of Calaehene, must needs <lb/>
            have occupied some site in the immediate vicinity."</p>
          <p>Lastly, in 1853, (Journ. of Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. xv. p. vi. et seq.,) <lb/>
            Colonel Rawlinson describes the remarkable cylinder before al­ <lb/>
            luded to as found at Kilah Shirgat, which establishes that site to <lb/>
            have been the most ancient capital of the Assyrian empire, and to <lb/>
            have been called Assur as well as Nimrud and Nineveh Proper. <lb/>
            This Assur, wo have seen, he identifies with the Tel Assur of the <lb/>
            Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resen; and instead, there­ <lb/>
            fore, of Resen being between Nineveh and Calah, it should be Ca­ <lb/>
            lah, which was between Nineveh and Resen.</p>
          <p>But, notwithstanding such very high authority, the conclusion <lb/>
            thus arrived at does not appear to be perfectly satisfactory. The <lb/>
            discovery of the expression Levekh, and its analogy in the Samari­ <lb/>
            tan Lachisa and the Greek Larissa, is very curious and very <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            remarkable, but not conclusive. The name Assur, or Athur, <lb/>
            occurs just as frequently in connexion with Nimrud as with Shir­ <lb/>
            gat, and therefore the same argument of its being the Tel Assur of <lb/>
            the Targums, which is used for the Mosaic Resen, would apply to <lb/>
            the one as well as to the other. It is possible to imagine two cities <lb/>
            like Nineveh and Resen to have been within some twenty miles of <lb/>
            one another, but it is not so easy to imagine that in after times <lb/>
            one was in the province of Adiabene, the other in that of Cala­ <lb/>
            chene. This part of the subject will be found discussed at length <lb/>
            in the " Papers of the Syro-Egyptian Society," (vol. i. part ii.).</p>
          <p>The whole question indeed regarding Nineveh and Assur ap­ <lb/>
            pears to be involved in a great deal of philological confusion. It <lb/>
            is evident that the name of the country came from Assur or Athur, <lb/>
            and we cannot therefore feel surprised at finding the name at Ki­ <lb/>
            lah Shirgat, afterwards transposed to Nimrud and to Nineveh, <lb/>
            just as we find the Chaldean priests using it in the present day in <lb/>
            their bibles at Musul or Mausil. It does not appear, therefore, <lb/>
            that any correct data will be derived for naming any of the Assyrian <lb/>
            cities from the presence of this epithet.</p>
          <p>Then again, with regard to Nineveh, it may at one time have <lb/>
            designated one place, at another time another place, according to <lb/>
            where the king took up his abode: and again, it may, in the time <lb/>
            of Jonah, have embraced the whole group of cities, as Colonel <lb/>
            Rawlinson remarks, in Assyria Proper. Layard does not dispute <lb/>
            that the different portions of Nineveh, thus comprehensively viewed, <lb/>
            may have had different names. Much light has already been <lb/>
            thrown upon the history of the different Assyrian cities and edi­ <lb/>
            fices, as well as upon the dwellers therein, and that is quite suf­ <lb/>
            ficient to show that we are as yet only upon the threshold of what <lb/>
            will be eliminated by the labours of our truly zealous and laborious <lb/>
            paleographers and archaeologists.</p>
          <p>Since the above was written, a letter from Colonel Rawlinson <lb/>
            appears in the Athenæum, No. 1381, making mention of the dis­ <lb/>
            covery in the S. E. palace at Nimrud, of a perfect statue of the <lb/>
            god Nebo, with an inscription on the breast, stating that the figure <lb/>
            in question was executed by a certain sculptor of Lakisa or Calah, <lb/>
            and dedicated by him to the Lord Phal-lukha, king of Assyria, and <lb/>
            to his Lady, Sammuramit, Queen of the Palace. In the same in­ <lb/>
            scription the territorial name of Sutgan is mentioned in conjunc­ <lb/>
            tion with that of the city of Calah, being, Colonel Rawlinson says, <lb/>
            the title given by the Samaritan interpreter for the Hebrew of Re­ <lb/>
            hoboth Ir. The Colonel identifies the king and queen here no­ <lb/>
            ticed together with the Belochus and Semiramis of the Greek As­ <lb/>
            syrian lists. He believes Semiramis to have been the daughter of <lb/>
            the king of Medo-Armenia, to have married Phal-lukha, the king <lb/>
            of Armenia, when she changed her name from Atossa to Semi­ <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            ramis, and to have reigned with her husband as joint monarch of <lb/>
            Nineveh in the eighth century before Christ.</p>
          <p>MESPILA.—From Larissa the Greeks are described as proceed­ <lb/>
            mg, in one day's journey, six parasangs, to a large unoccupied for­ <lb/>
            tress, situated near a city, the name of which was Mespila. Upon <lb/>
            the data here given, I identified the fortress with the ruins at <lb/>
            Yarumjah, and Mespila with Nineveh. Colonel Chesncy appears <lb/>
            to coincide in this view of the subject. " That Larissa and Mes­ <lb/>
            pila are represented by the ruins of Nimroud and Kouyunjik," <lb/>
            Layard says, (Nineveh and Babylon, p. Gl,) " no one can reason­ <lb/>
            ably doubt."</p>
          <p>Colonel Rawlinson however says, (Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc. vol. <lb/>
            xii. p. 419,) " It seems to me very possible, that Xenophon's name, <lb/>
            of Mespila may denote Mosul, and not Nineveh." The term Mes­ <lb/>
            pila or Meso-pulai, "middle pass or gates," would certainly appear <lb/>
            to apply to the pass of the river between Musul and Kuyunjik or <lb/>
            Nabbi Yunus, and there may have been ruins on both banks, for <lb/>
            a great mound still exists in Musul, not far from the river, but <lb/>
            there is no evidence of such extensive ruins, as are described by <lb/>
            Xenophon as being at Mespila, having existed on the right bank <lb/>
            of the river, whilst we know they do occur on the left. Rennell <lb/>
            has, however, also conjectured Musul to be derived from Mesulae, <lb/>
            a corruption of Meso-pulai. It does not matter much. Xenophon's <lb/>
            name, no doubt, applied to the pass of the Tigris, and therefore to <lb/>
            Musul and Nineveh, and his description of ruins to the latter.</p>
          <p>VILLAGES BEYOND MESPILA.—The Greeks proceeded from the <lb/>
            pass of the Tigris, one day's journey, a distance of four parasangs, <lb/>
            to some villages where there was plenty of corn. Fertility is the <lb/>
            characteristic of the plain of Nineveh to the present day, and there <lb/>
            are no want of villages. From the data here given, I identified <lb/>
            the particular villages at which the Greeks encamped with Tel <lb/>
            Kaif, an Assyrian mound with a village or small town at its foot. <lb/>
            Colonel Chesney joins me in this identification. Layard, however, <lb/>
            says, " they probably halted near the modern village of Batnai, <lb/>
            between Tel Kef and Tel Eskof, an ancient site exactly four hours, <lb/>
            by the usual caravan road, from Kouyunjik." There is no doubt <lb/>
            that Tel Kaifis not above nine geog. miles from Kuyunjik, and Bat­ <lb/>
            nai is twelve. But this is allowing the full three geog. miles to the <lb/>
            parasang, and that when the Greeks were harassed throughout the <lb/>
            journey by Tissaphernes. Tel Kaif is evidently also an old As­ <lb/>
            syrian site, which is not so certain with respect to Batnai, and I <lb/>
            therefore, considering all the circumstances of the site, prefer the <lb/>
            first identification.</p>
          <p>PALACE AND VILLAGES.—The Greeks remained at the villages <lb/>
            on the Assyrian plain the ensuing day, after which they proceeded <lb/>
            through the open country, five days' march, till thev came to hills, <lb/>
            beyond which was a kind of palace and several villages round it. <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            The first bills that are met with in proceeding northwards from <lb/>
            Assyria to Karduchia, are those which constitute the triple range, <lb/>
            designated as the Jibal Abyad by the Arabs, and Cha Spi by the <lb/>
            Kurds, both signifying white hille," and immediately beyond <lb/>
            them is the castle of Zakhu, with villages around it, like a feudal <lb/>
            castle of olden times. In no part of the journey do the circum­ <lb/>
            stances of the case more closely correspond with Xenophon's de­ <lb/>
            scriptions, especially of the difficulties met with in passing the <lb/>
            hilly range, and the unforeseen opposition they met with in the <lb/>
            now wooded valleys between the ranges.</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney (ii. 224) and Layard (Nineveh and Babylon, <lb/>
            p. 61) both agree with me in this identification. It is remarkable <lb/>
            that Xenophon does not mention the Khabur, which Dr. Grant <lb/>
            confounded with the Chebar of Scripture—the Khabur of Meso­ <lb/>
            potamia-althongh he must have crossed that viver either by a <lb/>
            ford or bridge.</p>
          <p>VILLAGE IN TilE PLAIN.—There being plenty of provisions at <lb/>
            Zakhu, the Greeks remained there three days, and on the fourth <lb/>
            they went down into the plain. Xenophon neglects here to notice <lb/>
            either the Khabur or its tributary the Hazil, both of which the <lb/>
            army must apparently have crossed. They are reported as having <lb/>
            eneampod at the first village they came to, which I have supposed <lb/>
            might correspond with Tel Kubbin, where a mound of ruin marks <lb/>
            an ancient site, but Layard does not think they got beyond the <lb/>
            Hazil su. The first village in the plain in the present day is Bidari, <lb/>
            inhabited by Chaldeans.</p>
          <p>FOOT OF TItE MOUNTAINS.—The Greeks evidently continued <lb/>
            their march across the plain of Zakhu—the Romaion Ager of <lb/>
            Procopius—till they reached the foot of the hills south of Jizirah. <lb/>
            A superior knowledge of the country had, however, been turned <lb/>
            to account by the Persians in the mean time, and the Greeks, to <lb/>
            their astonishment, found the enemy in possession of the heights <lb/>
            over wnich they necessarily must pass, whilst the troops of Ariacus <lb/>
            and Tissaphernes pressed upon the rear.</p>
          <p>The scene of this second conflict in the outlying mountains <lb/>
            of Kurdistan I have identified with the low hills which con­ <lb/>
            stitute that spur of the Jibal Jndi which advances immediately <lb/>
            beyond the plain of Zakhu down to the banks of the Tigris, and <lb/>
            where is the now ruinous castle of Rabahi—the Rabdium of the <lb/>
            Low Empire, Tur Abdin of Al Wakidis' History of the Conquest <lb/>
            of Mesopotamia by the Saracens, and Tur Rabdin of the Jihan <lb/>
            Numa. Colonel Chesney agrees with me in this explanation of mat­ <lb/>
            ters, but Layard takes the Greeks (p. 62) all the way to Fynyk or <lb/>
            Finik, a view of the subject that will meet with very little support <lb/>
            from those who will be at the pains to consider the details carefully</p>
          <p>KURDISH PLAIN WITH VILLAGES.—The Greeks having driven <lb/>
            the enemy from the commanding position which they held, they <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            descended into a plain, in which were many villages, stored with <lb/>
            excellent provisions, lying along the river Tigris. This plain ex­ <lb/>
            ists precisely in the position indicated, between the Rabahi spur <lb/>
            of the Jibal Judi and the low eminences which again block up the <lb/>
            plain opposite to Jizirah ibn Umar, the Zozarta of the Chaldeans, <lb/>
            and Bezabde of the Romans, and at the farther or northern end <lb/>
            of which is the Chaldean village of Mansuriyah. There was <lb/>
            formerly a bridge over the Tigris in this plain, the ruins of which <lb/>
            still exist.</p>
          <p>The Greeks are described as being much perplexed, for on one <lb/>
            side of them were exceeding high mountains, and on the other a <lb/>
            river of such depth, that when they sounded it, their spears did not <lb/>
            rise above the water.</p>
          <p>They were also obliged to retrace their steps to a certain extent. <lb/>
            The Persians having set fire to some of the villages before them, <lb/>
            they had to return in search of provisions to some that were un­ <lb/>
            burnt. These villages may have been at the westerly end of the <lb/>
            plain of Zakhu, where are in the present day Kalah Salahsani <lb/>
            or Sayid Bay's castle, Nahrwan, Girgi Pedros or Afar Yiorgio, <lb/>
            (Church of St. George,) Zibarra, Wasit, Perishabur, and other <lb/>
            villages mostly Chaldean. I prefer this view of the case to the <lb/>
            one I first entertained, that they went up the valley of Mar Yu­ <lb/>
            hannah. The whole district, however, as Colonel Chesney (ii. <lb/>
            225) justly remarks, included the tract round Jizirah ibn Umar.</p>
          <p>Layard (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 62) identifies the villages in <lb/>
            question with those still found around Funduk, but it appears <lb/>
            evident from what follows in chapter i. of the 10th book of the <lb/>
            Katabnsis, that the Greeks had not yet fought their way through <lb/>
            the chief pass of the Tigris, and which is met with immediately <lb/>
            beyond Jizirah ibn Umar and the valley of Mar Yuhannah, <lb/>
            or the Dargilah of Layard—Fynyk, ancient Phœnica, command­ <lb/>
            ing the pass in question from above. I cannot but attribute <lb/>
            the great discrepancy that occurs here between my identifi­ <lb/>
            cations and those admitted by Layard, to the circumstances of <lb/>
            his having travelled from the north, I from the south. Coming <lb/>
            in the first direction, Layard first saw the plains of Assyria <lb/>
            through the gap made by the river stretching before him, as it were <lb/>
            at his feet, from the heights of Funduk, and all other passes were <lb/>
            from that moment looked at as insignificant; coming, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, from the south, the great range of the Jibal Judi seems to <lb/>
            Item in the Tigris immediately beyond Jizirah, like a mighty <lb/>
            wall of rock. There is no mistaking this great physical feature in <lb/>
            .lie configuration of the country. The pass of the Tigris, where <lb/>
            the Greeks stopped awe-struck at the formidable aspect of the <lb/>
            country before them, was at or near the Bezabde of the Romans. <lb/>
            That town has been from time immemorial the fortress which has <lb/>
            commanded the great pass of the Tigris.</p><pb n="311"/>
            
          <p>PASS OF TilE TIGRIS.—The Greeks are described in the next book <lb/>
            as having arrived at a spot where the Tigris was quite impassable <lb/>
            from its depth and width, and where there was no passage along <lb/>
            its banks, as the Karduchian mountains hung steep over the <lb/>
            stream, and hence their further progress became a matter of seri­ <lb/>
            ous and anxious discussions.</p>
          <p>This is the great pass of the Tigris I have just alluded to imme­ <lb/>
            diately beyond Jizirah ibn Umar. There cannot be a moment's <lb/>
            question upon the subject. It was a point of such great import­ <lb/>
            ance in the retreat, that it is made the scene of discussion of all <lb/>
            the principal routes that presented themselves to get out of the <lb/>
            country, and Xenophon begins another book with the account of <lb/>
            the passage of this remarkable pass, which the Greeks effected <lb/>
            with their characteristic gallantry and expedition, arriving beyond <lb/>
            the summit in certain villages of Karduchians that lay dispersed <lb/>
            in the valleys and recesses of the mountains. It is perhaps scarcely <lb/>
            necessary to say that Colonel Chesney quite coincides with this <lb/>
            view of the matter.</p>
          <p>VILLAGES OF KAUDUCHIANS.—The pass of the Tigris will be <lb/>
            found minutely described in the Travels in the Track, p. 154. After <lb/>
            the summit of the pass is gained, the line of hills and cliffs gradually <lb/>
            recede from the river, till suddenly, from having a nearly horizontal <lb/>
            stratification, additional beds of rock make their appearance in front <lb/>
            of the cliffs, dipping nearly vertically to the west, and rising in rude <lb/>
            irregular conical summits, in front of what had been hitherto one <lb/>
            continuous wall of rock. The recesses thus left between the hills <lb/>
            are in the present day the seat of villages, as they were in the <lb/>
            time of Xenophon, and the crags in front and in the rear bristle <lb/>
            with the small and rude rock-forts of the Kurds. This place cor­ <lb/>
            responds to the Phoenica of Amm. Marcellinus, of the existence <lb/>
            of which Mr. Rich obtained some intelligence; but as I was, I be­ <lb/>
            lieve, the first traveller to visit it in modern times, I cannot refrain <lb/>
            from quoting the description given of this remarkable spot in the <lb/>
            Tray. in the Track, &amp;c. p. 154 et seq.</p>
          <p>" My surprise and pleasure may be well imagined (after crossing <lb/>
            the before-mentioned wild rocky pass) at finding extending before <lb/>
            me a considerable expanse of well-wooded gardens, which stretch­ <lb/>
            ed from the hills down to the water-side, and for about two miles <lb/>
            up the river-course. Nothing could exceed the rich luxuriance of <lb/>
            these groves and orchards; there were open spaces here and <lb/>
            there for maize, melon, gourd, and cucumber, but otherwise the <lb/>
            groves of plum, apricot, and peach appeared almost inaccessible, <lb/>
            from the dense lower growth of fig-trees and pomegranates, them <lb/>
            selves again half hid beneath clustering vines. Overlooking this <lb/>
            scene of vegetative splendour, and upon the side of the hill, were <lb/>
            the ruins -if a castellated building, the battlemented wall and irre­ <lb/>
            gularly dispersed towers of which still remain. This building <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            covered a considerable space, being six hundred yards in depth, by <lb/>
            eleven hundred in length. Traces of out-works, and of buildings <lb/>
            connected with it, were also quite evident, stretching downward to <lb/>
            the gardens.</p>
          <p>" On two mounds, not far distant from each other, and close to <lb/>
            the river, are the ruins of two smaller castles of similar character to <lb/>
            the large one, only with double battlements, and consequently <lb/>
            rising more loftily trom the deep green groves, in the midst of <lb/>
            which they are situated.</p>
          <p>" In a deep and rocky glen at the head of these gardens is situated <lb/>
            the village of Güli or Kuli Shirafi, (so called from its being in a <lb/>
            narrow strait or pass,) many of the houses of which are hewn out <lb/>
            of rock, and some of them out of fallen masses, which often stand <lb/>
            erect at the foot of the cliffs, like great obelisks with a door-way in <lb/>
            front: on the cliffs around are also numerous sepulchral grots, and <lb/>
            the remains of aqueducts.</p>
          <p>" To the north of this glen is another of greater dimensions, in <lb/>
            which is the modern village of Fynvk, containing about one hun­ <lb/>
            dred houses, many of them excavated. The village is defended by <lb/>
            several Kurd forts, two of which were on the opposite hill-tops, <lb/>
            while other small ones succeeded to one another along the crest <lb/>
            and acclivities down to the village. This pass of the Tigris was <lb/>
            rendered quite impracticable to strangers by the Kurds of these <lb/>
            villages till the time of Rashid Pasha."</p>
          <p>It is manifest that it is these villages to which Xenophon al­ <lb/>
            ludes when he speaks of such being in rocky recesses. Layard <lb/>
            however looks for these villages at Funduk (p. 62).</p>
          <p>Whilst resting during the heat of day in the gardens down by <lb/>
            the river Tigris, Layard was lucky enough to have had informa­ <lb/>
            tion brought to him of the existence of sculptures in one of these <lb/>
            ravines—the description appears to apply rather to that of Knli <lb/>
            Shirafi than to that of Finik or Fynyk proper. " We rode," he says, <lb/>
            (p. 54,) " up a narrow and shady ravine, through which leapt a <lb/>
            brawling torrent, watering fruit trees and melon beds. The rocks <lb/>
            on both sides were honey-combed with tombs. The bas-relief is <lb/>
            somewhat above the line of cultivation, and is surrounded by ex­ <lb/>
            cavated chambers. It consists of two figures, dressed in loose <lb/>
            vests and trousers, one apparently resting his hand on the <lb/>
            shoulder of the other. There are the remains of an inscription, <lb/>
            but too much weather-worn to be copied with any accuracy. The <lb/>
            costume of the figures, and the forms of the characters as far as <lb/>
            they can be distinguished, prove that the tablet belongs to the <lb/>
            Parthia. period. It closely resembles monuments of the same <lb/>
            epoch existing in the mountains of Persia."</p>
          <p>What further satisfies me that the glen or ravine which my <lb/>
            informants told me was called Kuli Shirafi is the same as that in <lb/>
            which Layard found the bas-reliefs, is that Layard adds, " Beneath <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            them (the figures) is a long cutting, and tunnel in the rock, pro­ <lb/>
            bably an ancient watercourse for irrigation, to record the construc­ <lb/>
            tion of which the tablets may have been sculptured."</p>
          <p>Layard also discovered some sculptures of a similar character in <lb/>
            the valley which leads from Jizirah to Darghilah, the former <lb/>
            stronghold of Badir Khan Bay, or as I have called it from a Chal­ <lb/>
            dean church, and the seat of a Chaldean episcopacy, the valley of <lb/>
            Mar Yuhannah. These sculptures were about two miles from the <lb/>
            high road, near a small fort built by Mir Saif-ad-din, the hereditary <lb/>
            chief of Buhtan, in whose name Badir Khan Bay exercised his <lb/>
            authority. There were two tablets, one above the other; the upper <lb/>
            contained a warrior on horseback, the lower a simple figure. Al­ <lb/>
            though no traces of inscription remain, the bas-relief may confi­ <lb/>
            dently be assigned to the same period, Layard says, as that of <lb/>
            Fynyk.</p>
          <p>PASS OF SCRUTINY.—Beyond Finik, or Fynyk, the hills and the <lb/>
            river recede from one another, the latter being closed up amidst <lb/>
            precipitous cliffs, and to avoid this long precipitous bend, the road <lb/>
            is carried over the hills by the village of Finduk or Funduk. As <lb/>
            the Greeks did not start from Finik till after breakfast, more than <lb/>
            seven to eight geographical miles cannot be allowed to the first <lb/>
            day's march thence, which would carry them to the slope of those <lb/>
            heights where are now the remains of Kunakti and other castles, <lb/>
            which defended the approach to Finduk. There is only one pass <lb/>
            in the line of road thus traversed, adapted for the purposes men­ <lb/>
            tioned by Xenophon, of examining the men in a file, and scrutiniz­ <lb/>
            ing their baggage or impedimenta, and that is the ravine of the <lb/>
            rivulet of Zawiyah, which is deep and narrow, and to which there <lb/>
            is only one descent on either side, the remainder being vertical <lb/>
            cliffs in which are here and there a sepulchral grotto.</p>
          <p>PASS OF FINDUK.—On the next day a great storm arose in the <lb/>
            very place to expect such, on the ascent of the highlands of Fin­ <lb/>
            duk; but they were obliged to go on, for their provisions failed <lb/>
            them. Beyond the castle of Kunakti, the road enters a narrow <lb/>
            glen, and winds round along similar passes, till turning the face of <lb/>
            a lofty precipice, it advances upon more open and cultivated high­ <lb/>
            lands by the village or town of Finduk, down again into the valley <lb/>
            of the Tigris, where are the villages of Kuwarru, Baravan, and <lb/>
            others, inhabited in the present day by Syrian Christians.</p>
          <p>Layard gives an amusing account of his passage through Fin­ <lb/>
            duk, whose inhabitants, he says, during the rule of Badir Khan Bay <lb/>
            were notorious amongst even the savage tribes of Buhtan, for <lb/>
            their hatred and insolence to Christians. At the time of my visit <lb/>
            Badir Khan had not been subdued, and the dangers of the road <lb/>
            were proportionably greater, but the only annoyance the savage <lb/>
            old chieftain Rasul gave me, (if it can be even so termed,) was to <lb/>
            ask me contemptuously if I was a Christian.</p><pb n="314"/>
            
          <p>The Greeks were subjected to much annoyance by the Kurde <lb/>
            on this passage, and Xenophon was irritated at Cheirisophus <lb/>
            hastening, as he deemed, too rashly forward; but the rival leader <lb/>
            pointed to the river pass and mountains before him, and urged the <lb/>
            necessity of haying hurried forward to secure the position they <lb/>
            were in. That this was on the banks of the Tigris is evidenced <lb/>
            by a prisoner they had taken, promising, under fear of death, to <lb/>
            lead them over the hills, instead of by the river-banks, which are <lb/>
            indeed at this point impassable, except when the waters are low, <lb/>
            besides being commanded by the neighbouring hills.</p>
          <p>PASS OF KULAK.—At the point where they had now arrived <lb/>
            then, that is, where the Tigris is hemmed in by the mountains, and <lb/>
            yet there is no short cut over the latter, as at Finduk; the Greeks <lb/>
            were obliged to detach a party to take possession of the heights <lb/>
            before they could attempt to force the passage below. Notwith­ <lb/>
            standing these precautions, the Kurds rolled down great stones <lb/>
            upon the Greeks and entailed considerable delay.</p>
          <p>The scene of this event appears to have been at the entrance of <lb/>
            the pass, where is a ferry and villages on each side of the river <lb/>
            known as Kulak, as is also the ferry on the Zab—pronounced by <lb/>
            the Kurds, Kelek or Chelek. At this point a rivulet of clear water <lb/>
            flows into the Tigris, by a narrow ravine, which is hemmed in, as <lb/>
            the Tigris is also from this point northwards, by perpendicular <lb/>
            rocks. A road, carried up in part by steps cut in the rock, leads <lb/>
            up the <unclear>eliff</unclear> to the ruins of a eastle that once commanded this im­ <lb/>
            portant position.</p>
          <p>To gain this pass, the Greeks had to fight three separate con. <lb/>
            flicts, on as many distinct eminences; after which they arrived at <lb/>
            a number of good houses, and in the midst of abundance of pro­ <lb/>
            visions. Wine was so abundant, that they kept it in excavations <lb/>
            under ground, which were plastered over.</p>
          <p>On emerging from the hills that hem in the river below Kulak, <lb/>
            there are at the present day no villages close to the river, but there <lb/>
            are several in the interior, and a little farther on the ruins of a <lb/>
            large village, and of a Khan built of stone. Kulak, with its tall <lb/>
            Kurdish castle, stands on the right bank of the river, a little far­ <lb/>
            ther on. The plastered cisterns noticed by Xenophon are still to <lb/>
            be met with in Kurdistan, Armenia, and Syria.</p>
          <p>THE CENTRITES—The next day the Greeks pursued their way <lb/>
            one party as usual ascending the mountains from behind to drive <lb/>
            the enemy away, and leave the passage below free to their com­ <lb/>
            rades. By these means they were enabled to force another wooded <lb/>
            and picturesque pass, that is met with north of Kulak, and to <lb/>
            reach the more open country where the ISuhtan chai or Centrites <lb/>
            joins the Tigris.</p>
          <p>The army did not encamp on the banks of the Centrites, but, as <lb/>
            is described by Xenophon, above the plain, where are some villages <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            of Chaldeans in the present day. At the point of junction of the <lb/>
            Tigris and Centrites is the ancient Armenian site of Til, or Till, <lb/>
            (written by Layard, Tilleh,) which was celebrated in history as fa­ <lb/>
            voured by Tigranes, and as the burial-place of several of the early <lb/>
            Armenian pontiffs.</p>
          <p>Layard having got the Greeks on their first day's march over <lb/>
            the Karduchian hills, as far as Finduk, he says, “There now re­ <lb/>
            mained about ten parasangs to the plain through which flows the <lb/>
            eastern branch of the Tigris; but the country was difficult, and at <lb/>
            this time of the year (nearly mid-winter) the lower road along the <lb/>
            river was impassable. The Greeks had therefore to force their <lb/>
            way over a series of difficult passes, all stoutly defended by warlike <lb/>
            tribes. They were consequently four days in reaching the Cen­ <lb/>
            trites, or eastern Tigris, the united waters of the rivers of Bitlis, <lb/>
            Sort, and Bohtan."</p>
          <p>FORD OF TilE CENTRITES.—The passage of the river was op­ <lb/>
            posed by an united army of Armenians, Mardians, or, as it was <lb/>
            previously read, Mygdonians, and Chaldeans. These mercenaries <lb/>
            were drawn up on high banks, three or four hundred feet from the <lb/>
            river; and the only road that was visible, was one that led up­ <lb/>
            ward, apparently a work of art, and the Greeks attempted to cross <lb/>
            the river at this point, but without success. They in consequence <lb/>
            retreated, and when they had encamped on the banks of the river, <lb/>
            they found their previous station occupied by the Kurds.</p>
          <p>That day, therefore, and the following night they remained where <lb/>
            they were in great perplexity. But the next morning two young <lb/>
            men came to Xenophon, when he was at breakfast, and told him <lb/>
            they had found a ford. This ford was at a distance of about four <lb/>
            stadia, and the Greeks effected the passage by a series of ingenious <lb/>
            manoeuvres which are described in the text.</p>
          <p>Layard, who forded the Buhtan chai in the month of September <lb/>
            I believe, (he disembarked at Trebizond on the 31st of August,) <lb/>
            says, “ We crossed the lower or eastern ford, which we found wide <lb/>
            and exceedingly rapid, the water, however, not reaching above the <lb/>
            saddle-girths. The villagers raised the luggage, and supported the <lb/>
            horses against the current, which rushing over loose and slippery <lb/>
            stones, affording an uncertain footing, threatened to sweep the <lb/>
            animals down the stream. * * The spot at which we crossed was <lb/>
            one of peculiar interest. It was here that the Ten Thousand in their <lb/>
            memorable retreat forded this river, called, by Xenophon, the Centrites <lb/>
            (p. 49). The next paragraph but one he says, " The ford was <lb/>
            deep, and its passage disputed by a formidable force of Armenians, <lb/>
            Mygdonians, (Mardians?) and Chaldeans, drawn up on an emi­ <lb/>
            nence 300 or 400 feet from the river. In this strait Xenophon <lb/>
            dreamt that he was in chains, and that suddenly his fetters burst <lb/>
            asunder of their own accord. His dream was fulfilled when two <lb/>
            youths casually found a more practicable ford, by which the army <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            after a skilful stratagem on the part of their commander, safely <lb/>
            reached the opposite bank.</p>
          <p>These two paragraphs contradict one another. Layard also <lb/>
            says at page 63, “The stream was rapid, the water reaching <lb/>
            to the breast, and the ford, owing to the unevenness of the bot­ <lb/>
            torn and the loose slippery stones, exceeding difficult; such, it <lb/>
            will be remembered, we found to be the case near Tilleh. The <lb/>
            opposite banks were, moreover, defended by the combined forces of <lb/>
            the Armenians, Mygdonians, and Chaldeans. It was impossible to <lb/>
            cross the river at this spot in the face of the enemy. At length a <lb/>
            ford was discovered higher up, and Xenophon, by skilful strategy, <lb/>
            effected the passage. This must have been at a short distance <lb/>
            from Tilleh, as the river, narrowed between rocky banks, is no <lb/>
            longer fordable higher up.”</p>
          <p>This latter statement is founded in error, for Mr. Rassam and <lb/>
            myself forded it a few miles higher up, in the month of September, <lb/>
            when the water was in its deepest part not above three feet, but <lb/>
            generally two.</p>
          <p>Supposing the Greeks to have first attempted the ford at Til, it <lb/>
            is evident, according to Layard's own showing, that they crossed <lb/>
            ultimately higher up the river. But the fact is that the point at <lb/>
            which the Greeks passed must be determined by where they first <lb/>
            reached the river-banks. On reaching the plain of the Centrites, <lb/>
            the Tigris makes a great bend to the westward before receiving <lb/>
            the Centrites, and as the course of the Greeks lay northward, <lb/>
            conceive it very unlikely that they would have turned unneces <lb/>
            sarily out of their way towards the junction of the two rivers. <lb/>
            Again, at the point where they approached the river, the enemy is <lb/>
            described as occupying high banks from 300 to 400 feet from the <lb/>
            river. This description would correspond with that part of the valley <lb/>
            where the Buhtan chai is first hemmed in by low hills, now called <lb/>
            Janiminiyah. About four miles beyond this there are in the pre­ <lb/>
            sent day the ruins of a bridge, over which lay formerly the road <lb/>
            to Radwan. Beyond this again is an artificial causeway carried <lb/>
            up the face of a limestone rock, partly by steps cut out of the rock <lb/>
            tself, and partly by a causeway paved with large blocks of stone. <lb/>
            This is the high-way to Sa'art, and appears to be of remote anti­ <lb/>
            quity. Here is also a ford, but as the river is fordable at its em­ <lb/>
            bouchure, it is evident there may be many fords between the two. <lb/>
            It is not necessary to presume then that the higher ford was <lb/>
            crossed, although the reference to the artificial <unclear>causeway</unclear> carried <lb/>
            up the face of the cliffs, and which remains to the present day, is <lb/>
            very curious; but as it appears almost certain that they did not <lb/>
            approach the river till where it is hemmed in by low hills, and <lb/>
            which is precisely what they would be expected to do from the <lb/>
            route taken and the configuration of the valley, and as they <lb/>
            crossed about four stadia above that point, the place where <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            the Greeks forded the river was manifestly beyond the said low <unclear/> <lb/>
            nills.</p>
          <p>PALACE OF ARMENIAN SATRAP.-Having forced the passage of <lb/>
            the Centrites, the Greeks are described as proceeding through <lb/>
            Armenia, over plains and gently sloping hills, a distance of not <lb/>
            less than five parasangs, arriving ultimately at a village of con­ <lb/>
            siderable size, which contained a palace for the satrap ; upon most <lb/>
            of the houses there were towers, and provisions in great plenty. <lb/>
            This spot, by the distance given, would appear to correspond with <lb/>
            the town now called Sa'art or Se'ert.</p>
          <p>TilE TELEBOAS.—The Greeks are described as advancing from <lb/>
            the palace of the Armenian satrap, two days' journey, a distance of <lb/>
            ten parasangs, until they passed beyond the sources of the river <lb/>
            Tigris. From hence they advanced, three days' journey, fifteen <lb/>
            parasangs, to the river Teleboas, a stream not large, indeed, but of <lb/>
            much beauty; and there were many villages on its banks. This <lb/>
            part of the country was called Western Armenia.</p>
          <p>There is a difficulty about the identification of the Teleboas, <lb/>
            which has been revived by Mr. Layard's going back to the old <lb/>
            view of the case. My ideas, as propounded from an unbiassed <lb/>
            consideration of the facts of the case, are given in the “Travels in <lb/>
            the Track, <unclear/>&amp;c.,” in the following words.</p>
          <p>“Had the Greeks marched by the great road from Sa'art to <lb/>
            Bitlis, the distance here given at the onset would take them to <lb/>
            the difficult pass called the Darah i Tasul, when they would leave <lb/>
            behind them the minor tributaries to the Kharzan su, (anc. Arsa­ <lb/>
            nius,) but only to arrive, after another ascent and descent, at the <lb/>
            river Bakiyah or of Bitlis, the greatest of the easterly tributaries <lb/>
            to the Tigris. So that Xenophon could hardly be expected to <lb/>
            have made the mistake regarding the passing the sources of the <lb/>
            Tigris, besides that the distance given from his passing the head- <lb/>
            waters of the Tigris, to the river Teleboas, much exceeds the <lb/>
            distance of the Darah-i-Tasul from the Bakiyah river. Lastly, <lb/>
            the Teleboas was a small river with many villages on its banks, <lb/>
            the Bakiyah is not large, but is so goodly a stream, that the his­ <lb/>
            torian would not have gone out of his way to describe it as small, <lb/>
            nor is it a district in which (except at Bitlis) many villages pro­ <lb/>
            bably ever existed. All these circumstances taken into consider­ <lb/>
            ation leave no doubt that the Greeks ascended directly towards <lb/>
            the great chain of the Ali Tagh, the ancient Niphates, in a direc­ <lb/>
            lion nearly north; by which proceeding, a journey of thirty miles <lb/>
            would have carried them beyond the head-waters of the tributaries <lb/>
            to the Tigris, in those districts, and another forty-five miles would <lb/>
            have brought them into the valley of the Kara-su, recognised by <lb/>
            many as the Teleboas of our author, and situate in the district of <lb/>
            Moxoene, the present Mush,—apparently from the most remote <lb/>
            times the seat of numerous towns and villages, and having a large <lb/>
            population. That this is the only version that can be given to this <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            portion of the narrative, is further corroborated by the fact that <lb/>
            from the Teleboas they proceeded through a plain which would <lb/>
            not apply itself to the river Bakiyeh, (nor to the river of Bitlis,) <lb/>
            both of which are enclosed in deep and wooded mountain valleys.”</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney's view of the subject is as follows. “ It is con­ <lb/>
            sidered to be a journey of thirty-eight hours from Se'rt to Mush <lb/>
            by the shortest route, (see Colonel Sheil's Journey from Tabriz <lb/>
            through Kurdistan, Jour. of Roy. Geo. Soc. vol. viii. p. 77,) but <lb/>
            as the Greeks approached the source of the Tigris, theirs must <lb/>
            have been rather longer. About twenty hours would be consumed <lb/>
            on their march to the high ground in question; and about twenty <lb/>
            hours more in reaching the supposed Teleboas or Kara-su at the <lb/>
            village of Arisban near Mush.”</p>
          <p>This is the most satisfactory explanation of all, because by <lb/>
            crossing the Niphates to Mush instead of to the valley of the Ka­ <lb/>
            ra su at the foot of the Nimrud Tagh, the Greeks would have had the <lb/>
            advantage of the high-way from Hazu to Mush. It may also be <lb/>
            observed here, that had the Greeks intended keeping to the country <lb/>
            of the <unclear>Kardnchians</unclear>, and passing the mountains by Bitlis, they <lb/>
            need not have fought their way over the Centrites; and Xenophon, <lb/>
            when he speaks of passing above Tigris, was, there is every reason <lb/>
            to believe, well enough aware that he was crossing the great water­ <lb/>
            shed. The historian also distinguishes the country they had ad­ <lb/>
            vanced into as a different region of Armenia, under its own satrap.</p>
          <p>In the face of all these facts, Layard says, " Six marches, of five <lb/>
            parasangs each, brought them to the small river Teleboas. I am <lb/>
            convinced that this river cannot be identified with the Kara su, <lb/>
            which would be at least between forty and fifty parasangs, or from <lb/>
            eight to ten days' march, from Tilleh, supposing Xenophon to have <lb/>
            made the smallest possible deviation to the west." (This is sup­ <lb/>
            posing the Greeks to have started from Tilleh, which is not pro­ <lb/>
            bable, and then to have travelled to the Kara su by way of Bitlis, <lb/>
            which is left out of the consideration.) “ I believe," continues <lb/>
            Layard, “ the Teleboas to have been the river of Bitlis. After cross­ <lb/>
            ing the low country of Kharzan, well described by Xenophon as <lb/>
            'a plain varied by hills of an easy ascent,' the Greeks must neces­ <lb/>
            sarily have turned slightly to the eastward to reach the Bitlis val­ <lb/>
            ley, as inaccessible mountains stopped all further progress." This <lb/>
            is not the case; Colonel Sheil, as before quoted, describes a road <lb/>
            from Sa'art of thirty-eight hours to Mush direct, which does not <lb/>
            pass through Bitlis : and the Colonel adds, " this must be the road <lb/>
            which Macdonald Kinneir supposes the Ten Thousand to have <lb/>
            taken after they crossed the river, which he calls the Khabur, <unclear>nt</unclear> <lb/>
            Se'rt." (Op. cit. p. 77.) Viscount Pollington passed through the <lb/>
            Niphates on his journey from Erzrum to Aleppo in 1838; and Mr <lb/>
            Consul Brant did the same on his journey from Kharput by Mush <lb/>
            to Bitlis. This was by the valley of the Kolb <unclear>su</unclear>, (Handle water,) <lb/>
            but Mr. Brant says there was another road crossing the</p><pb n="319"/>
            
          <p>Immediately south of Mush. (See Journ. of Roy. Geog. Soc. vol. <lb/>
            n. p. 445 et seq. and p. 352 et seq.) Either of those roads would <lb/>
            have been preferable to the mountain route through Kurdistan b) <lb/>
            Bitlis, to the Greeks.</p>
          <p>Mr. Layard remarks, that the text of Xenophon describes the <lb/>
            Greeks as coming to, not crossing, the Teleboas. This would ap­ <lb/>
            ply itself alike to the origin of the Kara-su at the foot of the Nim­ <lb/>
            rud Tagh—to the rivulet of Mush or Ak su—the White Water-a <lb/>
            tributary to the Kara-su, or to the rivulet at Kizil Aghaz on the <lb/>
            north side of the Kolb Tagh. It would scarcely apply to the rivet <lb/>
            of Bitlis, with which they would have had to keep company some <lb/>
            time. Beyond either of the above rivers there are plains, not so <lb/>
            at the head of the Bitlis river, and all these rivers are beyond the <lb/>
            water-shed of the Tigris, which is not the case with the river of <lb/>
            Bitlis.</p>
          <p>PALACE OF TIRIBAZUS.—The Greeks proceeded from the Tele­ <lb/>
            boas three days' march, a distance of five parasangs, through a <lb/>
            plain, till they came to a palace, with several villages around it, <lb/>
            stored with abundance of provisions. The direction followed by <lb/>
            the Greeks, after reaching the plains of Armenia, must be chiefly <lb/>
            judged of by the time spent before they crossed the Euphrates. <lb/>
            Had they pursued a direct northerly course, they could have <lb/>
            reached the river in a day's march, but at a point where it is searce­ <lb/>
            'y fordable. Probably they were informed of this fact, and hence <lb/>
            led to pursue a north-easterly course to where the river was suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently fordable, and which was not attained till the sources of <lb/>
            the river lire described as being not far off.</p>
          <p>The palace of Tiribazus and surrounding villages may, from the <lb/>
            distance given, be at or near the sites of Perak or Lis, north of <lb/>
            Lake Nazuk, but this, in the absence of corroborative information, <lb/>
            is naturally a merely speculative suggestion.</p>
          <p>The plain of Mush attains an average elevation, from my own <lb/>
            observations, of 4200 ft. above the sea, which is some 1800 <lb/>
            ft. below that of Arzrum, vulgo Erzrum, Erzerum, and Erzeroom.* <lb/>
            But between the two, or the valleys of the western Euphrates and <lb/>
            that of the Murad su, the generality of the valleys and uplands <lb/>
            which attain their culminating point in the Bin gill Tagh—the <lb/>
            mountain of a thousand lakes—the Abus of the Romans—and on <lb/>
            which are patches of perpetual snow, art much higher.</p>
          <p>The knowledge which we now possess of the great elevation of <lb/>
            these Armenian uplands explains the extreme severity of the win­ <lb/>
            ters, which has been the subject of much controversy; so much so, <lb/>
            that Tournefort, the traveller and botanist, suggested that it might <lb/>
            be owing to so unnatural a cause as the impregnation of the soil <note type="footnote"> * Oriental manuscripts leave no doubt as to the name of the present <lb/>
            capital of Armenia being Arzrum, vulgarly pronounced Erzerum. The im­ <lb/>
            portance of the prefix justify us in writing the word as it is spelt, not as it <lb/>
            is pronounced. </note> <lb/>

            lulls of a lower temperature are increased by a continental climate, <lb/>
            and a long continuity of open woodless tracts, appear to be the <lb/>
            main causes of the phenomena in question.</p>
          <p>The Hon. Mr. Curzon, who spent the winter of 1842-43 at Ar­ <lb/>
            zrum, speaking of the intense cold experienced at that city, the <lb/>
            present capital of Armenia, says, “ During great part of the year. <lb/>
            and naturally in the winter, the cold was so severe that any one <lb/>
            standing still for even a very short time, was frozen to death. <lb/>
            Dead frozen bodies were frequently brought into the city; and it is <lb/>
            common in the summer, on the melting of the snow, to find nu­ <lb/>
            merous corpses of men and bodies of horses, who had perished in the <lb/>
            preceding winter. So usual an event is this, that there is a custom, <lb/>
            or law, in the mountains of Armenia, that every summer the vil­ <lb/>
            lagers go out to the more dangerous passes and bury the dead <lb/>
            whom they are sure to find." (Armenia, <unclear/>&amp;c. p. 162.) This will <lb/>
            give some idea of what the Greeks had to suffer during a winter <lb/>
            ionrney across the uplands of Armenia.</p>
          <p>FORD OF THE EUPHRATES.—From these villages an attack was <lb/>
            made upon Tiribazus, who held a pass that lay on their way, after <lb/>
            which the whole body set forward through deep snow, and tra­ <lb/>
            velled three days' journey, through a desert tract of country, a dis­ <lb/>
            tance of fifteen parasangs, to the river Euphrates, which they <lb/>
            passed without being wet higher than the middle. “ The sources <lb/>
            of the river were said to be not far off.”</p>
          <p>Rennell and Kinneir had both remarked that this distance is <lb/>
            too great for troops marching through deep snow. All the proba­ <lb/>
            bilities of the case are, however, that the Greeks crossed the Murad <lb/>
            su above its confluence with the Char Buhar su, and the river of <lb/>
            Khanus or Kalah su, as beyond those points there would be so <lb/>
            much the less water.</p>
          <p>Layard having taken the Greeks through Karduchia to Bitlis, <lb/>
            says, “ the high road from Bitlis to Northern Armenia would lead <lb/>
            in exactly thirty hours, or six marches, to the Euphrates, which it <lb/>
            crosses near Karaghal. I believe, therefore, that, after issuing <lb/>
            from the valley of Bitlis, Xenophon turned to the westward, leav­ <lb/>
            ing the lake of Wan a little to the right, though completely con­ <lb/>
            cealed from him by a range of low hills. Skirting the western <lb/>
            foot of the Nimroud Dagh range, he passed through a plain thickly <lb/>
            inhabited, abounding in well-provisioned villages, and crossed here <lb/>
            by ranges of hills. The country still tallies precisely with Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon's description." The upper valley of the Kara-su here alluded <lb/>
            to, certainly abounds in villages, but I saw no ranges of hills actu­ <lb/>
            ally crossing it. It is, however, commanded by low hills where it <lb/>
            takes a westerly turn.</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney (ii. 229) says, " Agreeably to the intention of <lb/>
            fording the great rivers towards their sources, (previously expressed. <lb/>
            Anab. iv. l,) the Greeks would necessarily procced from the Tele <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            boas in a north-eastern direction, through a very mountainous <lb/>
            tract, till they could cross the Murad Chai: this could not have <lb/>
            been the case before they reached 39° 10' north latitude, or some­ <lb/>
            where about seventy miles from the Kara su, which, under existing <lb/>
            circumstances, would require the seven marches given by Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon.</p>
          <p>This would identify the place where the Greeks forded the Mu­ <lb/>
            rad su with a position not far beyond the junction of the river of <lb/>
            Khanus or the Kalah-su; as would indeed be deduced from the <lb/>
            general facts of the case.</p>
          <p>TRIBUTARIES TO THE EUPHRATES.—From the Euphrates they <lb/>
            advanced three days' march, through much snow and a level plain, <lb/>
            a distance of fifteen parasangs: the third day's march was ex­ <lb/>
            tremely troublesome, as the north wind blew full in their faces. <lb/>
            The depth of the snow was a fathom; so that many of the bag­ <lb/>
            gage-cattle and slaves perished, with about thirty of the soldiers. <lb/>
            There was plenty of wood at the encampment, which would indi­ <lb/>
            cate that they had reached the banks of a river, as it is almost <lb/>
            only in such situations that wood is found in this part of Armenia. <lb/>
            The valley most probably of one of the tributaries to the river of <lb/>
            Khanus, or, if farther east, a tributary to the Murad su, on the <lb/>
            plain of Arishkart. If in a westerly direction, the distances would <lb/>
            lead them to the upper valley of the Kalah su or river of Khanus. <lb/>
            In all these instances a northerly wind would still have blown <lb/>
            more or less in their faces.</p>
          <p>VILLAGES IN KHANUS DISTRIcT.-From thence they made one <lb/>
            day's irregular march through the snow, the men affected with <lb/>
            bulimia, snow-blindness, and mortification of the toes. Five or <lb/>
            six geographic miles are as much as can be allowed for such a <lb/>
            march: and at dark they arrived at a village with a rampart. <lb/>
            The satrap residing a parasang off, very possibly at Khanus Ka­ <lb/>
            lahsi, which is apart from the villages. A Thermal spring, it is <lb/>
            to be noted, was met with on this day's march. Xenophon with <lb/>
            the rear did not get up to the villages till the next day. The de­ <lb/>
            scription of the houses of the Armenians corresponds with what is <lb/>
            observed in the present day, they are in part subterranean, and <lb/>
            the live stock herd with the people during these severe winters. <lb/>
            As these Armenians had laid in their stores for the winter, the <lb/>
            Greeks found plenty of provisions, including barley-wine, and even <lb/>
            grape-wine, in these villages.</p>
          <p>Professor Maiden rather sharply criticises this identification of <lb/>
            Khanus with the villages in question, adopted by.Rennell also long <lb/>
            previously, but on different grounds. “ There is absolutely nothing," <lb/>
            he says, “ according to Air. Ainsworth's notion of the route, but <lb/>
            the existence of villages round the modern castle of Khanus, to <lb/>
            identify that district with the group of villages where the Greeks <lb/>
            rested a week; for Mr. Ainsworth goes beyond his author, when <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            he speaks of ‘ the palace of the satrap,' and would fain suppose the <lb/>
            modern castle to be on the same site.”—The impression I received <lb/>
            and still retain, however, is that the women and girls at the foun­ <lb/>
            tain, when the Greeks told them that they were going to the satrap, <lb/>
            answered by informing them, that he was about a parasang off, <lb/>
            meaning thereby, not that he and his army were hovering at that <lb/>
            distance, but that his residence was there; and having read of the <lb/>
            palace of the satrap Orontes and of that of Tiribazus a few pages <lb/>
            before, I pictured to myself a palace or castle for the satrap of the <lb/>
            Khanus district, more especially since the chief of that district <lb/>
            dwells in a feudal castle to the present day.</p>
          <p>In identifications like these, the traveller often differs from the <lb/>
            cabinet geographer or scholar, inasmuch as his identifications are <lb/>
            not only founded upon what exists, but that he has also in his <lb/>
            mind at the same time what he does not enter into at length, a <lb/>
            mass of negative matter as to what does not exist. The mere <lb/>
            bare results thus presented often do not satisfy the critic upon the <lb/>
            grounds given. When he doubts or condemns an identification, <lb/>
            however, upon such grounds he does not take sufficiently into <lb/>
            consideration, that the territory perhaps presents no other re­ <lb/>
            sources. Thus, for example, in the present instance, it is quite <lb/>
            possible that the Greeks held on a due northerly course. I by no <lb/>
            means wish to insist upon the point that they did not do so, as <lb/>
            the north wind blew in their faces, and they would, in such a case, <lb/>
            reach the upper and watered valleys of the Tag Tagh.</p>
          <p>But what has been omitted to be explained in the “Travels in <lb/>
            the Track," is that these upper valleys of the Bin Gill Tagh, and <lb/>
            Tag Tagh, are utterly unproductive, except of a little short grass, <lb/>
            and a narrow fringe or belt of low wood on the banks of the rivu­ <lb/>
            lets. They are neither cultivated nor inhabited.</p>
          <p>It seems much more likely, therefore, that the Greeks found <lb/>
            villages and cultivation, and heard of a satrap's residence, where <lb/>
            there are in the present day villages and a chieftain’s residence, <lb/>
            than that they found such higher up the country, where there are <lb/>
            none such nor traces of such to be met with, nor a possible culti­ <lb/>
            vation to induce the natives to settle at such a point.</p>
          <p>THE ARAS.—After stopping eight days at these villages, the <lb/>
            Greeks started under guidance of a native, who, leading them three <lb/>
            days' marches without coming to any villages, so irritated Cheiri­ <lb/>
            sophus that he struck him, which was the occasion of his running <lb/>
            away in the night. From what follows in the account of their <lb/>
            journey, it appears that during these three days the Greeks turned <lb/>
            the Tag Tagh, an easterly spur of the Bin Gül Tagh, and reached <lb/>
            the tributaries of the Aras. This they would do travelling from <lb/>
            fifteen to twenty geographic miles in the three days. The <unclear>Bin</unclear> <lb/>
            Giil Tagh, one of the remarkable mountains of Central Armenia, <lb/>
            gives birth to the south, to tributaries to the Murad su, to the west <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            and north-west, to the tributaries to the Western Euphrates, and <lb/>
            to the north and north-east, to tributaries to the Aras.</p>
          <p>River Phasin or ARAXES.—After losing the guide, the Greeks <lb/>
            are described as proceeding seven days' journey, five parasangs <lb/>
            each day, along the river Phasis. I am indebted for this important <lb/>
            correction of all previous versions to Professor Maiden, who has <lb/>
            published it in the 7th number of the Classical Museum, April, <lb/>
            1845, p. 36 et seq. There is, the Professor states, no real ambiguity <lb/>
            in the meaning of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρά</foreign> in such a context. The meaning <lb/>
            is the same as in v. 10. 1, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔπλεον ήμέρας δύο παρα την γη̃ν</foreign>, " they <lb/>
            sailed two days along the coast."</p>
          <p>This being admitted, then, it will be observed that Xenophon, <lb/>
            who mistook the Aras for the Colehian Phasis, describes it as only <lb/>
            a plethrum, or a hundred feet, broad, where they joined it. This <lb/>
            would show that it was not far from its sources. With such an <lb/>
            indefinite point to start from, and a very uncertain value of the <lb/>
            parasang in a journey through snow, it is difficult to measure off <lb/>
            35 parasangs on the map. Allowing, however, two geog. miles to <lb/>
            the parasang, the utmost that can be done under the circumstances, <lb/>
            70 miles laid down on the map to illustrate the routes by Mr. Ains­ <lb/>
            worth, Mr. Suter, Mr. Brant, and Lord Pollington, published in <lb/>
            the 10th volume of the Journ. of the Roy. Geog. Soc., would carry <lb/>
            the Greeks to the junction of the Karu su, or river of Oran, with <lb/>
            the Aras.</p>
          <p>Professor Malden has conjectured, that having mistaken the <lb/>
            Araxes for the Phasis, they followed the course of the stream, in <lb/>
            the hope that it would lead them towards the Euxine, till, seeing <lb/>
            that it continued to flow eastward, they resolved to try a somewhat <lb/>
            more direct line. Now, nothing would have so aroused the Greeks <lb/>
            to a sense of the mistake they were labouring under so much as <lb/>
            coming to a large river flowing into the Aras from the north, at <lb/>
            the very same time that the supposed Phasis took a bend rather <lb/>
            to the south of east. Nothing would be left for them in their de­ <lb/>
            spair but (having crossed the Aras at its head) to turn away from <lb/>
            it and follow the course of the new river they had come to north­ <lb/>
            wards towards its sources. The distances granted are, however, <lb/>
            very great, and the very same reflections may have forced them­ <lb/>
            selves upon them at the very first stream they came to which <lb/>
            flowed from the north-the river of Hassan Kalah. This would <lb/>
            give a distance of fifty miles direct, and upwards of seventy miles <lb/>
            by river from the point at which Mr. Brant and myself crossed the <lb/>
            Aras. That river is already at that point fifty to sixty yards in <lb/>
            width, the current rapid, the water reaching above the horse's <lb/>
            girths. See Brant's Journal (Journ. of Roy. Geog. Soc. vol. x. p <lb/>
            344). If the Greeks passed it to the westward of this, then (which <lb/>
            if, not likely, as the Bin Gill Tagh presented an impediment to so <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            doing) the chances of their not having got beyond the junction of <lb/>
            the Hassan Kalah tributary, is still further increased.</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney's view of this portion of the retreat is as fol­ <lb/>
            lows (ii. 229):</p>
          <p>"From hence, (the Murad su,) in a north-western direction, to <lb/>
            a point where the river Aras, or Phasis of Xenophon, is generally <lb/>
            fordable, namely, at the junction of the Hassan Kalah su and the <lb/>
            Bin Gül su, near Kupri Kiui, (Bridge village,) it cannot be less <lb/>
            than from seventy to eighty miles; since the shorter distance from <lb/>
            the latter point to the upper part of the Murad su, near Kara Ki­ <lb/>
            lisa, (Black or ruined Church,) is sixty-six miles."</p>
          <p>"It has just been seen, that the distance in question occupied <lb/>
            thirteen marches, or, including four days not particularly men­ <lb/>
            tioned, about sixty-nine parasangs. But, as it is to be observed <lb/>
            that these were intended to be road distances answering to one <lb/>
            hour, it may fairly be presumed, that an army could not accom­ <lb/>
            plish much more than about one mile in each, especially through <lb/>
            snow so deep that the whole of the specified time must have been <lb/>
            consumed between the rivers Euphrates and Araxes; even the <lb/>
            pressing marches through Mesopotamia were less than two miles <lb/>
            per hour. We are told, that it even became necessary to tie bags <lb/>
            stuffed with hay to the horses'feet to prevent their sinking." It <lb/>
            is obvious, that if we admit such a judicious estimate of the value <lb/>
            of the parasang, under the described circumstances, that the diffi­ <lb/>
            culties of explaining the marches between the Euphrates and the <lb/>
            Black Sea will be considerably diminished, and that the Greeks, <lb/>
            notwithstanding their seven days' journey along the Aras, as estab­ <lb/>
            lished by Professor Malden, may in reality have only travelled <lb/>
            some thirty-five miles along that river, and not beyond the first <lb/>
            westerly—not northerly—affluent, the river of Hassan Kalahsi. <lb/>
            The point at which that river joins the Aras is thirty miles by map <lb/>
            from where Mr. Brant and myself crossed the Aras, but it would <lb/>
            be a good thirty-five or more by the river.</p>
          <p>PASS OF TilE TAOCHI.—Quitting, it is to be supposed, the Aras, <lb/>
            the Greeks advanced two days' journey, ten parasangs; when on <lb/>
            the pass that led over the mountains into the plain, the Chalybes, <lb/>
            Tnochi, and Phasians were drawn up to oppose their progress.* <lb/>
            As soon as they had gained this pass, and had sacrificed and erect­ <lb/>
            ed a trophy, they went down into the plain before them, and <lb/>
            arrived at a number of villages stored with abundance of excellent <lb/>
            provisions. These villages would apparently be situated in the <lb/>
            valley of Kara Oran or Kara Osman, which is watered by the <note type="footnote"> * It is to be supposed that these ten miles were performed over the rocky <lb/>
            districts between Kupri Kiui and Khorasan. Hamilton describes the road <lb/>
            as, after leaving Kupri Kiui, being soon confined to a narrow pass between <lb/>
            high hills on the left and the river on the right. (i. p. 185.) </note> <lb/>

            Ruin."</p>
          <p>MOUNTAIN STRONG-HOLD OF THE TAOCHIANS. — From hence <lb/>
            they marched five days' journey, thirty parasangs, to the country <lb/>
            of the Taochi, where provisions beginning to fail them, they at­ <lb/>
            tacked one of the fastnesses, which is described as containing no <lb/>
            houses, but defended by high rocks, down which the Taochians <lb/>
            tolled great stones.</p>
          <p>Supposing the country of the Taochians to correspond to that <lb/>
            which is in part occupied by the Suwanli or Sughanli Tagh, if the <lb/>
            parasang did not amount to more than a mile, in a difficult and <lb/>
            hostile country, this journey would have only conducted the <lb/>
            Greeks to the head waters of the river of Bardes. The forest range <lb/>
            of the Suwanli 'agii is described by Hamilton as constituting an <lb/>
            important and interesting feature in the geography of that part of <lb/>
            the country, being the only district in which forests of any extent <lb/>
            are to be found for many miles round, and its passage by Bardes <lb/>
            and Gushlah is full of natural obstacles.</p>
          <p>It is to be observed that traces of the name of Taochi are sup­ <lb/>
            posed to be found in the Tauk or Taok of the Turks, and Tuchi or <lb/>
            Taoutchie of the Georgian districts. These people and those of <lb/>
            the little Kabarda are said by Captain Stoltzman, as quoted by <lb/>
            Colonel Chesney, to still retire occasionally into wattled enclo­ <lb/>
            sures.</p>
          <p>COUNTRY OF THE CHALYBES.—Hence they advanced, seven <lb/>
            days' journey, a distance of fifty parasangs, through the country of <lb/>
            the Chalybes, who had their dwellings in strong places, in which <lb/>
            they had also laid up their provisions, so that the Greeks could <lb/>
            get nothing from that country, but lived upon the cattle which <lb/>
            they had taken from the Taochi.</p>
          <p>The distance from the head waters of the river ofBardes to the <lb/>
            main tributary to the Arpa chai, is as the crow flies some forty <lb/>
            miles, but by following the road to Kars, as the great road does in <lb/>
            the present day, and crossing the mountains from liars to the <lb/>
            Arpa chai at Kizil Chak Chak, it would be upwards of fifty miles <lb/>
            —a fair allowance for the fifty parasangs under the circumstances <lb/>
            described in the text.</p>
          <p>RIVER HARPASUS.—The Greeks next arrived at the river Har­ <lb/>
            pasus, the breadth of which was four plethra. Supposing the <lb/>
            modern Arpa chai to represent the Harpasus, we have shown, that <lb/>
            the point where the Greeks would be expected to touch that river, <lb/>
            by the distances given, would be at or where the present high road <lb/>
            from Arzrum and Kars to Ardahan and Ahkiskah crosses it at <lb/>
            Kizil Chak Chak. It must be already a goodly river at such a <lb/>
            place, but there are no data for giving it a width of four hundred <lb/>
            feet. So much obscurity indeed pervades this part of the route, <lb/>
            that I am much inclined to doubt the correctness of the identifica. <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            tion of the Harpasus of Xenophon with the modern Arpa chai, <lb/>
            and with Colonel Chesney and Layard to consider that the histo­ <lb/>
            rian applied that name to the river now called the Juruk su or <lb/>
            l'choruk su, and which was called in later times the Apsarus and <lb/>
            Acampsis. The Juruk in the lower part of its course would pre­ <lb/>
            sent a width fully of four hundred feet.</p>
          <p>COUNTRY OF THE SCYTHINI.—Hence they proceeded through <lb/>
            the territory of the Scythini, four days' journey, making twenty <lb/>
            parasangs, over a level tract, until they came to some villages, in <lb/>
            which they halted three days, and collected provisions.</p>
          <p>The distance here given, allowing about It mile for the para­ <lb/>
            sang, would carry the Greeks up the valley of the Arpa chai across <lb/>
            the watershed of that river, and down the valley of the river of <lb/>
            Olti, a tributary to the Juruk su, to about the site of Olti itself. <lb/>
            Or it is possible that they may have crossed the country that in­ <lb/>
            tervenes between the river of Olti and the Araxes in a more direct <lb/>
            line to the Juruk su, nearly touching Hamilton's route, at the head <lb/>
            waters of the rivers of Narman, Liefgaff, Turtum, and Yani Kiui, <lb/>
            a line of country which Hamilton's, and still more lately Mr. <lb/>
            Curzon's, descriptions show to be wooded, rocky, precipitous, and <lb/>
            most difficult.</p>
          <p>CITY OF GYMNIAS.—From this place they advanced four days' <lb/>
            journey, twenty parasangs, to a large, rich, and populous city, called <lb/>
            Gymnias, from which the governor of the country sent the Greeks <lb/>
            a guide, to conduct them through a region at war with the people.</p>
          <p>The distance given of twenty parasangs, allowing l½ mile per <lb/>
            parasang, would carry the Greeks along the valley of the Olti river <lb/>
            and up that of the Juruk su to Ispir or Ispira, a town of great <lb/>
            antiquity, described at length by Hamilton in his Researches (vol. <lb/>
            i. p. 219 et seq.).</p>
          <p>It is to be observed also, that supposing Mount Theches to cor­ <lb/>
            respond to Tekiya Tagh, it is about sixty miles thence to Ispir, <lb/>
            following the valley of the Juruk su; this in five days would give <lb/>
            an average of twelve miles a day, which the Greeks may well be <lb/>
            supposed to have got over in a route that did not present so many <lb/>
            difficulties as usual.</p>
          <p>It is evident, however, that it will require further corroborative <lb/>
            testimony before Gymnias can be admitted to be the same as the <lb/>
            modem Ispir.</p>
          <p>MOUNT THECHES.—On the fifth day from Gymnias, distances <lb/>
            not given, they came to a mountain, the name of which was The­ <lb/>
            ches, and whence, to their great delight, the Greeks saw the sea.</p>
          <p>The distance allowed between Mount Theches and the country <lb/>
            of the Macrones, which in such a country did not much exceel <lb/>
            twenty miles, places Mount Theehes between the Juruk su, the <lb/>
            river of Baiburt, and the Kurash Tagh. It is in the present day <lb/>
            called Takiya Tagh, which may be a corruption of Theches. OY <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            Theches of it, or it may simply mean the mountain of the monas­ <lb/>
            tery. This is the name also given to it by Hamilton, who adds a <lb/>
            sketch of a remarkable mountain castle near Takiya. Mr. Vivien <lb/>
            de St. Martin calls the mountain in his map Hak Mesdjidy Tagh. <lb/>
            This name, like that of Takiya, refers to some holy edifice ex­ <lb/>
            isting at the spot, and indicates that tradition has preserved the <lb/>
            character imputed to the mountain by Xenophon down to existing <lb/>
            times.</p>
          <p>COUNTRY OF THE MACRONES. — From Mount Theches the <lb/>
            Greeks advanced three days' journey, a distance of ten parasangs, <lb/>
            through the country of the Macrones. On the first day they came <lb/>
            to a river which divided the territory of the Macrones from that of <lb/>
            the Scythini. On their right they had an eminence extremely <lb/>
            difficult of access, and on their left another river, into which the <lb/>
            boundary river which they had to cross emptied itself.</p>
          <p>Allowing l½ geo. miles to the parasang in this difficult country, <lb/>
            the country of the Macrones would correspond to the mountain <lb/>
            land that lies between Gumush Khana or the silver mines, and the <lb/>
            Kara Darah su, the Hyssus of Arrian's Periplus. This mountain <lb/>
            is called Korash Tagh in Brant's map of 1836. The river to which <lb/>
            they came would appear to correspond with the river beyond <lb/>
            Kalah Kiui, or castle village, one of the head tributaries of the <lb/>
            Kharshut river, or river of Gumush Khana, into which the river of <lb/>
            Kalah Kiui itself flows from the left. As the Grecks crossed the <lb/>
            boundary river above its junction with the river to the left, this <lb/>
            very fact of its being in such a direction shows that it must have <lb/>
            been a stream flowing westward, and not eastward. Had it had <lb/>
            an easterly flow, and yet been to the left hand, it must have joined <lb/>
            the boundary river before the Greeks crossed it.</p>
          <p>COUNTRY OF TilE COLCHIANS.—The Macrones conducted the <lb/>
            Greeks through their country for three days, until they brought <lb/>
            them to the confines of the Colchians. At this point there was a <lb/>
            range of hills high, but accessible, and upon them the Colchians <lb/>
            were drawn up in array. Having passed the summit, the Greeks <lb/>
            encamped in a number of villages containing abundance of pro­ <lb/>
            visions.</p>
          <p>These villages, from the distance travelled the next day to Trebi­ <lb/>
            zond, manifestly correspond with the Greek villages which occupy <lb/>
            at the present day the head of the valley, whence a very precipitous <lb/>
            road leads down from the Kohat or Kolat Tagh (quære Kulak <lb/>
            Tagh, mountain of the pass) of Brant's map, (Journ. of Roy. Geo <lb/>
            Soc. vol. vi.,) and the Kara Kaban of Hamilton, and which appeart <lb/>
            to have been the range on which the Colchians had posted them <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>The rivulet in question is called Surmel in Hamilton's map, <lb/>
            where one of the villages is marked as Jivislik. (Kara Kapan and <lb/>
            Djevisak of St. Martin's map.) It is recorded in my own notes <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            as Muhurjï-wooded valley with Greek villages, and a bridge over <lb/>
            rivulet, at the foot of the Kara Kapan.</p>
          <p>TREBIZOND.—From the villages of the Colchians, the Greeks <lb/>
            proceeded two days' march, seven parasangs, and arrived at Trebi­ <lb/>
            zond, a Greek city of large population, on the Euxine Sea; a <lb/>
            colony of Sinope, but lying in the territory of the Colchians. <lb/>
            Here they stayed thirty days, encamping in the villages of the <lb/>
            Colchians.</p>
          <p>It is obvious that, in sketching out a possible line of travel <lb/>
            through the countries of the Taochians, Chalybes, Scythians, Ma­ <lb/>
            cronians, and Colchians, a region as yet little investigated, that <lb/>
            other explanations might be admitted. One of these is, that the <lb/>
            Greeks took a more central line, between the Aras and the Juruk <lb/>
            su. This is not at all improbable. Hamilton explored this country <lb/>
            from Bardes to Ispira, and found it so mountainous and difficult, <lb/>
            as to fully account for a very great lapse of time in traversing it <lb/>
            in almost a direct line. The difficulty that would remain to ac­ <lb/>
            count for here, would be the account given of the Greeks having <lb/>
            arrived at the Harpasns where it was four plethra in breadth. <lb/>
            But may not this have been the Bardes su or the river of Narman, <lb/>
            or some other river, not yet correctly delineated on the maps in the <lb/>
            interval between the Juruk su, the Aras, the Olti river, and the <lb/>
            river of Kars ? Colonel Chesney is with a still greater degree of <lb/>
            probability inclined to identify the Harpasus with the Juruk su <lb/>
            or Tchoruk su—variously designated as the Apsarus and Acampsis <lb/>
            by the Romans.</p>
          <p>Upon the subject of the prolonged marches made by the Greeks <lb/>
            between the Aras and the Euxine, Colonel Chesney offers the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing general explanations.</p>
          <p>"On the second day after crossing the latter river, (the Araxes,) <lb/>
            which Colonel Chesney supposes to have been crossed, as previously <lb/>
            observed, near Kupri Kiui, the Greeks discovered the inhabitants of <lb/>
            the surrounding countries, namely, the Chalybeans, the Taochians, <lb/>
            and the Phasians, assembled to dispute their passage, and occupy­ <lb/>
            ing strong ground, probably between the territory of the two <lb/>
            last.</p>
          <p>Here, as when difficulties of the same kind previously occurred, <lb/>
            the eminences were gained by an attack made in the flank by <lb/>
            volunteers; and the disheartened defenders having fled with loss, <lb/>
            the Greeks got possession of some well-stored villages in advance.</p>
          <p>During the succeeding five marches of thirty parasangs, made <lb/>
            through the territory of the Taochians, provisions were scarce, it <lb/>
            being the custom of the country people to place their supplies in <lb/>
            secret fastnesses, probably wattled enclosures, such as those still in <lb/>
            use in the Little Kabarda, and district of Tuchi. One of these in­ <lb/>
            trenchments, containing a number of oxen, asses, and sheep, was, <lb/>
            however, taken after a prolonged resistance; during which the <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            women chose to perish rather than fall into the power of the <lb/>
            Greeks.</p>
          <p>The latter now proceeded a distance of fifty parasangs through <lb/>
            the territory of the Chalybeans to the river Harpasus, which they <lb/>
            accomplished in seven marches; notwithstanding the dime ilties <lb/>
            caused by the most warlike and the most troublesome people <lb/>
            hitherto encountered. The system of hostilities pursued chiefly <lb/>
            consisted in constantly harassing the rear; but when pressed in <lb/>
            turn, they retreated to fastnesses in which their provisions were <lb/>
            secured: so that the Greeks would have been starved by their <lb/>
            systematic and persevering opposition, had it not been for the <lb/>
            supply of cattle taken from the Taochians.</p>
          <p>The difficulties experienced by Rennell, Ainsworth, and other <lb/>
            commentators in following this part of the retreat of the Ten Thou­ <lb/>
            sand, will be greatly lessened if it be borne in mind, that the daily <lb/>
            marches, through deep snow in January, the army being also <lb/>
            harassed by the Chalybeans, must have been very short. From <lb/>
            the supposed crossing-place on the Aras, keeping a little way <lb/>
            northward of the direct line, it is about 110 miles to the Tchoruk <lb/>
            su (Juruk su) or Acampsis, near Kara Aghatch, which would <lb/>
            coincide with the fourteen marches given by Xenophon, as docs <lb/>
            also the position of the river in question with the Harpasus; the <lb/>
            last seven marches being, as we are informed, through the country <lb/>
            of the Chalybeans, the Chaldeans of Strabo (xii. 549).</p>
          <p>This probably was the southern part of the district of Tchildir; <lb/>
            for the Chaldeans, as a separate people, occupied a tract next to <lb/>
            the Colchians, which was, however, afterwards extended to Pontus, <lb/>
            and formed a considerable kingdom under Mithridates.</p>
          <p>Quitting the river Harpasus, twenty parasangs, made in four <lb/>
            marches, brought the Greeks to a halting-place at some villages, <lb/>
            possibly near the present town of Baiburt, in which they remained <lb/>
            three days to obtain provisions. From hence, apparently proceed­ <lb/>
            ing towards the western pass through the great northern chain, <lb/>
            they made twenty parasangs in three additional marches, to the <lb/>
            rich and well-inhabited city of Gymnias. Possibly this place may <lb/>
            now be represented by the small town of Gemeri on the Kara su, <lb/>
            an affluent of the river Frat; in which case the distance thither, <lb/>
            being about 60 miles, would occupy seven or eight marches along <lb/>
            the slope of the Paryadres, a branch of the Taurus, or, as it is <lb/>
            stated, through the country of the Scythinians. This appears to be <lb/>
            the only trace of that ephemeral power, which commenced with <lb/>
            the Sacae or Scythians, on the banks of the Araxes; from whence <lb/>
            the people extended their name and authority over Imiretia, Col­ <lb/>
            chis, Georgia, the Caucasus, Media, Persia, and even Palestine; <lb/>
            according to Herodotus, the same people ruled Asia during twenty- <lb/>
            eight years.</p>
          <p>On leaving Gymnias, the guide furnished by the satrap of the <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            district delighted the Greeks by saying that he would forfeit his <lb/>
            head if he did not show them the sea in five marches; and ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly on the fifth day, in ascending the holy mountain of The­ <lb/>
            dies, the Greeks gave a tremendous shout of surprise and delight, <lb/>
            on finding his promise realized. The mountain alluded to may be <lb/>
            the present Gaur Tagh; (from the summit of which Colonel Ches­ <lb/>
            ney saw the sea in 1831;) and from thence to Tarabuzun, although <lb/>
            the direct distance is not great, the journey occupied five days with <lb/>
            good horses. This was owing to the necessity of passing along <lb/>
            what in reality is more a winding chasm than a mountain valley <lb/>
            in the ordinary acceptation of the word; and it is scarcely necessary <lb/>
            to observe, that the marches through the mountains of Kurdistan <lb/>
            and Armenia often must have presented difficulties and caused <lb/>
            delays susceptible of the same kind of explanation.</p>
          <p>Gaur Tagh is not, however, the only mountain in this part of the <lb/>
            country from which the Euxine may be seen, for the guide inform­ <lb/>
            ed the author that it was visible from three other peaks, namely, <lb/>
            the Zigani mountain, two hours N. W. of Godol; again, with a <lb/>
            more extensive view, from Fililein, two hours on the other side of <lb/>
            Godol towards Gumish Khanah ; and, lastly, at the higher peak of <lb/>
            Karagul, three hours southward of the latter.</p>
          <p>The name of the first, " Infidel mountain," and its position with <lb/>
            respect to Tarabazun, claim for it the honour of representing the <lb/>
            holy Theches; the localities also appear to correspond to the de­ <lb/>
            seription. Xenophon tells us that in the first day they came to a <lb/>
            river separating the Macronians from the Scythinians; and on this, <lb/>
            which disembogned into another river, the Macronians were drawn <lb/>
            up to dispute the passage. A negotiation, followed by a treaty, <lb/>
            produced, however, friendship with that people.</p>
          <p>Eleven or twelve miles N. N. W. of Gaur Tagh (visible from <lb/>
            thence) is the village of Damajula, which is situated near the <lb/>
            meeting of four valleys and two rivers. One of the latter coming <lb/>
            from the N. W. has remarkably steep banks, rising fifteen or <lb/>
            twenty feet, with hills above, of difficult ascent on the eastern side, <lb/>
            and a chain of more accessible shoulders on the opposite; both are <lb/>
            covered with firs, and silver poplars of small size. This valley <lb/>
            would have been met during the first day's march from Gaur <lb/>
            Tagh, and troops posted on the opposite sides would be with­ <lb/>
            in speaking distance, although they must have been complete­ <lb/>
            ly separated by the difficult nature of the ravine. Peace being <lb/>
            concluded, the Greeks were conducted by this people during the <lb/>
            succeeding three marches through the remainder of their territory; <lb/>
            no doubt following the valleys of Damoulee and Godol, till at the <lb/>
            termination of the latter, and about thirty-one miles from Dama­ <lb/>
            jula, they entered that of Gumush Khanah, a little northward of <lb/>
            the town of this name.</p>
          <p>The great and deep valley in question runs northward from <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            chence along the foot of the Colchian mountains for about twelve <lb/>
            miles, where an abutment of the latter, called Karakaban, crosses <lb/>
            it near Zigani, at an elevation of 5300 feet, and the pass thus <lb/>
            formed was occupied in force by the Colchians.</p>
          <p>Being in a state of hostility with the latter, the Macronians re­ <lb/>
            turned to their own country, a distance of about forty-three miles, <lb/>
            which would correspond with the three marches made in a more <lb/>
            favourable season (February) than the preceding part of the march. <lb/>
            It is difficult to imagine a stronger barrier or a more formidable <lb/>
            position than that which here presented itself, to exercise the ta­ <lb/>
            lent and display the unshaken intrepidity of the Grecian chief. <lb/>
            Owing to the nature of the ground, as well as the numbers by <lb/>
            which it was occupied, the Greeks, even could they have passed <lb/>
            the latter unbroken, would have been out-flanked had they attack­ <lb/>
            ed in line. But Xenophon, without hesitation, turned this circum­ <lb/>
            stance to his own advantage, by a master-piece of tactics hitherto <lb/>
            unequalled.</p>
          <p>The Greeks were formed in eleven columns, three of which, <lb/>
            each consisting of GOO targeteers and archers, occupied the flanks <lb/>
            and centre; these ascended the hill at such distances from one <lb/>
            another that Xenophon not only outstretched the flanks of the <lb/>
            Colchians, but was also prepared to attack them in rear, if, con­ <lb/>
            trary to expectation, they had stood the shock and maintained <lb/>
            their ground. At first the Colchians advanced, but before they <lb/>
            closed with the Greek columns, they opened right and left, and <lb/>
            eventually fled in disorder, abandoning the well-stored villages in <lb/>
            their rear.</p>
          <p>After three days' halt, suffering from the quantity and nature of <lb/>
            the honey, which, from the abundance of the azalea pontica, the <lb/>
            rhododendron ponticum, and the hellebore, in this fine country, <lb/>
            affects the brain for a time, the Greeks, in two marches of seven <lb/>
            parasangs, reached the villages near Tarabuzun (Trebizond). <lb/>
            (Vol. ii. p. 230 et seq.)</p>
          <p>Colonel Chesney's explanation gains a manifest advantage in <lb/>
            simplicity of detail over mine, by his not taking the Greeks out <lb/>
            the way to reach the Arpa chai, Hamilton's Harpasus, but it <lb/>
            loses it again by going out of the way to the westward to the <lb/>
            Gaur Tagh, because the Colonel saw the sea from that point. It <lb/>
            is evident that there must be many heights of the mountains east <lb/>
            as well as west of the river of Gumush Khanah, from whence the <lb/>
            sea can be discerned. In this part of the retreat, where probably <lb/>
            the points will never be all definitively settled, that explanation <lb/>
            which presents the greatest degree of simplicity, and at the same <lb/>
            time meets most closely all the exigencies of the case, will be the <lb/>
            one which will ultimately meet with the most general acceptance.</p>
          <p>M. Vivien de Saint Martin, in his admirable Histoire des Decou­ <lb/>
            vertes Gengraphiques, (tome ii. p. 324,) after identifying Gymnias <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            with a village called Djinnis, situated near the left bank of the Eu. <lb/>
            phrates, about six leagues from Arzrum to the westward, says:</p>
          <p>“The body of the Greeks having left Gymnias or Djinnis, on <lb/>
            the Upper Euphrates, must have ascended the Kop Tagh, de­ <lb/>
            scended the Massa Deressi (Marsah Darahsi) or river of Baiburt, <lb/>
            then re-ascended up the course of the river of Balakhor (Balak <lb/>
            Hur, "Fish stream?") to the Takiya Tagh, where the name of <lb/>
            Theches is still preserved. From thence they descended to the <lb/>
            upper valley of the Balak Hur, which led them to the precipitous <lb/>
            chain of the Kolat Tagh, evidently the same as the mountain of <lb/>
            the Colchians of Xenophon; this chain separates the two water­ <lb/>
            sheds, which pour their waters to the south in the Upper Tchoruk <lb/>
            or river of Ispir, to the north directly to the Black Sea, towards <lb/>
            the coast of Trebizond. The divers circumstances of the narrative <lb/>
            do not appear to us to leave the least doubt upon this itinerary, of <lb/>
            which nature has marked the features in an ineffaceable manner <lb/>
            in this country of deeply contrasted configurations."</p>
          <p>It is scarcely necessary, but for fear of misconception it may be <lb/>
            as well to remark that this identification of the Kolat Tagh with <lb/>
            the mountain of the Colchians, upon the strength of the name, will <lb/>
            not be received by scholars in this country.</p>
          <p>Professor Malden, after recurring to the mistake made by Major <lb/>
            Rennell, Kinneir, and myself, in supposing that the Greeks marched <lb/>
            seven days after the guide ran away from them before they reached <lb/>
            the Phasis; adds,</p>
          <p>“Rennell, however, has probably fallen into a further mistake <lb/>
            in thinking that the Greeks did not cross the Harpasus; for this <lb/>
            seems to be his opinion. He supposes that they came to the river <lb/>
            between its conflux with the Araxes and the conflux of the river of <lb/>
            Kars with the other streams that form it, and then turned back <lb/>
            from it towards the west; so that their subsequent marches for <lb/>
            four days were still between the Harpasus and the Phasis or <lb/>
            Araxes; and he is inclined to identify the city of Gymnias with a <lb/>
            modern town on the latter river. Xenophon certainly does not <lb/>
            say distinctly that they crossed the Harpasus, but his language <lb/>
            implies it. He says, ‘After this the Greeks arrived at the river <lb/>
            Harpasus, which was four hundred feet broad. Thence they <lb/>
            marched through the country of the Scythini,' &amp;c. (iv. 7. 18). He <lb/>
            does not say that they did not cross it, and the notice of the breadth <lb/>
            of the river is not much to the purpose unless they did cross it; <lb/>
            and besides, he uses the very same language with respect to rivers <lb/>
            which were certainly crossed. (See i. 4, §§ 9 and 19; and iv. 4, §§ <lb/>
            3 and 7.)</p>
          <p>" But, if they crossed it, it was probably the branch called the <lb/>
            river of Kars which they crossed, not the stream below the junc­ <lb/>
            tion of this branch with those to the east of it; otherwise, we <lb/>
            should have them still persevering in their mistaken easterly course; <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            and they would have had to cross the eastern branch on their way <lb/>
            back towards the west. In crossing the river of Kars they would <lb/>
            be going northward; and if they then turned westward, they would <lb/>
            fall in with no considerable river till they came to the Apsarus or <lb/>
            Shoruk, (Juruk,) which accords with Xenophon's narrative; the <lb/>
            Shoruk being identified with the river of the Macrones.</p>
          <p>"After examining all the circumstances of the story, if we sup­ <lb/>
            pose the Greeks to have crossed the Phasis at the point which <lb/>
            Rennell indicates, near the modern bridge of Koban Kupri, (same <lb/>
            as Kupri Kiui,) or perhaps even nearer to its source; and then, <lb/>
            in consequence of their confusion between the two rivers Phasis, <lb/>
            to have turned eastward, and marched seven days along its north­ <lb/>
            ern bank, and even when they left the river to have inclined but <lb/>
            little towards the north, and to have reached the Harpasus about <lb/>
            the junction of the river of Kars with the other branches, thus <lb/>
            traversing the diagonal of the space between the Araxes and <lb/>
            the Arpa-su, we assign them a march, which in winter, through <lb/>
            an unknown country, and in the presence of an active enemy, <lb/>
            might well occupy the time given for it. The time is twenty-one <lb/>
            days; and the distance from point to point in a straight line, if the <lb/>
            Greeks had not kept to the river-side for the first seven days, would <lb/>
            be about 120 miles. If we admit, therefore, a very reasonable ac­ <lb/>
            count of deviation from the direct course, and allow that the length <lb/>
            of the days' marches has either been over-rated by Xenophon, or <lb/>
            exaggerated by errors of the transcribers, the difficulties seem to <lb/>
            be removed.</p>

            Geog. Soc. to illustrate routes of Mr. Ainsworth, Mr. Brant, Mr. <lb/>
            Suter, and Lord Pollington, in the tenth volume of their Journal, <lb/>
            would satisfy Professor Malden that it was along the Bin Giil su <lb/>
            or Upper Aras, that the Greeks would have performed their seven <lb/>
            days’ journey, and not on the Kalah su, which they joined at Ku­ <lb/>
            pri Kiui, where I suppose them to have terminated their seven <lb/>
            days' march, having Professor Malden's correction in mind. I <lb/>
            quite agree, however, with the Professor, that the correct determine <lb/>
            ation of the position of Gymnias will do much towards elucidating <lb/>
            this most abstruse part of the narrative, and the determination <lb/>
            may yet be expected, from the constant progress that geographical <lb/>
            and archæological research are making in the East.</p>
          <p>The question has, indeed, been much narrowed <unclear>in</unclear> its cOmpass <lb/>
            already, from the day when Rennell conceived that the Greeks, <lb/>
            having lost their way, wandered up and down after crossing the <lb/>
            Araxes. A mere intimate acquaintance with the physical charae. <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            ters of northern Armenia has shown it to be a country peculiarly <lb/>
            difficult to travel in-a constant succession of hills and valleys- <lb/>
            precipices and ravines-rocky ledges and foaming torrents.</p>
          <p>Air. Curzon, who has given a very picturesque account of some <lb/>
            of the difficulties to be met with in travelling from Arzrum to <lb/>
            Trebizond, in his little work on Armenia, mentions having met <lb/>
            a rich Persian merchant on the 2nd of January, at a hovel called <lb/>
            Khaderach Khan, who had been eighteen days on the road from <lb/>
            Trebizond, which was thirty-two hours of Tartar posting. At the <lb/>
            pass of Husha-Bunar he also came upon a party of Persians, seated <lb/>
            on the ledge of a precipice, looking despairingly at a number of <lb/>
            their baggage-horses which had tumbled over, and were wallowing <lb/>
            in the snow many hundred feet below. At the Zigana Tagh, a <lb/>
            whole caravan had been overwhelmed in an avalanche. When <lb/>
            these difficulties come to be better appreciated, it will be easy to <lb/>
            understand how the Greeks should, in the depth of winter and the <lb/>
            natives in open hostility to them, have spent so much time in this <lb/>
            part of the country.</p>
          <p>“We have not," says Layard, “I conceive, sufficient data in <lb/>
            Xenophon's narrative to identify with any degree of certainty his <lb/>
            route after crossing the Euphrates. We know that about twenty <lb/>
            parasangs from that river, the Greeks encamped near a hot spring, <lb/>
            and this spring might be recognised in one of the many which <lb/>
            abound in the country. It is most probable that the Greeks took <lb/>
            the road still used by caravans through the plains of Hinnis (Kha­ <lb/>
            nus) and Hassan-Kalah, as offering the fewest difficulties. But <lb/>
            what rivers are we to identify with the Phasis and Harpasus, the <lb/>
            distance between the Euphrates and Phasis being seventy para­ <lb/>
            sangs, and between the Phasis and Harpasus ninety-five, and the <lb/>
            Harpasus being the larger of the two rivers? I cannot admit that <lb/>
            the Greeks turned to the west and passed near the site of the mo­ <lb/>
            dern Erzeroom. There are no rivers in that direction to answer <lb/>
            the description of Xenophon. Moreover, the Greeks came to the <lb/>
            high mountain, and beheld the sea for the first time, at the dis­ <lb/>
            tance of thirty-two parasangs from Trebizond. Had they taken <lb/>
            either of the three modern roads from Erzeroom to the coast, and <lb/>
            there are no others, they must hive seen the Euxine in the im­ <lb/>
            mediate vicinity of Trebizond, certainly not more than six or eight <lb/>
            parasangs from that city. I am, on the whole, inclined to believe, <lb/>
            that either the Greeks took a very tortuous course after leaving the <lb/>
            Euphrates, making daily but little actual progress towards the <lb/>
            great end of their arduous journey, the sea-coast, or that there is <lb/>
            a considerable error in the amount of parasangs given by Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon; that the Harpasus must be the Tcheronk, (Juruk,) and the <lb/>
            Phasis, either the Araxes or the Kur; and that. Mount Theches, <lb/>
            the holy mountain, from which the Greeks beheld the sea, was be­ <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            tween Batun and Trebizond, the army having followed the valley <lb/>
            of the Tcherouk, but leaving it before reaching the site of the mo­ <lb/>
            dern port on the Black Sea." (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 65.)</p>
          <p>This is, at all events, an uncompromising statement of the ob­ <lb/>
            scurities that envelope this part of the retreat, if it is not a lucid re­ <lb/>
            cord of the details. Colonel Chesney having seen the sea with his <lb/>
            own eyes from the Gaur or Jawur Tagh, is an answer to one objec­ <lb/>
            tion—that it could certainly not be seen at a greater distance than <lb/>
            six or seven parasangs from Trebizond. With regard to other diffi­ <lb/>
            culties, Layard would throw the whole subject back again to the <lb/>
            dark .period that preceded the investigations of Rennell and Kin­ <lb/>
            neir. I have endeavoured to show what has been added to those <lb/>
            able and conscientious researches, and the patience and zeal of <lb/>
            future inquirers will, most assuredly, sift what is good from all <lb/>
            these statements, will expunge that which will not stand the test <lb/>
            of time, and will arrive ultimately at some clear and satisfactory <lb/>
            conclusions regarding these very remarkable Armenian wanderings.</p>
          <p>CERASUS.—The Greeks recruited themselves at Trebizond, till <lb/>
            the supplies furnished by the surrounding country were nearly ex­ <lb/>
            hausted, and then, only a portion of the necessary shipping having <lb/>
            been obtained, they embarked their women and children, with the <lb/>
            sick and the aged, under the two oldest generals, Philesius and <lb/>
            Sophaenetus, while the remainder proceeded by land; and in three <lb/>
            marches they reached the Greek city Cerasus, or, more correctly, <lb/>
            Kerasus. Hamilton has shown that the ancient Kerasus does not <lb/>
            correspond with the modern Kirasunt, but that the site must be <lb/>
            sought for at the rivulet of Kirasun Darah su, about eight miles <lb/>
            from Cape Yurus, and not quite forty from Trebizond. Consider­ <lb/>
            ing the difficulties of the country, it is not likely, Colonel Ches­ <lb/>
            ney remarks, that a greater distance could have been accomplished <lb/>
            in three days.</p>
          <p>THE MOSSYNOECI.—The territory of the Mossynoeci or <unclear>Moschi</unclear>, <lb/>
            in which the Greeks became engaged in a struggle that had nearly <lb/>
            been disastrous to them, appears to have stretched from a little dis­ <lb/>
            lance westward of Trebizond, to the district of Pharnaeia, or up­ <lb/>
            wards of seventy miles along the coast. The fort or citadel of <lb/>
            these fierce people appears to have been in the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            Cerasus. These Mossynoeci—the Mossyni of Pliny and of Pom­ <lb/>
            ponius Mela-and who are said to derive their name from the <lb/>
            wooden turrets or the trees they dwelt in, are described as being <lb/>
            the most barbarous people the Greeks met with during the whole <lb/>
            of their journey.</p>
          <p>THE CHALYBES.—The Greeks were eight days travelling through <lb/>
            the territory of the Mossynoeci, after which they came to that of <lb/>
            the Chalybes. These were subject to the Mossynoecians, and far <lb/>
            from being numerous, they lived by the manufacture of iron, and <lb/>
            were mixed with the Tibarenians. Hamilton found the poor na­ <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            tives of the coast occupied in the present day in extracting iron <lb/>
            from the superficial soil, not exactly at this spot, but to the west <lb/>
            of Cotyora, and between the ruins of Polemonium and the Ther­ <lb/>
            modon, directly south of Uniyah Kalah, ancient Oenoe.</p>
          <p>COTYORA.—Marching through the country of the Tibareni, <lb/>
            which is described as being more campaign, and the towns near <lb/>
            the sea not so strong, the Greeks came to Cotyora, a Greek city, <lb/>
            and a colony of Sinopians, situated in the territory of the Tibare­ <lb/>
            nians. Cotyora was replaced by Pharnacia, which was built, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to Strabo, out of its spoils, and hence, in the time of Ar­ <lb/>
            rian, was already a mere village.</p>
          <p>Hamilton has identified the site with a place called Ordu or <lb/>
            Urdu, where are some remains of an ancient port, and Colonel <lb/>
            Chesney has accepted the identification. There are some diffi­ <lb/>
            culties in the way of this identification with the distances given by <lb/>
            Arrian in the Periplus of the Euxine Sea, which led me to prefer <lb/>
            the site of Parshambah. It is, however, by no means a point to <lb/>
            he insisted upon.</p>
          <p>SINOPE.—After discussing the question of forming a Greek set­ <lb/>
            tlement on the Euxine, as well as the relative advantages of a <lb/>
            homeward voyage by sea, and a march thither by land, the Greeks <lb/>
            adopted the former course; and the Cotyorians having provided <lb/>
            the necessary shipping to get rid of their uninvited guests, a fair <lb/>
            wind carried the Greeks rapidly along the coast of Paphlagonia, <lb/>
            when passing in succession the rivers Thermodon (Thirmah su), <lb/>
            Iris (Yashil Irmak), and Halys (Kiz.il Irmak), they landed at <lb/>
            Harmene or Armene, a port five miles from the flourishing city of <lb/>
            Sinope, once a Milesian colony. The site of this port and city is <lb/>
            too well known to require further illustration.</p>
          <p>HERACLEA.-After electing Cheirisophus commander-in-chief, <lb/>
            the Greeks sailed from Sinope along the coast of Paphlagonia and <lb/>
            Bithynia, to Heraclea, where the army disembarked at the close of <lb/>
            the second day's sail. Xenophon makes the Greeks pass the rivers <lb/>
            Thermodon and Halys on this journey, by mistake; instead of on <lb/>
            that from Cotyora to Sinope.</p>
          <p>The Greeks came to an anchor near to the peninsula of the <lb/>
            Acherusians-the site of one of Hercules’ fabled exploits. The <lb/>
            modern town of Harakli occupies only the south-west corner of the <lb/>
            space covered by the ancient city. The Lycus noticed by Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon is called the Kilij su or Sword river, significative of the same <lb/>
            thing-its sudden wolf-like or destructive risings.</p>
          <p>CALPE.-The Greeks, in their apparent great anxiety for booty <lb/>
            —an anxiety which attained its acme as they were getting near <lb/>
            home, divided into three bodies. The Arcadians and the Achae­ <lb/>
            ans, mustering about 4500 heavy-armed men, proceeded by sea to <lb/>
            Calpe. while the other heavy-armed men and the Thracian targe­ <lb/>
            teers, who amounted to about 2100 men under Cheirisophus, marched <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            along the coast to Thrace; Xenophon himself, at the head of 1700 <lb/>
            heavy-armed men, 300 targeteers, and 40 horsemen, marching, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to Colonel Chesney, towards Calpe in a direct line. I <lb/>
            read it, however, through the middle of the country, a phrase which <lb/>
            is twice repeated in the account of the journey, and as the district <lb/>
            that lies between the shore and the plains of Tuz-cha and Saban­ <lb/>
            cha, is occupied by the Yailah Tagh, a densely wooded range of hills, <lb/>
            totally impassable to a body of troops, there remained no alternative <lb/>
            but to keep to the shore or to take to the middle of the country. <lb/>
            My idea, as expressed in the “Travels in the Track," and which I <lb/>
            am still inclined to hold by, is, that Xenophon, in the pursuit of <lb/>
            booty,crossed the Yailah Tagh—ancient Mons Hypius,and descend­ <lb/>
            ed upon the fertile plain of Prusa ad Hypium, but on nearing of the <lb/>
            the straits in which his comrades were placed at Calpe, he re­ <lb/>
            turned thither through the westerly prolongation of the same hills. <lb/>
            The promontory of Calpe enjoyed in those times the same name as <lb/>
            that of Gibraltar. It is now called Kirpah or Kafkan Adasi.</p>
          <p>CHRYSOPOLIS.—After a long stay and no small disasters entailed <lb/>
            by the restlessness of the Greeks at Calpe, they started from that <lb/>
            place, marching through Bithynia, or Asiatic Thrace, as it was also <lb/>
            called, six days' march, to Chrysopolis—the Golden city, the mo­ <lb/>
            dern Uskudar or Scutari, opposite to Constantinople. The dis­ <lb/>
            lance travelled upon this occasion by road of some eighty miles in <lb/>
            six days, gives an average of thirteen miles a day, showing that <lb/>
            eight, ten, and twelve were as often assumed ordinary day's jour­ <lb/>
            neys, under circumstances of greater difficulties, according to the <lb/>
            exigencies of the case, and may indeed have been still less. The <lb/>
            retreat of the Ten Thousand may in reality be said to end at this <lb/>
            point, for the kind of business which they became engaged in after <lb/>
            crossing the Bosphorus, has nothing to do with that on which they <lb/>
            were originally taken from their homes by the ambition of Cyrus.</p>
          <p>The Ten Thousand in European THRACE.—From Chrysopolis <lb/>
            the Greeks crossed over to Byzantium, where they were but scur­ <lb/>
            vily treated by the Lacedaemonian admiral Anaxibius, and hence <lb/>
            obliged to quarter in some Thracian villages. Xenophon sailed in <lb/>
            the mean time to Cyzicus, (now Baal Kiz,) from whence he re­ <lb/>
            turned to his comrades, and led them all, except such as remained <lb/>
            with Neon and such as had disbanded on finding themselves in <lb/>
            Europe, to Perinthus, now Haraldi. From this point they were <lb/>
            induced by large promises to assist Seuthes, son of Maesades, to <lb/>
            recover his patrimony as one of the independent kings of Thrace. <lb/>
            In execution of this compact they marched into the country called <lb/>
            the Delta of the Thracians, above Byzantium, that of the Melino­ <lb/>
            phagi, who dwelt in the eastern part of the Kutchuk Balkhan, <lb/>
            (Little Balkhan,) and they arrived at Salmydissus or Kalmydissus, <lb/>
            now Midiyah, on the Euxine. After they had subdued the in- <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            habitants, who lived chiefly by the plunder of wrecks, they re­ <lb/>
            turned and encamped on a plain above Selymbria.</p>
          <p>The Greeks arrive at PERGAMUS.—At this point the Greeks <lb/>
            parted from Seuthes, who had failed to fulfil his promises made to <lb/>
            them, and crossing the Propontis, they repaired to Lampsacns, a <lb/>
            well-known port on the Hellespont, now called Lamsaki. From <lb/>
            hence they marched through Troas, and passing over the celebrated <lb/>
            Mount Ida, they came first to Antandrus, now Antandros, <unclear>near</unclear> <lb/>
            Adramiti. Hence they continued their march along the coast of <lb/>
            the Lydian sea, to the plain of Thebes. It is known, from Herod­ <lb/>
            otus and Livy, that the plain of Adramyttium was so called. <lb/>
            Thence they passed through Adramyttium or Atramyttium Cer <lb/>
            tonium, which is believed to be the Karene of Herodotus, and <lb/>
            Atarne, an Aeolian city-the Atarneus of Strabo, from whence <lb/>
            they reached Pergamus, where the narrative of the historian finally <lb/>
            ceases.</p>
          <p>The whole of the way, both of the Expedition and of the Re­ <lb/>
            treat, is said to have comprised two hundred and fifteen days' <lb/>
            march, of eleven hundred and fifty-five parasangs, and of thirty <lb/>
            thousand six hundred and fifty stadia. and the time employed iD <unclear/> <lb/>
            both. was a year and three months.</p><pb n="339"/>

          <p>ABYDUS, i. 1. 9. A city of Mysia on the Hellespont, nearly op­ <lb/>
            posite Sestus on the European shore. Aidos or Avido, a modern <lb/>
            village on the Hellespont, may be the site of Abydus, though the <lb/>
            conclusion from a name alone is not admitted by some critics.</p>
          <p>Acherusian Chersonese, vi. 2. 2: the scene, as it is said, of Her­ <lb/>
            cules's twelfth labour, to bring up the dog Cerberus from Acheron. <lb/>
            It ran out into the Black Sea, near Heraclea, now Harakli. Ainsw. <lb/>
            p. 215.</p>
          <p>Æolia, v. 6. 24. A district on the west coast of Asia Minor, <lb/>
            which is included by Strabo in the larger division of Mysia.</p>
          <p>Antandrus, vii. S. 7. A city on the coast of Troas, now Antan­ <lb/>
            dros.</p>
          <p>Apollonia, vii. 8. 15. A town of Mysia, on an eminence east of <lb/>
            Pergamus, oil the way to Sardis. Strabo, xiii. p. 625. It seems to <lb/>
            have been near the borders of Lydia. The exact site does not ap­ <lb/>
            pear to be determined.</p>
          <p>Arabia, i. 5. 1 ; vii. S. 25. The term Arabia is used by Xenophon <lb/>
            to designate those parts of Mesopotamia which lie south of the river <lb/>
            Khabur, the same as are described by Strabo, (i. 2, p. 65; xvi. 1, p. <lb/>
            351,) as inhabited by the Arabes Scenitae or Nomade Arabs, and <lb/>
            which are in the present day chiefly occupied by the Shamar <lb/>
            Arabs.</p>
          <p>Araxes, i. 4. 19. There is every reason to believe that what <lb/>
            Xenophon calls the Araxes, (a river of Mesopotamia running into <lb/>
            the Euphrates,) is the same river that is called Chaboras by Ptolemy <lb/>
            and Pliny, Aborras by Strabo, Zosimus, Ammianus Marcellinus, <lb/>
            and other writers: and by the Arabs, the Khabur. A contributor <lb/>
            to the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, art. Chaboras, <lb/>
            has however thought fit to question this identification.</p>

          <p>Caenae, ii. 4. 28. A large city of Mesopotamia on the Tigris. <lb/>
            Supposed by Mannert, Rennell, and others to be represented by the <lb/>
            ruins at Senn, but determined by Colonel Chesney and Colonel Raw­ <lb/>

          <p>Castolus, Plain of, i. 1. 2; D. 7. Stephanus says that Castolus <lb/>

          <p>Caystrus, Plain of, i. 2. 11. Supposed to be the plain of Bulavadin, <lb/>
            in the lower part of which is the lake called Ibar Gül. Hamilton <lb/>
            thinks at or near the village called Chai Kiui or “river village." It <lb/>
            has been placed higher up, near Surmanah. Koch and Long have <lb/>
            dissented from the latter identification. See Kühner ad i. 2. II.</p>

          <p>Ceramon Agora, or Ceramorum Forum, i. 2. 10. This place <lb/>
            appears to be represented by the modern Ushak, still a place of con­ <lb/>
            siderable traffic and commerce. Hamilton, ii. 204. Hutchinson <lb/>
            supposes it to be the same with Ceranæ, mentioned by Plin. It N. <lb/>
            v. 41.</p>
          <p>Cerasus, a Greek city on the coast of Colchis, founded by the <lb/>
            people of Sinope, v. 3. 2; 5. 10; 7. 13. The site of this place was <lb/>
            not at the modern Kirasunt, but in a valley bearing the samename <lb/>
            of Kirasun Damah su, or river of the valley of Kerasus. Hamilton, i. <lb/>
            250. Eustathius, ad Dionys. Perieg. v. 437, says that the place was <lb/>
            so named from the abundance of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεράσοι</foreign>, cherry trees, that grew <lb/>
            there. Hence it is supposed Lucullus first introduced the cherry <lb/>
            tree into Europe. Plin. II. N. xv. 5. 3; 5. 10; 7. 13.</p>
          <p>Cersus, see Carsus.</p>
          <p>Certonium, a city of Mysia, vii. 8. 8. It is not mentioned in any <lb/>
            other author: see Cramer, Asia Minor, vol. i. p. 133, who favours <lb/>
            the suggestion of Hutchinson, that we should perhaps read <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καρίνης</foreign> <lb/>
            the name of a town mentioned by Herodotus. It has been conjec­ <lb/>
            tured that it may be the Cytonium of Theopompus (Steph. s, v. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κυτώνιον</foreign>) : there being now a place named Kidonia, near the sup­ <lb/>
            posed situation of Certonium. But Cytoniumwas between Mysia and <lb/>
            Lydia ; and Xenophon’s Certonium is in Mysia. Carine or Carene <lb/>
            may have stood on the river Caresos, mentioned by Homer, II. xii. <lb/>

            Arundel (ii. 159) to be represented by ruins at the modern Chonos <lb/>
            or Khonos, but identified by Hamilton with ruins about three miles <lb/>

          <p>Tlie two charges on which Socrates was condemned to death by the Athe <lb/>
            nians, sect. 1. The first charge refuted by several arguments: for So­ <lb/>
            crates used to sacrifice to the gods, 2; he practised divination, and his <lb/>
            dœmon was no new god, 2—5; he recommended that the gods should be <lb/>
            consulted by man in perplexing circumstances, 6—9; he was guilty of no <lb/>
            impiety, he avoided vain speculations respecting the gods, and said that <lb/>
            the business of philosophy was the study of virtue, 10-17; his life was <lb/>
            in accordance with the precepts of morality, 18-20.</p>
          <p>1. I HAVE often wondered by what arguments the accusers1 <lb/>
            of Socrates persuaded the Athenians that lie deserved death <lb/>
            from the state ; for the indictment against him was to this <lb/>
            effect: SOCRATES OFFENDS AGAINST THE LAWS IN NOT <lb/>
            PAYING RESPECT2 TO THOSE GODS WHOM THE CITY RE­ <lb/>
            SPECTS, AND INTRODUCING OTHER NEW DEITIES ; HE ALSO <lb/>
            OFFENDS AGAINST THE LAWS IN CORRUPTING THE YOUTH.</p>
          <p>2 In the first place, that he did not respect the gods whom <note type="footnote"> I Plato, in his Apology of Socrates, mentions his accusers by <lb/>
            name : Melctus, a bad author of tragedies and songs (see Aristopli. <lb/>
            Ran. 1302, and the Scholiast); Anytus, who was a tanner or currier, <lb/>
            a-! appears from Xen. Apol. sect. 29, illustrated by the industry of <lb/>
            Bornemann, p. 72, ed. 1824, and p. 350, ed. 1829; and Lyco, an ora­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            the city respects, what proof did they bring ? For he was <lb/>
            seen frequently sacrificing at home, and frequently on the <lb/>
            public altars of the city; nor was it unknown that he used <lb/>
            divination ; as it was a common subject of talk, that “Socrates <lb/>
            used to say that the divinity instructed him;" and it was <lb/>
            from this circumstance, indeed, that they seem chiefly to have <lb/>
            derived the charge of introducing new deities. 3. He how­ <lb/>
            ever introduced nothing newer than those who, practising <lb/>
            divination, consult auguries, voices,1 omens, and sacrifices ; for <lb/>
            they do not imagine that birds, or people who meet them, <lb/>
            know what is advantageous for those seeking presages, but <lb/>
            that the gods, by their means, signify what will be so ; and <lb/>
            such was the opinion that Socrates entertained. 4. Most <lb/>
            people say that they are diverted from an object, or prompted <lb/>
            to it, by birds, or by the people who meet them ; but Socrates <lb/>
            spoke as he thought, for he said it was the divinity that was <lb/>
            his monitor. He also told many of his friends to do certain <lb/>
            things, and not to do others, intimating that the divinity had <lb/>
            forewarned him; and advantage attended those who obey­ <lb/>
            ed his suggestions, but repentance, those who disregarded <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>5. Yet who would not acknowledge that Socrates wished to <lb/>
            appear to his friends neither a fool nor a boaster ? But lie <lb/>
            would have seemed to be both, if, after saying that intima­ <lb/>
            tions were given him by a god, he had then been proved <lb/>
            guilty of falsehood. It is manifest, therefore, that he would <lb/>
            have uttered no predictions, if he had not trusted that they <lb/>
            would prove true. But who, in such matters, would trust to <lb/>
            any one but a god ? And how could he, who trusted the gods, <lb/>
            think that there were no gods ? 2 <note type="footnote"> I an omen taken from the voices of men. See <lb/>

            cessary consequence1 in such a manner as he thought that <lb/>
            they would be best managed; but concerning those of which <lb/>
            it was doubtful how they would terminate, he sent them to <lb/>
            take auguries whether they should be done or not. 7. Those <lb/>
            who would govern families or cities well, he said, had need of <lb/>
            divination ; for to become skilful in architecture, or working in <lb/>
            brass, or agriculture, or in commanding men, or to become a <lb/>
            critic in any such arts,2 or a good reasoner, or a skilful regu­ <lb/>
            lator of a household, or a well-qualified general, lie considered <lb/>
            as wholly matters of learning, and left to the choice of the <lb/>
            human understanding; s. but he said that the gods reserved <lb/>
            to themselves the most important particulars attending such <lb/>
            matters, of which nothing was apparent to men ; for neither <lb/>
            was it certain to him who had sown his field well, who should <lb/>
            reap the fruit of it ; nor certain to him who had built a house <lb/>
            well, who should inhabit it; nor certain to him who was skilled <lb/>
            in generalship, whether it would be for his advantage to act <lb/>
            as a general; nor certain to him who was versed in political <lb/>
            affairs, whether it would be for his profit to be at the head of <lb/>
            the state ; nor certain to him who had married a beautiful wife <lb/>
            in hopes of happiness, whether he should not incur misery by <lb/>
            her means; nor certain to him who had acquired powerful <lb/>
            connexions in the state, whether he might not be banished by <lb/>
            them: 9. and those who thought that none of these thing,; <lb/>
            depended on the gods, but that all were dependent on the <lb/>
            human understanding, he pronounced to be insane ; as he also <lb/>
            pronounced those to be insane who had recourse to omens re­ <lb/>
            specting matters which the gods had granted to men to dis <lb/>
            cover by the exercise of their faculties; as if, for instance, a <lb/>

            who does not know; or whether it would be better to place <note type="footnote">tion would be in accordance with the accusation: “ How could he, <lb/>

            thought guilty of impiety, and said that it was the duty of <lb/>

            the day he was where he was likely to meet the greatest <lb/>
            number of people; he was generally engaged in discourse, <lb/>
            and all who pleased were at liberty to hear him; 11. yet no <lb/>
            one ever either saw Socrates doing, or heard him saying, any­ <lb/>
            thing impious or profane; for lie did not dispute about the <lb/>
            nature of things as most other philosophers disputed,2 specu­ <lb/>
            lating how that which is called by sophists the world was <lb/>

            they already knew sufficient of human affairs, and therefore <lb/>
            proceeded to such subjects of meditation, or whether, when <lb/>
            they neglected human affairs entirely, and speculated on celes­ <lb/>
            tial matters, they thought that they were doing what became <lb/>
            them. 13. He wondered, too, that it was not apparent to <lb/>
            them that it is impossible for man to satisfy himself on such <lb/>
            points, since even those who pride themselves most on dis­ <lb/>

            thing is effected, they will be able to produce, whenever they <lb/>
            please, wind, rain, changes of the seasons, and whatever else <lb/>
            of that sort they may desire, or whether they have no such <lb/>
            expectation, but are content merely to know how everything <lb/>
            of that nature is generated. to. Such were the observations <lb/>
            which he made about those who busied themselves in such <lb/>
            speculations ; but for himself, he would hold discourse, from <lb/>
            time to time, on what concerned mankind, considering what <lb/>
            was pious, what impious; what was becoming, what unbe­ <lb/>
            coming; what was just, what unjust; what was sanity, <lb/>
            what insanity; what was fortitude, what cowardice; what a <lb/>
            state was, and what the character of a statesman ; what was <lb/>
            the nature of government over men, and the qualities of one <lb/>
            skilled in governing them; and touching on other subjects, <lb/>
            with which he thought that those who were acquainted were <lb/>
            men of worth and estimation, but that those who were ignor­ <lb/>
            ant of them might justly be deemed no better than slaves.</p>
          <p>17. As to those matters, then, on which Socrates gave no <lb/>
            intimation what his sentiments were, it is not at all wonderful <lb/>
            that his judges should have decided erroneously concerning <lb/>
            him; but is it not wonderful that they should have taken no <lb/>
            account of such things is all men knew ? is. For when he <note type="footnote"> VOL I. </note> <note type="footnote"> a A </note> <pb n="354"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. I. </note> <lb/>
            was a member of the senate, and had taken the senator's oath, <lb/>
            in which it was expressed that he would vote in accordance <lb/>
            with the laws, he, being president in the assembly of the <lb/>
            people when they were eager to put to death Thrasyllus, <lb/>
            Erasinides, and all the nine generals, by a single vote con­ <lb/>
            trary to the law, refused,! though the multitude were en­ <lb/>
            raged at him, and many of those in power uttered threats <lb/>
            against him, to put the question to the vote, but considered it <lb/>
            of more importance to observe his oath than to gratify the <lb/>
            people contrary to what was right, or to seek safety against <lb/>
            those who menaced him; 19. for he thought that the gods <lb/>
            paid regard to men, not in the way in which some people <lb/>
            suppose, who imagine that the gods know some things and do <lb/>
            not know others, but he considered that the gods know all <lb/>
            things, both what is said, what is done, and what is medi­ <lb/>
            tated in silence, and are present everywhere, and give ad­ <lb/>
            monitions to men concerning everything human.</p>
          <p>20. I wonder, therefore, how the Athenians were ever per­ <lb/>
            suaded that Socrates had not right sentiments concerning the <lb/>
            gods ; a man who never said or did anything impious towards <lb/>
            the gods, but spoke and acted in such a manner with respect <lb/>
            to them, that any other who had spoken and acted in the same <lb/>
            manner, would have been, and have been considered, emi­ <lb/>
            nently pious.</p>

          <p>Reply to the other charge against Soerates. He did not corrupt the youth, for <lb/>
            his whole teaching dissuaded them from vice, and encouraged them to tem­ <lb/>
            perance and virtue of every kind, sect. 1-8. He exhorted them to obey <lb/>
            the laws, 9—11. If Critias and Alcibiades, who listened to his discourses, <lb/>
            became corrupt, the fault was not his, 12—28; he endeavoured to reclaim <lb/>
            them, till they deserted him; and others, who resigned themselves wholly <lb/>
            to his instructions, became virtuous and honourable men, 28—48. Other <lb/>
            frivolous assertions refuted, 49—60. His benevolence, disinterestedness. <lb/>
            and general merits, 61—61.</p>
          <p>I. IT also seems wonderful to me, that any should have <lb/>
            been persuaded that Socrates corrupted the youth; Socrates, <lb/>
            who, in addition to what has been said of him, was not only <note type="footnote"> I See Xen. Hell. i. 7, especially sect. IS, </note> <pb n="355"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2. ] </note> <lb/>
            the most rigid of all men in the government of his passions <lb/>
            and appetites, but also most able to withstand cold, heat, and <lb/>
            every kind of labour ; and, besides, so inured to frugality, that, <lb/>
            though he possessed very little, lie very easily made it a sum­ <lb/>
            ciency. 2. How, then, being of such a character himself, <lb/>
            could he have rendered others impious, or lawless, or luxuri­ <lb/>
            ous, or incontinent, or too effeminate to endure labour ? On <lb/>
            the contrary, he restrained many of them from such vices, <lb/>
            leading them to love virtue, and giving them hopes, that if <lb/>
            they would take care of themselves, they would become hon­ <lb/>
            ourable and worthy characters. 3. Not indeed that he even <lb/>
            professed to be an instructor in that way, but, by showing <lb/>
            that he was himself such a character, he made those In his <lb/>
            society hope that, by imitating him, they would become such <lb/>
            as he was.</p>
          <p>4. Of the body lie was not neglectful, nor did he commend <lb/>
            those who were. He did not approve that a person should <lb/>
            eat to excess, and then use immoderate exercise, but recom­ <lb/>
            mended that he should work off, by a proper degree of exer­ <lb/>
            cise, as much as the appetite received with pleasure ; for such a <lb/>
            habit, he said, was peculiarly conducive to health, and did not <lb/>
            prevent attention to the mind. 5. He was not, however, fine <lb/>
            or ostentatious in his clothes or sandals, or in any of his <lb/>
            habits of life; yet he did not make those about him lovers cf <lb/>
            money,1 for he checked them in this as well as other passions, <lb/>
            and asked no remuneration from those who desired his com­ <lb/>
            pany. 6. By refraining from such demand, lie thought that <lb/>
            he consulted his liberty, and called those who took money for <lb/>
            their discourses their own enslavers, since they must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity hold discussions with those from whom they received <lb/>
            pay. 7. He expressed wonder, too, that any one who pro­ <lb/>
            fessed to teach virtue, should demand money, and not think <lb/>
            that he gained the greatest profit in securing a good friend, <lb/>
            but fear that he whom he had made an honourable and <lb/>
            worthy character would not retain the greatest gratitude <lb/>
            towards his greatest benefactor. 8. Socrates, indeed, never <lb/>
            expressed so much to any one ; yet he believed that those of <lb/>
            his associates who imbibed what he approved, would be always <lb/>
            good friends both to himself and to each other. How then <note type="footnote"> 1 Though he was not extravagant, lie was not avaricious; not <lb/>
            had his conversation a tendency to make others avaricious. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 A 2 </note> <pb n="356"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            could a man of such a character corrupt the young, unless, <lb/>
            indeed, the study of virtue be corruption ?</p>
          <p>9. "But assuredly," said the accuser, "he caused those who <lb/>
            conversed with him to despise the established laws, by saying <lb/>
            how foolish it was to elect the magistrates of a state by beans,1 <lb/>
            when nobody would be willing to take a pilot elected by <lb/>
            beans, or an architect, or a flute-player,2 or a person in any <lb/>
            other profession, which, if erroneously exercised, would cause <lb/>
            far less harm than errors in the administration of a state;” <lb/>
            and declared that such remarks excited the young to con­ <lb/>
            temn the established form of government, and disposed them <lb/>
            to acts of violence." 10. But I think that young men who <lb/>
            exercise their understanding, and expect to become capable <lb/>
            of teaching their fellow-citizens what is for their interest, <lb/>
            grow by no means addicted to violence, knowing that on <lb/>
            violence attend enmity and danger, but that, by persuasion, <lb/>
            the same results are attained without peril, and with good- <lb/>
            will; for those who are compelled by us, hate us as if despoiled <lb/>
            of something, while those who are persuaded by us, love us <lb/>
            as if they had received a favour. It is not the part, there­ <lb/>
            fore, of those who cultivate the intellect to use violence; for <lb/>
            to adopt such a course belongs to those who possess brute <lb/>
            force without intellect, 11. Besides, he who would venture <lb/>
            to use force, had need of no small number of allies, but lie <lb/>
            who can succeed with persuasion, has need of none, for, <lb/>
            though left alone, he would think himself still able to persuade ; <lb/>
            and it by no means belongs to such men to shed blood, for <lb/>
            who would wish to put another man to death rather than to <lb/>
            have him is a living subject persuaded to obey?</p>
          <p>12. "But," said the accuser, "Critias and Alcibiades, after <lb/>
            having been associates of Socrates, inflicted a great number <lb/>
            of evils on the state; for Critias was the most avaricious and <lb/>
            violent of all that composed the oligarchy, and Alcibiades <lb/>
            was the most intemperate, insolent, and turbulent of all those <lb/>
            in the democracy." 13. For whatever evil they did the state, <lb/>
            I shall make no apology; but as to their intimacy with <note type="footnote"> I ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απὸ κυάμου</foreign>.] Black and white beans were used in voting for <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            Socrates, I will state how it took place. 14. These two men <lb/>
            were by nature the most ambitious of all the Athenians, and <lb/>
            wished that everything should be done by their means, and that <lb/>
            they themselves should become the most celebrated of all men. <lb/>
            But they knew that Socrates lived with the utmost content­ <lb/>
            ment on very small means, that he was most abstinent from <lb/>
            every kind of pleasure, and that he swayed those with whom <lb/>
            he conversed just as he pleased by his arguments; is. and, <lb/>
            seeing such to be the case, and being such characters as they <lb/>
            have just been stated to be, whether will any one say that <lb/>
            they sought his society from a desire to lead such a life as <lb/>
            Socrates led, and to practise such temperance as he practised, <lb/>
            or from an expectation that, if they associated with him, they <lb/>
            would become eminently able to speak and act? 16. I myself, <lb/>
            indeed, am of opinion, that if a god had given them their <lb/>
            choice, whether they would live their whole lives as they <lb/>
            saw Socrates living, or die, they would have chosen rather to <lb/>
            die; and they showed this disposition by what they did; for <lb/>
            as soon as they considered themselves superior to their asso­ <lb/>
            ciates, they at once started away from Socrates, and engaged <lb/>
            in political life, to qualify themselves for which they had <lb/>
            sought the society of Socrates.</p>
          <p>17. Perhaps some one may observe on this point, that <lb/>
            Socrates should not have taught his followers politics before <lb/>
            he taught them self-control. To this remark I make no reply <lb/>
            at present;1 but I see that all teachers make themselves <lb/>
            examples to their pupils how far they practise what they <lb/>
            teach, and stimulate them by precepts ; is. and I know that <lb/>
            Socrates made himself an example to those who associated <lb/>
            with turn as a man of honourable and excellent character, <lb/>
            and that he discoursed admirably concerning virtue and other <lb/>
            things that concern mankind. I know, too, that those men <lb/>
            exercised self-control as long as they conversed with Socrates, <lb/>
            not from fear lest they should be fined or beaten by him, but <lb/>
            from a persuasion at the time that it was best to observe such <lb/>
            conduct.</p>
          <p>19. Perhaps, however, many of those who profess to be <lb/>
            philosophers, may say that a man once just, can never become <lb/>
            unjust, or once modest, immodest; and that, with regard to <note type="footnote">1 Xenophon leaves this point for the present, intending to reply <lb/>
            to it ill iv. 3. Kühner. </note> <pb n="358"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            any other qualification, (among such as can be taught,) he <lb/>
            who has once learned it can never become ignorant of it. <lb/>
            But regarding such points I am not of that opinion ; for I see <lb/>
            that as those who do not exercise the body, cannot perform <lb/>
            what is proper to the body, so those who do not exercise the <lb/>
            mind, cannot perform what is proper to the mind; for they <lb/>
            can neither do that which they ought to do, nor refrain from <lb/>
            that from which they ought to refrain. 20. For which reason <lb/>
            fathers keep their sons, though they be of a virtuous disposi­ <lb/>
            tion, from the society of bad men, in the belief that associa­ <lb/>
            tion with the good is an exercise of virtue, but that association <lb/>
            with the bad is the destruction of it. One of the poets also <lb/>
            bears testimony to this truth, who says, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_83_fig11.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              From good men you will learn what is good; but if you associate <lb/>
              with the bad, you will lose the understanding which is in yon.1 <lb/>
              And another, who observes, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_83_fig12.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              A good man is at one time good, and at another bad. <lb/>
              21. I also concur with them; for I see that as people forget <lb/>
              metrical compositions when they do not practise the repetition <lb/>
              of them, so forgetfulness of precepts of instruction is produced <lb/>
              in those who neglect them. But where a person forgets <lb/>
              moral admonitions, he forgets also what the mind felt when it <lb/>
              had a desire for self-government; and, when he forgets this, <lb/>
              it is not at all wonderful that he forgets self-government also. <lb/>
              22. I see, too, that those who arc given up to a fondness for <lb/>
              drinking, and those who have fallen in love, are less able to <lb/>
              attend to what they ought to do, and to refrain from what <lb/>
              they ought not to do; for many, who can be frugal in their <lb/>
              expenses before they fall in love, are, after falling in love, <lb/>
              unable to continue so; and, when they have exhausted their <lb/>
              resources, they no longer abstain from means of gain from <lb/>
              which they previously shrunk as thinking them dishonourable. <lb/>
              23. How is it impossible, then, that he who has once had a <note type="footnote">1 This distich is taken from Theognis, v. 35, 36. That Socrates <lb/>
              was fond of quoting it, appears also from Xen. Symp. ii. 4, and <lb/>

               <note type="margin">CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
              control over himself, may afterwards cease to maintain it, and <lb/>
              that he who was once able to observe justice, may subsequently <lb/>
              become unable? To me everything honourable and good <lb/>
              seems to be maintained by exercise, and self-control not the <lb/>
              least; for sensual desires, generated in the same body with <lb/>
              the soul, are constantly exciting it to abandon self-control, <lb/>
              and to gratify themselves and the body as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>24. Critias and Alcibiades, then, as long as they associated <lb/>
            with Socrates, were able, with the assistance of his example, to <lb/>
            maintain a mastery over their immoral inclinations; but, <lb/>
            when they were separated from him, Critias, fleeing to Thes­ <lb/>
            saly, formed connexions there with men who practised dis­ <lb/>
            honesty rather than justice ; and Aleibiades also, being sought <lb/>
            by many women, even of high rank, for his beauty, and being <lb/>
            corrupted by many men, who were well able to seduce him by <lb/>
            their flattery, on account of his influence in the city and <lb/>
            among the allies, and being also honoured by the people, and <lb/>
            easily obtaining the pre-eminence among them, became like <lb/>
            the wrestlers in the gymnastie games, who, when they are <lb/>
            fairly superior to others, neglect their exercise ; so he grew <lb/>
            neglectful of self-control. 25. When such was their for­ <lb/>
            tune, and when they were proud of their birth, elated with <lb/>
            their wealth, puffed up with their power, corrupted by many <lb/>
            associates, demoralized by all these means, and long absent <lb/>
            from Socrates, what wonder is it if they became headstrong ? <lb/>
            26. And then, if they did anything wrong, does the accuser <lb/>
            blame Socrates for it? and does Socrates seem to the accuser <lb/>
            deserving of no praise, for having, when they were young, and <lb/>
            when it is likely that they were most inconsiderate and in­ <lb/>
            tractable, rendered them discreet? 27. Yet other affairs are <lb/>
            not judged of in such a way; for what flute-player, or what <lb/>
            teacher of the harp, or what other instructor, if he produces <lb/>
            competent pupils, and if they, attaching themselves to other <lb/>
            masters, become less skilful, is blamed for their deterioration ? <lb/>
            Or what father, if his son, while he associated with one man, <lb/>
            should be virtuous, but afterwards, on uniting himself to <lb/>
            some other person, should become vicious, would blame the <lb/>
            former of the two ? would he not rather, the more corrupt <lb/>
            his son became with the second, bestow the greater praise on <lb/>
            the first ? Not even parents themselves, when they have their <lb/>
            sons in their society, are blamed if their sons do anything <pb n="360"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            wrong, provided they themselves are correct in their conduct. <lb/>
            28. In the same manner it would be right to judge of Socrates ; <lb/>
            if he had done anything immoral, he would justly be thought <lb/>
            to be a bad man ; but if he constantly observed morality, how <lb/>
            can he reasonably bear the blame of vice which was not in <lb/>
            him ?</p>
          <p>an. Or even if be himself did nothing wrong, but com­ <lb/>
            mended others when he saw them doing wrong, he would <lb/>
            justly be censured. When he perceived, however, that Critias <lb/>
            was enamoured of Euthydemus, and was seeking to have the <lb/>
            enjoyment of his society, like those who abuse the persons of <lb/>
            others for licentious purposes, he dissuaded him from his in­ <lb/>
            tention, by saying that it was illiberal, and unbecoming a man <lb/>
            of honour and proper feeling, to offer supplications to the ob­ <lb/>
            ject of his affections, with whom he wished to be held in high <lb/>
            esteem, beseeching and entreating him, like a beggar, to grant <lb/>
            a favour, especially when such favour was for no good end. <lb/>
            30. But as Critias paid no regard to such remonstrances, and <lb/>
            was not diverted from his pursuit, it is said that Socrates, in <lb/>
            the presence of many others as well as of Euthydemus, observed <lb/>
            that " Critias seemed to him to have some feeling like that of <lb/>
            a pig, as he wished to rub against Euthydemus as swine <lb/>
            against stones." 31. Critias, in consequence, conceived such <lb/>
            a hatred to Socrates, that when he was one of the Thirty <lb/>
            Tyrants, and was appointed a law-maker1 with Charicles, he <lb/>
            remembered the circumstance to his disadvantage, and insert­ <lb/>
            ed in his laws that " none should teach the art of disputa­ <lb/>
            tion," intending an insult to Socrates, yet not knowing how <lb/>
            to affect him in particular, but laying to his charge what was <lb/>
            imputed to the philosophers by the multitude,2 and calumni­ <lb/>
            ating him to the people; at least such is my opinion; for I <lb/>
            myself never heard this from Socrates, nor do 1 remember <lb/>
            having known any one say that he heard it from him. 32. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Hellen. ii. 3. 2. Of the Thirty, Charicles alone is here <lb/>
            named, besides Critias the chief of them, because, by conspiring <lb/>
            with Critias and a few of the others, he afterwards acquired great <lb/>
            authority and power in the state. Kühner. The law here mentioned <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            But Critias showed that such was the case; for when the <lb/>
            Thirty had put to death many of the citizens, and those not <lb/>
            of the inferior class, and had encouraged many to acts of injus­ <lb/>
            tice,1 Socrates happened to observe, that “it seemed surprising <lb/>
            to him if a man, becoming herdsman of a number of cattle, and <lb/>
            rendering the cattle fewer and in worse condition, should not <lb/>
            confess that lie was a bad herdsman, and still more surprising <lb/>
            if a man, becoming governor of a city, and rendering the peo­ <lb/>
            ple fewer and in worse condition, should not feel ashamed, and <lb/>
            be conscious of being a bad governor of the city." 33. This <lb/>
            remark being repeated to the Thirty, Critias and Charicles <lb/>
            summoned Socrates before them, showed him the law, and <lb/>
            forbade him to hold discourse with the youth. Socrates in­ <lb/>
            quired of them, if he might be permitted to ask a question as to <lb/>
            any point in the prohibitions that might not be understood by <lb/>
            him. They gave him permission. 34. “Then," said he, “I am <lb/>
            prepared to obey the laws; but that I may not unconsciously <lb/>
            transgress through ignorance, I wish to ascertain exactly <lb/>
            from you, 'whether it is because you think that the art of <lb/>
            reasoning is an auxiliary to what is rightly spoken,2 or to <lb/>
            what is not rightly spoken, that you give command to abstain <lb/>
            from it; for if it be an adjunct to what is rightly spoken, it <lb/>
            is plain that we have to abstain from speaking rightly ; but if <lb/>
            to what is not rightly spoken, it is plain that we ought to en­ <lb/>
            deavour to speak rightly.’” 33. Charicles, falling into a <lb/>
            passion with him, said, " Since, Socrates, you are ignorant of <lb/>
            this particular, we give you an order more easy to be under­ <lb/>
            stood, not to discourse at all with the young." " That it may <lb/>
            not be doubtful, then," said Socrates, “whether I do anything <lb/>
            contrary to what is enjoined, define for me till what age I <lb/>
            must consider men to be young." " As long," replied Chari­ <lb/>
            cles, "as they are not allowed to fill the office of senator, as <lb/>
            not being yet come to maturity of understanding ; and do not <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
              discourse with such as are under thirty years of age." 36. "And <lb/>
              if I wish to buy anything," said Socrates, " and a. person under <lb/>
              thirty years of age has it for sale, may I not ask him at what <lb/>
              price he sells it?" " Yes, such questions as these," replied <lb/>
              Charicles, " but you are accustomed to ask most of your ques­ <lb/>
              tions about things, when you know very well how they stand ; <lb/>
              such questions, therefore, do not ask." " If then any young <lb/>
              man," said he, "should ask me such a question as 'where docs <lb/>
              Charicles live?' or where is Critias?' may I not answer <lb/>
              him, if I know?" "Yes, you may answer such questions," <lb/>
              said Charicles. 37. " But," added Critias, "it will be necessary <lb/>
              for you to abstain from speaking of those shoemakers, 1 and <lb/>
              carpenters, and smiths; indeed I think that they must now be <lb/>
              worn out, from being so often in your mouth." " I must <lb/>
              therefore," said Socrates, "abstain from the illustrations that <lb/>
              I attach to the mention of those people, illustrations on jus­ <lb/>
              tice, piety, and other such subjects." "Yes, by Jupiter," <lb/>
              retorted Charicles", " and you must abstain from illustrations <lb/>
              taken from herdsmen; for, if you do not, take care lest you <lb/>
              yourself make the cattle fewer." 2 38. Hence it was evident <lb/>
              that they were angry with Socrates on account of his remark <lb/>
              about the cattle having been reported to them.</p>
          <p>What sort of intercourse Critias had with Socrates, and <lb/>
            how they stood towards each other, has now been stated. 39. <lb/>
            But I would say that no regular training is derived by any <lb/>
            one from a teacher who does not please him ; and Critias and <lb/>
            Alcibiades did not associate with Socrates, while their associ­ <lb/>
            ation with him lasted, as being an instructor that pleased them, <lb/>
            but they were, from the very first, eager to be at the head of <lb/>
            the state, for, while they still attended Socrates, they sought <lb/>
            to converse with none more than with those who were most <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Απέχεσθαι</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν σκυτέων, κ. τ. λ</foreign>.] A brief mode of expression <lb/>
            for "to abstain from drawing illustrations from those shoemakers," <lb/>
            &amp;c. Socrates, in his conversation, was accustomed to illustrate <lb/>
            or support his precepts and opinions by examples taken from full­ <lb/>
            ers, leather-cutters, potters, and other artisans; a mode of lectur­ <lb/>

            engaged in affairs of government. 40. Alcibiades, it is said, <lb/>
            before he was twenty years of age, held the following dis­ <lb/>
            course with Pericles, who was his guardian, and chief ruler of <lb/>
            the state, about laws. 41. " Tell me," said he, "Pericles, can <lb/>
            you teach me what a law is." " Certainly," replied Peri clef!. <lb/>
            " Teach me then, in the name of the gods," said Alcibiades, <lb/>
            " for I, hearing some persons praised as being obedient to the <lb/>
            laws, consider that no one can fairly obtain such praise who <lb/>
            does not know what a law is." 42. " You desire no very <lb/>
            difficult matter, Alcibiades," said Pericles, "when you wish <lb/>
            to know what a law is; for all those regulations are laws, <lb/>
            which the people, on meeting together and approving them, <lb/>
            have enacted, directing what we should do and what we should <lb/>
            not do." " And whether do they direct that we should do good <lb/>
            things, or that we should do bad things ?" " Good, by Jupiter, <lb/>
            my child," said he, "but bad by no means." 43. "And if it <lb/>
            should not be the whole people, but a few, as where there is <lb/>
            an oligarchy, that should meet together, and enact what we <lb/>
            are to do, what arc such enactments ?" " Everything," replied <lb/>
            Pericles, " which the supreme power in the state, on determin­ <lb/>
            ing what the people ought to do, has enacted, is called a law." <lb/>
            " And if a tyrant, holding rule over the state, prescribes to <lb/>
            the citizens what they must do, is such prescription called a <lb/>
            law." " Whatever a tyrant in authority prescribes," returned <lb/>
            Pericles, "is also called a law." 44. " What then, Pericles," <lb/>
            asked Alcibiades, " is force and lawlessness ? Is it not when <lb/>
            the stronger obliges the weaker, not by persuasion, but by <lb/>
            compulsion, to do what he pleases ? " " So it appears to me," <lb/>
            replied Pericles. " Whatever then a tyrant compels the <lb/>
            people to do, by enacting it without gaining their consent, is <lb/>
            that an act of lawlessness ? " " Yes," said Pericles, " it appears <lb/>
            to me that it is, for I retraet my admission 1 that what a tyrant <lb/>
            prescribes to the people wIthout persuading them, is a law." <unclear/> <lb/>
            10. " But what the few enact, not from gaining the consent of <lb/>
            the many, but from having superior power, should we say that <lb/>
            that is force, or that it is not ?" "Everything," said Peri­ <lb/>
            cles, " which one man obliges another to do without gaining <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανατιϑεμαι</foreign>.] A metaphorical expression from the game of <lb/>

            his consent, whether he enact it in writing or not, seems to <lb/>
            me to be force rather than law." " Whatever, then, the whole <lb/>
            people, when they are stronger than the wealthier class, enact <lb/>
            without their consent, would be an act of force rather than a <lb/>
            law?" 46. Certainly, Alcibiades," said Pericles ; " and I, <lb/>
            when I was of your age, was very acute at such disquisitions ; <lb/>
            for we used to meditate and argue about such subjects as <lb/>
            you now appear to meditate." " Would therefore," said Alci­ <lb/>
            biades, " that I had conversed with you, Pericles, at the time <lb/>
            when you were most acute in discussing such topics ! " 47. <lb/>
            When Alcibiades and Critias, therefore, began to think them­ <lb/>
            selves superior to those who were then governing the state, <lb/>
            they 110 longer attended Socrates, (for he was not agreeable <lb/>
            to them in other respects, and they were offended, if they <lb/>
            went to him at all, at being reproved for any error that they <lb/>
            had committed,) but devoted themselves to political employ­ <lb/>
            ments, with a view to which they had at first associated with <lb/>
            Socrates. 48. But Crito was also an attendant on Socrates, <lb/>
            as well as Chærephon, Chærecrates, Hermocrates, Simmias, <lb/>
            Cebes, and Phædondes, who, with others that attended him, <lb/>
            did not seek his society that they might be fitted for popular <lb/>
            orators or forensic pleaders, but that, becoming honourable <lb/>
            and good men, they might conduct themselves irreproachably <lb/>
            towards their families, connexions, dependants, and friends, <lb/>
            as well as towards their country and their fellow-citizens ; <lb/>
            and no one of all these, whether in youth or at a more <lb/>
            advanced age, either was guilty, or was accused, of any <lb/>
            crime.</p>
          <p>49. , ut Socrates," said the accuser, "taught children to <lb/>
            show contempt for1 their parents, persuading his followers that <lb/>
            lie rendered them wiser than their fathers, and observing that a <lb/>
            son was allowed by the law to confine his father on convicting <lb/>
            him of being deranged, using that circumstance as an argu­ <lb/>
            ment that it was lawful for the more ignorant to be confined <lb/>
            by the wiser." 50. But what Socrates said was, that he <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προπηλακί</foreign><unclear>ζειν</unclear>]. See Apolog. sect. 20, and Aristoph. Null. 1107, <lb/>
            where Phidippides is introduced, as a disciple of Socrates, heating <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            thought'he who confined another for ignorance, might justly <lb/>
            be himself confined by those who knew what he did not know; <lb/>
            and, with a view to such cases, lie used to consider in what <lb/>
            respect ignorance differed from madness, and expressed his <lb/>
            opinion that madmen might be confined with advantage to <lb/>
            themselves and their friends, but that those who did not know <lb/>
            what they ought to know, might reasonably learn from those <lb/>
            who did know.</p>
          <p>51. "But Socrates," proceeded the accuser, "not only <lb/>
            caused parents, but other relations, to be held in contempt by <lb/>
            his followers, saying that relatives, as relatives, were of no <lb/>
            profit to people who were sick, or to people going to law, but <lb/>
            that physicians aided the one, and lawyers the other." 52. <lb/>
            The accuser asserted, too, that Socrates said concerning <lb/>
            friends that " it was of no profit that they were well-disposed, <lb/>
            unless they were able also to assist; and that he insisted that <lb/>
            those only were deserving of honour who knew what was for <lb/>
            the advantage of others and could make it intelligible to <lb/>
            them; and that by thus persuading the young that he himself <lb/>
            was the wisest of mankind, and most capable of making others <lb/>
            wise, he so disposed his pupils towards him, that other people <lb/>
            were of no account with them in comparison with himself." <lb/>
            53. I am aware, indeed, that he did express himself concern­ <lb/>
            ing parents and other relatives, and concerning friends, in <lb/>
            such a manner as this; and used to say, besides, that when <lb/>
            the soul has departed, in which alone intelligence exists, men <lb/>
            take away the body of their dearest friend, and put it out of <lb/>
            sight as soon as possible. 54. He was accustomed to say, also, <lb/>
            that every man, while lie is alive, removes of himself from <lb/>
            his own body, which he loves most of all things, and allows <lb/>
            others to remove from it, everything that is useless and un­ <lb/>
            profitable ; since men themselves take off portions of their nails, <lb/>
            and hair, and callous parts, and resign themselves to surgeons <lb/>
            to cut and burn them with labour and pain, and think it their <lb/>
            duty even to pay them money for their operations; and the <lb/>
            saliva from the mouth, he said, men spit away as far as pos­ <lb/>
            sible, because, while it is in the mouth, it profits them nothing, <lb/>
            but is far more likely to harm them. 55. But such observa­ <lb/>
            tions Socrates uttered, not to teach any one of his followers <lb/>
            to bury his father alive, or to cut himself to pieces, but, by <lb/>
            showing that what is senseless is worthless, he exhorted each to <pb n="366"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. I. </note> <lb/>
            study to become as intelligent and useful as possible, so that, <lb/>
            whether he wished to be honoured by his father, by his <lb/>
            brother, or by any one else, he might not be neglectful of <lb/>
            himself through trusting to his relationship, but might endea­ <lb/>
            vour to be serviceable to those by whom lie desired to be <lb/>
            respected.</p>
          <p>56. The accuser also said that Socrates, selecting the worst <lb/>
            passages of the most celebrated poets, and using them as <lb/>
            arguments, taught those who kept him company to be un­ <lb/>
            principled and tyrannical. The verse of Hesiod, for example, <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_83_fig14.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              Work is no disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace,1 <lb/>
              they say that lie used to explain as intimating that the poet <lb/>
              bids us abstain from no kind of work, dishonest or dishonour­ <lb/>
              able, but to do such work for the sake of profit. 57. But <lb/>
              when Socrates maintained that to be busy was useful and <lb/>
              beneficial for a man, and that to be unemployed was noxious <lb/>
              and ill for him, that to work was a good, and to be idle an <lb/>
              evil, he at the same time observed that those only who do <lb/>
              something good really work, and are useful workmen,2 but <lb/>
              those who gamble, or do anything bad and pernicious, he <lb/>
              called idle; and in this view the sentiment of the poet will <lb/>
              bo unobjectionable, <lb/>
              Work is no disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace. <lb/>
              58. That passage of Homer, too, the accuser stated that he <lb/>
              often used to quote, in which it is said that Ulysses, <lb/>
              Whatever king or eminent hero he found, <lb/>
              Stood beside him, and detained him with gentle words. <lb/>
              " Illustrious chief, it is not fit that you should shrink back as a <lb/>
              coward; <lb/>
              Sit down yourself, and make the rest of the people sit down." <lb/>
              But whatever man of the people he noticed, and found clamouring, <lb/>
              He struck him with his staff, and rebuked him with words: <lb/>
              " Worthless fellow, sit down in peace, and hear the exhortations <lb/>
              of others, <note type="footnote">I Not toil, but sloth, shall ignominious be.—Elton. <lb/>
              The enemies of Socrates insinuated that he joined <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούῦὲν</foreign>, not with <lb/>
              its proper substantive <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὒνειδος</foreign>, but with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒργον</foreign>, making the sense to <lb/>
              be " no work is disgraceful." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare iii. 9. 9. </note> <pb n="367"/>

              Who are much better than you ; for you are unwarlike and power­ <lb/>
              less, <lb/>
              Neither to be numbered in the field nor in the council." 1 <lb/>
              so. And he said that he used to explain it as if the poet re­ <lb/>
              commended that plebeians and poor people should be beaten. <lb/>
              Socrates, however, said no such thing, (for he would thus <lb/>
              have given an opinion that he himself ought to be beaten,) <lb/>
              but what he did say was, that those who benefited others <lb/>
              neither by word nor deed, and who were incapable of serving <lb/>
              the army, or the state, or the common people, if they should <lb/>
              ever be called upon to serve, should, especially if, in addition <lb/>
              to their incapacity, they were of an insolent spirit, be curbed <lb/>
              in every way, even though they might be ever so rich. CHI. <lb/>
              But, contrary to the charge of the accuser, Socrates was <lb/>
              evidently a friend to the common people, and of a liberal dis­ <lb/>
              position; for though he received numbers of persons desirous <lb/>
              to hear him discourse, as well citizens as foreigners, he never <lb/>
              required payment for his communications from any one, but <lb/>
              imparted to every one in abundance from his stores, of which <lb/>
              some2 receiving fragments from him for nothing, sold them <lb/>
              at a great price to others, and were not, like him, friends to <lb/>
              the common people, for they declined to converse with such as <lb/>
              had not money to give them. 61. But Socrates, in the eyes of <lb/>
              other men, conferred glory on the city, far more than Liehas, <lb/>
              who was celebrated in this respect, on that of the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
              monians ; for Lichas indeed entertained the strangers that <lb/>
              visited Lacedæmon at the Gymnopædiæ,3 but Socrates, through <note type="footnote"> 1 II. ii. 188, seqq. <lb/>

          <p>62. To me, therefore, Socrates, being a man of such a <lb/>
            character, appeared to be worthy of honour rather than of <lb/>
            death; and any one, considering his case according to the <lb/>
            laws, would find such to be the fact; for, by the laws, death <lb/>
            is the punishment for a man if he be found stealing, or strip­ <lb/>
            ping people of their clothes, or cutting purses, or house- <lb/>
            breaking, or kidnapping, or sacrilege, of which crimes So­ <lb/>
            crates was the most innocent of all men. 63. Nor was he ever <lb/>
            the cause of any war ending unfortunately for the state, or <lb/>
            of any sedition or treachery ; nor did he ever, in his private <lb/>
            transactions, either deprive any man of what was for his good, <lb/>
            or involve him in evil; nor did he ever lie under suspicior <lb/>
            of any of the crimes which I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>64. How then could he have been guilty of the charges <lb/>
            brought against him ? a man who, instead of not acknowledg­ <lb/>
            ing the gods, as was stated in the indictment, evidently paid <lb/>
            respect to the gods more than other men ; and instead of cor­ <lb/>
            rupting the youth, as the accuser laid to his charge, plainly <lb/>
            led such of his associates as had vicious inclinations, to cease <lb/>
            from indulging them, and exhorted them to cherish a love of <lb/>
            that most honourable and excellent virtue, by which men <lb/>
            successfully govern states and families. How then, pursuing <lb/>
            such a course of conduct, was he not deserving of great <lb/>
            honour from the city ?</p>

            character was, and partly by his conversation, I shall record <lb/>
            whatever I can remember of him relating to these points.</p>
          <p>As to what had reference to the gods, then, he evidently <lb/>
            acted and spoke in conformity with the answer which the <lb/>
            priestess of Apollo gives to those who inquire how they ought <lb/>
            to proceed with regard to a sacrifice, to the worship of their <lb/>
            uncestors, or to any such matter ; for the priestess replies that <lb/>
            they will act piously, if they act in agreement with the laMo of <lb/>
            their country, and Socrates both acted in this manner him­ <lb/>
            self, and exhorted others to act similarly; and such as acted <lb/>
            in any other way he regarded as doing what was not to the <lb/>
            purpose, 1 and guilty of folly.</p>
          <p>2. To the gods lie simply prayed that they would give him <lb/>
            good things, as believing that the gods knew best what things <lb/>
            are good; and those who prayed for gold, or silver, or <lb/>
            dominion, or anything of that kind, he considered to utter <lb/>
            no other sort of requests than if they were to pray that they <lb/>
            might play at dice, or fight, or do anything else of which it <lb/>
            is quite uncertain what the result will be.</p>
          <p>3. When lie offered small sacrifices from his small means, <lb/>
            he thought that he was not at all inferior in merit to those <lb/>
            who offered numerous and great sacrifices from ample and <lb/>
            abundant means; for lie said that it would not become the <lb/>
            gods to delight in large rather than in small sacrifices; since, <lb/>
            if such were the case, the offerings of the bad would often­ <lb/>
            times be more acceptable to them than those of the good ; nor <lb/>
            would life be of any account in the eyes of men, if oblations <lb/>
            from the bad were better received by the gods than oblations <lb/>
            from the good; but he thought that the gods had most plea­ <lb/>
            sure in the offerings of the most pious. lie also used to quote, <lb/>
            with approbation, the verse, <figure type="illustration">

              Perform sacrifices to the gods according to your ability, <lb/>
              and used to say that it was a good exhortation to men, with <lb/>
              regard to friends, and guests, and all other relations of life, <lb/>
              to perform according to their ability.</p>
          <p>4. If anything appeared to be intimated to him from the <lb/>
            gods, be could no more have been persuaded to act contrary <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περιέργους</foreign>.] Doing what was superfluous; not adhering, au <lb/>

            to such intimation, than any one could have persuaded him <lb/>
            to take for his guide on a journey a blind man, or one who <lb/>
            did not know the way, instead of one who could see, and did <lb/>
            know it; and he condemned the folly of others, who act con­ <lb/>
            trary to what is signified by the gods, through anxiety to <lb/>
            avoid the ill opinion of men. As for himself, he undervalued <lb/>
            everything human, in comparison with counsel from the <lb/>
            gods.'</p>
          <p>5. He disciplined his mind and body by such a course of <lb/>
            life, that he who should adopt a similar one, would, if no <lb/>
            supernatural influence prevented, live in good spirits and un­ <lb/>
            interrupted health; nor would he ever be in want of the <lb/>
            necessary expenses for it. So frugal was he, that I do not <lb/>
            know whether any one could earn so little by the labour of <lb/>
            his hands, as not to procure sufficient to have satisfied So­ <lb/>
            crates. He took only so much food as he could eat with a <lb/>
            keen relish ; and, to this end, he came to his meals2 so dis­ <lb/>
            posed that the appetite for his meat was the sauce to it. <lb/>
            Every kind of drink was agreeable to him, because he never <lb/>
            drank unless he was thirsty. 6. If he ever complied with an <lb/>
            invitation to go to a feast, he very easily guarded, what is <lb/>
            extremely difficult to most men, against loading his stomach <lb/>
            to excess. Those who were unable to do so, he advised to bo <lb/>
            cautious of taking anything that would stimulate them to eat <lb/>
            when they were not hungry, and to drink when they were <lb/>
            not thirsty ; for he said that those were the things that dis­ <lb/>
            ordered the stomach, the head, and the mind ; 7. and he used <lb/>
            to say, In jest, that he thought Circe transformed men into <lb/>
            swine, by entertaining them with abundance of such luxuries, <lb/>
            but that Ulysses, through the admonition of Mercury, and <lb/>
            through being himself temperate, and forbearing to partake of <lb/>
            such delicacies to excess, was in consequence not changed into <lb/>

            earnest meaning. As to love, his counsel was to abstain <lb/>
            rigidly from familiarity with beautiful persons; for he ob­ <lb/>
            served that it was not easy to be in communication with such <lb/>
            persons, and observe continence. Hearing, on one occasion, <lb/>
            that Critobulus, the son of Criton, had kissed the son of Alci­ <lb/>
            biades,1 a handsome youth, he asked Xenophon, in the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of Critobulus, saying, “ Tell me, Xenophon, did you not <lb/>
            think that Critobulus was one of the modest rather than the <lb/>
            forward, one of the thoughtful rather than of the thoughtless <lb/>
            and inconsiderate?" 9. “ Certainly,” replied Xenophon. “You <lb/>
            must now, then, think him extremely headstrong and daring ; <lb/>
            one who would even spring upon drawn swords, and leap into <lb/>
            the fire." 10. "And what," said Xenophon, "have you seen him <lb/>
            doing, that you form so unfavourable an opinion of him ? " <lb/>
            " Why, has he not dared," rejoined Socrates, "to kiss the son <lb/>
            of Alcibiades, a youth extremely handsome, and in the flower <lb/>
            of his ago ? " “ If such a deed," returned Xenophon, " is one <lb/>
            of daring and peril, I think that even I could undergo such <lb/>
            peril." 11. “ Unhappy man ! " exclaimed Socrates, “ and what <lb/>
            do you think that you incur by kissing a handsome person ? <lb/>
            Do you not expect to become at once a slave instead of a free­ <lb/>

            and which, if the body did desire them, should cause us no <lb/>

          <p>15. Such was the state of his feelings in regard to eating, <lb/>
            drinking, and amorous gratification ; and he believed that he <lb/>
            himself, with self-restraint, would have no less pleasure from <lb/>

          <p>Socrates not only exhorted men to practise virtue, but led them to the prac­ <lb/>
            tice of it; his dialogue with Aristodemus, sect. 1, 2. Things formed for <lb/>
            a purpose, must be the production, not of chance, but of reason, 3, 4. The <lb/>
            human frame is a structure of great excellence, and admirably fitted for <lb/>
            its purposes; and we must therefore suppose that man is the object of <lb/>
            divine forethought, 5—7. The order of things throughout the universe <lb/>
            shows that it is under the providence of a superior nature, 8,9. The supe­ <lb/>
            riority of man over the inferior animals proves that he is more immedi­ <lb/>
            ately under the care of the higher powers, 10—14. The gods also give <lb/>
            instruction to man as to his conduct, 1,5. That they care for man both in­ <lb/>
            dividually and collectively is evident from various considerations, 15, 16. <lb/>
            As the mind governs the body, so the providence of the gods governs <lb/>
            the world, 17. If men therefore worship the gods rightly, they may feel <lb/>
            persuaded that the gods will be ready to aid them, 18, 19.</p>
          <p>1. BUT if any suppose that Socrates, as some write and <lb/>
            speak of him on conjecture,1 was excellently qualified to ex­ <lb/>
            hort men to virtue, but incapable of leading them forward in <lb/>
            it, let them consider not only what he said in refutation, by <lb/>
            questioning, of those who thought that they knew everything, <lb/>
            (refutations intended to check the progress of those disput­ <lb/>
            ants,)2 but what he used to say in his daily intercourse with <lb/>
            his associates, and then form an opinion whether he was capa­ <lb/>
            ble of making those who conversed with him better. 2. I <lb/>
            will first mention what I myself once heard him advance in a <lb/>
            dialogue with Aristodemus, surnamed The Little,3 concerning <lb/>
            the gods; for having heard that Aristodemus neither sacri­ <lb/>
            ficed to the gods, nor prayed to them, nor attended to augu­ <lb/>
            ries, but ridiculed those who regarded such matters, he said <lb/>
            to him, "Tell me, Aristodemus, do you admire any men <lb/>
            for their genius?" "I do," replied he. "Tell us their <lb/>
            names, then,” said Socrates. 3. "In epic poetry I most admire <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τεκμαιρόμενοι</foreign>.] Forming conjectures from those men, who, after <lb/>

            many editions, though found, as Kühner says, who has replaced <lb/>
            them, in all the manuscripts. “As modesty prevented Aristodemus <lb/>
            from expressly affirming, and a regard for truth kept him from <lb/>
            exactly denying, that lie had any intelligence, he answers guardedly <lb/>

            answer, you will understand that I have in me some portion of in­ <lb/>
            elligenee.” Lange. “ Lange, therefore, thinks that Aristodemus <lb/>
            did not wish his possession of intelligence to be concluded from the <lb/>
            matter of his answer or answers, but from the mere fact of his <lb/>
            answering; intimating that he who could give an answer to a <lb/>
            question, must necessarily be possessed of intellect." Kühner. <lb/>
            Zeune gives this sense to the passage: "Question me as to other <lb/>
            things which necessarily follow from hence, and which you are <lb/>
            accustomed to infer from premises of this kiad and you will find <lb/>
            me prepared to answer you." The true sense, however, seems to <lb/>
            be, “ Question me, and judge from my answers whether I onght to <lb/>
            be considered as possessed of intellect or not." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The words in italics are supplied according to the sense given <lb/>

            despise the gods, but consider them as too exalted to need my <lb/>
            attention." "But," said Socrates, "the more exalted they <lb/>
            arc, while they deign to attend to you, the more ought you to <lb/>
            honour them." 11. “ Be assured," replied Aristodemus, " that if <lb/>
            I believed the gods took any thought for men, I would not <lb/>
            neglect them." “ Do you not, then, believe that the gods <lb/>
            take thought for men? the gods who, in the first place, have <lb/>
            made man alone, of all animals, upright, (which uprightness <lb/>
            ables him to look forward to a greater distance, and to con­ <lb/>
            template better what is above, and renders those parts less <lb/>
            liable to injury in which1 the gods have placed the eyes, and <lb/>
            cars, and mouth;) and, in the next place, have given to other <lb/>
            animals only feet, which merely give them the capacity of <lb/>
            walking, while to men they have added hands, which execute <lb/>
            most of those things through which we are better off than <lb/>
            they. 12. And though all animals have tongues, they have <lb/>
            made that of man alone of such a nature, as, by touching <lb/>
            sometimes one part of the mouth, and sometimes another, to <lb/>
            express articulate sounds, and to signify everything that we <lb/>
            wish to communicate one to another. Do you not see, too, that to <lb/>
            other animals they have so given the pleasures of sexual in­ <lb/>
            tercourse as to limit them to a certain season of the year, but <lb/>
            that they allow them to us uninterruptedly till extreme old <lb/>
            age? 13. Nor did it satisfy the gods to take care of the body <lb/>
            merely, but, what is most important of all, they implanted <lb/>
            in him the soul, his most excellent part. For what other <lb/>
            animal has a soul to understand, first of all, that the gods, <lb/>
            who have arranged such a vast and noble order of things, <lb/>
            exist? What other species of animal, besides man, offers <lb/>
            worship to the gods ? What other animal has a mind better <lb/>
            fitted than that of man, to guard against hunger or thirst, or <lb/>
            cold or heat, or to relieve disease, or to acquire strength by <lb/>
            exercise, or to labour to attain knowledge; or more capable <lb/>

            other animals, men live like gods, excelling them by nature, <lb/>
            both in body and mind ? For an animal, having the body of <lb/>
            an ox, and the understanding of a man, would be unable to <lb/>
            execute what it might meditate; and animals which have <lb/>
            hands,1 but are without reason, have no advantage over others ; <lb/>
            and do you, who share both these excellent endowments, think <lb/>
            that the gods take no thought for you ? What then must they <lb/>
            1o, before you will think that they take thought for you?”2 <lb/>
            15. "I will think so," observed Aristodemus, "when they <lb/>
            send me, as you say that they send to you, monitors, to show <lb/>
            what I ought, and what I ought not, to do." “ But when <lb/>
            they send admonitions to the Athenians, on consulting them <lb/>
            by divination, do you not think that they admonish you also? <lb/>
            Or when they give warnings to the Greeks by sending por­ <lb/>
            tents, or when they give them to the whole human race, <lb/>
            do they except you alone from the whole, and utterly neglect <lb/>
            you ? 16. Do you suppose, too, that the gods would have en­ <lb/>
            gendered a persuasion in men that they are able to benefit or <lb/>
            injure them, unless they were really able to do so, and that <lb/>
            men, if they had been thus perpetually deluded, would not <lb/>
            have become sensible of the delusion? Do you not see that <lb/>
            the oldest and wisest of human communities, the oldest and <lb/>
            wisest cities and nations, are the most respectful to the gods, <lb/>
            and that the wisest age of man is the most observant of their <lb/>
            worship? 17. Consider also, my good youth," continued <lb/>
            Socrates, " that your mind, existing within your body, directs <lb/>
            your body as it pleases; and it becomes you therefore to <lb/>
            believe that the intelligence pervading all things directs all <lb/>

            men you discover who are wise, you should, in like manner, <lb/>
            make trial of the gods by offering worship to them, whether <lb/>
            they will advise you concerning matters hidden from man, <lb/>

            to be present everywhere, and to have a care for all things at <lb/>

          <p>19. By delivering such sentiments, Socrates seems to me to <lb/>
            have led his associates to refrain from what was impious, or <lb/>
            unjust, or dishonourable, not merely when they were seen by <lb/>
            men, but when they were in solitude, since they would con­ <lb/>

            or conquer our adversaries ? 2. Or if, being at the close of <lb/>
            life, we should wish to commit to any one the guardianship <lb/>
            of our sons, or the care of our unmarried daughters, or the <lb/>
            preservation of our property, should we think an intemperat( <lb/>
            man worthy of confidence for such purposes? Should we in­ <pb n="379"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            trust to an intemperate slave our herds, our granaries, or the <lb/>
            superintendence of our agriculture? Should we be willing to <lb/>
            accept such a slave as an agent, or purveyor, even for nothing ? <lb/>
            3. But if we would not even accept an intemperate slave, how <lb/>
            can it be otherwise than important for every man to take care <lb/>
            that he himself does not become such a character ? For the <lb/>
            intemperate man is not injurious to his neighbour and pro­ <lb/>
            fitable to himself, (like the avaricious, who, by despoiling <lb/>
            others of their property, seem to enrich themselves,) but, <lb/>
            while he is mischievous to others, is still more mischievous to <lb/>
            himself, for it is, indeed, mischievous in the highest degree, <lb/>
            to ruin not only his family, but his body and mind. 4. In <lb/>
            society, too, who could find pleasure in the company of such a <lb/>
            man, who, lie would be aware, felt more delight in eating and <lb/>
            drinking than in intercourse with his friends, and preferred <lb/>
            the company of harlots to that of his fellows? Is it not the <lb/>
            duty of every man to consider that temperance is the founda­ <lb/>
            tion of every virtue, and to establish the observance of it in <lb/>
            his mind before all things ? 5. For who, without it, can either <lb/>
            learn anything good, or sufficiently practise it ? Who, that is <lb/>
            a slave to pleasure, is not in an ill condition both as to his <lb/>
            body and his mind ? It appears to me, by Juno,1 that a free­ <lb/>
            man ought to pray that he may never meet with a slave of <lb/>
            such a character, and that lie who is a slave to pleasure should <lb/>
            pray to the gods that he may find well-disposed masters; for <lb/>
            by such means only can a man of that sort be saved.”</p>
          <p>6. While such were the remarks that he made, he proved <lb/>
            himself more a friend, to temperance by his life than by his <lb/>
            words ; for he was not only superior to all corporeal pleasures, <lb/>
            but also to those attendant on the acquisition of money; <lb/>
            thinking that he who received money from any one,2 set up a <lb/>
            master over himself, and submitted to a slavery as disgrace­ <lb/>
            ful as any that could be. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νὴ τὴν Ἤραν</foreign>.] This mode of swearing, which was commonly <lb/>

          <p>Three dialogues of Socrates with Antipho. I. Antipho ridicules the poverty <lb/>
            and frugality of Socrates, and his forbearance to receive pay for his in­ <lb/>
            structions, sect. 1—3; Socrates replies that, by not receiving remunera­ <lb/>
            tion, he is more at liberty to choose his audience, 4, 5 ; that there are <lb/>
            various advantages attendant on plainness of diet and dress, 6, 7; that <lb/>
            the frugal man has the advantage over the man of pleasure in facilities <lb/>
            for self-improvement, for doing his duty to his country, and for securing <lb/>
            general happiness, 8—10. II. Antipho asserts that Socrates might be a <lb/>
            Just man, but was by no means wise, in accepting no payment, 11, 12; <lb/>
            Socrates replies that to sell wisdom is to degrade it, and that more good <lb/>
            is gained by the acquisition of friends than of money, 13, 14. III. An­ <lb/>
            tipho asks Socrates why, when he trained others to manage public affairs, <lb/>
            he took no part in public affairs himself; Socrates replies that he was of <lb/>
            more service to his country by training many to govern it, than he could <lb/>
            have been by giving his single aid in the government of it, 15.</p>
          <p>1. IT is due to Socrates, also, not to omit the dialogues <lb/>
            which he held with Antipho the sophist. Antipho, on one <lb/>
            occasion, wishing to draw away his associates from him, came <lb/>
            up to Socrates, when they were present, and said, 2. " I <lb/>
            thought, Socrates, that those who studied philosophy were tc <lb/>
            become happier than other men ; but you seem to have reaped <lb/>
            from philosophy fruits of an opposite kind; at least you live <lb/>
            in a way in which no slave would continue to live with his <lb/>
            master; you eat food, and drink drink, of the worst kind; <lb/>
            you wear a dress, not only bad, but the same both summer <lb/>
            and winter, and you continue shoeless and coatless.1 3. Money, <lb/>
            which cheers men when they receive it, and enables those <lb/>
            who possess it to live more generously and pleasantly, you do <lb/>
            not take; and if, therefore, as teachers in other professions <lb/>
            make their pupils imitate themselves, you also shall produce a <lb/>
            similar effect on your followers, you must consider yourself <lb/>
            but a teacher of wretchedness." 4. Socrates, in reply to these <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀνυπόδητός τε καὶ ἀχίτων</foreign>.] On the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνυποδησία</foreign> of Socrates, sea <lb/>

            By <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀχίτων</foreign> is not to be understood that Socrates had covered his <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            remarks, said, " You seem to me, Antipho, to have conceived <lb/>
            a notion that I live so wretchedly, that I feel persuaded you <lb/>
            yourself would rather choose to die than pass your life as I <lb/>
            pass mine. Let us then consider what it is that you find dis­ <lb/>
            agreeable in my mode of life. 5. Is it that while others, who <lb/>
            receive money, must perform the service for which they re­ <lb/>
            ceive it, while I, who receive none, am under no necessity to <lb/>
            discourse with any one that I do not like ? Or do you despise <lb/>
            my way of living, on the supposition that I eat less whole­ <lb/>
            some or less strengthening food than yourself? Or is it that <lb/>
            my diet is more difficult to procure than yours, as being more <lb/>
            rare and expensive ? Or is it that what you procure for <lb/>
            yourself is more agreeable to you than what I provide for <lb/>
            myself is to me? Do you not know that he who cats with <lb/>
            the most pleasure is he who least requires sauce, and that he <lb/>
            who drinks with the greatest pleasure is he who least desires <lb/>
            other drink than that which he has ? 6. You know that those <lb/>
            who change their clothes, change them because of cold and <lb/>
            heat, and that men put on sandals that they may not be pre­ <lb/>
            vented from walking through annoyances to the feet; but <lb/>
            have you ever observed me remaining at home, on account of <lb/>
            cold, more than any other man, or fighting with any one for <lb/>
            shade because of heat, or not walking wherever I please be­ <lb/>
            cause my feet suffer ? 7. Do you not know that those who <lb/>
            are by nature the weakest, become, by exercising their bodies, <lb/>
            stronger in those things in which they exercise them, than <lb/>
            those who neglect them, and bear the fatigue of exercise with <lb/>
            greater ease ? And do you not think that I, who am con­ <lb/>
            stantly preparing my body by exercise to endure whatever <lb/>
            may happen to it, bear everything more easily than you who <lb/>
            take no exercise ? 8. And to prevent me from being a slave <lb/>
            to gluttony, or sleep, or other animal gratifications, can you <lb/>
            imagine any cause more efficient than having other objects of <lb/>
            attention more attractive than they, which not only afford <lb/>
            pleasure in the moment of enjoying them, but give hopes that <lb/>
            they will benefit me perpetually ? You are aware of this also, <lb/>
            that those who think themselves successful in nothing, are far <lb/>
            from being cheerful, but that those who regard their agricul­ <lb/>
            ture, their seamanship, or whatever other occupation they <lb/>
            pursue, as going on favourably for them, are delighted as with <lb/>
            present success ? 9. But do you think that from all these <pb n="382"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. I. </note> <lb/>
            gratifications so much pleasure can arise as from the consci­ <lb/>
            ousness that you are growing better yourself, and are acquir­ <lb/>
            ing more valuable friends ? Such is the consciousness, then, <lb/>
            which I continue to enjoy.</p>
          <p>“ But if there should be occasion to assist our friends or our <lb/>
            country, which of the two would have most leisure to attend <lb/>
            to such objects, he who lives as I live now, or he who lives, <lb/>
            as you think, in happiness? Which of the two would most <lb/>
            readily seek the field of battle, he who cannot exist without <lb/>
            expensive dishes, or he who is content with whatever comes <lb/>
            before him ? Which of the two would sooner be reduced by <lb/>
            a siege, he who requires what is most difficult to be found, or <lb/>
            he who is fully content with what is easiest to be met with ? <lb/>
            10. You, Antipho, seem to think that happiness consists in <lb/>
            luxury and extravagance; but I think that to want nothing <lb/>
            is to resemble the gods, and that to want as little as possible <lb/>
            is to make the nearest approach to the gods; that the Divine <lb/>
            nature is perfection, and that to be nearest to the Divine nature <lb/>
            is to be nearest to perfection."</p>
          <p>11. On another occasion, Antipho, in a conversation with <lb/>
            Socrates, said, "I consider you indeed to be a just man, So­ <lb/>
            crates, but by no means a wise one; and you appear to me <lb/>
            yourself to be conscious of this; for you ask money from no <lb/>
            one for the privilege of associating with you; although, if you <lb/>
            considered a garment of yours, or a house, or any other thing <lb/>
            that you possess, to be worth money, you would not only not <lb/>
            give it to anybody for nothing, but you would not take less <lb/>
            than its full value for it. 12. It is evident, therefore, that if <lb/>
            you thought your conversation to be worth anything, you <lb/>
            would demand for it no less remuneration than it is worth. <lb/>
            You may, accordingly, be a just man, because you deceive <lb/>
            nobody from covetousness, but wise you cannot be, as you <lb/>
            have no knowledge that is of any value." 13. Socrates, in <lb/>
            reply, said, " It is believed among us, Antipho, that it is <lb/>
            possible to dispose of beauty, or of wisdom, alike honourably <lb/>
            or dishonourably;1 for if a person sells his beauty for money <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νομίζεται τὴν ὥραν καὶ τὴν σοφίαν ὁμοίως μὲν καλὸν, ὁμοίως δέ <lb/>
            αἰσχρὸν διατίϑεσαι εἷναι</foreign>.] The sense seems to be, that it is alike <lb/>
            honourable or dishonourable to dispose of beauty (in a certain way) <lb/>
            and to dispose of wisdom (in a certain way): i. e. that there is a <lb/>
            certain way of disposing of beauty honourably, and a certain way </note> <pb n="383"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            to any one that wishes to purchase, men call him a male pros­ <lb/>
            titute; but if any one makes a friend of a person whom he <lb/>
            knows to be an honourable and worthy admirer, we regard <lb/>
            him as prudent: and, in like manner, those who sell their <lb/>
            wisdom for money, to any that will buy, men call sophists, <lb/>
            or, as it were, prostituters of wisdom ; Iut whoever makes a <lb/>
            friend of a person whom he knows to be deserving, by teach­ <lb/>
            in,,,, him all the good that he knows, we consider him to act the <lb/>
            part which becomes an honourable and good citizen. 14. <lb/>
            As any other man, therefore, Antipho, takes delight in a good <lb/>
            horse, or do,-, or bird, so I, to a still greater degree, take de­ <lb/>
            light in valuable friends; and, if I know anything good, I <lb/>
            communicate it to them, and recommend them, also, to any <lb/>
            other teachers by whom I conceive that they will be at all <lb/>
            advanced in virtue. The treasures, too, of the wise men of <lb/>
            old, which they have left written in books, I turn over and <lb/>
            peruse in company with my friends, and if we find anything <lb/>
            good in them, we remark it, and think it a great gain if we <lb/>
            thus become more attached 1 to one another." To me, who <lb/>
            heard him utter these sentiments, Socrates appeared to be <lb/>
            both happy himself, and to lead those that listened to him <lb/>
            to honour and virtue.</p>
          <p>15. Again, when Antipho asked him how he imagined that <lb/>
            he could make men skilful statesmen, when he himself took <lb/>
            no part in state affairs, if indeed he knew anything of them, <lb/>
            "In which of the two ways," said he, "Antipho, should I <lb/>
            better promote the management of affairs ; if I myself engage <lb/>
            in them alone, or if I make it my care that as many as possi­ <lb/>
            ble may be qualified to engage in them?" <note type="footnote">of disposing of it dishonourably, and that the same is the case with <lb/>
            regard to wisdom, or talent. My translation is much the same as <lb/>

          <p>Dissuasions from ostentation. He that desires to be distinguished, should <lb/>
            endeavour to be what he would wish to seem. He that pretends to be <lb/>
            what he is not, exposes himself to great ineonvenicnce and ridicule, and <lb/>
            may bring disgrace and detriment on his country.</p>
          <p>I. LET us consider also, whether, by dissuading his fol­ <lb/>
            lowers from ostentation, he excited them to pursue virtue. He <lb/>
            always used to say that there was no better road to honour­ <lb/>
            able distinction, than that by which a person should become <lb/>
            excellent in that in which he wished to appear excellent.</p>
          <p>2. That he said what was just, he used to prove by the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing arguments. "Let us consider," he would say, " what <lb/>
            a person must do, if, not being a good flute-player, he should <lb/>
            wish to appear so ? Must he not imitate good flute-players <lb/>
            in the adjuncts of their art ? In the first place, as flute-players <lb/>
            procure fine dresses, and go about with a great number of <lb/>
            attendants, he must act in a similar manner; and as many <lb/>
            people applaud them, lie must get many to applaud him; yet <lb/>
            lie must never attempt to play, or he will at once be shown to <lb/>
            be ridiculous, and not only a bad flute-player, but a vain <lb/>
            boaster. Thus, after having been at great expense without <lb/>
            the least benefit, and having, in addition, incurred evil repute, <lb/>
            how will he live otherwise than in uneasiness, unprofitable­ <lb/>
            ness, and derision ?</p>
          <p>3. "In like manner, if any one should wish to be thought a <lb/>
            good general, or a good steersman of a ship, without being so, <lb/>
            let us reflect what would be his success. If, when he longed <lb/>
            to seem capable of performing the duties of those characters, <lb/>
            he should be unable to persuade others of his capability, <lb/>
            would not this be a trouble to him? and, if he should per­ <lb/>
            suade them of it, would it not be still more unfortunate for <lb/>
            him ? For it is evident that he who is appointed to steer a <lb/>
            vessel, or to lead an army, without having the necessary <lb/>
            knowledge, would be likely to destroy those 1 whom he would <lb/>
            not wish to destroy, and would come off himself with disgrace <lb/>
            and suffering."</p>
          <p>4. By similar examples he showed that it was of no profit <note type="footnote"> I Ilis friends, and such as he would wish to applaud him. </note> <pb n="385"/>

            for a man to appear rich, or valiant, or strong, without being <lb/>
            so; for lie said that demands were made upon such persons <lb/>
            too great for their ability, and that, not being able to comply <lb/>
            with them, when they seemed to be able, they met with no <lb/>
            indulgence.</p>
          <p>5. He called him, also, no small impostor, who, obtaining <lb/>
            money or furniture from his neighbour by persuasion, should <lb/>

            who, possessed of no valuable qualifications, should deceive <lb/>
            men by representing himself capable of governing his country. <lb/>
            To me he appeared, by discoursing in this manner, to deter <lb/>
            his associates from vain boasting.</p>

          <p>Socrates, suspecting that Aristippus, a man of pleasure, was aspiring to a <lb/>
            place in the government, admonishes him that temperance is an essential <lb/>
            qualification in a statesman, sect. 1—7. But as Aristippus says that ho <lb/>
            looked only to a life of leisure and tranquil enjoyment, Socrates intro­ <lb/>
            duces the question, whether those who govern, or those who are <lb/>
            governed, live the happier life, 8—10. Aristippus signifies that he wished <lb/>
            neither to govern nor to be governed, but to enjoy liberty; and Socrates <lb/>
            shows that such liberty as he desired is inconsistent with the nature of <lb/>
            human society, 11—13. Aristippus still adhering to his own views, and <lb/>
            declaring his intention not to remain in any one country, but to visit and <lb/>
            sojourn in many, Socrates shows him the dangers of such a mode of life, <lb/>
            14—16. But as Aristippus proceeds to aceuse those of folly who prefer <lb/>
            a life of toil in the affairs of government to a life of case, Socrates shows <lb/>
            the difference between those who labour voluntarily, and those whe <lb/>
            labour from compulsion, and observes that nothing good is given to mor­ <lb/>
            tals without labour, 17—20; in illustration of which remark he relates <lb/>
            the fable of Prodicus, THE CHOICE OF HERCULES, 21—31.</p>
          <p>I. HE appeared also to me, by such discourses as the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing, to exhort his hearers to practise temperance in their <lb/>
            desires for food, drink, sensual gratification, and sleep, and <lb/>
            endurance of cold, heat, and labour.' But finding that one of <lb/>
            his associates was too intemperately disposed with regard to <lb/>
            such matters, he said to him, " Tell me, Aristippus, I if it were <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristippus of Cyrene, the founder of the Cyrenaic sect of philo-</note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 c </note> <pb n="386"/>

            required of you to take two of our youths and educate them, <lb/>
            the one in such a manner that he would be qualified to <lb/>
            govern, and the other in such a manner that he would never <lb/>
            seek to govern, how would you train them respectively? <lb/>
            Will you allow us to consider the matter by commencing with <lb/>
            their food, as with the first principles?" "Food, indeed," re­ <lb/>
            plied Aristippus, "appears to me one of the first principles ; <lb/>
            for a person could not even live if he were not to take food." <lb/>
            2. "It will be natural for them both, then," said Socrates, <lb/>
            "to desire to partake of food when a certain hour comes." <lb/>
            " It will be natural," said Aristippus. "And which of the <lb/>
            two, then," said Socrates, "should we accustom to prefer the <lb/>
            discharge of any urgent business to the gratification of his <lb/>
            appetite?" " Tile one undoubtedly," rejoined Aristippus, <lb/>
            " who is trained to rule, that the business of the state may <lb/>
            not be neglected during his administration." " And on the <lb/>
            same person," continued Socrates, " we must, when they <lb/>
            desire to drink, impose the duty of being able to endure <lb/>
            thirst?" "Assuredly," replied Aristippus. 3. And on <lb/>
            which of the two should we by the necessity of being tem­ <lb/>
            perate in sleep, so as to be able to go to rest late, to rise early, <lb/>
            or to remain awake if it should be necessary?" "Upon the <lb/>
            same, doubtless." "And on which of the two should we im­ <lb/>
            pose the obligation to control his sensual appetites, that he <lb/>
            may not be hindered by their influence from discharging <lb/>
            whatever duty may be required of him ?" " Upon the same." <lb/>
            "And on which of the two should we enjoin the duty of not <lb/>
            shrinking from labour, but willingly submitting to it?" "This <lb/>
            also is to be enjoined on him who is trained to rule." "And <lb/>
            to which of the two would it more properly belong to acquire <lb/>
            whatever knowledge would assist him to secure the mastery <lb/>
            over his rivals?" "Far more, doubtless, to him who is <lb/>
            trained to govern, for without such sort of acquirements there <lb/>
            would be no profit in any of his other qualifications." 4. "A <lb/>
            man, then, who is thus instructed, would appear to you less <lb/>
            liable to be surprised by his enemies than other animals, of <lb/>
            which some, we know, are caught by their greediness; and <lb/>
            others, though very shy, are yet attracted to the bait by their <lb/>
            desire to swallow it, and consequently taken; while others <note type="footnote">sophers, who thought pleasure the greatest good, and pain the <lb/>

            also are entrapped by drink." " Indisputably," replied Aris­ <lb/>
            tippus. "Are not others, too, caught through. Their salacious­ <lb/>
            ness, as quails and partridges, which, being attracted to the <lb/>
            call of the female by desire and hope of enjoyment, and losing <lb/>
            all consideration of danger, fall into traps?" To this Aris­ <lb/>
            tippus expressed his assent. 5. " Docs it not then," proceeded <lb/>
            Socrates, "appear to you shameful for a man to yield to the <lb/>
            same influence as the most senseless of animals; as adulterers, <lb/>
            for instance, knowing that the adulterer is in danger of suffer­ <lb/>
            in.- what the law threatens, and of being watched, and dis­ <lb/>
            graced if caught, yet enter into closets ; and, though there <lb/>
            are such dangers and dishonours hanging over the intriguer, <lb/>
            and so many occupations that will free him from the desire of <lb/>
            sensual gratification, does it not seem to you the part of one <lb/>
            tormented with an evil genius, to run, nevertheless, into im­ <lb/>
            minent. peril?" "It does seem so to me." said Aristippus. <lb/>
            6. " And since the greater part of the most necessary employ­ <lb/>
            ments of life, such as those of war and agriculture, and not a <lb/>
            few others, arc to be carried on in the open air, does it not <lb/>
            appear to you to show great negligence, that, the majority of <lb/>
            mankind should be wholly unexercised to bear cold and heat ? " <lb/>
            Aristippus replied in the affirmative. "Does it not then <lb/>
            appear to you that we ought to train him who is intended to <lb/>
            rule, to bear these inconveniences also without, difficulty?" <lb/>
            " Doubtless," answered Aristippus. 7. " If, therefore, we class <lb/>
            those capable of enduring these things among those who are <lb/>
            qualified to govern, shall we not class such as are incapable <lb/>
            of enduring them among those who will not even aspire to <lb/>
            govern ?" Aristippus expressed his assent. " In conclusion, <lb/>
            then, since you know the position of each of these classes of <lb/>
            men, have you ever considered in which of them you can <lb/>
            reasonably place yourself?" s. "I have indeed," said Aris­ <lb/>
            tippus, "and I by no means place myself in the class of <lb/>
            those desiring to rule ; for it appears to me that, when it is a <lb/>
            task of great difficulty to procure necessaries for one's self, it <lb/>
            is the mark of a very foolish man not to be satisfied with that <lb/>
            occupation,1 but to add to it the labour of procuring for his <lb/>
            fellow-countrymen whatever they need. And is it not the <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μὴ̀ άρκι̃ν του̃το</foreign>.] That is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺτο μὴ άρκει̃ν αὺτῳ̃</foreign>, " that that <lb/>
            occupation should not be sufficient for him ; " should not content <lb/>
            him. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 c 2 </note> <pb n="388"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. II. </note> <lb/>
            greatest folly in him, that while many things which he desires <lb/>
            are out of his reach, he should, by setting himself at the head <lb/>
            of the state, subject himself, if he does not accomplish all that <lb/>
            the people desire, to be punished for his failure? 9. For the <lb/>
            people think it right to use their governors as I use my <lb/>
            slaves ; for I require my slaves to supply me with the neces­ <lb/>
            saries of life in abundance, but to take no part of them them­ <lb/>
            selves ; and the people think it the duty of their governors <lb/>
            to supply them with as many enjoyments as possible, but <lb/>
            themselves to abstain from all of them. Those, therefore, <lb/>
            who wish to have much trouble themselves, and to give <lb/>
            trouble to others, I I would train in this manner, and rank <lb/>
            among those qualified to govern ; but myself I would number <lb/>
            with those who wish to pass their lives in the greatest pos­ <lb/>
            sible ease and pleasure."</p>
          <p>10. Socrates then said, " Will you allow us to consider this <lb/>
            point also, whether the governors or the governed live with <lb/>
            the greater pleasure?" " By all means," said Aristippus. <lb/>
            " In the first place, then, of the nations of which we have any <lb/>
            knowledge, the Persians bear rule in Asia, and the Syrians, <lb/>
            Phrygians, and Lydians are under subjection ; the Seythians <lb/>
            govern in Europe, and the Medians2are held in subjection; <lb/>
            the Carthaginians rule in Africa, and the Libyans are under <lb/>
            subjection. Which of these do you regard as living with the <lb/>
            greater pleasure? Or among the Greeks, of whom you your­ <lb/>
            self arc, which of the two appear to you to live more happily, <lb/>
            those who rule, or those who are in subjection ?" 11. "Yet, <lb/>
            on the other hand,"3 said Aristippus, "I do not consign <lb/>
            myself to slavery; but there appears to me to be a certain <lb/>
            middle path between the two, in which I endeavour to pro- <note type="footnote"> I lie that holds the reins of government, must not only undergo <lb/>
            much toil and trouble himself, but must also enjoin many tasks and <lb/>

            With this passage of Xenophon may aptly be compared what the <lb/>
            Corinthians say of the Athenians in Thucydides, i. 10: "If any <lb/>
            one should say, in a word, that they are formed by nature neither <lb/>
            to enjoy quiet themselves, nor to suffer others to enjoy it, he would <lb/>
            speak of them rightly." Kûhner. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The people bordering on the lake Mæotis, which was in Sar­ <lb/>

            ceed, and which leads, not through slavery, but through <lb/>
            liberty, a path that most surely conducts to happiness." 12. <lb/>
            “ If this path of yours, indeed," said Socrates, “ as it lies <lb/>
            neither through sovereignty nor servitude, did not also lie <lb/>
            through human society, what you say would perhaps be worth <lb/>
            consideration ; but if, while living among mankind, you shall <lb/>
            neither think proper to rule nor to be ruled, and shall not will­ <lb/>
            ingly pay respect to those in power, I think that you will see <lb/>
            that the stronger know how to treat the weaker as slaves, mak­ <lb/>
            ing them to lament both publicly and privately. 13. Do those <lb/>
            escape your knowledge who fell and destroy the corn and trees <lb/>
            of others that have sown and planted them, and who assail in <lb/>
            every way such as are inferior to them, and are unwilling to flat­ <lb/>
            ter them, until they prevail on them to prefer slavery to <lb/>
            carrying on war against their superiors? In private life, too, <lb/>
            do you not see that the spirited and strong enslave the timor­ <lb/>
            ous and weak, and enjoy the fruits of their labours?" " But <lb/>
            for my part," answered Aristippus, “ in order that I may not <lb/>
            suffer such treatment, I shall not shut myself up in any one <lb/>
            state, but shall be a traveller everywhere.” 14. “ Doubtless," <lb/>
            rejoined Socrates, " this is an admirable plan that you pro­ <lb/>
            pose; for since Sinnis, and Sciron, and Procrustes1 were <lb/>
            killed, nobody injures travelers. Yet those who manage <lb/>
            the government in their several countries, even now make <lb/>
            laws, in order that they may not be injured, and attach to <lb/>
            themselves, in addition to such as are called their necessary <lb/>
            connexions, other supporters; they also surround their cities <lb/>
            with ramparts, and procure weapons with which they may <lb/>
            repel aggressors, securing, besides all these means of defence, <lb/>
            other allies from abroad ; and yet those who have provided <lb/>
            themselves with all these bulwarks, nevertheless suffer injury ; <lb/>
            13. and do you, having no protection of the sort, spending a <lb/>
            long time on roads on which a very great number are out­ <lb/>
            raged, weaker than all the inhabitants of whatever city you <lb/>
            may arrive at, and being such a character2 as those who are <note type="footnote"> I Celebrated robbers, put to death by Theseus. There is a plea­ <lb/>

            would wish to keep in his house a man not at all disposed to <lb/>
            labour, and delighting in the most expensive fare? in. But <lb/>
            let us consider how masters treat slaves of such a sort. Do <lb/>
            they not tame down their fondness for dainties by hunger? <lb/>
            Do they not hinder them from stealing by excluding them <lb/>
            from every place from whence they may take anything? Do <lb/>
            they not prevent them from running away by putting fetters <lb/>
            on them? Do they not overcome their laziness by stripes? <lb/>
            Or how do you yourself act, when you find any one of your <lb/>
            slaves to be of such a disposition?” 17. “ I chastise him,” <lb/>
            said Aristippus, “ with every kind of punishment, until I <lb/>
            compel him to serve me ? But how do those, Socrates, who <lb/>
            are trained to the art of ruling, which yon seem to me to con­ <lb/>
            sider as happiness, differ from those who undergo hardships <lb/>
            from necessity, since they will have (though it be with <lb/>
            their own consent) to endure hunger, and thirst, and cold, and <lb/>
            want of sleep, and suffer all other inconveniences of the same <lb/>
            kind ? 18. For I, for lilY own part, do not know what differ­ <lb/>
            ence it makes to a man who is scourged on the same skin, <lb/>
            whether it be voluntarily or involuntarily, or, in short, to one <lb/>
            who suffers with the same body in all such points, whether lie <lb/>
            suffer with his consent or against it, except that folly is to be <lb/>
            attributed to him who endures troubles voluntarily.” “ What <lb/>
            then, Aristippus,” said Socrates, “do not voluntary endur­ <lb/>
            ances of this kind seem to you to differ from the involuntary, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he who is hungry from choice may eat when <lb/>
            he pleases, and he who is thirsty from choice may drink when <lb/>
            he pleases, the same being the case with regard to other <lb/>
            voluntary sufferings, while he who endures such hardships <lb/>
            from necessity has no liberty to relieve himself from them <lb/>
            when he wishes ? Besides, lie who undergoes trouble will­ <lb/>
            ingly, is cheered in undergoing it with some expectation of <lb/>
            good, as the hunters of wild animals bear fatigue with plea­ <lb/>
            sure in the. hope of capturing them. 19. And such rewards <lb/>
            of toil are indeed but of small worth ; but as for those who <pb n="391"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            toil that they may acquire valuable friends, or that they may <lb/>
            subdue their enemies, or they may, by becoming vigorous in <lb/>
            body and mind, manage their own household judiciously, and <lb/>
            be of service to their friends and of advantage to their coun­ <lb/>
            try, how can you think that they labour for such objects <lb/>
            otherwise than cheerfully, or that they do not live in happi­ <lb/>
            ness, esteeming themselves, and being praised and envied by <lb/>
            others? 20. But indolence, moreover, and pleasures enjoyed <lb/>
            at the moment of desire,1 are neither capable of producing a <lb/>
            good constitution of body, as the teachers of gymnastic exer­ <lb/>
            cises say, nor do they bring to the mind any knowledge wor­ <lb/>
            thy of consideration ;2 but exercises pursued with persevering <lb/>
            labour lead men to the attainment of honourable and valuable <lb/>
            objects, as worthy men inform us; and Hesiod somewhere <lb/>
            says, <lb/>
            Vice it is possible to find in abundance and with ease; for the <lb/>
            way to it in smooth, and lies very near. But before the temple <lb/>
            of Virtue the immortal gods have placed labour, and the way <lb/>
            to it is long and steep, and at the commencement rough; but <lb/>
            when the traveller has arrived at the summit, it then becomes <lb/>
            easy, however difficult it was at first. <lb/>
            A sentiment to which Epicharmus gives his testimony in <lb/>

            of his ability, expresses a similar notion respecting virtue, <lb/>
            speaking, as far as I remember, to the following effect: For <lb/>
            he says that Hercules, when he was advancing from boyhood <lb/>
            to manhood, a period at which the young, becoming their own <lb/>
            masters, begin to give intimations whether they will enter on <lb/>
            life by the path of virtue or that of vice, went forth into a <lb/>
            solitary place, and sat down, perplexed as to which of these <lb/>
            two paths lie should pursue ; 22. and that two female figures, <lb/>
            of lofty stature, seemed to advance towards him, the one of <lb/>
            an engaging and graceful mien, gifted by nature with elegance <lb/>
            of form, modesty of look, and sobriety of demeanour,3 and <lb/>
            clad in a white robe ; the other fed to plumpness and softness, <lb/>
            but assisted by art both in her complexion, so as to seem <lb/>
            fairer and rosier than she really was, and in her gesture, so <lb/>
            as to seem taller than her natural height; she had her eyes <lb/>
            wide open,4 and a robe through which her beauty would <lb/>
            readily show itself; she frequently contemplated her figure, <lb/>
            and looked about to see if any one else was observing her; <lb/>
            and she frequently glanced back at her own shadow. 23. As <note type="footnote"> I ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ο σοφός</foreign>.] Sturz and others consider <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφὸς</foreign>, in this passage, to <lb/>

            why it should not be rendered the wise. " On Prodicus, the famous <lb/>

            they approachednearer to Hercules, slip, whom I first de­ <lb/>
            scribed, came forward at the same pace, but the other, eager <lb/>
            to get before her, ran up to Hercules, and exclaimed, "I see <lb/>
            that you are hesitating, Hercules, by what path you shall <lb/>
            enter upon life ; if, then, you make a friend of me, I will <lb/>
            conduct you by the most delightful and easy road, and you <lb/>
            shall taste of every species of pleasure, and lead a life free <lb/>
            from every sort of trouble. 24. In the first place, you shall <lb/>
            take no thought of wars or state affairs, but shall pass your <lb/>
            time considering what meat or drink yon may find to gratify <lb/>
            your appetite, what you may delight yourself by seeing or <lb/>
            hearing, what you may be pleased with smelling or touching, <lb/>
            with what objects of affection you may have most pleasure in <lb/>
            associating, how you may sleep most softly, and how you may <lb/>
            secure all these enjoyments with the least degree of trouble. <lb/>
            25. If an apprehension of want of means, by which such de­ <lb/>
            lights may be obtained, should ever arise in you, there is no <lb/>
            fear that I shall urge you to procure them by toil or suffering <lb/>
            either of body or mind ; but you shall enjoy what others ac­ <lb/>
            quire by labour, abstaining from nothing by which it may be <lb/>
            possible to profit, for I give my followers liberty to benefit <lb/>
            themselves from any source whatever."</p>
          <p>26. Hercules, on hearing this address, said, " And what, 0 <lb/>
            woman, is your name ?" "My friends," she replied, "call me <lb/>
            Happiness, but those who hate me, give me, to my disparage­ <lb/>
            ment, the name of Vice."</p>
          <p>27. In the mean time the other female approached, and <lb/>
            said, "I also am come to address you, Hercules, because I <lb/>
            know your parents, and have observed your disposition in the <lb/>
            training of your childhood, from which I entertain hopes, that <lb/>

          <p>A dialogue between Socrates and his son Lamprocles, who had expressed <lb/>
            resentment against his mother. on the duty of children to their parents. <lb/>
            The ungrateful are to be deemed unjust, stet. 1, 2. The greater benefits <lb/>
            a person has received, the more unjust is he if he is ungrateful; and there <lb/>
            are no greater benefits than those which children experience from their <lb/>
            parents, 3—6. Hence it follows that a son ought to reverence his mother, <lb/>
            though she be severe, when he knows that her severity proceeds from <lb/>
            kind motives, 7—12. How great a crime the neglect of filial duty is, ap­ <lb/>
            pears from the fact that it is punished by the laws and execrated by mail­ <lb/>
            kind, 13, 14.</p>
          <p>I. HAVING learned, one day, that Lamprocles, the eldest1 of <lb/>
            his sons, had exhibited anger against his mother, " Tell me, <lb/>
            my son," said he, " do you know that certain persons are <lb/>
            called ungrateful?" " Certainly," replied the youth. "And <lb/>
            do you understand how it is they act that men give them this <lb/>
            appellation ?" "I do," said Lamprocles, " for it is those that <lb/>
            have received a kindness, and that do not make a return when <lb/>
            they are able to make one, whom they call ungrateful." " They <lb/>
            then appear to you to class the ungrateful with the unjust?" <lb/>
            " I think so." a. "And have you ever considered whether, as <lb/>
            it is thought unjust to make slaves of our friends, but just to <note type="footnote"> I Socrates had three sons, Lamprocles, Soplironiscus, and Me­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.| </note> <lb/>
            make slaves of our enemies, so it is unjust to be ungrateful to­ <lb/>
            wards our friends, but just to be so towards our enemies ?” <lb/>
            ‘ I certainly have," answered Lamprocles, "and from whom­ <lb/>
            soever a man receives a favour, whether friend or enemy, and <lb/>
            does not endeavour to make a return for it, he is in my opinion <lb/>
            unjust."</p>
          <p>3. “If such, then, be the case,” pursued Socrates, “ ingra­ <lb/>
            titude must be manifest injustice?” Lamprocles expressed <lb/>
            his assent. " The greater benefits, therefore, a person has <lb/>
            received, and makes no return, the more unjust he must be.” <lb/>
            He assented to this position also. " Whom, then," asked <lb/>
            Socrates, "can we find receiving greater benefits from any <lb/>
            persons than children receive from their parents ? children <lb/>
            whom their parents have brought from non-existence into ex­ <lb/>
            istence, to view so many beautiful objects, and to share in so <lb/>
            many blessings, as the gods grant to men; blessings which <lb/>
            appear to us so inestimable, that we shrink, in the highest <lb/>
            degree, from relinquishing them; and governments have <lb/>
            made death the penalty for the most heinous crimes, in the sup­ <lb/>
            position that they could not suppress injustice by the terror <lb/>
            of any greater evil. 4. You do not, surely, suppose that men <lb/>
            beget children merely to gratify their passions, since the streets <lb/>
            are full, as well as the brothels, of means to allay desire; but <lb/>
            what we evidently consider, is, from what sort of women the <lb/>
            finest1 children may be born to us, and, uniting with them, <lb/>
            we beget children. 5. The man maintains her who joins with <lb/>
            him to produce offspring, and provides, for the children that <lb/>
            are likely to be born to him, whatever he thinks will conduce <lb/>
            to their support, in as great abundance as he can ; while the <lb/>
            woman receives and bears the burden, oppressed and endan­ <lb/>

            nor is it able to signify what it wants, but she, conjecturing what <lb/>
            will nourish and please it, tries to satisfy its calls, and feeds it <lb/>

          <p>7. Upon this the young man said, “ But, even if she has <lb/>
            done all this, and many times more than this, no one, assuredly, <lb/>
            could endure her ill-humour,” “ And which do you think," <lb/>
            asked Socrates, more difficult to be endured, " the ill-humour <lb/>
            of a wild beast, or that of a mother ?”"I think," replied <lb/>
            Lamprocles, " that of a mother, at least of such a mother as <lb/>
            mine is.,, " Has she ever then inflicted any hurt upon you, <lb/>
            by biting or kicking you, as many have often suffered from <lb/>
            wild beasts ? " 8. “ No ; but, by Jupiter, she says such things <lb/>
            as no one would endure to hear for the value of all that he <lb/>
            possesses." " And do you reflect," returned Socrates, " how <lb/>
            much grievous trouble you have given her by your peevish­ <lb/>
            ness, by voice and by action, in the day and in the night, <lb/>
            and how much anxiety you have caused her when you were <lb/>
            ill ? ” “ But I have never said or done anything to her,” re­ <lb/>
            plied Lamprocles, " at which she could feel ashamed." 9. " Do <lb/>
            you think it, then," inquired Socrates, "a more difficult thing <lb/>
            for you to listen to what she says, than for actors to listen <lb/>
            when they utter the bitterest reproaches against one another <lb/>
            in tragedies?" “ But actors, I imagine, endure such re­ <lb/>
            preaches easily, because they do not think that, of the speakers, <lb/>
            the one who utters reproaches, utters them with intent to do <lb/>
            harm, or that the one who utters threats, utters them with <lb/>
            any evil purpose." " Yet you are displeased at your mother, <lb/>
            although you well know that whatever she says, she not only <lb/>
            says nothing with intent to do you harm, but that lie wishes <lb/>
            you more good than any other human being. Or do you sup­ <lb/>
            pose that your mother meditates evil towards you ? ” “ No <lb/>
            indeed,” said Lamprocles, "that I do not imagine." 10. “ Do <lb/>
            you then say that this mother,” rejoined Socrates, "who is so <lb/>
            benevolent to you, who, when you are ill, takes care of you, <lb/>
            to the utmost of her power, that you may recover your health, <pb n="399"/>

            who, besides, entreats the gods for many blessings on your <lb/>
            head, and pays vows for you, is a harsh mother ? For my <lb/>
            part, I think that if you cannot endure such a mother, you <lb/>
            cannot endure anything that is good? 11. But tell me," <lb/>
            continued he, " whether you think that you ought to fay re­ <lb/>
            spect to any other human being, or whether you are resolved <lb/>
            to try to please nobody, and to follow or obey neither a general <lb/>
            nor any other commander ? " " No indeed," replied Lamprocles, <lb/>
            "I have formed no such resolution." 12. “Are you then <lb/>
            willing," inquired Socrates, " to cultivate the good-will of <lb/>
            your neighbour, that lie may kindle a fire for you when you <lb/>
            Want it, or aid you in obtaining some good, or, if you happen <lb/>
            to meet with any misfortune, may assist you with willing and <lb/>
            ready help ? " "I am," replied he. " Or would it make no <lb/>
            difference,” rejoined Socrates, “ whether a fellow-traveller, or <lb/>
            fellow-voyager, or any other person that you met with, should <lb/>
            be your friend or enemy ? Or do you think that you ought <lb/>
            to cultivate their good-will?" "I think that I ought," re­ <lb/>
            plied Lamprocles. is. " You are then prepared,” returned So­ <lb/>
            crates, " to pay attention to such persons ; and do you think <lb/>
            that you ought to pay no respect to your mother, who loves <lb/>
            you more than any one else ? Do you not know that the state <lb/>
            takes no account of any other species of ingratitude, nor allow? <lb/>
            any action at law for it, overlooking such as receive a favour <lb/>
            and make no return for it, but that if a person does not pay <lb/>
            due regard to his parents, it imposes a punishment on him,1 <lb/>
            rejects his services, and does not allow him to hold the arch­ <lb/>

            the sacrifices offered for the country, or discharge any other <lb/>
            duty with propriety and justice. Indeed if any one does not <lb/>
            keep up the sepulchres of his dead parents, the state inquires <lb/>
            into it in the examinations of candidates for office. 14. You <lb/>

          <p>Socrates, hearing that two brothers, Chærephon and Chærecrates, had quar­ <lb/>
            relled, recommends brotherly love to Chærecrates by the following argu­ <lb/>
            ments. A brother ought to be regarded as a friend, and esteemed more <lb/>
            than wealth, sect. 1; for wealth is an uncertain possession, if the possess <lb/>
            or of it is destitute of friends, 2, 3. Fraternal love an appointment of <lb/>
            Nature; and men who have brothers are more respected than those who <lb/>
            have one, 4. Even though a brother should conceive ill feelings towards <lb/>
            us, we should still endeavour to conciliate him, 5—9. How such concili­ <lb/>
            ation may be effected, 10—14. The endeavour to conciliate is still more <lb/>
            the duty of a younger than of an elder brother, and the more noble the <lb/>
            disposition of a brother is, the more easy will it he to conciliate him, <lb/>
            15—17. Brothers should act in unison with one another, like different <lb/>
            members of the same body, 18, 19.</p>
          <p>1. SOCRATES, having observed that Chærephon and Chære <lb/>
            crates, two brothers well known to hint, were at variance with <lb/>
            each other, and having met with Chærecrates, said, “ Tell me, <lb/>
            Chærecrates, you surely are not one of those men, are you, <lb/>
            who think wealth more valuable than brothers, when wealth <lb/>
            is but a senseless thing, and a brother endowed with reason, <lb/>
            when wealth needs protection, while a brother can afford pro­ <lb/>
            tection, and when wealth, besides, is plentiful, and a brother <lb/>
            but one?1 2. It is wonderful, too, that a man should con­ <lb/>
            sider brothers to be a detriment to him, because he does not <lb/>
            possess his brothers' fortunes, while he does not consider his <lb/>
            fellow-citizens to be a detriment, because he does not possess <lb/>
            their fortunes; but, in the latter case, he can reason with <lb/>
            himself, that it is better for him, living in society with many, <lb/>
            to enjoy a competency in security, than, living alone, to possess <lb/>
            all the property of his fellow-citizens in fear of danger, while, <lb/>
            with regard to brothers, he knows not how to apply such rea- <note type="footnote"> I “ After all, there is more money than brothers." Bysshe's <lb/>

            soning. 3. Those who are able, too, purchase slaves, that they <lb/>
            may have helpers in their work, and procure friends, as being <lb/>
            in need of supporters, while they neglect their brothers, as if <lb/>
            friends could be made of fellow-citizens, but could not be <lb/>
            made of brothers. 4. Yet it surely conduces greatly to friend­ <lb/>
            ship to have been born of the same parents, and to have been <lb/>
            brought up together, since, even among brutes, a certain affec­ <lb/>
            tion springs up between those that are reared together. In <lb/>
            addition to these considerations, men pay more respect to those <lb/>
            who have brothers than to those who have none, and are less <lb/>
            forward to commit aggression on them.”</p>
          <p>5. To this Chærecrates made answer, " If, indeed, Socrates, <lb/>
            the dissension between us were not great, it might perhaps be <lb/>
            my duty to bear with my brother, and not shun his society <lb/>
            for slight causes; for a brother, as you say, is a valuable <lb/>
            possession, if he be such as he ought to be; but when he <lb/>
            is nothing of the sort, and is indeed quite the reverse of <lb/>
            what he should be, why should I attempt impossibilities ?" <lb/>
            6. " Whether, then, Chærecrates,” rejoined Socrates, " is <lb/>
            Chærephon unable to please anybody, as he is unable to <lb/>
            please you, or are there some whom he certainly can please ?" <lb/>
            " Yes," replied Chærecrates, " for it is for this very reason <lb/>
            that I justly hate him, that he can please others, while to me <lb/>
            he is on all occasions, whenever he comes in contact with me, <lb/>
            a harm rather than a good, both in word and deed." 7. " IS <lb/>
            the ease then thus,” said Socrates, " that as a horse is a harm <lb/>
            to him who knows not how to manage him, and yet tries to <lb/>
            do so, so a brother is a harm, when a person tries to manage <lb/>
            him without knowing how to do it ?" 8. " But how can I <lb/>
            be ignorant," replied Chærecrates. “how to manage my <lb/>
            brother, when I know how to speak well of him who speaks <lb/>
            well of me, and to do well to him who does well to me ? As <lb/>
            to one, however, who seeks to vex me both by word and deed, <lb/>
            f should not be able either to speak well of him, or to act <lb/>
            well towards him, nor will I try." 9. " You speak strangely, <lb/>
            Chærecrates," rejoined Socrates, “ for if a dog of yours were <lb/>
            of service to watch your sheep, and fawned upon your shep­ <lb/>
            herds, but snarled when you approached him, you would for­ <lb/>
            bear to show any ill feeling towards him, but would endeavour <lb/>
            to tame him by kindness; but as for your brother, though <lb/>
            you admit that he would be a great good to you if he were <note type="footnote"> VOL 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 D </note> <pb n="402"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. II. </note> <lb/>
            such as lie ought to be, and though you confess that you know <lb/>
            how to act and speak well with respect to him, you do not <lb/>
            even attempt to make him of such service to you as he might <lb/>
            be.”1 10. " I fear, Socrates," replied Chærecrates, " that I <lb/>
            have not wisdom enough to render Chærephon such as he <lb/>
            ought to be towards me." " Yet there is no need to contrive <lb/>
            anything artful or novel to act upon him,” said Socrates, " as <lb/>
            it appears to me; for I think that he may be gained over by <lb/>
            means which you already know, and may conceive a high es­ <lb/>
            teem for you.” 11. " Tell me first," said the other, " whether <lb/>
            you have observed that I possess any love-charm, which I <lb/>
            was not aware that I knew ? " “Answer me this question," <lb/>
            said Socrates: "if you wished to induce any one of your ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance, when he offered sacrifice, to invite you to his <lb/>
            feast, what would you do?” "I should doubtless begin by <lb/>
            inviting him when I offered sacrifice.” 12. "And if you wished <lb/>
            to prevail on any of your friends to take care of your property, <lb/>
            when you went from home, what would you do ? " "I should <lb/>
            certainly first offer to take care of his property, when he went <lb/>
            from home." 13. "And if you wished to induce an acquaintance <lb/>
            in a foreign land to receive you hospitably when you visited his <lb/>
            country, what would you do ?” "I should unquestionably be <lb/>
            the first to receive him hospitably when he came to Athens; <lb/>
            and if I wished him to be desirous to effect for me the objects <lb/>
            for which I went thither, it is clear that I must first confer a <lb/>
            similar service on him." it. “Have you not long been un­ <lb/>
            awares acquainted, then, with all the love-charms that exist <lb/>
            among mankind ? Or are you afraid," continued Socrates, <lb/>
            " to make the first advances, lest you should seem to degrade <lb/>
            yourself, if you should be the first to propitiate your brother ? <lb/>
            Yet he is thought to be a man deserving of great praise, who <lb/>
            is the first to do harm to the enemy, and to do good to his <lb/>
            friends. If, then, Chærephon had appeared to me more <lb/>
            likely to bring you to this frame of mind, I would have <lb/>
            endeavoured to persuade him first to try to make you <lb/>
            his friend ; but, as things stand, you seem more likely, if <lb/>
            you take the lead, to effect the desired object.” IS. " You <lb/>
            speak unreasonably, Socrates," rejoined Chærecrates, “ and <note type="footnote"> 1 Kiihner, differing from other editors, puts a note of interroga­ <lb/>
            tion at the end of this sentence. It seems better not to take it in­ <lb/>

            not as might be expected from you, when you desire me, who <lb/>
            am the younger, to take the lead; for the established practice <lb/>
            among all men is quite the reverse, being that the elder should <lb/>
            always be first, both to act and speak." if-,. “How,” said So­ <lb/>
            crates; " is it not the custom everywhere that the younger <lb/>
            should yield the path to the elder when he meets him, rise <lb/>
            from his seat before him, honour him with the softest couch, <lb/>
            and give place to him in conversation? Do not therefore <lb/>
            hesitate, my good young friend, but endeavour to conciliate <lb/>
            your brother, and he will very soon listen to you. Do you <lb/>
            not see how fond of honour, and how liberal-minded, he is ? <lb/>
            Mean-minded persons you cannot attract more effectually <lb/>
            than by giving them something; but honourable and good <lb/>
            men you may best gain by treating them in a friendly spirit." <lb/>
            17. “ But what if he should become no kinder," said Chærecra­ <lb/>
            tes, “after I have done what you advise ?” " It will be of no <lb/>
            consequence," replied Socrates, "for what other risk will you <lb/>
            run but that of showing that you arc kind and full of brother­ <lb/>
            ly aflèction, and that lie is mean-spirited and unworthy ot <lb/>
            any kindness ? But I apprehend no such result; for I con­ <lb/>
            ceive that when lie finds you challenging him to such a con­ <lb/>
            test, he will be extremely emulous to excel you in doing <lb/>
            kindnesses both by word and deed. 18. At present, you are <lb/>
            in the same case as if the two hands, which the gods have <lb/>
            made to assist each other, should neglect this duty, and begin <lb/>
            to impede each other; or as if the two feet, formed by divine <lb/>
            providence to co-operate with one another, should give up this <lb/>
            office, and obstruct one another, 19. Would it not be a. great <lb/>
            folly and misfortune to use for our hurt what was formed for <lb/>
            our benefit? And indeed, as it appears to me, the gods have <lb/>
            designed brothers to be of greater mutual service than the <lb/>
            hands, or feet, or eyes, or other members which they have <lb/>
            made in pairs for men ; for the hands, if required to do things, <lb/>
            at the same time, at greater distance than a fathom, would be <lb/>
            unable to do them ; the feet cannot reach two objects, at the <lb/>
            same time, that are distant even a fathom; and the eyes, <lb/>
            which seem to reach to the greatest distance, cannot, of objects <lb/>
            that arc much nearer, see at the same time those that are be­ <lb/>
            fore and behind them ; but brothers, if they are in friendship, <lb/>
            can, even at the greatest distance, act in concert and for mu­ <lb/>

            concerning friends,1 by which, as it seems to me, a person <lb/>
            might be greatly benefited, both as to the acquisition and use <lb/>
            of friends ; for he said that lie had heard many people observe <lb/>
            that a true and honest friend was the most valuable of all <lb/>
            possessions, but that he saw the greater part of mankind at­ <lb/>
            tending to anything rather than securing friends. 2. He ob­ <lb/>
            served them, he added, industriously endeavouring to procure <lb/>
            houses and lands, slaves, cattle, and furniture; but as for a <lb/>
            friend, whom they called the greatest of blessings, he saw <lb/>
            the majority considering neither how to procure one, nor <lb/>
            how those whom they had might be retained. 3. Even when <lb/>
            friends and slaves were sick, he said that he noticed people <lb/>
            calling in physicians to their slaves, and carefully providing <lb/>
            other means for their recovery, but paying no attention to <lb/>
            their friends; and that, if both died, they grieved for their <lb/>
            slaves, and thought that they had suffered a loss, but con­ <lb/>
            sidered that they lost nothing in losing friends. Of their <lb/>
            other possessions they left nothing untended or unheeded, <lb/>
            but when their friends required attention, they utterly neg­ <lb/>
            lected them.</p>
          <p>4. In addition to these remarks, he observed that he saw <lb/>
            the greater part of mankind acquainted with the number of <lb/>
            their other possessions, although they might be very numer­ <lb/>
            ous, but of their friends, though but few, they were not only <lb/>
            ignorant of the number, but even when they attempted to <lb/>
            reckon it to such as asked them, they set aside again2 some <lb/>
            that they had previously counted among their friends; so <lb/>
            little did they allow their friends to occupy their thougnts. 5. <lb/>
            Yet in comparison with what possession, of all others, would not <note type="footnote"> 1 The sentiments of Plato's Socrates concerning friendship are <lb/>

            a good friend appear far more valuable ? What sort of horse, <lb/>
            or yoke of oxen, is so useful as a truly good friend? What <lb/>
            slave is so well-disposed or so attached, or what other acqui­ <lb/>
            sition so beneficial? 6. For a good friend is ready to <lb/>
            supply whatever is wanting on the part of his friend, whether <lb/>
            in his private affairs, or for the public interests ; if he is re­ <lb/>
            quired to do a service to any one, he assists him with the <lb/>
            means ; if any apprehension alarms him, he lends him his aid, <lb/>
            sometimes sharing expenditure with him, sometimes co-oper­ <lb/>
            ating with him, sometimes joining with him to persuade <lb/>
            others, sometimes using force towards others; frequently <lb/>
            cheering him when he is successful, and frequently support­ <lb/>
            ing him when he is in danger of falling. 7. What the hands <lb/>
            do, what the eyes foresee, what the cars hear, what the feet <lb/>
            accomplish, for each individual, his friend, of all such ser­ <lb/>
            vices, fails to perform no one ; and oftentimes, what a person <lb/>
            has not effected for himself, or has not seen, or has not <lb/>
            heard, or has not accomplished, a friend has succeeded in ex­ <lb/>
            ecuting for his friend ; and yet, while people try to foster trees <lb/>
            for the sake of their fruit, the greater portion of mankind are <lb/>
            heedless and neglectful1 of that most productive possession <lb/>
            which is called a friend.</p>

          <p>On the different estimation in which different friends are to be held. We <lb/>
            ought to examine ourselves, and ascertain at what value we may expect <lb/>
            our friends to hold us.</p>
          <p>1. I HEARD one day another dissertation of his, which <lb/>
            seemed to me to exhort the hearer to examine himself, and <lb/>
            ascertain of how much value he was to his friends. Finding <lb/>
            that one of his followers was neglectful of a friend who was <lb/>
            oppressed with poverty, he asked Antisthenes, in the presence <lb/>
            of the man that neglected his friend, and of several others, <lb/>
            saying, “Are there certain settled values for friends, Antis­ <lb/>
            thenes, as there are for slaves? 2. For, of slaves, one, per­ <lb/>
            haps, is worth two minæ, another not even half a mina, ano­ <lb/>
            ther five minæ, another ten. Nicias, the SOil of Niceratus, is <note type="footnote"> I '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αργω̄ καὶ ἀνειμένωϚ έπιμέλονται</foreign>.⌉ “Idly and negligently at­ <lb/>

            said to have bought an overseer for his silver mines1 at the <lb/>
            prise of a whole talent. I am therefore considering whether, <lb/>
            as there are certain values for slaves, there are also certain <lb/>
            values for friends." 3. " There are, undoubtedly," replied <lb/>
            Antisthenes; “at least I, for my part, should wish one man to <lb/>
            be my friend rather than have two mince ; another I should <lb/>
            not value even at half a mina; another I should prefer to ten <lb/>
            minæ; and another I would buy for my friend at the sacri­ <lb/>
            fice of all the money and revenues in the world."2 4. “If <lb/>
            such be the ease, therefore," said Socrates, “it would be well <lb/>
            for each of us to examine himself, to consider of what value <lb/>
            he is in the estimation of his friends; and to try to be of as <lb/>
            much value to them as possible, in order that his friends may <lb/>
            be less likely to desert him; for I often hear one man saying <lb/>
            that his friend has abandoned him, and another, that a person <lb/>
            whom he thought to be his friend has preferred a mina to <lb/>
            him. 5. I am considering, accordingly, whether, as one sells <lb/>
            a bad slave, and parts with him for whatever he will fetch, so <lb/>
            it may be advisable to give up a worthless friend, when there <lb/>
            is an opportunity of receiving more than he is worth. Good <lb/>
            slaves I do not often see sold at all, or good friends aban­ <lb/>

            themselves as friends, by such conversations as the following. <lb/>
            “Tell me, Critobulus," said he, " if we were in need of a <lb/>
            good friend, how should we proceed to look for one ? Should <lb/>
            we not, in the first place, seek for a person who can govern <lb/>
            his appetite, his inclination to wine or sensuality, and abstain <lb/>
            from immoderate sleep and idleness ? for one who is overcome <lb/>
            by such propensities would be unable to do his duty either to <lb/>
            himself or his friend.” “Assuredly he would not," said <lb/>
            Critobulus. " It appears then to you that we must avoid one <lb/>
            who is at the mercy of such inelinations?” “Undoubtedly,” <lb/>
            replied Critobulus. 2. “Besides,” continued Socrates, “does <lb/>
            not a man who is extravagant and yet unable to support him­ <lb/>
            self, but is always in want of assistance from his neighbour, a <lb/>
            man who, when lie borrows, cannot pay, and when he cannot <lb/>
            borrow, hates him who will not lend, appear to you to be a <lb/>
            dangerous friend?” “Assuredly,” replied Critobulus. “We <lb/>
            must therefore avoid such a character?" “We must indeed,” <lb/>
            a. “Again : what sort of friend would he be who has the means <lb/>
            of getting money, and covets great wealth, and who, on this <lb/>
            account, is a driver of hard bargains, and delights to receive, <lb/>
            but is unwilling to pay?” Such a person appears to me,” <lb/>
            said Critobulus, “ to be a still worse character than the <lb/>
            former.” 4. “What then do you think of him, who, from love <lb/>
            of getting money, allows himself no time for thinking of any­ <lb/>
            thing else but whence he may obtain it?" “We must avoid <lb/>
            him, as it seems to me; for he would be useless to any one <lb/>
            that should make an associate of him.” “And what do you <lb/>
            think of him who is quarrelsome, and likely to raise up many <lb/>
            enemies against his friends?” “We must avoid him also, by <lb/>
            Jupiter." "But if a man have none of these bad qualities, <lb/>
            but is content to receive obligations, taking no thought of re­ <lb/>
            turning them?” “He also would he useless as a friend. <lb/>
            But what sort of person, then, Socrates, should we endea­ <lb/>
            your to make our friend ?” 5. “A person, I think, who, being <lb/>
            the reverse of all this, is proof against the seductions of bodily <lb/>
            pleasures, is upright and fair in his dealings, and emulous not <lb/>
            to be outdone in serving those who serve him, so that he is <lb/>
            of advantage to those who associate with him." 6. How <note type="footnote"> of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόνων</foreign> is so forced, and so destitute of support, that I have pre­ <lb/>
            ferred the emendation, especially as it is effected with the change <lb/>
            of one letter. </note> <pb n="408"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ B. II. </note> <lb/>
            then shall we find proof of these qualities in him, Socrates, <lb/>
            before we associate with him?" " We make proof of statu­ <lb/>
            aries," rejoined Socrates, " not by forming opinions from their <lb/>
            words, but, whomsoever we observe to have executed his pre­ <lb/>
            vious statues skilfully, we trust that he will execute others <lb/>
            well." 7. "You mean, then, that the man who is known to <lb/>
            have served his former friends, will doubtless be likely to serve <lb/>
            such as may be his friends hereafter?" "Yes; for whom­ <lb/>
            soever I know to have previously managed horses with skill, <lb/>
            I expect to manage other horses also with skill."</p>
          <p>8. "Be it so," said Critubulus ; "but by what means must <lb/>
            we make a friend of him who appears to us worthy of our <lb/>
            friendship?" "In the first place," answered Socrates, "we <lb/>
            must consult the gods, whether they recommend us to make <lb/>
            him our friend." " Can you tell me, then," said Critobulus, <lb/>
            " how he, who appears eligible to us, and whom the gods do <lb/>
            not disapprove, is to be secured?" 9. "Assuredly," returned <lb/>
            Socrates, " he is not to be caught by tracking him like the <lb/>
            hare, or by wiles, like birds, or by making him prisoner by <lb/>
            force, like enemies; for it would be an arduous task to make a <lb/>
            man your friend against his will, or to hold him fast if you <lb/>
            were to bind him like a slave; for those who suffer such treat­ <lb/>
            ment are rendered enemies rather than friends." to. "How <lb/>
            then are men made friends?" inquired Critobulus. They <lb/>
            say that there are certain incantations, which those who know <lb/>
            them, chant to whomsoever they please, and thus make them <lb/>
            their friends ; and that there arc also love-potions, which those <lb/>
            who know them, administer to whomsoever they will, and arc <lb/>
            in consequence beloved by them." 11. "And how can we dis­ <lb/>
            cover these charms?" "You have heard from Homer the <lb/>
            song which the Sirens sung to Ulysses, the commencement of <lb/>
            which runs thus: <note type="footnote"> 'Come hither, much-extolled Ulysses, great glory of the Greeks.' " </note><note type="footnote"> " Did the Sirens then, by singing this same song to other men <lb/>
            also, detain them so that they were charmed and could not <lb/>
            depart from them?" "No; but they sang thus to those who <lb/>
            were desirous of being honoured for virtue." 12. "You seem <lb/>
            to mean that we ought to apply as charms to any person, such <lb/>
            commendations as, when he hears them, lie will not suspect <lb/>
            that his eulogist utters to ridicule him; for. if he con-</note> <pb n="409"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            ceived such a suspicion, lie would rather be rendered an <lb/>
            enemy, and would repel men from him ; as, for instance, if a <lb/>
            person were to praise as beautiful, and tall, and strong, one <lb/>
            who is conscious that he is short, and deformed, and weak.</p>
          <p>But," added Critobulus, " do yon know any other charms ? " <lb/>
            13. "No," said Socrates, "but I have heard that Pericles <lb/>
            knew many, which lie used to chant to the city, and make it <lb/>
            love him." " And how did Themistocles make the city love <lb/>
            him?" "Not, by Jupiter, by uttering charms to it, but by <lb/>
            conferring1 on it some advantage." 14. " You appear to me <lb/>
            to mean, Socrates, that if we would attach to us any good <lb/>
            person as a friend, we ourselves should be good both in speak­ <lb/>
            ing and acting."2 "And did you think it possible," said So­ <lb/>
            crates, " for a bad person to attach to himself good men as his <lb/>
            friends?" 15. "I have seen," rejoined Critobulus, "bad <lb/>
            orators become friends to good orators, and men bad at com­ <lb/>
            manding an army become friends to men eminently good in <lb/>
            the military art." 16. Do you, then," said Socrates, "re­ <lb/>
            garding the subject of which we are speaking,3 know any <lb/>
            persons, who, being themselves useless, can make useful per <lb/>
            sons their friends ? " "No, by Jupiter," replied Critobulus; <lb/>
            " hilt if it is impossible for a worthless person to attach to him­ <lb/>
            self good and honourable friends, it becomes now an object of <lb/>
            consideration with me, whether it is possible for one who is <lb/>
            himself honourable and good, to become, with case, a friend <lb/>
            to the honourable and good." 17. " What perplexes you, Cri­ <lb/>
            tobulus, is, that you often see men who are honourable in <lb/>
            their conduct, and who refrain from everything disgraceful, <lb/>
            involved, instead of being friends, in dissensions with one <lb/>
            another, and showing more severity towards each other than <lb/>
            the worthless part of mankind." 18. " Nor is it only private <lb/>
            persons," rejoined Critobulus, "that act in this manner, but <lb/>
            even whole communities, which have the greatest regard for <note type="footnote"> 1 A expression borrowed from witeheraft or sorcery, <lb/>

          <p>in. When I reflect on these differences," continued Crito­ <lb/>
            bulus, “I am quite in despair about the acquisition of friends ; <lb/>
            for I see that the bad cannot be friends with one another; <lb/>
            for how can the ungrateful, or careless, or avaricious, or <lb/>
            faithless, or intemperate, be friends to each other ? indeed the <lb/>
            had appear to me to be altogether disposed by nature to be <lb/>
            mutual enemies rather than friends. 20, Again, the bad, as <lb/>
            yon observe, can never harmonize in friendshipwith the good ; <lb/>
            for how can those who commit bad actions be friends with <lb/>
            those who abhor such actions? And yet, if those also who <lb/>
            practise virtue fall into dissensions with one another about <lb/>
            pre-eminence in their respective communities, and even hate <lb/>
            each other through envy, who will ever be friends, or among <lb/>
            what class of mankind shall affection and attachment b <lb/>
            found?" 21. “But these affections act in various ways," re­ <lb/>
            joined Socrates, "for men have by nature inclinations to <lb/>
            attacliment, since they stand in need of each other, and feel <lb/>
            compassion for each other, and co-operate for mutual benefit, <lb/>
            and, being conscious that such is the case, have a sense of <lb/>
            gratitude towards one another; but they have also propen­ <lb/>
            sities to enmity, for such as think the same objects honour­ <lb/>
            able and desirable, engage in contention for them, and, divided <lb/>
            in feelings, become enemies. Disputation and anger lend to <lb/>
            war;the desire of aggrandizement excites ill-will ;and envy <lb/>
            is followed by hatred. 22. But, nevertheless, friendship, in­ <lb/>
            sinnating itself through all these hindrances, unites together <lb/>
            the honourable and good ; for such characters, through affec­ <lb/>
            tion for virtue, prefer the enjoyment of a moderate competency <lb/>
            without strife, to the attainment of unlimited power by means <lb/>
            of war ;they can endure hunger and thirst without discon­ <lb/>
            tent, and take only a fair share of meat and drink, and, <lb/>
            though delighted with the attractions of youthful beauty, <lb/>
            they can control themselves, so as to forbear from offending <lb/>
            those whom they ought not to offend. 23. By laying aside <lb/>
            all avaricious feelings too, they can not only be satisfied with <lb/>
            their lawful share of the common property, but can even <lb/>
            assist one another. They can settle their differences, not <lb/>
            only without mutual offence, but even to their mutual benefit. <lb/>
            They can prevent their anger from going so far as to cause <pb n="411"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 6.] <lb/>
            </note>them repentance; and envy they entirely banish, by sharing <lb/>
            their own property with their friends, and considering that of <lb/>
            their friends as their own.</p>
          <p>24. " How, then, can it be otherwise than natural, that <lb/>
            the honourable and good should be sharers in political dis­ <lb/>
            tinctions, not only without detriment, but even with advan­ <lb/>
            tage, to each other? Those indeed who covet honour and <lb/>
            power in states, merely that they may be able to embezzle <lb/>
            money, to do violence to others, and to live a life of luxury, <lb/>
            must be regarded as imprincipled and abandoned characters, <lb/>
            and incapable of harmonious union with other men. 25. But <lb/>
            when a person wishes to attain honours in a community, in <lb/>
            order, not merely that he may not suffer wrong himself, but <lb/>
            that he may assist his friends as far as is lawful, and may <lb/>
            endeavour, in his term of office, to do some service to his <lb/>
            country, why should he not, being of such a character, form <lb/>
            a close union with another of similar character? Will he be <lb/>
            less able to benefit his friends if he unite himself with the <lb/>
            honourable and good, or will he he less able to serve his coun­ <lb/>
            try if he have the honourable and good fOr his colleagues? <lb/>
            26. In the public games, indeed, it is plain, that if the strong­ <lb/>
            est were allowed to unite and attack the weaker, they would <lb/>
            conquer in all the contests, and carry off all the prizes ; and <lb/>
            accordingly people, do not permit them, in those competitions, <lb/>
            to act in such a manner; but since, in political affairs,1 in <lb/>
            which honourable and good men rule, no one hinders another <lb/>
            from serving his country in concert with whomsoever he <lb/>
            pleases, how can it be otherwise than profitable for him to <lb/>
            conduct affairs with the best men as his friends, having these <lb/>
            as colleagues and co-operators, rather than antagonists, in his <lb/>
            proceedings? 27. It is evident, too, that if one man com­ <lb/>
            mences hostilities against another, lie will need allies, and will <lb/>
            need a great number of them, if he oppose the honourable and <lb/>
            good ; and those who consent to be his allies must be well <lb/>
            treated by him, that they may be zealous in his interests ; <lb/>
            and it is much better for him to serve the best characters, <lb/>
            who are the fewer, than the inferior, who are more numerous ; <lb/>
            for the bad require far more favours than the good. 28. <note type="footnote"> 1 ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επεὶ</foreign> ovv lull <foreign xml:lang="grc">μὲν οὺκ ἐω̃σι τουστο ποιεὶν, ἐν δὲ τοι̃ς πολιτικοι̃ς, κ</foreign>. r. <lb/>

            But strive with good courage, Critobulus,” he continued, <lb/>
            " to be good yourself, and, having become so, endeavour to <lb/>
            gain the friendship of men of honour and virtue. Perhaps I <lb/>
            myself also may be able to assist you in this pursuit of the <lb/>
            honourable and virtuous, from being naturally disposed to <lb/>
            love, for, for whatever persons I conceive a liking, I devote <lb/>
            myself with ardour, and with my whole mind, to love them, <lb/>
            and be loved in return by them, regretting their absence to <lb/>
            have mine regretted by them, and longing for their society <lb/>
            while they on the other hand long for mine. 29. I know that <lb/>
            you also must cultivate such feelings, whenever you desire to <lb/>
            form a friendship with any person. Do not conceal from my <lb/>
            knowledge, therefore, the persons to whom you may wish to <lb/>
            become a friend ; for, from my carefulness to please those <lb/>
            who please me, I do not think that I am unskilled in the art <lb/>
            of gaining men's affections."</p>
          <p>so. " Indeed, Socrates,” replied Critobulus, “ I have long <lb/>
            desired to receive such instructions as yours, especially if the <lb/>
            same knowledge will have effect at once on those who are <lb/>
            amiable in mind, and handsome in person." 31. “ But, Crito­ <lb/>
            bulus,” replied Socrates, “ there is nothing in the knowledge <lb/>
            that I communicate to make those who are handsome in per­ <lb/>
            son endure him who lays hands upon them; for I am per­ <lb/>
            suaded that men shrunk from Scylla because she offered to <lb/>
            put her hands on them ; while every one, they say, was ready <lb/>
            to listen to the Sirens, and were enchanted as they listened, <lb/>
            because they laid hands on no one, but sang to all men from a <lb/>
            distance.” 32. “ On the understanding, then, that I shall lay my <lb/>
            hands on no one," said Critobulus, "tell me if you know any <lb/>
            effectual means for securing friends." "But will you never," <lb/>
            asked Socrates, " apply your lips to theirs ?” “ Be of good <lb/>
            courage, Socrates," said Critobulus, " for I will never apply <lb/>
            my lips to those of any person, unless that person be beauti­ <lb/>
            ful." " You have now said,” rejoined Socrates, “ the exact <lb/>
            contrary to what will promote your object; for the beautiful1 <lb/>
            will not allow such liberties, though the deformed receive <lb/>
            them with pleasure, thinking that they arc accounted beau­ <lb/>
            tiful for their mental qualities." 33. As I shall caress the <lb/>
            beautiful, then," said Critobulus, "and caress the good with <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλοί</foreign>.] Socrates plnys on the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλο</foreign>ì, which referred, as <lb/>

            </note>the utmost ardour, teach me, with confidence, the art of at­ <lb/>
            taching my friends to me." “ When, therefore, Critobulus," <lb/>
            said Socrates, "you wish to become a friend to any one, will <lb/>
            you permit me to say to him concerning you, that you admire <lb/>
            him, and desire to be his friend ?" " You may say so," an­ <lb/>
            swered Critobulus, “ for I have never known any one dislike <lb/>
            those who praised him." 34. " But if I say of you, in addition, <lb/>
            that, because you admire him, you feel kindly disposed to­ <lb/>
            wards him, will you not think that false information is given <lb/>
            of you by me ?” “ No : for a kind feeling springs up in my­ <lb/>
            self also towards those whom I regard as kindly disposed <lb/>
            towards me.” 35. “ Such information, then," continued So­ <lb/>
            crates, " I may communicate regarding you to such as you <lb/>
            may wish to make your friends; but if you enable me also to <lb/>
            say concerning you, that you are attentive to your friends ; <lb/>
            that you delight in nothing so much as in the possession of <lb/>
            good friends; that you pride yourself on the honourable con­ <lb/>
            duct of your friends not less than on your own ; that you <lb/>
            rejoice at the good fortune of your friends not less than at <lb/>
            your own ; that you are never weary of contriving means by <lb/>
            which good fortune may come to your friends ; and that you <lb/>
            think it the great virtue of a man to surpass his friends in do­ <lb/>
            ing them good and his enemies in doing them harm, I think <lb/>
            that I shall be a very useful assistant to you in gaining the <lb/>
            affections of worthy friends." 36. “ But why," said Crito­ <lb/>
            bulus, " do you say this to me, as if you were not at liberty to <lb/>
            say of me anything you please?" " No, by Jupiter," replied <lb/>
            Socrates; “ I have no such liberty, according to a remark that <lb/>
            I once heard from Aspasia; for site said that skilful match- <lb/>
            makers, by reporting with truth good points of character, had <lb/>
            great influence in leading people to form unions, but that those <lb/>
            who said what was false, did no good by their praises, for that <lb/>
            such as were deceived hated each other and the match-maker <lb/>
            alike; and as I am persuaded that this opinion is correct, I <lb/>
            think that I ought not to say, when I praise you, anything <lb/>
            that I cannot utter with truth." 37. " You are, therefore," <lb/>
            returned Critobulus, “ a friend of such a kind to me, Socrates, <lb/>
            as to assist me, if I have myself any qualities adapted to gain <lb/>
            friends; but if not, you would not be willing to invent any­ <lb/>
            thing to serve me." “ And whether, Critobulus,” said So­ <lb/>
            crates, “ should I appear to serve you more by extolling you <pb n="414"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. II. </note> <lb/>
            with false praises, or by persuading you to endeavour to be­ <lb/>
            come a truly deserving man ? 38. If this point is not clear to <lb/>
            you, consider it with the following illustrations: If, wishing <lb/>
            to make the owner of a ship your friend, I should praise <lb/>
            you falsely to him, pronouncing you a skilful pilot, and he, <lb/>
            believing me, should intrust his ship to you to steer when you <lb/>
            are incapable of steering it, would you have any expectation <lb/>
            that you would not destroy both yourself and the ship ? Or if, <lb/>
            by false representations, I should persuade the state, publicly, <lb/>
            to intrust itself to you as a man skilled in military tactics, in <lb/>
            judicial proceedings, or in political affairs, what do you think <lb/>
            that yourself and the state would suffer at your hands ? Or if, <lb/>
            In private intercourse, I should induce any of the citizens, by <lb/>
            unfounded statements, to commit their property to your care, <lb/>
            as being a good and diligent manager, would you not, when <lb/>
            you came to give proof of your abilities, be convicted of dis­ <lb/>
            honesty, and make yourself appear ridiculous ? 39. But the <lb/>
            shortest, and safest, and best way, Critobulus, is, to strive to <lb/>
            be really good in that in which you wish to be thought good. <lb/>
            Whatever are called virtues among mankind, you will find, on <lb/>
            consideration, capable of being increased by study and exer­ <lb/>
            cise. I am of opinion, that it is in accordance with these <lb/>
            sentiments, that we ought to endeavour to acquire friends ; if <lb/>
            you know any other way, make me acquainted with it." "I <lb/>
            should be indeed ashamed,” replied Critobulus, " to say any­ <lb/>
            thing in opposition to such an opinion ; for I should say what <lb/>
            was neither honourable nor true.”</p>

          <p>Jocrates endeavoured to alleviate the necessities of his friends by his instruc­ <lb/>
            tions, and by exhorting them to assist each other. In this chapter it is <lb/>
            particularly shown that any person of liberal education may, when op­ <lb/>

            from poverty, by admonishing them to assist each other ac­ <lb/>
            cording to their means. With reference to this point, I will <pb n="415"/>

            relate what I know of him from having been an car-witness <lb/>
            of what he said.</p>
          <p>Observing Aristarchus,1 on one occasion, looking gloomily, <lb/>
            “ You seem," said he, “ Aristarchus, to be taking something to <lb/>
            heart; but you ought to impart the cause of your uneasiness <lb/>
            to your friends; for perhaps we may by some means lighten <lb/>
            it." 2. "I am indeed, Socrates," replied Aristarchus, "in <lb/>
            great perplexity ; for since the city has been disturbed,2 and <lb/>
            many of our people have fled to the Piræcus, my surviving <lb/>
            sisters, and nieces, and cousins have gathered about me in <lb/>
            such numbers, that there arc now in my house fourteen free- <lb/>
            born persons.3 At the same time, we receive no profit from <lb/>
            our lands, for the enemy are in possession of them ; nor any <lb/>
            rent from our houses, for but few inhabitants are left in the <lb/>
            city; no one will buy our furniture, nor is it possible to bor­ <lb/>
            row money from any quarter; a person, indeed, as it seems to <lb/>
            me, would sooner find money by seeking it on the road, than <lb/>
            get it by borrowing. It is a grievous thing to me, therefore, <lb/>
            to leave my relations to perish ; and it is impossible for me to <lb/>
            support such a number under such circumstances." 3. So­ <lb/>
            crates, on hearing this, replied, " And how is it that Cera­ <lb/>
            nion,4 yonder, though maintaining a great number of people, <lb/>
            is not only able to procure what is necessary for himself and <lb/>

            while you, having many to support, arc afraid lest you should <lb/>
            all perish for want of necessaries?" Because, assuredly,” <lb/>
            replied Aristarchus, “ he maintains slaves, while I have to <lb/>
            support free-born persons.” 4. " And which of the two," in­ <lb/>
            quired Socrates, " do you consider to be the better, the free- <lb/>
            born persons that arc with you, or the slaves that are with <lb/>
            Ceramon ?” “ I consider the free persons with me as the <note type="footnote"> I Nothing more is known of him than is here mentioned. <lb/>

            wonderful; for' he supports artisans ; but I, persons of liberal <lb/>
            education." 5. “ Artisans, then," asked Socrates, “are per­ <lb/>
            sons that know how to make something useful ?" “ Unques­ <lb/>
            tionably,” replied Aristarchus. " Is barley-meal, then, use­ <lb/>
            ful ?" "Very." " Is bread?" " Not less so." " And are <lb/>
            men's and women's garments, coats, cloaks, and mantles, use­ <lb/>
            ful?" " They are all extremely useful." "And do those <lb/>
            who are residing with you, then, not know how to make any <lb/>
            of these things ? " " They know how to make them all, as I <lb/>

            please; but I have with me free-born persons and relatives." <lb/>

            you find that idleness and carelessness are serviceable to man­ <lb/>
            kind, either for learning what it becomes them to know, <lb/>
            or for remembering what they have learned, or for maintain­ <lb/>
            ing the health and strength of their bodies, or for acquiring <lb/>
            and preserving what is useful for the support of life, and that <lb/>
            industry and diligence are of no service at all ? 8. And as to <lb/>
            the arts which you say they know, whether did they learn <lb/>
            them as being useless to maintain life, and with the in­ <lb/>
            tention of never practising any of them, or, on the contrary, <lb/>
            with a view to occupy themselves about them, and to reap <lb/>
            profit from them ? In which condition will men he moro <lb/>
            temperate, living in idleness, or attending to useful employ­ <lb/>
            ments ? In which condition will they be more honest, if they <lb/>
            work, or if they sit in idleness meditating how to procure <lb/>
            necessaries ? 9. Under present circumstances, as I should sup­ <lb/>
            pose, you neither feel attached to your relatives, nor they to <lb/>
            you, for you find them burdensome to you, and the) see that <lb/>
            you are annoyed with their company. From such feelings there <lb/>
            is danger that dislike may grow stronger and stronger, and <lb/>
            that previous friendly inclinations may be diminished. But if <lb/>
            you take them under your direction, so that they may be em­ <lb/>
            ployed, you will love them, when you see that they are ser­ <lb/>
            viceable to you, and they will grow attached to you, when they <lb/>
            find that you feel satisfaction in their society; and remember­ <lb/>
            ing past services with greater pleasure, you will increase the <lb/>
            friendly feeling resulting from them, and consequently grow <lb/>
            more attached and better disposed towards each other. 10. If, <lb/>
            indeed, they were going to employ themselves in anything <lb/>
            dishonourable, death would be preferable to it; but the ac­ <lb/>
            complishments which they know, are, as it appears, such as <lb/>
            are most honourable and becoming to women; and all people <lb/>
            execute what they know with the greatest ease and expedition, <lb/>
            and with the utmost credit and pleasure. Do not hesitate, <lb/>
            therefore," concluded Socrates, " to recommend to them this <lb/>
            line of conduct, which will benefit both you and them; and <lb/>
            they, as it is probable, will cheerfully comply with your <lb/>
            wishes.” 11. “By the gods," exclaimed Aristarchus, “you <lb/>
            seem to me to give such excellent advice, Socrates, that <lb/>
            though hitherto I did not like to borrow money, knowing that, <lb/>
            when I had spent what I got, I should have no means of ro- <note type="footnote"> VOL. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 a </note> <pb n="418"/>

            paying it, I now think that I can endure to do so, in order to <lb/>
            gain the necessary means for commencing work.</p>
          <p>12. The necessary means were accordingly provided ; wool <lb/>
            was bought; and the women took their dinners as they con­ <lb/>
            tinued at work, and supped when they had finished their <lb/>
            tasks ; they became cheerful instead of gloomy in countenance, <lb/>
            and, instead of regarding each other with dislike, met the looks <lb/>
            of one another with pleasure ; they loved Aristarchus as their <lb/>
            protector, and he loved them as being of use to him. At last <lb/>
            he came to Socrates, and told him with delight of the state of <lb/>
            things in his house; adding that "the women complained of <lb/>
            him as being the only person in the house that ate the bread <lb/>
            of idleness." 13. “ And do you not tell them,” said Socrates, <lb/>
            " the fable of the dog ? For they say that when beasts had <lb/>
            the faculty of speech, the sheep said to her master, 'Jon act <lb/>
            strangely, in granting nothing to us who supply you with <lb/>
            wool, and lambs, and cheese, except what we get from the <lb/>
            ground ; while to the dog, who brings you no such profits, <lb/>
            you give a share of the food which you take yourself.' 14. <lb/>
            The do,-, hearing these remarks, said, 'And not indeed with­ <lb/>
            out reason ; for I am he that protects even yourselves, so that <lb/>
            you are neither stolen by men, nor carried off by wolves ; <lb/>
            while, if I were not to guard you, you would be unable even <lb/>
            to feed, for fear lest you should be destroyed.' In consequence <lb/>
            it is said that the sheep agreed that the dog should have supe­ <lb/>
            rior honour. You, accordingly, tell your relations that you <lb/>
            are, in the place of the dog, their guardian and protector, and <lb/>
            that, by your means, they work and live in security and plea­ <lb/>
            sure. without suffering injury from any one.” <pb n="419"/>

          <p>Socrates persuades Eutherus, who was working for hire, to seek some more <lb/>
            eligible employment, as his present occupation was not suited for old age, <lb/>
            and recommends to him the post of steward to some rich man. An ob­ <lb/>
            jection on the part of Eutherus, that lie should dislike to have to render <lb/>
            an account to a master, Socrates opposes with the remark that there is no <lb/>
            office in the world free from responsibility.</p>
          <p>I. SEEING an old friend one day, after a considerable inter­ <lb/>
            val of time, he said, “Whence do you come, Eutherus ?" "I <lb/>
            am returned, Socrates," replied Eutherus, “ from my retire­ <lb/>
            ment abroad at the conclusion of the war and I come now <lb/>
            from the immediate neighbourhood ; for since we were robbed <lb/>
            of all our possessions beyond the borders, and my father left <lb/>
            me nothing in Attica, I am obliged to live in the city and <lb/>
            work with my own hands to procure the necessaries of life ; <lb/>
            but this seems to me better than to ask aid of anybody, espe­ <lb/>
            cially as I have nothing on which I could borrow.” 2. " And <lb/>
            how long,” said Socrates, " do you think that your bodily <lb/>
            labour will serve to earn what you require ? " “ Not very <lb/>
            long, by Jupiter,” replied Eutherus. "Then," said Socrates, <lb/>
            "when you grow older, you will doubtless be in want of <lb/>
            money, and no one will be willing to give you wages for your <lb/>
            bodily labour." " What you say is true," rejoined Eutherus. <lb/>
            3. “ It will be better for you, therefore," continued Socrates, <lb/>
            " to apply yourself immediately to some employment which <lb/>
            will maintain you when you are old, and, attaching yourself <lb/>
            to some one of those that have larger fortunes, (who requires <lb/>

            ing to gather in his fruits, and preserve his property, to benefit <lb/>
            him, and to be benefited by him in return." 4. "I should <lb/>
            with great reluctance, Socrates," said he, "submit to slavery." <lb/>
            "Yet those who have the superintendence in states, and who <lb/>
            take care of the public interests, are not the more like slaves <lb/>

            man." 5. “ In a word, however,” rejoined Eutherus, “I am <lb/>
            not at all willing to make myself liable to any one's censure." <lb/>
            " But assuredly, Eutherus,” said Socrates, "it is not very easy <lb/>
            to find an employment in which a person would not be ex­ <lb/>
            posed to censure ; for it is difficult to do anything so as to <lb/>
            commit no error; and it is difficult, even if you have done it <lb/>
            without error, to meet with a considerate judge ; for even in <lb/>
            the occupation in which you are now engaged I should wonder <lb/>
            if it be easy for you to go through it without blame. 6. But <lb/>
            you must endeavour to avoid such employers as are given to <lb/>
            censure, and seek such as are candid; to undertake such duties <lb/>
            as you are able to do, and to decline such as you cannot fulfil; <lb/>
            and to execute whatever you take upon you in the best manner <lb/>
            and with the utmost zeal; for I think that, by such conduct, <lb/>
            you will be least exposed to censure, you will most readily <lb/>
            find assistance in time of need, and you will live with the <lb/>

          <p>Crito, a rich man, complaining that he is harassed by informers, Socrates <lb/>
            recommends him to secure the services of Archedemus, a poor man well <lb/>
            skilled in the law, to defend him against them; a plan by which both <lb/>
            are benefited. Archedemus also assists others, and gains both reputation <lb/>
            and emolument.</p>
          <p>1. I KNOW that he also heard Crito once observe, how <lb/>
            difficult it was for a man who wished to mind his own busi­ <lb/>
            ness to live at Athens.1 "For at this very time," added he, <lb/>
            " there are people bringing actions against me, not because <lb/>
            they have suffered any wrong from me, but because they <lb/>
            think that I would rather pay them a sum of money than <lb/>
            have the trouble of law proceedings." 2. “ Tell me, Crito," <lb/>
            said Socrates, " do you not keep dogs, that they may drive <lb/>
            away the wolves from your sheep?" " Certainly," answered <note type="footnote"> 1 To live at Athens is said to have been troublesome on account <lb/>
            of the sycophantæ, or informers, whom the populace allowed to harass <lb/>
            and annoy the richer class, in the belief that such liberty helped to <lb/>
            support the democracy. Schneider. </note> <pb n="421"/>

            Crito, "for it is more profitable to me to keep them than not." <lb/>
            " Would you not then be inclined to keep a man also, who <lb/>
            would be willing and able to drive away from you those that <lb/>
            try to molest you ?" "I would with pleasure," returned Crito, <lb/>
            "if I were not afraid that he would turn against me." 3. <lb/>
            " But do you not see," said Socrates, "that it would be much <lb/>
            more pleasant for him to serve himself by gratifying such a <lb/>
            man as you than by incurring your enmity. And be assured <lb/>
            that there are such characters here, who would be extremely <lb/>
            ambitious to have you for a friend."</p>
          <p>4. In consequence of this conversation, they fixed upon <lb/>
            Archedemus, a man of great ability both in speaking and <lb/>
            acting, but poor; for he was not of a character to make <lb/>
            money by every means, but was a lover of honesty, and a <lb/>
            person of superior mind, so that lie could draw money from <lb/>
            the informers.' Crito, therefore, whenever he gathered in <lb/>
            his corn, or oil, or wine, or wool, or anything else that grew <lb/>
            on his land, used to select a portion of it, and give it to Ar­ <lb/>
            chedemus ; and used to invite him whenever he sacrificed,2 <lb/>
            and paid him attention in every similar way. 5. Archedemus, <lb/>
            accordingly, thinking that Crito's house would be a place of <lb/>
            refuge for him, showed him much respect, and quickly dis­ <lb/>
            covered, on the part of Crito's accusers, many illegal acts, <lb/>
            and many persons who were enemies to those accusers, one of <lb/>
            whom he summoned to a public trial, in which it would be <lb/>
            settled what lie should suffer or pay.3 6. This person, being <lb/>
            conscious of many crimes, tried every means to get out of the <lb/>
            hands of Archedemus; but Archedemus would not let him <lb/>
            off, until he ceased to molest Crito, and gave himself a sum <lb/>
            of money besides.</p>
          <p>7. When Archedemus had succeeded in this and some <figure type="illustration">

              other similar proceedings, then, as when any shepherd has a <lb/>
              good dog, other shepherds wish to station their flocks near <lb/>
              him, in order to have the benefit of his dog, so likewise many <lb/>
              of the friends of Crito begged him to lend them the services <lb/>
              of Archedemus as a protector. 8. Archedemus willingly <lb/>
              gratified Crito in this respect, and thus not only Crito himself <lb/>
              was left at peace, but his friends. And if any of those with <lb/>
              whom lie was at variance taunted him with receiving favours <lb/>
              from Crito, and paying court to him, Archedemus would ask, <lb/>
              " whether is it disgraceful to be benefited by honest men, <lb/>
              and to make them your friends by serving them in return, <lb/>
              and to be at variance with the unprincipled, or to make the <lb/>
              honourable and good your enemies by trying to wrong them, <lb/>
              and to make the bad your friends by co-operating with them, <lb/>
              and associate with the vicious instead of the virtuous ?" From <lb/>
              this time Archedemus was one of Crito's friends, and was <lb/>
              honoured by the other friends of Crito.</p>

          <p>Socrates exhorts Diodorus, a rich man, to aid his friend Hermogenes, who <lb/>
            is in extreme poverty. A man endeavours to preserve the life of a slave, <lb/>
            and ought surely to use greater exertions to sate a friend, who will well <lb/>
            repay our kindness.</p>
          <p>I. I AM aware that he also held a conversation with Dio­ <lb/>
            dorns, one of his followers, to the following effect. " Tell <lb/>
            me, Diodorus,” said he, " if one of your slaves runs away, do <lb/>
            you use any care to recover him?" 2. “ Yes, indeed," an­ <lb/>
            swered he, “and I call others to my aid, by offering rewards <lb/>
            for capturing him." “And if any of your slaves falls ill," <lb/>
            continued Socrates, “do you pay any attention to him, and <lb/>
            call in medical men, that lie may not die?" "Certainly," <lb/>
            replied the other. "And if any one of your friends, who is <lb/>
            far more valuable to you than all your slaves, is in danger of <lb/>
            perishing of want, do you not think that it becomes you to <lb/>
            take care of him, that his life may be saved ? 3. But you are <lb/>
            not ignorant that Hermogenes is not ungrateful, and would <lb/>
            be ashamed, if, after being assisted by you, he were not to <lb/>
            serve you in return ; and indeed to secure such a supporter as <pb n="423"/>
             <note type="margin">B. III. CH. 1.] </note> <lb/>
            he, willing, well-disposed, steady, and not only able to do iliaS <lb/>
            he is directed, but capable of being useful of himself, and of <lb/>
            taking forethought, and forming plans for you, I consider <lb/>
            equivalent to the value of many slaves. 4. Good economists <lb/>
            say that you ought to buy, when you can purchase for a little <lb/>
            what is worth much ; but now, in consequence of the troubled <lb/>
            state of affairs, it is possible to obtain good friends at a very <lb/>
            easy rate." 5. " You say well, Socrates," rejoined Diodorus; <lb/>
            “ and therefore tell Hermogenes to come to me." “ No, by <lb/>
            Jupiter," said Socrates, “I shall not; for I think it not so <lb/>
            honourable for you to send for him as to go yourself to <lb/>
            him; nor do I consider it a greater benefit to him than to <lb/>
            you that this intercourse should take place." 6. Diodorus <lb/>
            accordingly went to Hermogenes, and secured, at no great <lb/>
            expense, a friend who made it his business to consider by <lb/>
            what words or deeds he could profit or please Diodorus.</p>

          <p>Socrates used to exhort those who aspired to publio offices to learn the <lb/>

            an army in his country should neglect to learn the duties of <lb/>
            that office when he has an opportunity of learning them; and <lb/>
            such a person would be far more justly punished by his coun­ <lb/>
            try than one who should contract to make statues for it, <lb/>
            when he had not learned to make them ; 3. for as the whole <lb/>
            state, in the perils of war, is intrusted to the care of the <lb/>
            general, it is likely that great advantages will occur if he act <lb/>
            well, and great evils if he fall into error. How, then, would <lb/>
            not he, who neglects to learn the duties of the office, while he <lb/>
            is eager to be elected to it, be deservedly punished?" By <lb/>
            making such observations, he induced the young man to go <lb/>
            and learn.</p>
          <p>4. When, after having learned, he returned to Socrates again, <lb/>
            he began to joke upon him, saying, “ Since Homer, my <lb/>
            friends, has represented Agamemnon as dignified,1 does not <lb/>
            this young mail, after learning to be a general, seem to you to <lb/>
            look more dignified than before? For as he who has learned <lb/>
            to play the lyre is a lyrist, though he may not use the instru­ <lb/>
            ment, and he who has learned the art of healing is a physician, <lb/>
            though he may not practise his art, so this youth will from <lb/>
            henceforth be a general, though no one may elect him to com­ <lb/>
            mand ; but he who wants the proper knowledge is neither <lb/>
            general nor physician, even though he be chosen to act as <lb/>
            such by all the people in the world. 5. But," he continued, <lb/>
            " in order that we may have a better knowledge of the mili­ <lb/>
            tary art, in case any one of us should have to command a <lb/>
            troop or company under you, tell us how he began to teach <lb/>
            you generalship?" "He began," replied the youth, “with <lb/>
            the same thing with which he ended ; for he taught me <lb/>
            tactics, and nothing else." 6. “But," said Socrates, " how <lb/>
            small a part of the qualifications of a general is this ! For a <lb/>
            general must be skilful in preparing what is necessary for <lb/>
            war, able2 in securing provisions for his troops, a man of great <lb/>
            contrivance and activity, careful, persevering, and sagacious ; <lb/>
            kind, and yet severe; open, yet crafty ; careful of his own, <lb/>
            yet ready to steal from others ; profuse, yet rapacious ; lavish <lb/>
            of presents, yet eager to acquire money ; cautions, yet enter­ <lb/>

            acquired, which he, who would fill the office of general with <lb/>
            ability, must possess. 7. It is good, indeed, to be skilled in <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γεραρόν</foreign>. II. iii. 171. </note><note type="footnote">2 Compare Cvrop. i. 6, 12. seqq. </note> <pb n="425"/>

            tactics; for a well-arranged army is very different from a <lb/>
            disorderly one; as stones and bricks, wood and tiles, if thrown <lb/>
            together in confusion, are of no use whatever; but when the <lb/>
            stones and tiles, materials not likely to rot or decay, are <lb/>
            placed at the bottom and the top, and the bricks and wood <lb/>
            are arranged in the middle, (as in building,) a house, which is <lb/>
            a valuable piece of property, is formed."1 8. “ What you have <lb/>
            said, Socrates," rejoined the youth, “ is an exact illustration <lb/>
            of our practice; for in the field of battle we must place the <lb/>
            bravest troops in the front and rear, and the cowardly in the <lb/>
            middle, that they may be led on by those before them, and <lb/>
            pushed forward by those behind."2 9. “If indeed he has <lb/>
            taught you to distinguish the brave and cowardly," rejoined <lb/>
            Socrates, " that rule may be of use ; but if not, what profit is <lb/>
            there in what you have learned? for if he ordered you, in <lb/>
            arranging a number of coins, to lay the best first and last, <lb/>
            and the worst in the middle, and gave you no instructions <lb/>
            how to distinguish the good and bad, his orders to you would <lb/>
            be to no purpose." "But indeed," he replied, " lie did not <lb/>
            teach me this; so that we must distinguish the brave from <lb/>
            the cowardly ourselves.”3 10. “ Why should we not consider <lb/>
            then," said Socrates, " how we may avoid mistakes as to that <lb/>
            matter?" "I am willing," returned the young man. " If <lb/>
            then we had to capture a sum of money, and were to place <lb/>
            the most covetous men in front, should we not arrange them <lb/>
            properly?" "It appears so to me." "And what must <lb/>
            generals do when entering on a perilous enterprise? Must <lb/>
            they not place the most ambitious in front?” "They at <lb/>
            Least," said the young man, "are those who are ready to <lb/>
            brave danger for the sake of praise; and they are by no <lb/>
            means difficult to discover, but will be everywhere con­ <lb/>

          <p>A good general ought to take measures for the safety, maintenance, and <lb/>
            success of his troops; and not to study his own honour alone, but that <lb/>
            of his whole army.</p>
          <p>1. HAVING met, on some occasion, a person who had been <lb/>
            elected general, Socrates said to him, " Why is it, do you <lb/>
            think, that Homer has styled Agamemnon Shepherd of the <lb/>
            people ?' Is it not for this reason, that as a shepherd must <lb/>
            be careful that his sheep be safe, and have food, and the ob­ <lb/>
            ject may be effected for which they are kept, so a general <lb/>
            must take care that his soldiers be safe, and have provisions, <lb/>
            and that the object be effected for which they serve ? and <lb/>
            they serve, no doubt, that they may increase their gratifiea. <lb/>
            tions by conquering the enemy. 2. Or why has he praised <lb/>
            Agamemnon in the following manner, saying that he was <lb/>
            Both characters, a good king, and an efficient warrior?1 <lb/>
            Does he not mean that he would not have been " an efficient <lb/>
            warrior,” if he had fought courageously alone against the <lb/>
            enemy, and if he had not been the cause of courage to his <lb/>
            whole army ; and that he would not have been " a good king," <lb/>
            if lie had attended to his own subsistence only, and had not <lb/>
            been the cause of comfort to those over whom he ruled ? 3. <note type="footnote"> all other editors; but it might be inquired whether they are not <lb/>

            For a man is chosen king, not that he may take good care of <lb/>
            himself, but that those who have chosen him may prosper by <lb/>
            his means; and all men, when they take the field, take it that <lb/>
            their lives may be rendered as happy as possible, and choose <lb/>
            generals that they may conduct them to the accomplishment <lb/>
            of that object. 4. It is incumbent on the leader of an army, <lb/>
            therefore, to carry into execution the views of those who have <lb/>
            chosen him their leader. Nor is it easy to find anything more <lb/>
            honourable than such exertion, or more disgraceful than an <lb/>
            opposite course of conduct."</p>
          <p>Thus considering what was the merit of a good leader, lie <lb/>
            omitted other points in his character, and left only this, that <lb/>
            he should render those whom he commanded happy.</p>

          <p>The duty of a commander of cavalry is twofold, to improve the condition <lb/>
            both of his men and his horses; and not to leave the care of the horses to <lb/>
            the troops, sect. 1-4. How he should train his men, and how he should <lb/>
            be himself qualified to do so, 5-10. He should acquire oratorical <lb/>

            desire of glory, 11-15.</p>
          <p>1. I REMEMBER that lie held a dialogue with a person who <lb/>
            had been chosen Hipparch,1 to the following purport. “Could <lb/>
            you tell me, young man," said he, " with what object you de­ <lb/>
            sired to be a Hipparch ? It certainly was not for the sake of rid­ <lb/>
            ing first among the cavalry ; for the horse-archers are honoured <lb/>
            with that dignity, as they ride even before the Hipparchs.” <lb/>
            " You say the truth," said the youth. " Nor was it, <lb/>
            surely, for the sake of being noticed, for even madmen are <lb/>
            noticed by everybody." " You say the truth in that respect <lb/>
            also.” 2. But was it, then, that you expect to render the <lb/>
            cavalry better, and present them in that condition to your <lb/>
            country, and that, if there should be need for the services of <note type="footnote"> I There were at Athens two <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴππαρχοι</foreign>, or commanders of the horse, <lb/>

            cavalry, you hope, as their leader, to be the author of some <lb/>
            advantage to the state ? " "I do hope so, certainly." “ And <lb/>
            it will be truly honourable to you," continued Socrates, "if <lb/>
            you are able to effect that object. But the office, to which <lb/>
            you have been chosen, takes charge of both the horses and <lb/>
            riders ?” " It does so," said the young man. 3. " Come then, <lb/>
            tell me this first of all, how you propose to render the horses <lb/>
            better?" “That,” replied the other, "I do not consider to <lb/>
            be my business ; for I think that each man, individually, must <lb/>
            take care of his own horse." 4. " If, then," said Socrates, <lb/>
            " sonic of the men should present their horses before you so <lb/>
            diseased in the feet, so weak in the legs, or so feeble in body, <lb/>
            and others theirs so ill-fed, that they could not follow you ; <lb/>
            others, theirs so unmanageable, that they would not remain <lb/>
            where you posted them; others, theirs so vicious that it <lb/>
            would not be possible to post them at all; what would he <lb/>
            the use of sueh cavalry to you ? Or how would you be able, <lb/>
            at the head of them, to be of any service to your country ? " <lb/>
            " You admonish me well," said the youth, " and I will try <lb/>
            to look to the horses as far as may be in my power." 5, <lb/>
            " And will you not also endeavour," asked Socrates, "to make <lb/>
            the riders better ?" "I will," said lie. “You will first of <lb/>
            all, then, make them more expert in mounting their horses." <lb/>
            " I ought to do so; for if any of them should fall off, they <lb/>
            would thus be better prepared to recover themselves.” 6. <lb/>
            “If, then," said Socrates, " you should be obliged to hazard <lb/>
            an engagement, whether will you order your men to bring <lb/>
            the enemy down to the level sand1 on which you have been <lb/>
            accustomed to ride, or will you try to exercise them on such <lb/>
            ground as that on which the enemy may show themselves ?" <lb/>
            " The latter method will be the better," said the young man. <lb/>
            7. " Will you also take any care that the greatest possible <lb/>
            number of your men may be able to hurl the dart on horse­ <lb/>
            back ? " " That will be better too," replied he. “ And have <lb/>
            you considered how to whet the courage of your cavalry, <lb/>
            since you intend to make them more courageous, and animate <lb/>
            them against the enemy ?" "If I have not yet considered," <note type="footnote"> I The cavalry were exercised on level ground strewed with sand; <lb/>

            said he, " I will now try to do so." 8. “And have you at all <lb/>
            considered how your cavalry may be induced to obey you ? <lb/>
            For without obedience you will have no profit either from <lb/>
            horses or horsemen, spirited and valiant as they may be." <lb/>
            “You say the truth, Socrates," said he ; “ but by what means <lb/>
            can a leader most effectually induce them to obedience ? " <lb/>
            9. " You are doubtless aware that in all circumstances men <lb/>
            most willingly obey those whom they consider most able to <lb/>
            direct; for in sickness patients obey him whom they think <lb/>
            the best physician ; on ship-board, the passengers obey him <lb/>
            whom they think the best pilot, and in agriculture, people <lb/>
            obey him whom they deem the best husbandman." Unques­ <lb/>
            tionably," said the young man. “Is it not then likely," said <lb/>
            Socrates, " that in horsemanship also, others will be most will­ <lb/>
            ing to obey him who appears to know best what he ought <lb/>
            to do ?" in. " If, therefore, Socrates, I should myself appear <lb/>
            the best horseman among them, will that circumstance be <lb/>
            sufficient to induce them to obey me ?” " If you convince <lb/>
            them in addition," said Socrates. " that it is better and safer <lb/>
            for them to obey you." " Ilow, then, shall I convince them <lb/>
            of that?" “With much more ease,” replied Socrates, “than <lb/>
            if you had to convince them that bad things are better and <lb/>
            more profitable than good." 11. " You mean," said the young <lb/>
            man, “that a commander of cavalry, in addition to his other <lb/>
            qualifications, should study to acquire some ability in speak­ <lb/>
            ing." “ And did you think," asked Socrates, "that you would <lb/>
            command cavalry by silence ? Have you not reflected, that <lb/>
            whatever excellent principles we have learned according to <lb/>
            law,1 principles by which we know how to live, we learned all <lb/>
            through the medium of speech; and that whatever other <lb/>
            valuable instruction any person acquires, he acquires it by <lb/>
            means of speech likewise? Do not those who teach best, use <lb/>
            speech most; and those who know the most important truths, <lb/>
            discuss them with the greatest eloquence ? 12. Or have you <lb/>

            say is true," said he. 13. “ But it is not so much in sweet­ <lb/>
            ness of voice, or in size and strength of body, that the Athe­ <lb/>
            nians excel other people, as in ambition, which is the greatest <lb/>

            Athenians the same as ever, Socrates?" lie replied; "for <lb/>
            they have not chosen me, who am worn out with serving on <lb/>
            the list,1 both as captain and centurion,2 and with having re­ <lb/>
            ceived so many wounds from the enemy, (he then drew aside <lb/>
            his robe, and showed the scars of the wounds,) but have <lb/>
            elected Antisthenes, who has never served in the heavy-armed <lb/>
            infantry, nor done anything remarkable in the cavalry, and <lb/>
            who indeed knows nothing, but how to get money." 2. <lb/>
            " Is it not good, however, to know this," said Socrates, "since <lb/>
            lie will then be able to get necessaries for the troops?" “ But <lb/>
            merchants," replied Nicomachides, " are able to collect money ; <lb/>
            and yet would not, on that account, be capable of leading an <lb/>
            army." 3. " Antisthenes, however,” continued Socrates, " is <lb/>
            given to emulation, a quality necessary in a general. Do you <lb/>
            not know that whenever he has been chorus-manager3 lie has <lb/>
            gained the superiority in all his choruses ?" " But, by Jupi­ <lb/>
            ter," rejoined Nicomachides, “ there is nothing similar in <lb/>
            managing a chorus and an army." 4. “ Yet Antisthenes,” <lb/>
            said Socrates, “ though neither skilled in music nor in teach­ <lb/>
            ing a chorus,4 was able to find out the best masters in these <lb/>
            departments." "In the army, accordingly," exclaimed Nico­ <lb/>
            machides, “ he will find others to range his troops for him, <lb/>
            and others to fight for him !” 5. " Well, then,” rejoined So­ <lb/>

            affairs, as he has done in the conduct of his choruses, lie will <lb/>
            probably attain superiority in this respect also; and it is <lb/>
            likely that he will be more willing to spend money for a vic­ <lb/>

            say, then, Socrates," said he, " that it is in the power of the <lb/>
            same man to manage a chorus well, and to manage an army <lb/>
            well?" " I say," said Socrates, "that over whatever a man <lb/>
            may preside, he will, if he knows what he needs, and is able <lb/>
            to provide it, be a good president, whether he have the direc­ <lb/>
            lion of a chorus, a family, a city, or an army." 7. "By <lb/>
            Jupiter, Socrates," cried Nicomachides, "I should never have <lb/>
            expected to hear from you that good managers of a family <lb/>
            would also be good generals." " Come, then," proceeded So <lb/>
            crates, " let us consider what are the duties of each of them, <lb/>
            that we may understand whether they are the same, or are in <lb/>
            any respect different." " By all means," said he. 8. " Is it <lb/>
            not, then, the duty of both," asked Socrates, " to render those <lb/>
            under their command obedient and submissive to them?" <lb/>
            "Unquestionably." " Is it not also the duty of both to in­ <lb/>
            trust various employments to such as are fitted to execute <lb/>
            them?" "That is also unquestionable." "To punish the <lb/>
            bad, and to honour the good, too, belongs, I think, to each of <lb/>
            them." "Undoubtedly." a. " And is it not honourable in both <lb/>
            to render those under them well-disposed towards them?" <lb/>
            " That also is certain." " And do you think it for the interest <lb/>
            of both to gain for themselves allies and auxiliaries or not?" <lb/>
            "It assuredly is for their interest." "Is it not proper for <lb/>
            both also to be careful of their resources?" "Assuredly." <lb/>
            " And is it not proper for both, therefore, to be attentive and <lb/>
            industrious in their respective duties ?" to. All these par­ <lb/>
            ticulars," said Nicomachides, " are common alike to both ; <lb/>
            but it is not common to both to fight." " Yet both have <lb/>
            doubtless enemies," rejoined Socrates. " That is probably the <lb/>
            case," said the other. "Is it not for the interest of both to <lb/>
            gain the superiority over those enemies?" 11. Certainly; <lb/>
            but to say nothing on that point, what, I ask, will skill in <lb/>
            managing a household avail, if it be necessary to fight ?" "It <lb/>
            will doubtless, in that case, be of the greatest avail," said So­ <lb/>
            crate.a ; " for a good manager of a house, knowing that nothing <lb/>
            is so advantageous or profitable as to get the better of your <lb/>
            enemies when you contend with them, nothing so unprofitable <lb/>

            therefore, Nicomachides," he added, "despise men skilful in <lb/>
            managing a household; for the conduct of private affairs <lb/>
            differs from that of public concerns only in magnitude; in <lb/>

            invasion, 26—28.</p>
          <p>I. CONVERSING, on one occasion, with Pericles,1 the son of <lb/>
            the great Pericles, Socrates said, “I have hopes, Pericles, that <lb/>
            under your leadership the city will become more eminent and <lb/>
            famous in military affairs, and will get the better of her ene­ <lb/>
            mies." “I wish, Socrates," said Pericles, " that what you <lb/>
            say may happen ; but how such effects are to be produced, I <lb/>
            cannot understand.” " Are you willing, then," asked So- <note type="footnote"> I This is the Pericles, the illegitimate son of the great Pericles, <lb/>

            crates, " that we should have some conversation on these <lb/>
            points, and consider how far there is a possibility of effecting <lb/>
            what we desire.”“I am quite willing," replied Pericles. 2. <lb/>
            “Are you aware, then," said Socrates, “that the Athenians <lb/>
            are not at all inferior in number to the Bœotians?” " I am,” <lb/>
            said Pericles. " And whether do you think that a greater <lb/>
            number of efficient and well-formed men could be selected <lb/>
            from the Bœotians, or from the Athenians?" " The Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans do not appear to me to be inferior in this respect." <lb/>
            " And which of the two peoples do you consider to be more <lb/>
            united among themselves?” "I think that the Athenians <lb/>
            are ; for many of the Bœotians, being oppressed by the The­ <lb/>
            bans, entertain hostile feelings towards them. But at Athens <lb/>
            I see nothing of the kind." 3. " But the Athenians are more­ <lb/>
            over of all people most eager for honour and most friendly in <lb/>
            disposition ; qualities which most effectually impel men to face <lb/>
            danger in the cause of glory and of their country." "The <lb/>
            Athenians are certainly not to be found fault with in these <lb/>
            respects.” “And assuredly there is no people that can boast <lb/>
            of greater or more numerous exploits of their ancestors than <lb/>
            the Athenians ; a circumstance by which many are prompted <lb/>
            and stimulated to cultivate manly courage and to become <lb/>
            brave.”4. “All that you say is true, Socrates, but you see <lb/>
            that since the slaughter of the thousand occurred at Lebadeia <lb/>
            under Tolmides,1 and that at Delium under Hippocrates,2 <lb/>
            the reputation of the Athenians has suffered as far as regards <lb/>
            the Bœotians, and the spirit of the Bœotians has been raised <note type="footnote"> 1 Lebadeia was a town of central Boeotia, between Haliartus and <lb/>
            Chæronea; the whole province is now comprehended under the <lb/>

            as far as regards the Athenians, so that the Bœotians, indeed, <lb/>
            who formerly did not dare, even on their own soil, to meet <lb/>
            the Athenians in the field without the aid of the Spartans <lb/>
            and other Peloponnesians, now threaten to invade Attica <lb/>
            tingle-handed ; while the Athenians, who formerly, when the <lb/>
            Bœotians were unsupported, ravaged Boeotia. are afraid lest <lb/>
            the Bœotians should lay waste Attica. 5. " I perceive, in­ <lb/>
            deed,” said Socrates, "that such is the ease; but the city <lb/>
            seems to me now to be more favourably disposed for any good <lb/>
            general; for confidence produces in men earelessness, indo­ <lb/>
            lence, and disobedience, but fear renders them more attentive, <lb/>
            obedient, and orderly, 6. You may form a notion of this <lb/>
            from people in a ship ; for as long as they fear nothing, they <lb/>
            are all in disorder, but as soon as they begin to dread a storm, <lb/>
            or the approach of an enemy, they not only do everything <lb/>
            that they are told to do, but are hushed in silence, waiting <lb/>
            for the directions to be given, like a band of dancers.”1 7. <lb/>
            " Well then," said Pericles, “ if they would now, assuredly, <lb/>
            obey, it would be time for us to discuss how we might incite <lb/>
            them to struggle to regain their ancient spirit, glory, and <lb/>
            happiness.” 8. "If then," said Socrates, “we wished them <lb/>
            to claim property of which others were in possession, we <lb/>
            should most effectively urge them to lay claim to it, if we <lb/>
            proved that it belonged to their fathers, and was their rightful <lb/>
            inheritance; and since we wish that they should strive for <lb/>
            pre-eminence in valour, we must show them that such pre- <lb/>
            eminence was indisputably theirs of old, and that if they now <lb/>
            exert themselves to recover it, they will be the most power­ <lb/>
            ful of all people." 9. “How, then, can we convince them of <lb/>
            this?” “I think that we may do so, if we remind them that <lb/>
            they have heard that their most ancient forefathers, of whom <lb/>
            we have any knowledge, were the bravest of men." 10. "Do <lb/>
            you allude to the dispute between the gods, of which Cecrops, <lb/>
            and his assessors had the decision on account of their valour ?" <lb/>

            " They are so," said Pericles. 12. In consequence, though <lb/>

            now recover their pristine dignity?" "It appears to me," <lb/>
            replied Socrates, “ not at all difficult to discover; for I think <lb/>
            that if they learn what were the practices of their ancestors, <lb/>
            and observe them not less diligently than they, they will <lb/>
            become not at all inferior to them ; but if they do not take <lb/>
            that course, yet, if they imitate those1 who are now at the <lb/>
            head of Greece, adhere to their institutions, and attend to <lb/>
            the same duties with diligence equal to theirs, they will stand <lb/>
            not at all below them, and, if they use greater exertion, even <lb/>
            above them." is. “ You intimate," returned Pericles, “ that <lb/>
            honour and virtue are far away from our city ; for when will <lb/>
            the Athenians reverence their elders as the Spartans do, <lb/>
            when they begin, even by their own fathers, to show disrespect <lb/>
            for older men ? Or when will they exercise themselves like <lb/>
            them, when they not only are regardless of bodily vigour, but <lb/>
            deride those who cultivate it. 16. Or when will they obey <lb/>
            the magistrates like them, when they make it their pride to set <lb/>
            them at nought? Or when will they be of one mind like <lb/>
            them, when, instead of acting in concert for their mutual in­ <lb/>
            terests, they inflict injuries on one another, and envy one <lb/>
            another more than they envy the rest of mankind ? More <lb/>
            than any other people, too, do they dispute in their private <lb/>
            and public meetings; they institute more law-suits against <lb/>
            one another, and prefer thus to prey upon one another than <lb/>
            to unite for their mutual benefit. They conduct their public <lb/>
            affairs as if they were those of a foreign state ;2 they contend <lb/>
            about the management of them, and rejoice, above all things, <lb/>
            in having power to engage in such contests. 17. From such <lb/>
            conduct much ignorance and baseness prevail in the republic, <lb/>

            Pericles," rejoined Socrates, " that the Athenians are thus <lb/>
            disordered with an incurable depravity. Do you not see how <lb/>
            orderly they are in their naval proceedings, how precisely <lb/>
            they obey the presidents in the gymnastic games, and how, in <lb/>
            the arrangement of the choruses, they submit to the directions <lb/>
            of their teachers in a way inferior to none?" if. " This is <lb/>
            indeed surprising," said Pericles, "that men of that classI <lb/>
            should obey those who are set over them, and that the in­ <lb/>
            fantry and cavalry, who are thought to excel the ordinary <lb/>
            citizens in worth and valour, should be the least obedient of <lb/>
            all the people." 20. “ The council of the Areopagus, too," <lb/>
            said Socrates, "is it not composed of men of approved cha­ <lb/>
            racter ?”2 "Undoubtedly," replied Pericles. " And do you <lb/>
            know of any judges who decide causes, and conduct all their <lb/>
            business, with more exact conformity to the laws, or with <lb/>
            more honour and justice ?" “I find no fault with them," said <lb/>
            Pericles. “ We must not therefore despair," said Socrates, <lb/>
            " as if we thought that the Athenians are not inclined to be <lb/>
            lovers of order." 21. " Yet in military affairs,” observed Peri­ <lb/>
            cles, "in which it is most requisite to act with prudence, and <lb/>
            order, and obedience, they pay no regard to such duties." <lb/>
            "It may be so," returned Socrates, "for perhaps in military <lb/>
            affairs men who are greatly deficient in knowledge have the <lb/>
            command of them. Do you not observe that of harp-players, <lb/>
            choristers, dancers, wrestlers, or pancratiasts, no one ventures <lb/>
            to assume the direction who has not the requisite knowledge <lb/>
            for it, but that all, who take the lead in such matters, are able <lb/>
            to show from whom they learned the arts in which they are <lb/>
            masters ; whereas the most of our generals undertake to com­ <lb/>

            from every quarter whence it was possible to acquire any­ <lb/>
            thing that would add to your skill as a commander. 23. I <lb/>
            have no doubt that you take great care that you may not un­ <lb/>
            awares be ignorant of anything conducive to generalship, <lb/>
            and that, if you have ever found yourself deficient in any <lb/>
            such matters, you have applied to persons experienced in <lb/>

            learn from them what you did not know, and might render <lb/>
            them efficient helpers to you." 21. " You make me well <lb/>
            aware, Socrates," said Pericles, "that you do not say this <lb/>
            from a belief that I have diligently attended to these matters, <lb/>
            but from a wish to convince me that he who would be a <lb/>
            general must attend to all such studies; and I indeed agree <lb/>
            with you in that opinion."</p>
          <p>25. “ Have you considered this also, Pericles," asked So­ <lb/>
            crates, “ that on the frontier of our territories lie great moun­ <lb/>
            tains,1 extending down to Boeotia, through which there lead <lb/>
            into our country narrow and precipitous defiles ; and that our <lb/>
            country is girded by strong mountains,2 as it lies in the midst <lb/>
            of them?” "Certainly," said he. 26. “Have you heard, <lb/>
            too, that the Mysians and Pisidians, who occupy extremely <lb/>
            strong positions in the country of the Great King,3 and who <lb/>
            arc lightly armed, are able to make descents on the king's <lb/>
            territory, and do it great damage, while they themselves pre­ <lb/>
            serve their liberty?" "This, too, I have heard," said Peri­ <lb/>
            cles, 27. “And do you not think that the Athenians,” said <lb/>
            Socrates, "if equipped with light arms while they are of an <lb/>
            age for activity, and occupying the mountains that fence our <lb/>
            country, might do great mischief to our enemies, and form a <lb/>
            strong bulwark for the inhabitants of bur country?" “ I <lb/>
            think, Socrates," said he, " that all these arrangements would <lb/>
            be useful." 28. "If these plans, then." concluded Socrates, <lb/>

          <p>Socrates, by his usual process of interrogation, leads Glaucon, a young man <lb/>
            who was extravagantly desirous of a post in the government, to confess <lb/>
            that he was entirely destitute of the knowledge necessary for the office to <lb/>
            which he aspired. He then shows that, unless a ruler has acquired an <lb/>
            exact knowledge of state affairs, he can do no good to his country or cre­ <lb/>
            dit to himself.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN Glaucon,1 the son of Ariston, attempted to ha­ <lb/>
            rangue the people, from a desire, though he was not yet <lb/>
            twenty years of age,2 to have a share in the government of the <lb/>
            state, no one of his relatives, or other friends, could prevent <lb/>
            him from getting himself dragged down from the tribunal, <lb/>
            and making himself ridiculous; but Socrates, who had a <lb/>
            friendly feeling towards him on account of Charmides3 the <lb/>
            son of Glaucon, as well as on account of Plato,4 succeeded in <lb/>
            prevailing on him, by his sole dissuasion, to relinquish his <lb/>
            purpose. 2. Meeting him by chance, he first stopped him by <lb/>
            addressing him as follows, that he might be willing to listen <lb/>
            to him : " Glaucon," said he, “ have you formed an intention <note type="footnote"> 1 This Glaucon was the brother of Plato the philosopher. See <lb/>

            to govern the stale for us ? " "I have, Socrates," replied <lb/>
            Glaucon. " By Jupiter," rejoined Socrates, "it is an hon­ <lb/>
            ourable office, if any other among men be so ; for it is certain <lb/>
            that, if you attain your object, you will be able yourself to <lb/>
            secure whatever you may desire, and will be in a condition to <lb/>
            benefit your friends ; you will raise your father's house, and <lb/>
            increase the power of your country ; you will be celebrated, <lb/>
            first of all in your own city, and afterwards throughout <lb/>
            Greece, and perhaps also, like Themistocles, among the Bar­ <lb/>
            barians ; and, wherever you may be, you will be an object of <lb/>
            general admiration.” 3. Glaucon, hearing this, was highly <lb/>
            elated, and cheerfully stayed to listen. Socrates next pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to say, “But it is plain, Glaucon, that if you wish to be <lb/>
            honoured, you must benefit the state." " Certainly," answered <lb/>
            Glaucon. “ Then, in the name of the gods," said Socrates, <lb/>
            “ do not hide from us how you intend to act, but inform us <lb/>
            with what proceeding you will begin to benefit the state ? " <lb/>
            4. But as Glaucon was silent, as if just considering how he <lb/>
            should begin, Socrates said, " As, if you wished to aggran­ <lb/>
            dize the family of a friend, you would endeavour to make it <lb/>
            richer, tell me whether you will in like manner also endea­ <lb/>
            vour to make the state richer ? " " Assuredly," said he. 5. <lb/>
            " Would it then be richer, if its revenues were increased ? " <lb/>
            " That i3 at least probable," said Glaucon. "Tell me then," <lb/>
            proceeded Socrates, " from what the revenues of the state <lb/>
            arise, and what is their amount; for you have doubtless <lb/>
            considered, in order that if any of them fall short, you may <lb/>
            make up the deficiency, and that if any of them fail, you may <lb/>
            procure fresh supplies." " These matters, by Jupiter," re­ <lb/>
            plied Glaucon, “ I have not considered." 6. " Well then," <lb/>
            said Socrates, "if you have omitted to consider this point, <lb/>
            tell me at least the annual expenditure of the state ; for <lb/>
            you undoubtedly mean to retrench whatever is superfluous in <lb/>
            it." “ Indeed," replied Glaucon, " I have not yet had time to <lb/>
            turn my attention to that subject." " We will therefore,” <lb/>
            said Socrates, " put off making our state richer for the pre­ <lb/>
            sent ; for how is it possible for him who is ignorant of its <lb/>
            expenditure and its income to manage those matters ?" 7. <lb/>
            " But, Socrates," observed Glaucon, "it is possible to enrich <lb/>
            the state at the expense of our enemies." "Extremely possi­ <lb/>
            ble indeed,” replied Socrates, "if we be stronger than they ; <pb n="442"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            but if we be weaker, we may lose all that we have.” " What <lb/>
            you say is true," said Glaucon. a. “Accordingly,” said So­ <lb/>
            crates, " lie who deliberates with whom lie shall go to war, <lb/>
            ought to know the force both of his own country and of the <lb/>
            enemy, so that, if that of his own country be superior to that <lb/>
            of the enemy, he may advise it to enter upon the war, but, if <lb/>
            inferior, may persuade it to be cautious of doing so." " You <lb/>
            say rightly,” said Glaucon. 9. “In the first place, then," <lb/>
            proceeded Socrates, " tell us the strength of the country by <lb/>
            land and set, and next that of the enemy." “But, by <lb/>
            Jupiter," exclaimed Glaucon, "I should not be able to tell <lb/>
            you on the moment, and at a word." " Well, then, if you <lb/>
            have it written down," said Socrates, "bring it, for I should <lb/>
            be extremely glad to hear what it is." “But to say the truth," <lb/>
            replied Glaucon, " I have not yet written it down." 10. “We <lb/>
            will therefore put off considering about war for the present," <lb/>
            said Socrates, “for it is very likely that, on account of the <lb/>
            magnitude of those subjects, and as you are just commencing <lb/>
            your administration, you have not yet examined into them. But <lb/>
            to the defence of the country, I am quite sure that you have <lb/>
            directed your attention, and that you know how many gar­ <lb/>
            risons are in advantageous positions, and how many not so, <lb/>
            what number of men would be sufficient to maintain them, and <lb/>
            what number would be insufficient, and that you will advise <lb/>
            your countrymen to make the garrisons in advantageous posi­ <lb/>
            tions stronger, and to remove the useless ones." it. "By <lb/>
            Jove,” replied Glaucon, "I shall recommend them to remove <lb/>
            them all, as they keep guard so negligently, that the property <lb/>
            is secretly carried off out of the country.” " Yet if we re­ <lb/>
            move the garrisons," said Socrates, " do you not think that <lb/>
            liberty will be given to anybody that pleases to pillage ? <lb/>
            But,” added he, “have you gone personally, and examined <lb/>
            as to this fact, or how do you know that the garrisons conduct <lb/>
            themselves with such negligence?" "I form my conjec­ <lb/>
            tures," said he. " Well then," inquired Socrates, “shall we <lb/>
            settle about these matters also, when we no longer rest upon <lb/>
            conjecture, but have obtained certain knowledge ? " “Perhaps <lb/>
            that," said Glaucon, "will be the better course." 12. " To the <unclear/> <lb/>
            jilver mines, however," continued Socrates, "I know that you <lb/>
            have not gone, so as to have the means of telling us why a small­ <lb/>
            er revenue is derived from them than came in some time ago " <pb n="443"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            " I have not gone thither," said he. " Indeed the place,” saia <lb/>
            Socrates, " is said to be unhealthy, so that, when it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to bring it under consideration, this will be a sufficient <lb/>
            excuse for you." " You jest with me,”1 said Glaucon. 13. " I <lb/>
            am sure, however," proceeded Socrates, " that you have not <lb/>
            neglected to consider, but have calculated, how long the corn, <lb/>
            which is produced in the country, will suffice to maintain the <lb/>
            city, and how much it requires for the year, in order that the <lb/>
            city may not suffer from scarcity2 unknown to you, but that, <lb/>
            from your own knowledge, you may be able, by giving your <lb/>
            advice concerning the necessaries of life, to support the city, <lb/>
            and preserve it." " You propose a vast field for me," observed <lb/>
            Glaucon, "if it will be necessary for me to attend to such <lb/>
            subjects." 14. "Nevertheless," proceeded Socrates, “a man <lb/>
            cannot order his house properly, unless he ascertains all that <lb/>
            it requires, and takes care to supply it with everything ne­ <lb/>
            cessary ; but since the city consists of more than ten thousand <lb/>
            houses, and since it is difficult to provide for so many at once, <lb/>
            how is it that you have not tried to aid one first of all, sup­ <lb/>
            pose that of your uncle,3 for it stands in need of help ? If <lb/>
            you be able to assist that one, you may proceed to assist more ; <lb/>
            but if you be unable to benefit one, how will you be able te <lb/>
            benefit many ? Just as it is plain that, if a man cannot carry <lb/>
            the weight of a talent, he need not attempt to carry a greater <lb/>
            weight." 15. " But I would improve my uncle’s house," said <lb/>
            Glaucon, " if he would but be persuaded by me." “And <lb/>
            then," resumed Socrates, “when you cannot persuade your <lb/>
            uncle, do you expect to make all the Athenians, together with <lb/>
            your uncle, yield to your arguments ? 16. Take care, Glaucon, <lb/>
            lest, while you are eager to acquire glory, you meet with the <lb/>
            reverse of it. Do you not see how dangerous it is for a person <lb/>

          <p>Socrates exhorts Charmides, a man of ability, and acquainted with public <lb/>
            affairs, to take part in the government, that lie may not be charged with <lb/>
            indolence, sect. 1—4. As Charmides distrusts his abilities for public <lb/>
            speaking, Socrates encourages him by various observations, 5—9.</p>
          <p>I. OBSERVING that Charmides,1 the son of Glaucon,1 a man <lb/>
            of worth, and of far more ability than those who then ruled <lb/>
            the state, hesitated to address the people, or to take part in <lb/>

            think him indolent and wanting in spirit," replied Charmides. <lb/>
            2. “And if any one were able," continued Socrates, “by tak­ <lb/>
            ing part in public affairs, to improve the condition of his <lb/>
            country, and thus to attain honour for himself, but should yet <lb/>
            shrink from doing so, might not lie be justly regarded as <lb/>
            wanting in spirit?" "Perhaps so," said Charmides; "but <lb/>
            why do you ask me that question?" “Because,” replied So. <lb/>
            crates, " I think that you yourself, though possessed of suffi­ <lb/>
            cient ability, yet shrink from engaging even in those affairs <lb/>
            in which it is your duty as a citizen to take a share." 3. <lb/>
            " But in what transaction have you discovered my ability," <lb/>
            said Charm ides, "that you bring this charge against me?" <lb/>
            " In those conferences," answered Socrates, “in which you <lb/>
            meet those who are engaged in the government of the stale; <lb/>
            for when they consult you on any point, I observe that you <lb/>
            give them excellent advice, and that, when they are in any <lb/>
            way in the wrong, you offer judicious objections." 4. “But <lb/>
            it is not the same thing, Socrates,” said lie, " to converse with <lb/>
            people in private, and to try one’s powers at a public assem­ <lb/>
            bly." "Yet," said Socrates, "he that is able to count, can <lb/>
            count with no less exactness before a multitude than alone, <lb/>
            and those who can play the harp best in solitude are also the <lb/>
            best performers on it in company." 5. " But do you not <lb/>
            see," said Charmides, "that bashfulness and timidity arc <lb/>
            naturally inherent in mankind, and affect us far more before <lb/>
            a multitude than in private conversations?" "But I am <lb/>
            prompted to remind you," answered Socrates, "that while <lb/>
            you neither feel bashfulness before the most intelligent, nor <lb/>
            timid before the most powerful, it is in the presence of the <lb/>
            most foolish and weak that you are ashamed to speak. 6. And <lb/>
            is it the fullers among them, or the cobblers, or the carpenters, <lb/>
            or the copper-smiths, or the ship-merchants,1 or those who <lb/>
            barter in the market, and meditate what they may buy for <lb/>

            For it is of all such characters that the assembly is composed. <lb/>
            7. How then do you think that your conduct differs from that <lb/>
            of a wrestler, who, being superior to well-practised opponents, <lb/>

            thought of political affairs, and who have shown no disrespect <lb/>
            for your talents, from an apprehension that you may be <lb/>
            laughed at?" 8. “And do not the people in the assembly," <lb/>
            asked Charmides, "appear to you often to laugh at those who <lb/>
            speak with great judgment?” “Yes,” said Socrates, “and so <lb/>
            do the other sort of people;1 and therefore I wonder at yon, <lb/>
            that you so easily silence one class of persons when they do <lb/>

          <p>Socrates meets the captious questions of Aristippus about goodness and <lb/>
            beauty in such a manner as to show that nothing is good or bad in itself, <lb/>
            but only with reference to some object, sect. 1—3; and that nothing is <lb/>
            beautiful or otherwise in itself, but that the beautiful must be considered <lb/>

          <p>I. WHEN Aristippus attempted to confute Socrates, as he <lb/>

            wishing to benefit those who were with him, gave his an­ <lb/>
            swers, not like those who are on their guard lest their words <lb/>
            be perverted,1 but like those who are persuaded that they <lb/>
            ought2 above all things to do what is right. a. What Aris­ <lb/>
            tippus had asked him, was, ' whether he knew anything <lb/>
            good, in order that if he should say any such thing as food, <lb/>
            or drink, or money, or health, or strength, or courage, he <lb/>
            might prove that it was sometimes an evil. But Socrates, re­ <lb/>
            flecting that if anything troubles us, we want something to <lb/>
            relieve us from it, replied, as it seemed best to do,3 " Do you <lb/>
            ask me whether I know anything good for a fever?" 3. “I <lb/>
            do not." “Anything good for soreness of the eyes ?” "No." <lb/>
            “For hunger?" "No, nor for hunger either.” “Well <lb/>
            then," concluded Socrates, "if you ask me whether I know <lb/>
            anything good that is good for nothing, I neither know any­ <lb/>
            thing, nor wish to know.”</p>
          <p>4. Aristippus again asking him if he knew anything beau­ <lb/>
            tiful, lie replied, " Many things.” " Are they then," inquired <lb/>
            Aristippus, "all like each other?" “Some of them," an­ <lb/>
            swered Socrates, “are as unlike one another as it is possible <lb/>
            for them to be." <unclear>“How</unclear> then," said he, “ can what is beau­ <lb/>
            tiful be unlike what is beautiful?" "Because, assuredly," <lb/>
            replied Socrates, "one man, who is beautifully formed for <lb/>
            wrestling, is unlike another who is beautifully formed for <lb/>
            running ; and a shield, which is beautifully formed for de­ <lb/>
            fence, is as unlike as possible to a dart, which is beautifully <lb/>
            formed for being forcibly and swiftly hurled.” 5. " You an­ <lb/>
            swer me,” said Aristippus, “ in the same manner as when I <lb/>
            asked you whether you knew anything good.” " And do you <lb/>
            imagine," said Socrates, " that the good is one thing, and the <lb/>

            the same objects all things are both beautiful and good? Virtue, <lb/>
            for instance, is not good with regard to some things and <lb/>
            beautiful with regard to others; and persons, in the same <lb/>
            way, are called beautiful and good with reference to the same <lb/>
            objects; and human bodies, too, with reference to the same <lb/>
            objects, appear beautiful and good; and in like manner all <lb/>
            other things, whatever men use, are considered beautiful and <lb/>
            good with reference to the objects for which they are service­ <lb/>
            able." 6. “ Can a dung-basket, then," said Aristippus, "be <lb/>
            a beautiful thing?" “ Yes, by Jupiter," returned Socrates, <lb/>
            “ and a golden shield may be an ugly thing, if the one be <lb/>
            beautifully formed for its particular uses, and the other ill <lb/>
            formed?" 7. Do you say, then, that the same things may <lb/>
            be both beautiful and ugly?” “Yes, undoubtedly, and also <lb/>
            that they may be good and bad ; for oftentimes what is good <lb/>
            for hunger is bad for a fever, and what is good for a fever is <lb/>
            bad for hunger; oftentimes what is beautiful in regard to run­ <lb/>
            ning is the reverse in regard to wrestling, and what is beauti­ <lb/>
            ful in regard to wrestling is the reverse in regard to running; <lb/>
            for whatever is good is also beautiful, in regard to purposes <lb/>
            for which it is well adapted, and whatever is bad is the re­ <lb/>
            verse of beautiful, in regard to purposes for which it is ill <lb/>
            adapted."</p>
          <p>8. When Socrates said, too, that the same houses that were <lb/>
            beautiful were also useful, he appeared to me to instruct us <lb/>
            what sort of houses we ought to build. He reasoned on the <lb/>
            subject thus, “Should not he, who purposes to have a house <lb/>
            such as it ought to be, contrive that it may be most pleasanr, <lb/>
            and at the same time most useful, to live in?" 9. This being <lb/>
            admitted, he said, “ Is it not then pleasant to have it cool in <lb/>
            summer, and warm in winter?" " When his hearers had as­ <lb/>
            sented to this, he said, “In houses, then, that look to the <lb/>
            south, does not the skin, in the winter, shine into the porticoes, <lb/>
            while, in the summer, it passes over our heads, and above the <lb/>
            roof, and casts a shade ? If it is well, therefore, that houses <lb/>
            should thus be made,1 ought we not to build the parts towards <lb/>
            the south higher, that the sun in winter may not be shut out, <lb/>
            and the parts toward the north lower, that the cold winds may <lb/>

          <p>The most suitable ground for temples and altars,2 he said, <lb/>
            Kühner contents himself with adducing, without any remark, the <lb/>
            comment of Lange : “ As far as the summer is concerned, the posi­ <lb/>
            tion of a house (in Greece) need not be considered, whether it looks <lb/>
            to the south or any other quarter of the heaven ; for it must be <lb/>
            shady in the hottest season of the year, when, indeed, the sun send. <lb/>
            down its rays almost perpendicularly, and makes a shade in what­ <lb/>
            ever position the house may be. (Umbrosa tamen sit fervidissimo <lb/>
            anni tempore, sole nimirum radios suos rectis lineis deorsum mit­ <lb/>
            tente, et in quovis domûs situ umbram efficiente.) In building a <lb/>
            house, (in Greece,) therefore, it is necessary to take thought only for <lb/>
            the winter, that at that season of the year the house may be as warm <lb/>
            as possible. To effect this object, let one row of buildings (una <lb/>
            domorum series) face the south, and the other the north, in such a <lb/>
            way, that those looking towards the south may be higher than those <lb/>
            'ooking in the opposite direction ; for thus the higher will enjoy the <lb/>
            sun in winter, and the lower, facing the north, will be defended <lb/>
            from the winds blowing from that quarter." (The part near um­ <lb/>
            brosa tamen sit seems to be defective, or incorrect in some way.) <lb/>
            But to me the text seems capable of explanation only on the suppo­ <lb/>
            sition that Socrates is speaking with reference to the porticoes or <lb/>
            colonnades merely, as we can easily conceive why he should recom­ <lb/>
            mend porticoes towards the south to be made high, in order to admit <lb/>
            the sun in winter, (the summer sun, as Lange remarks, being not at <lb/>
            all regarded,) and those toward the north to be made low, in order <lb/>
            to exclude in some degree the keen north winds. Thus Columella, <lb/>
            R. R. i. 6. 2, says, Ambulationes meridiano œquinoctiali subjectœ sint, ut <lb/>
            hieme plurimum solis et œstate minimum recipiant: a passage which <lb/>
            Schneider says is not to be compared with this of Xenophon ; but <lb/>
            it might not be very difficult to prove the contrary. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποικιλίαι</foreign>.] Ralph Rochet, cited by G. Hermann in Opusc. vol. v. <lb/>

          <p>Various definitions of fortitude, prudence and temperance, madness, envy, <lb/>
            idleness, command, happiness, given by Socrates. Fortitude is not equal <lb/>
            in all men; it may be increased by exercise, sect. 1—3. Prudence and <lb/>
            temperance not distinct from each other, 4. Justice, as well as other vir­ <lb/>
            tues, is wisdom, 5. The opposite to prudence is madness ; ignorance dis­ <lb/>
            tinct from madness, 6, 7. Envy is uneasiness of mind at the contempla­ <lb/>
            tion of the happiness of others, 8. Idleness is forbearance from useful <lb/>
            occupation, 9. Command is exercised, not by those who bear the name, <lb/>
            merely, of kings and rulers, but by those who know how to command, <lb/>
            10—13. The best object of human life is to act well; the difference be­ <lb/>
            tween acting cell and acting fortunately, 14, 15.</p>
          <p>1. BEIXG asked, again, whether Fortitude was a quality <lb/>
            acquired by education, or bestowed by nature, " I think,” said <lb/>
            he, " that as one body is by nature stronger for enduring toil <lb/>
            than another body, so one mind may be by nature more <lb/>
            courageous in meeting dangers than another mind ; for I see <lb/>
            that men who are brought up under the same laws and insti­ <lb/>
            tutions differ greatly from each other in courage. 2. I am of <lb/>
            opinion, however, that every natural disposition may be im­ <lb/>
            proved, as to fortitude, by training and exercise; for it is <lb/>
            evident that the Scythians and Thracians would not dare tc <lb/>
            take bucklers and spears and fight with the Lacedæmonians; <lb/>
            and it is certain that the Lacedæmonians would not like tc <lb/>
            fight the Thracians with small shields and javelins, or the <lb/>
            Scythians with bows. 3. In other thing, also, I see that <note type="footnote"> intercepted by a thick grove or some considerable number of trees. <lb/>
            Of these obstructions to the view, Socrates disapproves, wishing the <lb/>
            site of the temple to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμφανεστάτη</foreign>, fully open to the sight, as if the <lb/>
            worshippers would then fancy that they saw as it were the deity be­ <lb/>
            fore them, and would suppose that their prayers would thus be <lb/>
            better received by him. Weiske. Others suppose that Socrates <lb/>
            merely wished that temples and altars should be built on high <lb/>
            grounds ; an opinion which is equally defensible. Kühner. </note><note type="footnote"> I That is, as Schutz suggests, that they might not have to go <lb/>

            men differ equally from one another by nature, and make <lb/>
            great improvements by practice ; from which it is evident <lb/>
            that it concerns all, as well the naturally ingenious as the <lb/>
            naturally dull, to learn and study those arts in which they de­ <lb/>
            sire to become worthy of commendation."</p>
          <p>4. Prudence and Temperance1 he did not distinguish; for he <lb/>
            deemed that he who knew what was honourable and good, and <lb/>
            how to practise it, and who knew what was dishonourable, <lb/>
            and how to avoid it, was both prudent and temperate Being <lb/>
            also asked whether he thought that those who knew what <lb/>
            they ought to do, but did the contrary, were prudent and tem­ <lb/>
            perate, he replied, " No more than I think the [openly] im­ <lb/>
            prudent and intemperate to be so;2 for I consider that all <lb/>
            [prudent and temperate] persons choose from what is possible <lb/>
            what they judge for their interest, and do it; and I therefore <lb/>
            deem those who do not act [thus] judiciously to be neither <lb/>
            prudent nor temperate."</p>
          <p>5. He said, too, that justice, and every other virtue, was [a <lb/>
            part of] prudence, for that everything just, and everything <lb/>
            done agreeably to virtue, was honourable and good ; that <lb/>
            those who could discern those things, would never prefer <lb/>
            anything else to them; that those who could not discern <lb/>
            them, would never be able to do them, but would even go <lb/>
            wrong if they attempted to do them; and that the prudent, <lb/>
            accordingly, did what was honourable and good, but that the <lb/>
            imprudent could not do it, but went wrong even if they at­ <lb/>
            tempted to do it; and that since, therefore, all just actions, <lb/>
            and all actions that are honourable and good, are done in <lb/>
            agreement with virtue, it is manifest that justice, and every <lb/>
            other virtue, is [comprehended in] prudence.</p>
          <p>6. The opposite to prudence, lie said, was Madness ;3 he did <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σοφίαν καὶ σωφροσύνην οὐ Σοφία</foreign>, wisdom or prudence, <lb/>
            is, as Kiihner remarks, right judgment about what ought to be <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. III. </note> <lb/>
            not, however, regard ignorance as madness; though for a <lb/>
            man to be ignorant of himself, and to fancy and believe that <lb/>
            he knew what he did not know, he considered to be something <lb/>
            closely bordering on madness. The multitude, he observed, <lb/>
            do not say that those are mad who make mistakes in matters <lb/>
            of which most people are ignorant, but call those only mad <lb/>
            who make mistakes in affairs with which most people are ac­ <lb/>
            quainted ; 7. for if a man should think himself so tall as to <lb/>
            stoop when going through the gates in the city wall, or so <lb/>
            strong as to try to lift up houses, or attempt anything else <lb/>
            that is plainly impossible to all men, they say that he is mad; <lb/>
            but those who make mistakes in small matters are not thought <lb/>
            by the multitude to be mad; but just as they call strong <lb/>
            desire" "love," so they call " great disorder of intellect " <lb/>
            " madness."</p>
          <p>s. Considering what Envy was, he decided it to be a cer­ <lb/>
            tain uneasiness, not such as arises, however, at the ill success <lb/>
            of friends, nor such as is felt at the good success of enemies, <lb/>
            but those only he said were envious who were annoyed at <lb/>
            the good success of their friends. When some expressed sur­ <lb/>
            prise, that any one who had a friendly feeling for another <lb/>
            should feel uneasy at his good fortune, he reminded them that <lb/>
            many are so disposed towards others as to be incapable of <lb/>
            neglecting them if they are unfortunate, but would relieve <lb/>
            them in ill fortune, though they are uneasy at their good for­ <lb/>
            tune. This feeling, he said, could never arise in the breast <lb/>
            of a sensible man, but that the foolish were constantly af­ <lb/>
            fected with it.</p>
          <p>a. Considering what Idleness was, he said that he found <note type="footnote"> Socrates, the contrary to wisdom or prudence, <unclear>οφια</unclear>. Madness is <lb/>
            therefore ignorance of the virtues of justice, temperance, and forti­ <lb/>
            tude; for prudence is manifested in the knowledge of these virtues. <lb/>
            But the source, and foundation as it were of prudence, is the <lb/>
            knowledge of one's self. He therefore that is destitute of this <lb/>
            knowledge of himself is bordering on madness. The multitude, <lb/>
            however, do not, like Socrates, consider ignorance of virtue to be <lb/>
            madness, but apply that term only to gross ignorance or misconduct <lb/>
            with regard to other matters. Kühner. </note><note type="footnote"> "Aristotle is praised for naming Fortitude first of the cardinal <lb/>
            virtues, as that without which no other virtue can steadily be prac­ <lb/>

            most men did something; for that dice-players and buffoons <lb/>
            did something; but he said that all such persons were idle, for <lb/>
            it was in their power to go and do something better; he ob­ <lb/>
            served that a man was not idle, however, in passing from a <lb/>
            better employment to a worse, but that, if he did so, he, as he <lb/>
            [previously] had occupation, acted in that respect viciously.</p>
          <p>in. Kings and Commanders, he said, were not those who <lb/>
            held sceptres merely, or those elected by the multitude, or <lb/>
            those who gained authority by lot, or those who attained it <lb/>
            by violence or deceit, but those who knew how to command. <lb/>
            11. For when some one admitted that it was the part of a <lb/>
            commander to enjoin what another should do, and the part of <lb/>
            him who was commanded, to obey, he showed that in a ship <lb/>
            the skilful man is the commander, and that the owner and all <lb/>
            the other people in the ship were obedient to the man of <lb/>
            knowledge; that, in agriculture, those who had farms, in <lb/>
            sickness, those who were ill, in bodily exercises, those who <lb/>
            practised them, and indeed all other people, who had any <lb/>
            business requiring care, personally took the management of it <lb/>
            if they thought that they understood it, but if not, that they <lb/>
            were not only ready to obey men of knowledge who were pre­ <lb/>
            sent, but even sent for such as were absent, in order that, by <lb/>
            yielding to their directions, they might do what was proper. <lb/>
            In spinning, too, he pointed out that women commanded men, <lb/>
            as the one knew how to spin, and the other did not know. <lb/>
            12. But if any one remarked in reply to these observations, <lb/>
            that a tyrant is at liberty not to obey judicious advisers, he <lb/>
            would say, " And how is lie at liberty not to obey, when a <lb/>
            penalty hangs <unclear>over</unclear> him that does not obey a wise monitor ? <lb/>
            for in whatever affair a person does not obey a prudent ad­ <lb/>
            viser, he will doubtless err, and, by erring, will incur a <lb/>
            penalty." 13. If any one also observed that a tyrant might <lb/>
            put to death a wise counsellor, " And do you think," he <lb/>
            would say, " that he who puts to death the best of his allies <lb/>
            will go unpunished, or that he will be exposed only to casual <lb/>
            punishment ? Whether do you suppose that a man who acts <lb/>
            thus would live in safety, or would be likely, rather, by such <lb/>
            conduct, to bring immediate destruction on himself ?"</p>
          <p>14. When some one asked him what object of study he <lb/>
            thought best for a man, he replied, " good conduct." When <lb/>
            he asked him again whether he thought "good fortune" an <pb n="454"/>
             <note type="margin">[B. III. </note> <lb/>
            object of study, lie answered, "'Fortune' and 'Conduct'I <lb/>
            think entirely opposed ; for, for a person to light on anything <lb/>
            that he wants without seeking it, I consider to be 'good for­ <lb/>
            tune,' but to achieve anything successfully by learning and <lb/>
            study, I regard as ' good conduct;' and those who make this <lb/>
            their object of study appear to me to do well."</p>
          <p>15. The best men, and those most beloved by the gods, he <lb/>
            observed, were those who, in agriculture, performed their <lb/>
            agricultural duties well, those who, in medicine, performed <lb/>
            their medical duties well, and those who, in political offices, <lb/>
            performed their public duties well; but he who did nothing <lb/>
            well, he said, was neither useful for any purpose, nor accept­ <lb/>
            able to the gods.</p>

            engaged in arts or trades, and who wrought at them for gain, <lb/>
            he proved of service to them. Visiting Parrhasius1 the painter <lb/>
            one day, and entering into conversation with him, he said, <lb/>
            "Pray, Parrhasius, is not painting the representation of visi­ <lb/>
            ble objects ? At least you represent substances, imitating <lb/>
            them by means of colour, whether they be concave or convex, <lb/>
            dark or light, hard or soft, rough or smooth, fresh or old." <lb/>
            " What you say is true," said Parrhasius. 2. " And when <lb/>
            you would represent beautiful figures, do you, since it is not <lb/>
            easy to find one person with every part perfect, select, out of <lb/>
            many, the most beautiful parts of each, and thus represent <lb/>
            figures beautiful in every part ?" " We do so," said he. 3. <lb/>
            " And do you also," said Socrates, "give imitations of the <note type="footnote"> I It is to be remembered that this celebrated painter, when So­ <lb/>

            disposition of the mind, as it may be most persuasive, most <lb/>
            agreeable, most friendly, most full of regret, or most amiable ? <lb/>
            Or is this inimitable ? " " How can that be imitated, Socrates," <lb/>
            said he, "which has neither proportion, nor colour, nor any <lb/>
            of the qualities which you just now mentioned, and is not <lb/>
            even a visible object ? " 1 4. "Is it not often observable in a <lb/>
            man that he regards others with a friendly or unfriendly <lb/>
            look ?" " I think so," said he. " Is this then possible to be <lb/>
            copied in the eyes ? " " Assuredly." "And at the good or <lb/>
            ill fortune of people's friends, do those who are affected at it, <lb/>
            and those who are not, appear to you to have the same sort of <lb/>
            look ? " " No, indeed ; for they look cheerful at their good, <lb/>
            and sad at their evil, fortune. " " Is it possible, then, to <lb/>
            imitate these looks ?" "Unquestionably." 5. "Surely, also, <lb/>
            nobleness and generosity of disposition, meanness and illiber­ <lb/>
            ality, modesty and intelligence, insolence and stupidity, show <lb/>
            themselves both in the looks and gestures of men, whether <lb/>
            they stand or move." " What you say is just." " Can these <lb/>
            peculiarities be imitated ? " " Certainly." " Whether, then," <lb/>
            said Socrates, "do you think that people look with more plea­ <lb/>
            sure on paintings in which beautiful, and good, and lovely <lb/>
            characters are exhibited, or those in which the deformed, and <lb/>
            evil, and detestable are represented ?" "There is a very great <lb/>
            difference indeed, Socrates," replied Parrhasius.2</p>
          <p>G. Going once, too, into the workshop of Cleito,3 the statu­ <lb/>
            ary, and beginning to converse with him, he said, " I see and <lb/>
            understand, Cleito, that you make figures of various kinds, <lb/>
            runners and wrestlers, pugilists and pancratiasts, but how do <lb/>
            you put into your statues that which most wins the minds of <lb/>
            the beholders through the eye, the life-like appearance ? " 7. <lb/>
            As Cleito hesitated, and did not immediately answer, So­ <lb/>
            crates proceeded to ask, "Do you make your statues appear <lb/>
            more life-like by assimilating your work to the figures of the <lb/>
            living ? " "Certainly," said he. " Do you not then make <lb/>
            your figures appear more like reality, and more striking, by <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οϱατόν</foreign>,] Not an object which you can represent by its shape, <lb/>

            was, as Schneider thinks, that he should exercise his pencil in re­ <lb/>

            imitating the parts of the body, that are drawn up or drawn <lb/>
            down, compressed or spread out, stretched or relaxed, by the <lb/>
            gesture?" "Undoubtedly," said Cleito. " And the repre­ <lb/>
            sentation of the passions of men engaged in any act, does it <lb/>
            not excite a certain pleasure in the spectators ? " "It is <unclear>na</unclear> <lb/>
            tural, at least, that it should be so," said he. "Must you not, <lb/>
            then, copy the menacing looks of combatants ? And must you <lb/>
            not imitate the countenance of conquerors, as they look joyful ?" <lb/>
            "Assuredly," said he. "A statuary, therefore," concluded <lb/>
            Socrates, "must express the workings of the mind by the <lb/>
            form."</p>
          <p>9. Entering the shop of Pistias,1 a corset-maker, and Pis­ <lb/>
            tias having shown him some well-made corslets, Socrates ob­ <lb/>
            served, " By Juno, Pistias, this is an excellent invention, that <lb/>
            the corslet should cover2 those parts of a man's body that need <lb/>
            protection, and yet should not hinder him from using his <lb/>
            hands. 10. But tell me, Pistias," he added, "why do you <lb/>
            sell your corslets at a higher price than other makers, though <lb/>
            you neither make them stronger nor of more costly materials ?" <lb/>
            " Because, Socrates," said he, " I make them better propor­ <lb/>
            tioned." " And do you make this proportion appear in the <lb/>
            measure or weight of your corslets, that you set a higher price <lb/>
            on them ? For I suppose that you do not make them all <lb/>
            equal or similar, if you make them to fit different persons." <lb/>
            "Indeed," replied he, " I do make them to fit, for there would <lb/>
            be no use in a corslet without that quality." 11. Are not <lb/>
            then," said Socrates, " the bodies of some men well-propor­ <lb/>
            tioned, and those of others ill-proportioned ? " " Certainly," <lb/>
            said Pistias. " How, then," asked Socrates, " do you make <lb/>
            a well-proportioned corslet fit an ill-proportioned body ?" <lb/>
            "As I make it fit," answered Pistias ; "for one that fits is <lb/>
            well-proportioned." 12. " You seem to me," said Socrates, <lb/>
            " to speak of proportion considered not independently, but <lb/>
            with respect to the wearer, as if you should say of a <lb/>
            shield, or a cloak, that it is well-proportioned to him whom it <lb/>

            things, according to what you say. is. But, perhaps, there <lb/>
            may be some other considerable advantage attendant on being <lb/>
            made to fit." " Tell me, Socrates," said he, " if you know <lb/>
            any." "Those corslets which fit," answered Socrates, "are <lb/>
            less oppressive by their weight, than those which do not fit, <lb/>
            though they be both of equal weight; while those which do not <lb/>
            fit, are, either from hanging wholly on the shoulders, or from <lb/>
            pressing heavily on some other part of the body, inconvenient <lb/>
            and uneasy; but those which fit, as they distribute their <lb/>
            weight partly over the collar-bone1 and shoulder, partly over <lb/>
            the upper part of the arm, and partly over the breast, back, <lb/>
            and stomach, appear almost like, not a burden to be borne, <lb/>
            but a natural appendage." 14. " You have hit upon the very <lb/>
            quality," said Pistias, "for which I consider my manufacture <lb/>
            deserving of the very highest price; some, however, prefer <lb/>
            purchasing ornamented and gilded corslets." " Yet if on <lb/>
            this account," said Socrates, " they purchase such as do <lb/>
            not fit, they appear to me to purchase an ornamented and <lb/>
            gilded annoyance. But," added he, " since the body does not <lb/>
            continue always in the same position, but is at one time bent, <lb/>
            and at another straight, how can a corslet, which is exactly <lb/>
            fitted to it, suit it ?" " It cannot by any means," said Pistias. <lb/>
            " You mean, therefore," said Socrates, " that it is not those <lb/>
            which are exactly fitted to the body that suit, but those that <lb/>
            do not gall in the wearing." " You say what is clearly the <lb/>
            case, Socrates," replied he, " and exactly comprehend the <lb/>
            matter."</p>

            body in company with Socrates making mention of her, and <lb/>
            saying that her beauty was beyond description, and that <lb/>
            painters went to her to take her portrait, to whom she showed <lb/>
            as much of her person as she could with propriety, " We <lb/>
            ought then to go and see her," remarked Socrates, " for it is <lb/>
            not possible to comprehend by hearing that which surpasses <lb/>
            description." " You cannot be too quick in following me, <lb/>
            then," said he who had mentioned her.</p>
          <p>2. Going, accordingly, to the house of Theodota, and find­ <lb/>
            ing her standing to a painter, they contemplated her figure; <lb/>
            and when the painter had left off, Socrates said, " My friends, <lb/>
            whether ought we to feel obliged to Theodota for having <lb/>
            shown us her beauty, or she to us for having viewed it with <lb/>
            admiration ? If the exhibition be rather of advantage to her, <lb/>
            ought not she to feel grateful to us, or if the sight has given rather <lb/>
            more pleasure to us, ought not we to feel grateful to her ?" 3. <lb/>
            Somebody saying that he spoke reasonably, he added, " She. <lb/>
            then, for the present, gains praise from us, and, when we have <lb/>
            spoken of her to others, will gain profit in addition ; but as <lb/>
            for us, we now desire to embrace what we have seen, and shall <lb/>
            go away excited, and long for her after we are away from <lb/>
            her ; the natural consequence of which is that we shall be her <lb/>
            adorers, and that she will be worshipped as our mistress." <lb/>
            "If this be the case, indeed," said Theodota, "I must feel <lb/>
            gratitude to you for coming to see me."</p>
          <p>4. Soon after, Socrates, seeing her most expensively attired, <lb/>
            and her mother with her in a dress and adornment above <lb/>
            the common, with several handsome female attendants, not <lb/>
            unbecomingly apparelled, and her house richly furnished in <lb/>
            other respects, said to her, " Tell me, Theodota, have you an <lb/>

            have a house that brings you an income?" " Nor a house <lb/>

            Socrates, "do you procure subsistence ? "If any one be­ <lb/>
            comes my friend," she replied, "and is willing to benefit me, <lb/>
            lie is my means of subsistence." 5. "By Juno, Theodota," <lb/>
            rejoined Socrates, "and he is an excellent acquisition to you ; <lb/>
            and it is much better to have a flock of friends than of sheep, <lb/>
            oxen, and goats, But," added lie, " do you leave it to chance <lb/>
            whether a friend, like a fly, shall wing his way to you, or do <lb/>
            you use any contrivance to attract them ?" 6. "And how," <lb/>
            said she, "can I find a contrivance for such a purpose?" <lb/>
            " Much more readily," said he, " than spiders can ; for you <lb/>
            know how they try to get subsistence ; they weave fine nets, <lb/>
            and feed upon whatever falls into them." 7. "And do you ad­ <lb/>
            vise me, too," said she, " to weave a net ?" " Yes," said he, <lb/>
            " for you ought not to think that you will catch friends, <lb/>
            the most valuable prey that can be taken, without art. Do <lb/>
            you not see how many arts hunters use to catch hares,1 an <lb/>
            animal of but little worth ? 8, As the hares feed in the night, <lb/>
            they procure dogs for hunting by night, with which they <lb/>
            chase them ; as they conceal themselves in the day, they pro­ <lb/>
            vide other dogs, which, perceiving by the smell the way that <lb/>
            they have gone from their feeding-place to their forms, trace <lb/>
            them out; and as they arc swift of foot, so as soon to <lb/>
            escape from view by running, they procure also other dogs, of <lb/>
            great speed, that they may be caught by pursuit; and because <lb/>
            some of them escape even from these dogs, they stretch nets <lb/>
            across the paths by which they flee, that they may fall into <lb/>
            them and be entangled." 9. " By what art of this kind, then," <lb/>
            said she, " can I catch friends ?" " If," said he, " instead of <lb/>
            a dog, you get somebody to track and discover the lovers of <lb/>
            beauty, and the wealthy, and who, when lie has found them, <lb/>
            will contrive to drive them into your nets." " And what nets <lb/>
            have I ?" said site. to. " You have one at least," he replied, <lb/>
            " and one that closely embraces its prey, your person ; and in <lb/>
            it you have a mind, by which you understand how you may <lb/>
            gratify a person by looking at him, and what you may say to <lb/>
            cheer him, and learn that you ought to receive with transport <lb/>

            who sincerely cares for you. To love I am sure that you know, <lb/>
            not only tenderly, but with true kindness of heart; and your <lb/>
            friends try to please you, I know, because you conciliate them, <lb/>
            not with words merely, but by your behaviour towards them." <lb/>
            " Indeed," replied Theodota, " I use none of these schemes." <lb/>
            11." Yet," said Socrates, " it is of great importance to deal with <lb/>
            a man according to his disposition, and with judgment; for by <lb/>
            force you can neither gain nor keep a friend, but by serving <lb/>
            and pleasing him the animal1 is easily taken and attached to <lb/>
            you." " What you say is true," said she.</p>
          <p>12. " It becomes you, therefore," proceeded Socrates, " in <lb/>
            the first place, to request of your lovers only such favours as <lb/>
            they will perform with least cost to themselves; and you must <lb/>
            then make a return by obliging them in a similar way; ;2 for <lb/>
            thus they will become most sincerely attached to you, and will <lb/>
            love you longest, and benefit you most. 13. But you will <lb/>
            please them most, if you grant them favours only when they <lb/>
            solicit them ; for you see that even the most savoury meats, <lb/>
            if a person offer them to another before he has an appetite for <lb/>
            them, appear to him distasteful; and in the satisfied they ex­ <lb/>
            cite even loathing; but if one offers food to another after <lb/>
            having raised an appetite in him, it seems, though it be of a <lb/>
            very ordinary kind, extremely agreeable." 14. "How then <lb/>
            can I," said she, "excite such an appetite in any one of those <lb/>
            that visit me ? " " If, when they are satiated," said he, " you, <lb/>
            in the first place, neither offer yourself to them, nor remind <lb/>
            them of you, until, coming to an end of their satiety, they <lb/>
            again feel a desire for you; and, when they do feel such de­ <lb/>
            sire, remind them of your fondness by the most modest ad­ <lb/>
            dress, and by showing yourself willing to gratify them, hold­ <lb/>
            ing back, at the same time, until they are filled with impatient <lb/>
            longing'; for it is far better to grant the same favours at such <lb/>
            a time, than before they had an appetite for them." 15. <lb/>
            "Why do not you, then, Socrates," said she, "become my <lb/>
            helper in securing friends ? " "I will indeed," said he, " if <lb/>
            you can persuade me." "And how then," said she, "can I <note type="footnote"> I To <foreign xml:lang="grc">θηρίον</foreign>.] A word suitable to the illustrations which Socrates <lb/>

            do so, if you should at all need me." " Come often to see me, <lb/>
            then," said she. 16. Then Socrates, joking upon his own easy <lb/>
            life, said, "But, Theodota, it is not easy for me to find leisure ; <lb/>
            for my own numerous occupations, private and public,1 allow <lb/>
            me no rest; and I have friends2 also, who will not suffer me <lb/>
            to leave them day or night, learning from me love-charms and <lb/>
            incantations." IT. Do you then know such arts, too, So­ <lb/>
            crates ? " said Theodota. " Through what other influence do <lb/>
            you suppose that Apollodorus3 here, and Antisthenes,4 never <lb/>
            leave me? and through what other influence do you suppose <lb/>
            that Cebes5 and Simmias5 come to me from Thebes? Be <lb/>
            assured, that such effects were not produced without many <lb/>

            said she, "only take care to let me in." " I will let you in <lb/>

          <p>Socrates shows the benefit of gymnastic exercises, as well on the health of <lb/>

          <p>1. NOTICING that Epigenes, one of his followers, was both <lb/>
            very young and weak in body, he said to him, " How very <lb/>
            unlike an athlete1 you are in frame, Epigenes ! " "I am not an <lb/>
            athlete, Socrates," replied he. "You are not less of an ath­ <lb/>
            lete," rejoined Socrates, " than those who are going to con­ <lb/>
            tend at the Olympic games. Does the struggle for life with <lb/>
            the enemy, which the Athenians will demand of you when <lb/>
            circumstances require, seem to you to be a trifling contest ? <lb/>
            a. Yet, in the dangers of war, not a few, through weakness of <lb/>
            body, either lose their lives, or save them with dishonour ; <lb/>
            many, from the same cause, arc taken alive, and, as prisoners <lb/>
            of war, endure for the rest of their lives, if such should be <lb/>
            their fate, the bitterest slavery; or, falling into the most <lb/>
            grievous hardships, and paying for their ransom sometimes <lb/>
            more than they possess, pass the remainder of their existence <lb/>
            in want of necessaries, and in the endurance of affliction ; and <lb/>
            many, too, incur infamy, being thought to be cowards merely <lb/>
            from the imbecility of their bodily frame. 3. Do you think <lb/>
            lightly of such penalties attached to weakness of body, or do <lb/>
            you expect that you will endure such calamities with ease ? I <lb/>
            believe that what lie must bear who attends to the health of <lb/>
            his body, is far lighter and more pleasant than such afflic­ <lb/>
            tions. Or do you suppose that an ill condition of body is <lb/>
            more salutary and advantageous than a good condition ? Or <lb/>
            do you despise the benefits secured by a good state of the <lb/>
            body? 4. Yet the lot which falls to those who have their <lb/>
            bodies in good condition is exactly the reverse of that which <lb/>
            falls to those who have them in ill condition ; for those who <lb/>
            have their bodies in a good state are healthy and strong; and <note type="footnote"> out their gallants was <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒνδον ἒτερος</foreign>. Lucian, Dialog. Meretr. xii, <lb/>

            with honour amid the struggles of war, and escape every <lb/>

            them privately, but rather to practise them the marc; 3 for be <lb/>
            well assured that neither in any other contest, nor in any <lb/>
            affair whatever, will you at all come off the worse because <lb/>
            your body is better trained than that of other men ; since the <lb/>
            body must bear its part in whatever men do ; and in all the <lb/>
            services required from the body, it is of the utmost import­ <lb/>
            ance to have it in the best possible condition ; 6. for even in <lb/>
            that in which you think that there is least exercise for the <lb/>
            body, namely, thinking, who does not know that many fail <lb/>
            greatly from ill-health ? and loss of memory, despondency, <lb/>
            irritability, and madness, often, from ill-health of body, at­ <lb/>
            tack the mind with such force as to drive out all previous <lb/>
            knowledge. 7. But to those who have their bodies in good <lb/>
            condition, there is the utmost freedom from anxiety, and no <lb/>
            danger of suffering any such calamity from weakness of con­ <lb/>
            stitution; whilst it is likely, rather, that a healthy state of <lb/>
            body will avail to produce consequences the reverse of those <lb/>
            which result from an unhealthy state of it; and, indeed, to <lb/>
            secure consequences the reverse of what we have stated, what <lb/>
            would a man in his senses not undergo? 8. It is disgraceful, <lb/>

            what he would become by rendering himself well-formed and <lb/>

          <p>Several brief sayings of Socrates. We should not be offended at rudeness of <lb/>
            manner more than at personal defects, sect. 1. Fasting the best remedy <lb/>
            for loathing of food, 2. We should not be too nice as to food or drink, 3. <lb/>
            He that punishes his slave, should consider whether he himself deserves <lb/>
            like punishment, 4. Admonitions to travellers, 5. It is disgraceful to <lb/>
            him who has been trained in the gymnasium to be outdone by a slave in <lb/>
            enduring toil, 6.</p>
          <p>I. A PERSON being angry, because, on saluting another, lie <lb/>
            was not saluted in return, " It is an odd thing," said Socrates <lb/>
            to turn, " that if you had met a man in-conditioned in body, <lb/>
            you would not have been angry, but to have met a man <lb/>
            rudely disposed in mind provokes you."</p>
          <p>a. Another person saying that he ate without pleasure, <lb/>
            " Acumenus,”1 said Socrates, ‟ prescribes an excellent remedy <lb/>
            for that disease.”The other asking, ‟What sort of remedy?” <lb/>
            " To abstain from eating,” said Socrates ; " for he says that, <lb/>
            after abstaining, you will live with more pleasure, less ex­ <lb/>
            pense, and better health.”</p>
          <p>3. Another saying that the water which lie had to drink at <lb/>
            his house was warm, ‟When you wish to bathe in warm <lb/>
            water, then,” said Socrates, " it will be ready for you." "But <lb/>
            it is too cold to bathe in," said the other. ‟ Are your <lb/>
            slaves, then," asked Socrates, ‟ inconvenienced by drinking <lb/>
            or bathing in it?" ‟ No, by Jupiter," replied he; "for I <lb/>
            have often wondered how cheerfully they use it for both those <lb/>
            purposes.” ‟ And is the water in your house,” said Socrates, <lb/>
            ‟or that in the temple of Æsculapius,2 the warmer for drink­ <lb/>
            ing?" "That at the temple of Æsculapius,” replied he. <lb/>
            " And which is the colder for bathing in, that at your house, <lb/>
            or that in the temple of Amphiaraus ?"3 ‟ That in the temple <lb/>
            of Amphiaraus,” said he. " Consider, then," said Socrates, <note type="footnote"> I A physician of the time of Socrates, and one of his friends. See <lb/>

            sick."</p>
          <p>4. Another person beating his attendant severely, Socrates <lb/>
            asked him why he was so angry at the slave. "Because," <lb/>
            said he, ‟ he is very gluttonous and very stupid, very covet­ <lb/>
            ous and very idle." ‟ And have you ever reflected," rejoined <lb/>
            Socrates, "which of the two deserves the greater number of <lb/>
            stripes, you or your slave?"</p>
          <p>5. A person being afraid of the journey to Olympia, <lb/>
            "Why," said Socrates to him, " do you fear the journey ? Do <lb/>
            you not walk about at nome almost all day ? And, if you set <lb/>
            out thither, you will walk and dine, walk and sup, and go to <lb/>
            rest. Do you not know that if you were to extend in a straight <lb/>
            ':ne the walks which you take in five or six days, you would <lb/>
            easily go from Athens to Olympia ? But it will be better for <lb/>
            you to start a day too soon than a day too late; for to be <lb/>
            obliged to extend your days' journeys beyond a moderate <lb/>
            length is disagreeable; but to spend one day more on the <lb/>
            road gives great ease; and it is better, therefore, to hasten to <lb/>
            start than to hurry on the way."</p>
          <p>6. Another saying that he was utterly wearied with a long <lb/>
            journey, Socrates asked him whether he carried any burden. <lb/>
            " No, by Jupiter," said he, ‟ I did not, except my cloak." <lb/>
            " And did you travel alone," said Socrates, " or did an at­ <lb/>
            tendant accompany you?" "An attendant was with me." <lb/>
            " Was he empty-handed, or did he carry anything?" " He <lb/>
            carried, certainly, the bedding3 and other utensils." ‟And <lb/>
            how did he get over the journey?" ‟ He appeared to me to <lb/>
            come off better than myself." "If you, then, had been <lb/>
            obliged to carry his burden, how do you imagine that you <lb/>
            would have fared?” "Very ill," by Jupiter; "or rather, I <lb/>
            should not have been able to carry it at all." ‟ And how can <lb/>
            you think that it becomes a man trained to exercise to be so <lb/>
            much less able to bear fatigue than a slave?" <note type="footnote"> 3 Which slaves used to carry in a bag. See note on Anab. v. <lb/>

          <p>fable-talk of Socrates in praise of frugality. In contributions to feasts, one <lb/>
            guest should not strive to surpass another in the quality or quantity of <lb/>
            what he contributes, sect. 1. lie may be called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοφάγος</foreign>, flesh-cater, <lb/>
            who cats flesh alone, or with very little bread, 2—4. He that cats of many <lb/>
            dishes at once acts foolishly in various ways, 6, 6. lie may be truly said <lb/>
            to banquet, who lives on plain and wholesome food, 7.</p>
          <p>1. WHEN, among a number of persons who had met to­ <lb/>
            gether to sup, some brought little meat, and others a great <lb/>
            quantity, Socrates desired the attendant either to set the <lb/>
            smallest dish on the table for common participation, or to dis­ <lb/>
            tribute a portion of it to each. They, accordingly, who had <lb/>
            brought a great deal, were ashamed not to partake of what <lb/>
            was put on table for the company in general, and not, at <lb/>
            the same time, to put their own on table in return. They <lb/>
            therefore offered their own dishes for the participation of the <lb/>
            company; and when they had no greater share than those <lb/>
            who brought but little, they ceased to buy meat at great cost.</p>
          <p>2. Observing one of those at table with him taking no <lb/>
            bread, but eating meat by itself, and a discussion having <lb/>
            arisen at the same time about names, for what cause any par <lb/>
            ticular name was given, ‟Can we tell,” said Socrates, "for <lb/>
            what cause a man should be called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοφ</foreign>ú<foreign xml:lang="grc">γος</foreign> ?1 For everybody <lb/>
            eats flesh with his bread when he has it; but I do not sup­ <lb/>
            pose that people are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοφάγοι</foreign> on that account.” ‟ I <lb/>
            should think not,” said one of the company. 3. ‟ But,” said <lb/>
            Socrates, " if a person should eat meat by itself without <lb/>
            bread, not for the purpose of training,2 but of gratifying his <lb/>
            appetite, whether would he seem to be an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοφάγος</foreign> or not?" <lb/>
            " Scarcely any other would more justly seem so," said he <lb/>
            ‟And he that eats a great deal of meat with very little <lb/>
            bread,” said another of the company, ‟what should lie be <lb/>
            calle ?” "To me,” replied Socrates, ‟it appears that he <lb/>
            would justly be called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀψοφάγος</foreign>, and when other men pray to <note type="footnote">1 Flesh-cater. From <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄψον</foreign>, whatever was eaten with bread, and <lb/>

            the gods for abundance of corn, lie may pray for abundance of <lb/>
            fles.” 4. When Socrates said this, the young man, thinking <lb/>
            that the words were directed at him, did not indeed leave off <lb/>
            eating meat, but took some bread with it. Socrates, observ­ <lb/>
            ing him do so, said, "Notice this young man, you that sit <lb/>
            near him, whether he takes bread to his meat, or meat to his <lb/>
            bread."</p>
          <p>5. Seeing another of the company taste of several dishes <lb/>
            with the same piece of bread, " Can any cookery be more ex­ <lb/>
            travagant,” said he, “or more adapted to spoil dishes, than <lb/>
            that which he practises who eats of several at the same time, <lb/>
            putting all manner of sauces into his mouth at once ? For as <lb/>
            he mixes together more ingredients than the cooks, he makes <lb/>
            what he eats more expensive; and as he mixes what they for­ <lb/>
            bear to mix as being incongruous, he, if they do right, is in <lb/>
            the wrong, and renders their art ineffectual. 6. And how can <lb/>
            it be otherwise than ridiculous," he added, " for a man to pro­ <lb/>
            vide himself with cooks of the greatest skill, and then, though <lb/>
            he pretends to no knowledge of their art, to undo what has <lb/>
            been done by them ? But there is another evil attendant on <lb/>
            him who is accustomed to eat of several dishes at once; for, if <lb/>
            lie has not several sorts of meat before him, he thinks himself <lb/>
            stinted, missing the variety to which he has been used. But <lb/>
            he who is accustomed to make one piece of bread, and one <lb/>
            piece of meat, go together, will be able to partake contentedly <lb/>
            of one dish when several are just at hand."</p>
          <p>7. He observed also that <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐωχει̃ϭϑαι</foreign>, " to fare wen,”1 was in <lb/>
            the language of the Athenians called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϭϑίειν</foreign>, "to eat;" and <lb/>

          <p>Socrates liked the society of young men; how he judged of them; his de­ <lb/>
            sire that they should be well educated, sect. 1, 2. The more powerful the <lb/>
            mind in youth, the more likely it is, if ill trained, to run into viee, 3, 4. <lb/>
            Happiness does not depend on riches, but on knowledge, and on being <lb/>
            useful to our fellow-ereatures, and gaining their esteem, 5.</p>
          <p>1. So serviceable was Socrates to others, in every kind of <lb/>
            transaction, and by every possible means, that to any one who <lb/>
            reflects on his usefulness, (even though he possess but moderate <lb/>
            discernment,) it is manifest that nothing was of greater be­ <lb/>
            nefit than to associate with Socrates, and to converse with <lb/>
            him, on any occasion, or on any subject whatever; since even <lb/>
            the remembrance of him, when he is no longer with us, bene­ <lb/>
            fits in no small degree those who were accustomed to enjoy <lb/>
            his society, and heard him with approbation; for he sought <lb/>
            to improve his associates not less in his humorous than in his <lb/>
            serious conversation. a. He would often say that he loved <lb/>
            some particular person ; but he was evidently enamoured, not <lb/>
            of those formed by nature to be beautiful, but of those <lb/>
            naturally inclined to virtue. He judged of the goodness <lb/>
            of people's abilities from their quickness in learning the <lb/>
            things to which they gave their attention, from their re­ <lb/>
            membrance of what they learned, and from their desire for <lb/>
            all those branches of knowledge by means of which it is possi­ <lb/>
            ble to manage a family or an estate well, and to govern men <lb/>
            and their affairs with success ; for he thought that such cha­ <lb/>
            racters, when instructed, would not only be happy themselves, <lb/>
            and regulate their own families judiciously, but would be able <lb/>
            to render other men, and other communities besides their own, <lb/>
            happy. 3. He did not however make advances to all in the <lb/>
            same manner. Those who thought that they had good natural <lb/>
            abilities, but despised instruction, he endeavoured to con­ <lb/>
            vince that minds which show most natural power have most <lb/>
            need of education, pointing out to them that horses of the best <lb/>
             <pb n="469"/>
            breed, which are high-spirited and obstinate, become, if they <lb/>
            are broken in when young, most useful and valuable, but if <lb/>
            they are left unbroken, remain quite unmanageable and <lb/>
            worthless ; and that hounds of the best blood, able to endure <lb/>
            toil, and eager to attack beasts, prove, if they are well trained, <lb/>
            most serviceable for the chase, and every way excellent, but, <lb/>
            if untrained, are useless, rabid, and disobedient. 4. In like <lb/>
            manner, he showed that men of the best natural endowments, <lb/>
            possessed of the greatest strength of mind, and most energetic <lb/>
            in executing what they undertake, became, if well disciplined <lb/>
            and instructed in what they ought to do, most estimable cha­ <lb/>
            racters, and most beneficent to society, (as they then per­ <lb/>
            formed most numerous and important services,) but that, if <lb/>
            uninstructed, and left in ignorance, they proved utterly worth­ <lb/>
            less and mischievous ; for that, not knowing what line of <lb/>
            conduct they ought to pursue, they often entered upon evil <lb/>
            courses, and, being haughty and impetuous, were difficult to be <lb/>
            restrained or turned from their purpose, and thus occasioned <lb/>
            very many and great evils.</p>
          <p>5. But those who prided themselves on their wealth, and <lb/>
            thought that they required no education, but imagined that <lb/>
            their riches would suflice to effect whatever they desired, and <lb/>
            to gain them honour from mankind, he tried to reduce to <lb/>
            reason by saying that the man was a fool who thought that <lb/>
            he could distinguish the good and the evil in life without in­ <lb/>
            struction ; and that he also was a fool, who, though he could <lb/>
            not distinguish them, thought that he would procure whatever <lb/>
            he wished, and effect whatever was for his interest, by means <lb/>
            of his wealth. He also said that the man was void of sense, <lb/>
            who, not being qualified to pursue what was for his good, <lb/>
            fancied that he would be prosperous in the world, and that <lb/>
            everything necessary for his comfort was fully, or at least <lb/>
            sufficiently, provided for him ; and that he was equally void <lb/>
            of sense, who, though he knew nothing, thought that he would <lb/>
            seem good for something because of his riches, and, though <lb/>
            evidently despicable, would gain esteem through their in­ <lb/>
            fluence. <pb n="470"/>

          <p>No dependence to be placed on natural abilities without education. Socrates <lb/>
            proceeds to show Euthydemus, a self-conceited young man, that in every <lb/>
            art it is proper to have recourse to instructors, sect. 1, 2. lie shows the <lb/>
            folly of a man who should pretend to have learned everything of himself, <lb/>
            3—5. The necessity of instruction in the art of government, 6, 7. By a <lb/>
            long series of interrogations Socrates reduces Euthydemus to acknowledge <lb/>
            his ignorance and incompetence, 8—23. The value of self-knowledge, <lb/>
            24—30. Further instructions given to Euthydemus, 30—40.</p>
          <p>1. 1 I will now show how Socrates addressed himself to <lb/>
            such as thought that they had attained the highest degree of <lb/>
            knowledge, and prided themselves on their ability. Hearing <lb/>
            that Euthydemus,2 surnamed the Handsome, had collected <lb/>
            many writings3 of tIle most celebrated poets and sophists, and <lb/>
            imagined that by that means he was outstripping his con­ <lb/>
            temporaries in accomplishments, and had great hopes that he <lb/>
            would excel them all in talent for speaking and acting, and <lb/>
            finding, by his first inquiries about him, that he had not yet <lb/>
            engaged in public affairs on account of his youth,4 but that, <lb/>
            when he wished to do any business,5 he usually sat in a bridle- <lb/>
            maker's shop near the Forum, he went himself to it, accom­ <lb/>
            panied by some of his hearers; 2. and as somebody asked, <lb/>
            first of all, " whether it was from his intercourse with some <lb/>
            of the wise men, or from his own natural talents, that The­ <lb/>
            mistocles attained such a pre-eminence above his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, that the republic looked to him whenever it wanted <lb/>
            the service of a man of ability," Socrates, wishing to excite <lb/>
            the attention of Euthydemus, said that "it was absurd to <lb/>
            believe that men could not become skilled in the lowest <note type="footnote"> 1 Schneider observes that this second chapter is but a continu­ <lb/>

            mechanical arts without competent instructors, and to imagine <lb/>
            that ability to govern a state, the most important of all arts, <lb/>
            might spring up in men by the unassisted efforts of nature."</p>
          <p>3. Oil another occasion, when Euthydemus was one of tile <lb/>
            company, and Socrates saw him leaving it, from apprehension <lb/>
            lest lie should seem to admire him for his wisdom, he observed, <lb/>
            "It is evident, my friends, from the studies that he pursues, <lb/>
            that Euthydemus here, when lie comes of age, and the govern­ <lb/>
            ment give liberty of discussion1 on any point, will not refrain <lb/>
            from offering his counsel; and I imagine that lie has already <lb/>
            framed an exordium for his public oration, taking precau­ <lb/>
            tion that lie may not be thought to have learned anything <lb/>
            from anybody; and it is pretty certain, therefore, that when <lb/>
            he begins to speak, he will make his opening thus: 4. ' I, 0 <lb/>
            men of Athens, have never learned anything from any per­ <lb/>
            son, nor, though I heard of some that were skilled in speaking <lb/>
            and acting, have I sought to converse with them; nor have I <lb/>
            been anxious that anyone of the learnedshould become my mas­ <lb/>
            ter ; but I have done the exact contrary; for I have constant­ <lb/>
            ly avoided not only learning anything from any one, but even <lb/>
            the appearance of learning anything; nevertheless I will offer <lb/>
            you such advice as may occur to me without premeditation. <lb/>
            5. So it might be proper for a person to commence a speech <lb/>
            who desired to obtain a medical appointment2 from the go­ <lb/>
            vernment : ' I, 0 men of Athens, have never learned the <lb/>
            medical art from any one, nor have been desirous that any <lb/>
            physician should be my instructor ; for I have constantly been <lb/>
            on my guard, not only against learning anything of the art <lb/>
            from any one, but even against appearing to have learned any­ <lb/>
            thing ; nevertheless confer on me this medical appointment; <lb/>
            for I will endeavour to learn by making experiments3 upon <note type="footnote"> 1 When the public crier called the people to an assembly, he gave <lb/>

            ceiving a salary from the public treasury. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 To learn by making experiments on their patients medical <lb/>

            you.'" At this mode of opening a speech all who were pre­ <lb/>
            sent burst out into laughter.</p>
          <p>6. As Euthydemus had now evidently begun to attend to <lb/>
            what Socrates was saying, but was cautious of speaking him­ <lb/>
            self, as thinking by his silence to clothe himself with reputa­ <lb/>
            tion for modesty, Socrates, wishing to cure him of that <lb/>
            fancy, said, “ It is indeed strange, that those who desire to <lb/>
            play on the lyre, or on the flute, or to ride, or to become expert <lb/>
            in any such accomplishment, should endeavour to practise, as <lb/>
            constantly as possible, that in which they desire to excel, and not <lb/>
            by themselves merely, but with the aid of such as are considered <lb/>
            eminent in those attainments, attempting and undergoing every­ <lb/>
            thing, so as to do nothing without their sanction, as supposing <lb/>
            that they can by no other means attain reputation; but that of <lb/>
            those who wish to become able to speak and act in affairs of <lb/>
            government, some think that they will be suddenly qualified to <lb/>
            achieve their object, without preparation or study, and by <lb/>
            their own unassisted efforts. 7. Yet these pursuits are mani­ <lb/>
            festly more difficult of attainment than those, inasmuch as of <lb/>
            the very many who attempt them a much smaller number <lb/>
            succeed in them ; and it is evident, therefore, that those who <lb/>
            pursue the one are required to submit to longer and more dili­ <lb/>
            gent study than those who pursue the other." <unclear/> <lb/>
            8. Socrates used at first to make such remarks, while Eu­ <lb/>
            thydemus merely listened; but when he observed that he <lb/>
            stayed, while lie conversed, with more willingness, and <lb/>
            hearkened to him with more attention, he at last came to the <lb/>
            bridle-maker's shop unattended. As Euthydemus sat down <lb/>
            beside him, he said, " Tell me, Euthydemus, have you really, <lb/>
            as I hear, collected many of the writings1 of men who are said <lb/>
            to have been wise." " I have indeed, Socrates," replied he, <lb/>
            "and I am still collecting, intending to persevere till I get as <lb/>
            many as I possibly can." 9. By Juno," rejoined Socrates, <lb/>
            "I feel admiration for you, because you have not preferred ac­ <lb/>
            quiring treasures of silver and gold rather than of wisdom ; for <lb/>
            it is plain you consider that silver and gold are unable to make <lb/>
            men better, but that the thoughts of wise men enrich their <lb/>
            possessors with virtue." Euthydemus was delighted to hear <note type="footnote">periculis nostril, et experimenta per mortes agunt, as Pliny says, It. N. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            this commendation, believing that lie was thought by Socrates <lb/>
            to have sought wisdom in the right course. 10. Socrates, ob­ <lb/>
            serving that he was gratified with the praise, said, " And in <lb/>
            what particular art do you wish to become skilful, that you <lb/>
            collect these writings?" As Euthydemus continued silent, <lb/>
            considering what reply he should make, Socrates again asked, <lb/>
            “ Do you wish to become a physician ? for there are many <lb/>
            writings of physicians." " Not I, by Jupiter," replied Eu­ <lb/>
            thydemus. "Do you wish to become an architect, then? for <lb/>
            a man of knowledge is needed for that art also.”1 " No, in­ <lb/>
            deed," answered he. “ Do you wish to become a good geome­ <lb/>
            trician, like Theodorus?”2 "Nor a geometrician either,” <lb/>
            said he. "Do you wish then to become an astronomer?" <lb/>
            said Socrates. As Euthydemus said “ No," to this, “ Do you <lb/>
            wish then," added Socrates, " to become a rhapsodist,3 for they <lb/>
            say that you are in possession of all the poems of Homer." <lb/>
            "No indeed," said he, "for I know that the rhapsodists, <lb/>
            though eminently knowing in the poems of Homer, are, as <lb/>
            men, extremely foolish." 11. " You are perhaps desirous then,” <lb/>
            proceeded Socrates, " of attaining that talent by which men <lb/>
            become skilled in governing states, in managing households, <lb/>
            able to command, and qualified to benefit other men as well <lb/>
            as themselves." “ I indeed greatly desire," said he, “ Socra­ <lb/>
            tes, to acquire that talent." “ By Jupiter," returned Socrates, <lb/>
            "you aspire to a most honourable accomplishment, and a most <lb/>
            exalted art, for it is the art of kings, and is called the royal <lb/>
            art. But," added he, “ have you ever considered whether it <lb/>
            is possible for a man who is not just to be eminent in that <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γνωμονικου̃ γὰρ ἀνδρὸς καὶ του̃το δει̃</foreign>.] “ There is need of a man <lb/>

            “ Have you yourself, then, made yourself master of that <lb/>
            virtue ?" " I think," said he, " Socrates, that I shall be <lb/>

            works of just men, as there are works of artisans ?" " There <lb/>

            also to tell their works?" "And why should not I," <lb/>
            asked Euthydemus, "be able to tell the works of jus­ <lb/>
            tice; as also indeed those of injustice; for we may see and <lb/>
            hear of no small number of them every day?"</p>
          <p>13. “ Are you willing then," said Socrates, “ that we should <lb/>
            make a delta on this side, and an alpha3 on that, and then that <lb/>
            we should put whatever seems to us to be a work of justice <lb/>
            under the delta, and whatever seems to be a work of injustice <lb/>
            under the alpha?” "If you think that we need those <lb/>
            letters,” said Euthydemus, "make them." 14. Socrates, <lb/>
            having made the letters as he proposed, asked, “ Does false­ <lb/>
            hood then exist among mankind?" "It does assuredly," <lb/>
            replied he. "Under which head shall we place it?" "Under <lb/>
            injustice, certainly." "Does deceit also exist?” "Unques­ <lb/>
            tionably." " Under which head shall we place that?" “Evi <lb/>
            dently under injustice.” “Docs mischievousness exist?" <lb/>
            “Undoubtedly.” "And the enslaving of men?" “That, <lb/>
            too, prevails." “And shall neither of these things be placed <lb/>
            by us under justice, Euthydemus?" " It would be strange if <lb/>
            they should be," said he. 15. "But," said Socrates, "if a <lb/>
            mail, being chosen to lead an army, should reduce to slavery <lb/>
            an <unclear>unjust</unclear> and hostile people, should we say that he committed <lb/>
            injustice?” “ No, certainly," replied he. “Should we not <lb/>
            rather say that he acted justly?” “Indisputably.” "And <lb/>
            if, in the course of tIle war with them, he should practise de­ <lb/>
            ceit?" “That also would be just," said he. "And if he <lb/>
            should steal and carry off their property, would he not do <lb/>
            what was just?" "Certainly," said Euthydemus; "but I <lb/>
            thought at first that you asked these questions only with <lb/>
            reference to our friends.” " Then," said Socrates, " all that <lb/>
            we have placed under the head of injustice, we must also place <note type="footnote"> Delta for <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαιος</foreign>, “just; ” alpha for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδικὸς</foreign>, "unjust." </note> <pb n="475"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 2.] </note> <lb/>
            under that of justice?" " It seems so," replied Euthydemus. <lb/>
            16. "Do you agree, then,” continued Socrates, “that, having <lb/>
            so placed them, we should make a new distinction, that it is <lb/>
            just to do such things with regard to enemies, but unjust to do <lb/>
            them with regard to friends, and that towards his friends our <lb/>
            general should be as guileless as possible?" " By all means," <lb/>
            replied Euthydemus. 17. “ Well, then," said Socrates, “ if a <lb/>
            general, seeing his army dispirited, should tell them, invent­ <lb/>
            ing a falsehood, that auxiliaries were coming, and should, by <lb/>
            that invention, check the despondency of his troops, under <lb/>
            which head should we place such all act of deceit ?” “It ap­ <lb/>
            pears to me,” said Euthydemus, "that we must place it under <lb/>
            justice." "And if a father, when his son requires medicine, <lb/>
            and refuses to take it, should deceive him, and give him the <lb/>
            medicine as ordinary food, and, by adopting such deception, <lb/>
            should restore him to health, under which head must we place <lb/>
            such an act of deceit?” “ It appears to me that we must put <lb/>
            it under the same head." “ And if a person, when his friend <lb/>
            was in despondency, should, through fear that lie might kill <lb/>
            himself, steal or take away his sword, or any other weapon, <lb/>
            under which head must we place that act?" "That, as­ <lb/>
            suredly, we must place under justice." Is. “ You say, then," <lb/>
            said Socrates, “ that not even towards our friends must we <lb/>
            act on all occasions without deceit ?" “ We must not indeed," <lb/>
            said he, “ for I retract what I said before, if I may be per­ <lb/>
            mitted to do so." " It is indeed much better that you should <lb/>
            be permitted," said Socrates, “than that you should not place <lb/>
            actions on the right side. 19. But of those who deceive their <lb/>
            friends in order to injure them, (that we may not leave even this <lb/>
            point unconsidered,) which of the two is the more unjust, he <lb/>
            who docs so intentionally or he who does so involuntarily ?” <lb/>
            “ Indeed, Socrates,” said Euthydemus, “I no longer put con­ <lb/>
            fidence in the answers which I give; for all that 1 said be­ <lb/>
            fore appears to me now to be quite different from what I then <lb/>
            thought; however, let me venture to say3 that he who de­ <lb/>
            ceives intentionally is more unjust than he who deceives in­ <lb/>

          <p>20. " Does it appear to you, then, that there is a way of <lb/>

            ever he pleased, he would be able to do both correctly." <lb/>
            " He, therefore, that purposely writes incorrectly may be a <lb/>
            good scholar, but he who does so involuntarily is destitute of <lb/>
            scholarship?” “ How can it be otherwise?" " And whether <lb/>
            does lie who lies and deceives intentionally know what is <lb/>
            just, or he who docs so unawares ?" “Doubtless he who does <lb/>
            so intentionally." "You therefore say that he who knows <lb/>
            how to write and read is a better scholar than he who does <lb/>
            not know?" "Yes." "And that he who knows what is <lb/>

            say so ; but I appear to myself to say this I know not how." <lb/>
            21. "But what would you think of the man, who, wishing to <lb/>
            tell the truth, should never give the same account of the same <lb/>
            thing, but, in speaking of the same road, should say at one <lb/>

            Socrates," rejoined Euthydemus, "I firmly believed that I <lb/>
            was pursuing that course of study, by which I should, as I <lb/>
            expected, be made fully acquainted with all that was proper <lb/>

            quainted with no other course which I may pursue to become <lb/>
            better !"</p>
          <p>24. Socrates then said, “Tell me, Euthydemus, have you <lb/>
            ever gone to Delphi ?" " Yes, twice," replied he. " And did <lb/>
            you observe what is written somewhere on the temple wall, <lb/>
            KNOW THYSELF?" "I did." "And did you take no <lb/>
            thought of that inscription, or did you attend to it, and try <lb/>
            to examine yourself, to ascertain what sort of character you <lb/>
            are?" "I did not indeed try, for I thought that I knew <lb/>
            very well already, since I should hardly know anything else <lb/>
            if I did not know myself,” 25. " But whether does he seem <lb/>
            to you to know himself, who knows his own name merely, or <lb/>
            he who, (like people buying horses, who do riot think that they <lb/>
            know the horse that they want to know, until they have <lb/>
            ascertained whether he is tractable or unruly, whether he is <lb/>
            strong or weak, swift or slow, and how lie is as to other points <lb/>
            which are serviceable or disadvantageous in the use of a <lb/>
            horse, so he,) having ascertained with regard to himself how <lb/>
            lie is adapted for the service of mankind, knows his own <lb/>
            abilities ?" “It appears to me, I must confess, that he who <lb/>
            does not know his own abilities, does not know himself." an. <lb/>
            " But is it not evident," said Socrates, " that men enjoy a great <lb/>
            number of blessings in consequence of knowing themselves, and <lb/>
            incur a great number of evils, through being deceived in them­ <lb/>
            selves? For they who know themselves know what is suitable <lb/>
            for them, and distinguish between what they can do and what <lb/>
            they cannot; and, by doing what they know how to do, pro­ <lb/>

            by abstaining from what they do not know, live blamelessly, <lb/>
            and avoid being unfortunate. By this knowledge of them­ <lb/>
            selves, too, they can form an opinion of other men, and, by <lb/>

            ,-elves what is good, and guard against what is evil. 27. But <lb/>
            they who do not know themselves, but are deceived in their <lb/>
            own powers, are in similar case with regard to other men,1 <lb/>
            and other human affairs, and neither understand what they <lb/>
            require, nor what they are doing, nor the characters of those <lb/>
            with whom they connect themselves, but, being in error as to <lb/>
            all these particulars, they fail to obtain what is good, and fall <lb/>
            into evil. 28. They, on the other hand, who understand <lb/>
            what they take in hand, succeed in what they attempt, and <lb/>
            become esteemed and honoured ; those who resemble them in <lb/>
            character willingly form connexions with them ; those who <lb/>
            are unsuccessful in life desire to be assisted with their ad­ <lb/>
            vice,2 and to prefer them to themselves ; they place in them <lb/>
            their hopes of good, and love them, on all these accounts, be­ <lb/>
            yond all other men. 20. But those, again, who do not know <lb/>
            what they are doing, who make an unhappy choice in life, <lb/>
            and arc unsuccessful in what they attempt, not only incur <lb/>
            losses and sufferings in their own affairs, but become, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence, disreputable and ridiculous, and drag out their lives <lb/>
            in contempt and dishonour. Among states, too, you see that <lb/>
            such as, from ignorance of their own strength, go to war with <lb/>
            others that are more powerful, are, some of them, utterly <lb/>
            verthrown, and others reduced from freedom to slavery.”</p>
          <p>30. "Be assured, therefore," replied Euthydemus, “that I <lb/>
            feel convinced we must consider self-knowledge of the highest <lb/>
            value; but as to the way in which we must begin3 to seek <lb/>
            self-knowledge, I look to you for information, if you will <lb/>
            kindly impart it to me.” 31. “Well, then," said Socrates, <lb/>
            "you doubtless fully understand what sort of things are good, <lb/>
            and what sort are evil." “Yes, by Jupiter," replied Euthy­ <lb/>
            demus, "for if I did not understand such things, I should be <lb/>
            in a worse condition than slaves arc." “Come then," said <lb/>
            Socrates, "tell me what they are,” " That is not difficult," <lb/>
            said he, “for, in the first place, health I consider to be a good, <lb/>

            as conduce to health to be good, and such as lead to sick­ <lb/>
            ness to be evil.” 32. “Consequently," said Socrates, " health <lb/>
            and sickness themselves, when they are the causes of any <lb/>
            good, will be good, and when they are the causes of any <lb/>
            evil, will be evil.” “But when," exclaimed Euthydemus, <lb/>
            “can health be the cause of evil, and sickness of good?" <lb/>
            “When, for example,” said Socrates, “some portion of a com­ <lb/>
            munity, from being in good health, take part in a disgraceful <lb/>
            expedition by land, or a ruinous voyage by sea, or in any <lb/>
            other such matters, which are sufficiently common, and lose <lb/>
            their lives, while others, who are left behind from ill-health, <lb/>
            are saved.” “What you say is true,” said Euthydemus, "but <lb/>
            you see that some men share in successful enterprises from <lb/>
            being in health, while others, from being in sickness, are left <lb/>
            out of them.” “Whether then,” said Socrates, “are those <lb/>
            things which are sometimes beneficial, and sometimes injuri­ <lb/>
            oil.,, goods, rather, or evils ?" “Nothing, by Jupiter, is to be <lb/>
            settled with regard to them1 by considering thus. 33. But as <lb/>
            to wisdom, Socrates, it is indisputably a good thing ; for what <lb/>
            business will not one who is wise conduct better than one who <lb/>
            is untaught?” “Have you not heard, then, of Dædalus,” said <lb/>
            Socrates, "how he was made prisoner by Minos and compelled <lb/>
            to serve him as a slave; how he was cut off, at once, from <lb/>
            his country and from liberty, and how, when he endeavoured <lb/>
            to escape with his son, he lost the child, and was unable to <lb/>
            save himself, but was carried away among barbarians, and <lb/>
            wade a second timo a slave?” “Such a story is told, in­ <lb/>
            deed,” said Euthydemus. “Have you not heard, too, of the <lb/>
            sufferings of Palamedes? for everybody says that it was for <lb/>
            his wisdom he was envied and put to death by Ulysses." <lb/>
            “That, too, is said," replied Euthydemus. " And how many <lb/>
            other men do you think have been carried off to the king2 on <lb/>
            account of their wisdom, and made slaves there?”</p>
          <p>34. " But as to happiness, Socrates,” said Euthydemns, <lb/>
            “that at least appears to be an indisputable good." " Yes, <lb/>
            Euthydemus," replied Socrates, “if we make it consist in <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐδὲν φαίνεται</foreign>] “Nothing appears” or is shown ; nothing <lb/>

            sometimes the other: but as to wisdom, that is indisputably a <lb/>
            good, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The king of Persia; iii. 5 26 </note> <pb n="480"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            things that are themselves indisputably good.”1 " But what.” <lb/>
            said he, "among things constituting happiness can be a <lb/>
            doubtful good ?” “Nothing,” answered Socrates, “unless we <lb/>
            join with it beauty, or strength, or wealth, or glory, or any <lb/>
            other such thing." 35. But we must assuredly join them <lb/>
            with it," said Euthydemus; " for how can a person be happy <lb/>
            without them ? " “We shall then join with it, by Jupiter," <lb/>
            said Socrates, "things from which many grievous calamities <lb/>
            happen to mankind; for many, on account of their beauty, <lb/>
            are ruined by those who are maddened with passion2 for their <lb/>
            youthful attractions ; many, through confidence in their <lb/>
            strength, have entered upon undertakings too great for it, and <lb/>
            involved themselves in no small disasters ; many, in consequence <lb/>
            of their wealth, have become enervated, been plotted against, <lb/>
            and destroyed ; and many, from the glory and power that they <lb/>
            have acquired in their country, have suffered the greatest <lb/>
            calamities." 36. " Well, then," said Euthydemus, " if I do not <lb/>

            not know what we ought to pray for to the gods."</p>
          <p>"These points, however," proceeded Socrates, "you have <lb/>
            perhaps not sufficiently considered, from too confident a belief <lb/>
            that you were already well acquainted with them; but since <lb/>
            you intend to be at the head of a democratic government, you <lb/>
            doubtless know what a democracy is." "Assuredly," said he. <lb/>
            37. “Do you think it possible for a person to know what a <lb/>
            democracy is, without knowing what the Demos is ?" "No, <lb/>
            indeed." " And what do you conceive the Demos to be?" <lb/>
            "I conceive it to be the poorer class of citizens." "Do you <lb/>
            know, then, which are the poor?” “I low can I help know­ <lb/>
            ing ? " “You know then which arc the rich?" "Just as <lb/>
            well as I know which arc the poor.” “Which sort of persons <lb/>
            then do you call poor, and which sort rich ? " " Those who <lb/>
            have not sufficient means to pay for the necessaries of life,3 I <lb/>

            who have very small means, those means are not only suffici­ <lb/>

            large fortunes are not sufficient?" "I have indeed," said <lb/>
            Euthydemus, "(for you very properly put me in mind of it,) <lb/>
            since I have known some princes, who, from poverty, have <lb/>
            been driven to commit injustice like the very poorest people." <lb/>
            39. " Then,” said Socrates, "if such be the case, we must rank <lb/>
            such princes among the Demos, and those that have but little, <lb/>
            we must rank, if they be good managers, among the rich ? " <lb/>
            " My own want of knowledge,1 indeed," said Enthydemus, <lb/>
            obliges me to admit even this ; and I am considering whether <lb/>
            it would not be best for me to be silent; for I seem to know <lb/>
            absolutely nothing."</p>
          <p>He went away, accordingly, in great dejection, holding him­ <lb/>
            self in contempt, and thinking that he was in reality no better <lb/>
            than a slave.</p>
          <p>40. Of those who were thus addressed by Socrates, many <lb/>
            came to him no more; and these he regarded as too dull to <lb/>
            be improved. But Euthydemus, on the contrary, conceived <lb/>
            that he could by no other means become an estimable charac­ <lb/>
            ter, than by associating with Socrates as much as possible; <lb/>
            and he in consequence never quitted him, unless some neces­ <lb/>
            sary business obliged him to do so. He also imitated many <lb/>
            of his habits.</p>
          <p>When Socrates saw that he was thus disposed, he no longer <lb/>
            puzzled him with questions, but explained to him, in the sim­ <lb/>
            plest and clearest manner, what he thought that he ought to <lb/>
            know, and what it would be best for him to study. <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φαυλότης</foreign>.] Inscitia. Sturz. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 1 </note> <pb n="482"/>

          <p>The necessity of temperance or self-control, and of right notions concerning <lb/>
            the gods, sect. 1, 2. The gods have a providential care for mankind, <lb/>
            3—9. Other animals are formed by the gods for the use of man, 10. In <lb/>
            addition to the senses common to man with the inferior animals, the gods <lb/>
            have given him reason and speech, 11, 12. Though we do not see the <lb/>
            gods, we are convinced of their existence from their works, 13, 14. We <lb/>
            ought therefore to pay them honour according to our means, 15—18.</p>
          <p>1. SOCRATES was never in haste that his followers should <lb/>
            become skilful in speaking, in action, or in invention,1 but, <lb/>
            previous to such accomplishments, he thought it proper that a <lb/>
            love of self-control should be instilled into them ; for he con­ <lb/>
            sidered that those who had acquired those qualifications were, <lb/>
            if devoid of self-control, only better fitted to commit injustice <lb/>
            and to do mischief. 2. In the first place, therefore, he endea­ <lb/>
            voured to impress his associateo with right feelings towards <lb/>
            the gods. Some, who were present with him when he con­ <lb/>
            versed with others on this subject, have given an account of <lb/>
            his discourses; but I myself was with him when he held a <lb/>
            conversation with Euthydemus to the following effect.</p>
          <p>3. "Tell me," said he, “Euthydemus, has it ever occurred <lb/>
            to you to consider how carefully the gods have provided for <lb/>
            men everything that they require ? ” “ It has indeed never <lb/>
            occurred to me," replied he. " You know at least," proceeded <lb/>
            Socrates, “ that we stand in need, first of all, of light, with <lb/>
            which the gods supply us." “ Yes, by Jupiter,” answered Eu­ <lb/>
            thydemus, "for if we had no light, we should be, as to the use <lb/>
            of our eyes, like the blind." "But, as we require rest, they <lb/>
            afford its night, the most suitable season for repose." “ That is <lb/>
            assuredly," said Euthydemus, " a subject for thankfulness." 4. <lb/>
            “ Then because the sun, being luminous, shows us the hours of <lb/>
            the day, and everything else, while the night, being dark, <lb/>
            prevents us from making such distinctions in it,2 have they <note type="footnote">1<foreign xml:lang="grc">Λεκτκοὺς καὶ πρακτικοὺς καιμηχανικούς</foreign>.]How Socrates rendered <lb/>

            not caused the stars to shine in the night, which show us the <lb/>
            night-watches, and under the direction of which we perform <lb/>
            many things that we require ? " " So it is," said he. “ The <lb/>
            moon, too, makes plain to us not only the divisions of the <lb/>
            night, but also of the month." “Assuredly,” said he. 5. <lb/>
            " But that, since we require food, they should raise it for us <lb/>
            from the earth, and appoint suitable seasons for the purpose, <lb/>
            which prepare for us, in abundance and every variety, not <lb/>
            only things which we need, but also things from which we <lb/>
            derive pleasure, what do you think of such gifts ?" " They <lb/>
            certainly indicate love for man.” 6. “ And that they should <lb/>
            supply us with water, an element of such value to us, that it <lb/>
            causes to spring up, and unites with the earth and the seasons <lb/>
            in bringing to maturity, everything useful for us, and assists <lb/>
            also to nourish ourselves, and, being mixed with all our food, <lb/>
            renders it easier of digestion, more serviceable, and more plea­ <lb/>
            sant; and that, as we require water in great quantities, they <lb/>
            should supply us with it in such profusion, what do you think <lb/>
            of such a gift? ” “ That also," said he, "shows thought for <lb/>
            us.” 7. " That they should also give us fire, a protection <lb/>
            against cold and darkness, an auxiliary in every art and <lb/>
            in everything that men prepare for their use, (for, in a <lb/>
            word, men produce nothing, among the various things neces­ <lb/>
            sary to life, without the aid of fire,) what do you think of <lb/>
            such a gift?" "That likewise," said he, "gives eminent <lb/>
            proof of regard for man." 8. 1 [“ That they should diffuse <lb/>
            the air also around us everywhere in such abundance, as not <lb/>
            only to preserve and support life, but to enable us to cross the <lb/>
            seas by means of it, and to get provisions by sailing hither <lb/>
            and thither among foreign lands, is not this a boon inexpressi­ <lb/>

            that, if he were to go beyond it, we should be frozen by the <lb/>
            cold, he should again turn towards us, and approach us, and <lb/>
            revolve in that precise part of the heaven in which he may be <lb/>
            of most advantage to us, what do you think of things so regu­ <lb/>
            lated ? " " By Jupiter," replied Euthydemus, they appear <lb/>
            to be appointed solely for the sake of man.” 9. “Again, that <lb/>
            the sun, because it is certain that we could not endure such <lb/>
            beat or cold if it should come upon us suddenly, should ap­ <lb/>
            proach us so gradually, and retire from us so gradually, that <lb/>
            we are brought imperceptibly to the greatest extremes of both, <lb/>
            what do you think of that appointment?" " I am reflecting, <lb/>
            indeed," said Euthydemus, " whether the gods can have any <lb/>
            other business than to take care of man ; only this thought <lb/>
            embarrasses me, that other animals partake in these benefits."</p>
          <p>10. "But is not this also evident," said Socrates, “ that <lb/>
            these animals are produced and nourished for the sake of <lb/>
            man ?” For what other animal derives so many benefits from <lb/>
            goats, sheep, horses, oxen, asses, and other such creatures, as <lb/>
            man ? To me it appears that he gains more advantages from <lb/>
            them than from the fruits of the earth ; at least he is fed and <lb/>
            enriched not less from the one than from the other; and a <lb/>
            great portion of mankind do not use the productions of the <lb/>
            earth for food, but live by herds of cattle, supported by their <lb/>
            milk, and cheese, and flesh; and all men tame and train the <lb/>
            useful sort of animals, and use their services for war and other <lb/>
            purposes." " I agree with what you say on that point," said <lb/>
            Euthydemus, “ for I see some animals, much stronger than <lb/>
            we, rendered so subservient to men that they use them for <lb/>
            whatever they please." 11. “But that, since there are num­ <lb/>
            berless beautiful and useful objects in the world, greatly dif­ <lb/>
            fering from one another, the gods should have bestowed on <lb/>
            men senses adapted to each of them, by means of which wo <lb/>
            enjoy every advantage from them; that they should have im­ <lb/>
            planted understanding in us, by means of which we reason <lb/>
            about what we perceive by the senses, and, assisted by the <lb/>
            memory, learn how far everything is beneficial, and contrive <lb/>
            many plans by which we enjoy good and avoid evil; 12. and <lb/>
            that they should have given us the faculty of speech, by mean <pb n="485"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 3.] </note> <lb/>
            of which we convey information to one another, and mutually <lb/>
            impart whatever is good, and participate in it, enact laws, and <lb/>
            enjoy constitutional government, what think you of such <lb/>
            blessings ? " “ The gods certainly appear, Socrates, to exer­ <lb/>
            cise the greatest care for man in every way.” "And that, <lb/>
            since we are unable to foresee what is for our advantage with <lb/>
            regard to the future, they should assist us in that respect, <lb/>
            communicating what will happen to those who inquire of them <lb/>
            by divination, and instructing them how their actions may be <lb/>
            most for their benefit, what thoughts does that produce in <lb/>
            you ? " “ The gods seem to show you, Socrates," rejoined he, <lb/>
            " more favour than other men, since they indicate to you, <lb/>
            without being asked, what you ought to do, and what not <lb/>
            to do."</p>
          <p>13. “And that I speak the truth,1 you yourself also well <lb/>
            know, if you do not expect to see the bodily forms of the <lb/>
            gods, but will be content, as you behold their works, to wor­ <lb/>
            ship and honour them. Reflect, too, that the gods themselves <lb/>
            give us this intimation 2 for the other deities3 that give us <lb/>
            blessings, do not bestow any of them by coming manifestly <lb/>
            before our sight ; and lie that orders and holds together the <lb/>
            whole universe, in which are all things beautiful and good, <lb/>
            and who preserves it always unimpaired, undisordered, and <lb/>
            undecaying, obeying his will swifter than thought and with­ <lb/>
            out irregularity, is himself manifested only in the perform­ <lb/>
            ance of his mighty works, but is invisible to us while he <lb/>
            regulates them. 14. Consider also that the sun, which ap­ <lb/>
            pears manifest to all, does not allow men to contemplate him <lb/>
            too curiously, but, if any one tries to gaze on him steadfastly, <lb/>
            deprives him of his sight. The instruments of the deities you <lb/>
            will likewise find imperceptible; for the thunder-bolt, for in­ <lb/>

            its will with everything with which it comes in contact, is yet <lb/>

            winds, too, are themselves invisible, though their effects are <lb/>
            evident to us, and we perceive their course. The soul of <lb/>
            man, moreover, which partakes of the divine nature if any­ <lb/>
            thing else in man does, rules, it is evident, within us, but is <lb/>
            itself unseen. Meditating on these facts, therefore, it be­ <lb/>
            hoves you not to despise the unseen gods, but, estimating <lb/>
            their power from what is done by them, to reverence what is <lb/>
            divine.”</p>
          <p>is. "I feel clearly persuaded, Socrates," said Euthydemus, <lb/>
            “ that I shall never fail, in the slightest degree, in respect for <lb/>
            the divine power, but I am dejected at the thought that no <lb/>
            one among mankind, as it seems to me, can ever requite the <lb/>
            favours of the gods with due gratitude." 16. "But be not <lb/>
            dejected at that reflection, Euthydemus," said Socrates, "for <lb/>
            you know that the deity at Delphi, whenever any one con­ <lb/>
            suits him how he may propitiate the gods, answers, ACCORD­ <lb/>
            ING TO TIlE LAW OF YOUlt COUNTRY ;1 and it is the law, <lb/>
            indeed, everywhere, that every man should propitiate the <lb/>
            gods with offerings according to his ability ; and how, there­ <lb/>
            fore, can any man honour the gods better or more piously, <lb/>
            than by acting as they themselves direct? 17. It behoves us, <lb/>
            however, not to do less than we are able, for, when any one <lb/>
            acts thus, he plainly shows that he does not honour the gods. <lb/>
            But it becomes him who fails, in no respect, to honour the <lb/>
            gods according to his means, to be of good courage, and to <lb/>
            hope for the greatest blessings; for no one can reasonably <lb/>
            hope for greater blessings from others than from those who are <lb/>
            able to benefit him most; nor on any other grounds than by <lb/>
            propitiating them ; and how can he propitiate them better <lb/>
            than by obeying them to the utmost of his power ?”</p>
          <p>is. By uttering such sentiments, and by acting according <lb/>

            example of adherence to justice in his own life, sect. 1—4. He commence <lb/>
            a conversation with Hippias, a sophist, 4—9. It is better to be just than <lb/>
            merely to talk of justice, 10, 11 ; it is a part of justice to obey the laws; <lb/>
            what a law is, 12—14 j who are the best magistrates in states, 15 ; a ge­ <lb/>
            neral observance of the laws maintains concord, 16—18; there are certain <lb/>
            unwritten laws, which it is not possible to transgress without incurring <lb/>
            punishment, 19—24; to observe the divine laws is to be just, 25.</p>
          <p>1. CONCERNING justice, too, he did not conceal what senti­ <lb/>
            ments he entertained, but made them manifest even by his <lb/>
            actions, for he conducted himself, in his private capacity, <lb/>
            justly and beneficently towards all men, and, as a citizen, he <lb/>
            obeyed the magistrates in all that the laws enjoined, both in <lb/>
            the city and on military expeditions, so that lie was distin­ <lb/>
            guished above other men for his observance of order. a. <lb/>
            When he was president in the public assembly, lie would not <lb/>
            permit the people to give a vote contrary to law, but opposed <lb/>
            himself, in defence of the laws, to such a storm of rage on <lb/>
            the part of the populace as I think that no other man could <lb/>
            have withstood.1 3. When the Thirty Tyrants commanded <lb/>
            him to do anything contrary to the laws, lie refused to obey <lb/>
            them ; for both when they forbade him to converse with the <lb/>
            young, and when they ordered him, and some others of the <lb/>
            citizens, to lead a certain person2 away to death, he alone did <lb/>
            not obey, because the order was given contrary to the laws.</p>
          <p>4. When he was accused by Meletus,3 and others were ac­ <lb/>
            customed, before the tribunal, to speak so as to gain the <lb/>
            favour of the judges, and to flatter them, and supplicate them, <lb/>
            in violation of the laws,4 and many persons, by such practices, <lb/>
            had often been acquitted by the judges, he refused, on his <lb/>
            trial, to comply with any practices opposed to the laws, and <note type="footnote">1 See i. 1. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> a Leon, a native of Salamis, but an enrolled citizen of Athens, <lb/>

            though he might easily have been acquitted by his judges, if <lb/>
            he had but in a slight degree adopted any of those customs, <lb/>
            he chose rather to die abiding by the laws than to save his <lb/>
            life by transgressing them.</p>
          <p>5. He held conversations to this effect with others on <lb/>
            several occasions, and I know that he once had a dialogue of <lb/>
            the following kind, concerning justice, with Hippias of Elis;1 <lb/>
            for Hippias, on his return to Athens after an absence of some <lb/>
            time, happened to conic in the way of Socrates as he was ob­ <lb/>
            serving to some people how surprising it was that, if a man <lb/>
            wished to have another taught to be a shoemaker, or a car­ <lb/>
            penter, or a worker in brass, or a rider, lie was at no loss <lb/>
            whither he should send him to effect his object ;2 [nay, that <lb/>
            every place, as some say, was fall of persons who would make <lb/>
            a horse or an ox observant of right for any one that desired ;] <lb/>
            while as to justice, if any one wished either to learn it him­ <lb/>
            self, or to have his son or his slave taught it, he did not know <lb/>
            whither he should go to obtain his desire, 6. Ilippias, hear­ <lb/>
            ing this remark, said, as if jesting with him, " What! are <lb/>
            you still saying the same things, Socrates, that I heard from <lb/>
            you so long ago?" "Yes," said Socrates, "and what is more <lb/>
            wonderful, I am not only still saying the same things, but am <lb/>
            saying them on the same subjects; but you, perhaps, from <lb/>
            being possessed of such variety of knowledge, never say the <lb/>
            same things on the same subjects." " Certainly,” replied <lb/>
            Hippias, " I do always try to say something new." 7. " About <lb/>
            matters of which you have certain knowledge, then," said <lb/>
            Socrates, "as, for instance, about the letters of the alphabet, <lb/>
            if any one were to ask yon how many and what letters are in <lb/>
            the word ' Socrates,' would you try to say sometimes one thing, <lb/>

            give the same answer at one time as at another?" "About <lb/>
            such matters, Socrates," replied Hippias, " I, like you, always <lb/>
            say the same thing; but concerning justice I think that I <lb/>
            have certainly something to say now which neither you nor <lb/>
            any other person can refute." 8. “By Juno," returned So­ <lb/>
            crates, " it is a great good that you say you have discovered, <lb/>
            since the judges will now cease from giving contradictory sen­ <lb/>
            tences, the citizens will cease from disputing about what is <lb/>

            to war ; and I know not how I can part with you till I have <lb/>
            learned so important a benefit from its discoverer." 9. " You <lb/>
            shall not hear it, by Jupiter," rejoined Hippias, “ until you <lb/>
            yourself declare what you think justice to be ; for it is enough <lb/>
            that you laugh at others, 1 questioning and confuting every­ <lb/>
            body, while you yourself are unwilling to give a reason to <lb/>
            anybody, or to declare your opinion on any subject." to. <lb/>
            " What then, Hippias,” said Socrates, " have you not per­ <lb/>
            ceived that I never cease declaring my opinion as to what I <lb/>
            conceive to be just ?" " And what is this opinion of yours ?" <lb/>
            said Hippias. " If I make it known to you, not by words <lb/>
            merely, but by actions, do not deeds seem to you to be a <lb/>
            stronger evidence than words?" “ Much stronger, by Jupi­ <lb/>
            ter," said Hippias, " for many who say what is just do what <lb/>
            is unjust, but a man who does what is just cannot be himself <lb/>
            unjust." 11. Have you ever then found me bearing false <lb/>
            witness, or giving malicious information, or plunging my <lb/>
            friends or the state into quarrels, or doing anything else that <lb/>
            is unjust?" "I have not." " And do you not think it jus­ <lb/>
            tice to refrain from injustice?" “You are plainly now," <lb/>
            said Hippias, " endeavouring to avoid expressing an opinion <lb/>
            as to what you think just; for what you say is, not what the <lb/>
            just do, but what they do not do." 12. But I thought," <lb/>
            rejoined Socrates, " that to be unwilling to do injustice was a <lb/>
            sufficient proof of justice. If this, however, does not satisfy <lb/>
            you, consider whether what I next say will please you better; <lb/>
            for I assert that what is in conformity with the laws is just." <lb/>
            " Do you say, Socrates, that to be conformable to the laws, <lb/>
            and to be just, is the same thing?" " I do indeed." 13. "I <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Satis est quod ceteros omnes rides;—me verb non ridebis.” <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            am puzzled; for I do not understand what you call conform­ <lb/>
            able to law, or what you call just." “ Do you know the laws <lb/>
            of the state ?" said Socrates. “ I do," said the other. "And <lb/>
            what do you consider them to be?" "What the citizens in con­ <lb/>
            cert have enacted as to what we ought to do, and what we <lb/>
            ought to avoid doing." “ Would not he, therefore," asked <lb/>
            Socrates, “ be an observer of the laws, who should conduct <lb/>
            himself in the community agreeably to those enactments, and he <lb/>
            be a violater of the laws who transgresses them ?" " Undoubt­ <lb/>
            edly," said Hippias. “ Would not lie then do what is just who <lb/>
            obeys the laws, and he do what is unjust who disobeys them ?” <lb/>
            “Certainly.” " Is not he then just who does what is just, and <lb/>
            he unjust who does what is unjust?" “How can it be other­ <lb/>
            wise?" “ He therefore that conforms to the laws is just," <lb/>
            added Socrates, ”and he who violates the laws, unjust."</p>
          <p>14. “ But,” objected Hippias, “ how can any oneimagine <lb/>
            the laws, or obedience to them, to be a matter of absolute im­ <lb/>
            portance, when the very persons who make them often reject <lb/>
            and alter them ?” “That objection is of no consequence," <lb/>
            said Socrates, "for states, which have commenced war, often <lb/>
            make peace again." " Undoubtedly they do," said Hippias. <lb/>
            " What difference will there be in your conduct, then, think <lb/>
            you, 1 if you throw contempt on those who obey the laws, be­ <lb/>
            cause the laws may be changed, and if you blame those who <lb/>
            act properly in war, because peace may be made ? Do you <lb/>
            condemn those who vigorously support their country in war ?” <lb/>

            heard it said of Lycurgus the Lacedæmonian, then," said So­ <lb/>
            crates, “ that he would not have made Sparta at all different <lb/>
            from other states, if he had not established in it, beyond <lb/>

            laws, is in the best condition In peace, and invincible in war? <lb/>
            16. The greatest blessing to states, moreover, is concord ; and <lb/>
            the senates and principal men in them often exhort the citizens <lb/>
            to unanimity; and everywhere throughout Greece it is a law <lb/>

            which they every where do take; but I conceive that this is done, <lb/>
            not that the citizens may approve of the same choruses, or that <lb/>
            they may praise the same flute-players, or that they may prefer <lb/>
            the same poets,1 or that they may take delight in the same <lb/>
            spectacles, but that they may obey the laws ; for while the <lb/>
            citizens adhere to these, states will be eminently powerful and <lb/>
            happy; but without such unanimity, no state can be well <lb/>
            governed, nor any family well regulated. 17. As an indi­ <lb/>
            vidual citizen, too, how could any person render himself less <lb/>
            liable to penalties from the government, or more likely to <lb/>
            have honours bestowed upon him, than by being obedient to <lb/>
            the laws? How else would he incur fewer defeats in the <lb/>
            courts of justice, or how more certainly obtain sentence in his <lb/>
            favour? To whom would any one believe that he could <lb/>
            more safely confide his money, or his sons or daughters ? <lb/>
            Whom would the whole community deem more trustworthy <lb/>
            than him who respects the laws ? From whom would parents, <lb/>
            or relatives, or domestics, or friends, or citizens, or strangers, <lb/>
            more certainly obtain their rights ? To whom would the <lb/>
            enemy sooner trust in cessations of arms, or in making a truce, <lb/>
            or articles of peace? To whom would people more willingly <lb/>
            become allies than to the observer of the laws, and to whom <lb/>
            would the allies more willingly trust the leadership, or com­ <lb/>
            mand of a fortress, or of a city ? From whom would any one <lb/>
            expect to meet with gratitude, on doing him a kindness, <lb/>
            sooner than from the observer of the laws ? Or whom would <lb/>
            any one rather serve than him from whom he expects to re­ <lb/>
            ceive a return ? To whom would any one more desire to be a <lb/>
            friend, or less desire to be an enemy, than such a man ? With <lb/>
            whom would any one be less inclined to go to war, than with <lb/>
            him to whom lie would most wish to be a friend, and least of <lb/>
            all an enemy, and to whom the greatest part of mankind <lb/>
            would wish to be friends and allies, and but a small number <lb/>
            to be antagonists and enemies? is. I, therefore, Hippias, <lb/>
            pronounce that to obey the laws and to be just is the same <lb/>
            if you hold an opinion to the contrary, tell me." “Indeed, <lb/>
            Socrates," rejoined Hippias, " I do not know that I entertain <lb/>
            any sentiments opposed to what you have said of justice."</p>
          <p>19. “ But are you aware, Ilippias," continued Socrates, <lb/>
            " that there are unwritten laws?" "You mean those," said <note type="footnote"> 1 The slime scenic poets. </note> <pb n="492"/>
            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            Hippias, that are in force about the same points every­ <lb/>
            where." “Can you affirm, then, that men made those laws?” <lb/>
            " How could they,” said Hippias, "when they could not all <lb/>
            meet together, and do not all speak the same language?" <lb/>
            " Whom then do you suppose to have made these laws?" "I <lb/>
            believe,” said he, "that it was the gods who made these laws <lb/>
            for men, for among all men the first law is to venerate the <lb/>
            gods." 20. " Is it not also a law everywhere to honour <lb/>
            parents?” "It is so." "Is it not a law, too, that parents <lb/>
            shall not intermarry with their children, nor children with <lb/>
            their parents?” “This does not as yet, Socrates, appear to <lb/>
            me to be a law of the gods?" " Why?” " Because I find <lb/>
            that some nations transgress it." 21. “ Many others, too, they <lb/>
            transgress,” said Socrates; "but those who violate the laws <lb/>
            made by the gods incur punishment which it is by no means <lb/>
            possible for man to escape, as many transgressors of the laws <lb/>
            made by men escape punishment, some by concealment, others <lb/>
            by open violence." 22. “ And what sort of punishment, <lb/>
            Socrates," said he, "cannot parents escape who intermarry <lb/>
            with their children, and children who intermarry with their <lb/>
            parents?” "The greatest of all punishments, by Jupiter," <lb/>
            replied Socrates, for what greater penalty can those who <lb/>
            beget children incur, than to have bad children ?” 23. “ How <lb/>
            then," said Hippias, "do they necessarily have bad children, <lb/>
            when nothing hinders but that they may he good themselves, <lb/>
            and have children by good partners?” “Decause,” returned <lb/>
            Socrates, “it is not only necessary that those who have chil­ <lb/>
            dren by each other should be good, but that they should be in <lb/>
            full bodily vigour.1 Or do you suppose that the seed of those <lb/>
            who are at the height of maturity is similar to that of those <lb/>
            who have not yet reached maturity, or to that of those who <lb/>
            are far past it?" “ By Jupiter,” replied Hippias, “ it is not <lb/>
            at all likely that it should be similar." " Which of the two <note type="footnote"> I Mirari libet Socratis commentum, qui in conjugiis talibus nihil <lb/>

            " That of those who are not at full maturity, then, is not sum­ <lb/>

            not to have children?" "No." “Do not those, therefore, <lb/>
            who have children under such circumstances, have them as <lb/>
            they ought not?” "So it appears to me." “What other <lb/>

            “ Well,” said Hippias, " I agree with you on this point also."</p>

            a law,” answered Hippias, “but it is transgressed.” " Do not <lb/>

            themselves, and are not those who make no return to such as <lb/>
            serve them hated by them for their ingratitude ; and yet, be­ <lb/>
            cause it is for their advantage to have their support, do they <lb/>
            not pay the greatest court to them?” “Indeed, Socrates,” <lb/>
            replied Hippias, "all these things seem to suit the character of <lb/>
            the gods; for that the laws themselves should carry with <lb/>
            them punishments for those who transgress them, appears to <lb/>
            me to be the appointment of a lawgiver superior to man."</p>
          <p>as. “Whether, therefore, Hippias,” added Socrates, "do <lb/>
            you consider that the gods appoint as laws, what is agreeable <lb/>
            to justice, or what is at variance with justice ?” Not what is <lb/>
            at variance with justice, certainly," said Hippias,” “for scarcely <lb/>
            would any other make laws in conformity with justice, if a god <lb/>
            were not to do so." "It is the pleasure of the gods, therefore, <lb/>
            Hippias,” concluded Socrates, "that what is in conformity with <lb/>
            justice should also be in conformity with the laws." 1</p>
          <p>By uttering such sentiments, and acting in agreement with <lb/>
            them, he rendered those who conversed with him more ob­ <lb/>
            servant of justice. <note type="footnote"> 1 Lange has given a judicious summary of these arguments. The <lb/>
            gods give just laws; what is in conformity with these laws, is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιμον</foreign>: therefore everything <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιμον</foreign> in the divine laws is just. <lb/>
            Thus the gods in this definition (TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμιμον δίκαιον εἲναι</foreign>, sect. 12) <lb/>
            agree with men, or with me, says Socrates. A sound argument, if <lb/>
            human laws be what they ought to be, that is, in conformity with <lb/>
            the divine laws, or the laws of nature. </note> <pb n="494"/>

          <p>Socrates rendered his followers better qualified for public life. The neces­ <lb/>

            arising from temperance, 8—10; the conduct of the temperate man, <lb/>

          <p>I. I WILL now relate how lie rendered his followers better <lb/>
            qualified for the management of public business. Thinking it <lb/>
            expedient that temperance should be observed by him who <lb/>
            would succeed in anything honourable, he first made it evi­ <lb/>
            dent to those who conversed with him, that he practised this <lb/>
            virtue beyond all other men, and then, by his discourse, he <lb/>
            exhorted his followers, above everything, to the observance of <lb/>
            temperance. He continued always, therefore, to make allu­ <lb/>
            sions to whatever was conducive to virtue ; and I know that <lb/>
            he once held a conversation on temperance with Euthydemus <lb/>
            to the following effect: 2. " Tell me," said he, "Euthydemus, <lb/>
            do you regard liberty as an excellent and honourable posses­ <lb/>
            sion for an individual or a community ? " “The most excel­ <lb/>
            lent and honourable that can be,” replied he. 3. “ Do you <lb/>
            consider him, then, who is held under control by the pleasures <lb/>
            of the body, and is rendered unable, by their influence, to do <lb/>
            what is best for him, to be free ?" " By no means," replied <lb/>
            Euthydemus. "Perhaps, then, to have the power of doing <lb/>
            what is best seems to you to be freedom, but to be under in­ <lb/>
            fluences which will hinder, you from doing it, you consider to <lb/>
            be want of freedom?" "Assuredly," said he. 4. Do not <lb/>
            the intemperate appear to you, then, to be absolutely without <lb/>
            freedom?" "Yes, by Jupiter, and naturally so." " And <lb/>
            whether do the intemperate appear to you to be merely pre­ <lb/>
            vented from doing what is best, or to be forced, also, to do what <lb/>
            is most dishonourable?" "They appear to me," replied Eu­ <lb/>
            thydemus, “ to be not less forced to do the one than they are <lb/>
            hindered from doing the other." 5. And what sort of mas­ <lb/>
            ters do you consider those to be, who hinder men from doing <lb/>
            what is best, and force them to do what is worst?” " The <lb/>
            very worst possible, by Jupiter," replied he. " And what <lb/>
            sort of slavery do you consider to be the worst ? " " That," <lb/>
            said he, “ under the worst masters." " Do not then the in- <pb n="495"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 5.] </note> <lb/>
            temperate," said Socrates, "endure the very worst of slavery?" <lb/>
            ' It appears so to me," answered Euthydemus. e. And <lb/>
            does not intemperance seem to you, by banishing from men <lb/>
            prudence, the greatest good, to drive them into the very oppo­ <lb/>
            site evil? Does it not appear to you to hinder them from <lb/>
            attending to useful things, and learning them, by drawing <lb/>
            them away to pleasure, and frequently, by captivating those <lb/>
            who have a perception of good and evil, to make them choose <lb/>
            the worse instead of the better ?" “ Such is the case," said he. <lb/>
            7. " And whom can we suppose, Euthydemus, to have less <lb/>
            participation in self-control than the intemperate man ? for <lb/>
            assuredly the acts of self-control and of intemperance are the <lb/>
            very opposite to each other.” " I assent to this also,” said he. <lb/>
            " And do you think that anything is a greater hindrance to <lb/>
            attention to what is becoming, than intemperance ?" "I do <lb/>
            not." “And do you imagine that there is any greater evil to <lb/>
            man, than that which makes him prefer the noxious to the <lb/>
            beneficial, which prompts him to pursue the one and to neg­ <lb/>
            lect the other, and which forces him to pursue a contrary <lb/>
            course of conduct to that of the wise ? ” “ There is none," <lb/>
            said Euthydemus.</p>
          <p>8. " Is it not natural, then," said Socrates, “ that temperance <lb/>
            should be the cause of producing in men effects contrary to <lb/>
            those which intemperance produces?” “ Undoubtedly,” said <lb/>
            Euthydemus. " Is it not natural, therefore, also, that what <lb/>
            produces those contrary effects should be best for man ? " " It <lb/>
            is natural," said he. "Is it not consequently natural, then, <lb/>
            Euthydemus, that temperance should be best for man ? " "It <lb/>
            is so, Socrates," said he. 9. And have you ever reflected <lb/>
            upon this, Enthydemus ? " “ What ? " “ That even to those <lb/>
            pleasures, to which alone intemperance seems to lead men, it <lb/>
            cannot lead them, but that temperance produces greater plea­ <lb/>
            sure than anything else?" "How?" said he. " Because <lb/>
            intemperance, by not allowing men to withstand hunger, thirst, <lb/>
            or the desire of sensual gratification, or want of sleep, (through <lb/>
            which privations alone is it possible for them to eat, and <lb/>
            drink, and gratify other natural appetites, and go to rest and <lb/>
            sleep with pleasure, waiting and restraining themselves until <lb/>
            the inclinations may be most happily indulged,) hinders them <lb/>
            from having any due enjoyment in acts most necessary and <lb/>
            most habitual; but temperance, which alone enables men to <pb n="496"/>
             <note type="margin">B. V. </note> <lb/>
            endure the privations which I have mentioned, alone enables <lb/>
            them to find delight in the gratifications to which I have <lb/>
            alluded." “ What you say," observed Euthydemus, “ is indis­ <lb/>
            putably true." 10. “ From learning what is honourable and <lb/>
            good, moreover, and from the study of those accomplishments <lb/>
            by which a man may ably govern himself, judiciously regulate <lb/>
            his household, become useful to his friends and the state, and <lb/>
            gain the mastery over his enemies, (from which studies arise <lb/>
            not only the greatest advantages, but also the greatest plea­ <lb/>
            sures,) the temperate have enjoyment while they practise <lb/>
            them, but the intemperate have no share in any of them ; for <lb/>
            to whom can we say that it less belongs to participate in such <lb/>
            advantages, than to him who has the least power to pursue <lb/>
            them, being wholly occupied in attention to present pleasures ?” <lb/>
            II. “You seem to me, Socrates,” said Euthydemus, "to say <lb/>
            that the man who is under the influence of bodily pleasures, <lb/>
            has no participation in any one virtue." " For what differ­ <lb/>
            ence is there, Euthydemus," said he, " between an intemperate <lb/>
            man and the most ignorant brute ? How will he, who has <lb/>
            no regard to what is best, but seeks only to enjoy what is most <lb/>
            seductive by any means in his power, differ from the most <lb/>
            senseless cattle ? To the temperate alone it belongs to con­ <lb/>
            sider what is best in human pursuits, to distinguish those pur­ <lb/>
            suits, according to experience and reason, into their several <lb/>
            classes, and then to choose the good and refrain from the <lb/>
            evil."</p>
          <p>12. Thus it was, he said, that men became most virtuous <lb/>
            and happy, and most skilful in reasoning; and he observed <lb/>
            that the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλέγεσϑαι</foreign>, " to reason," had its origin in <lb/>
            people's practice of meeting together to reason on matters, and <lb/>
            distinguishing them, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλέγοντας</foreign>, according to their several <lb/>
            kinds. It was the duty of every one, therefore, he thought, <lb/>
            to make himself ready in this art, and to study it with the <lb/>
            greatest diligence; for that men, by the aid of it, became <lb/>
            most accomplished, most able to guide others, and most acute <lb/>
            in discussion. <pb n="497"/>

            of COURAOE, 10, 11. Some other definitions, 12. Remarks on the So­ <lb/>
            cratic method of argument, 13—15.</p>
          <p>1. I WILL now endeavour to show that Socrates rendered <lb/>
            those who associated with torn more skilful in argument. For <lb/>
            he thought that those who knew the nature of things sever­ <lb/>
            ally, would be able to explain them to others; but as to <lb/>
            those who did not know, he said that it was not surprising <lb/>
            that they fell into error themselves, and led others into it. <lb/>
            He therefore never ceased to reason with his associates about <lb/>
            the nature of things.1 To go through all the terms that he <lb/>
            defined, and to show how lie defined them, would be a long <lb/>
            task ; but I will give as many instances as I think will suffice <lb/>
            to show the nature of his reasoning.</p>
          <p>2. In the first place, then, he reasoned of PIETY, in some <lb/>
            such way as this. “ Tell me,” said he, “Euthydemus, what <lb/>
            sort of feeling do you consider piety to be ? " “ The most <lb/>
            noble of all feelings," replied he. " Can you tell me, then, <lb/>
            who is a pious man ? " " The man, I think, who honours the <lb/>
            gods." "Is it allowable to pay honour to the gods in any <lb/>
            way that one pleases ? " " No ; there are certain laws in con­ <lb/>
            formity with which we must pay our honours to them." 3. <lb/>
            " He, then, who knows these laws, will know how he must <lb/>
            honour the gods ?" “ I think so." “ He therefore who knows <lb/>
            how to pay honour to the gods, will not think that he ought to <lb/>
            pay it otherwise than as he knows?" " Doubtless not." “Bu <lb/>
            does any one pay honours to the gods otherwise than as he <lb/>
            thinks that he ought to pay them ?" " I think not.” 4. "He <lb/>
            therefore who knows what is agreeable to the laws with re­ <lb/>
            gard to the gods, will honour the gods in agreement with the <lb/>
            laws?" “Certainly.” "Does not he, then, who honours the <lb/>
            gods agreeably to the laws honour them as he ought ? " "How <lb/>
            can he do otherwise ?” “ And he who honours them as he <lb/>
            ought, is pious ?" "Certainly." “ He therefore who knows <lb/>
            what is agreeable to the laws with regard to the gods, may <note type="footnote">1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τί ἕκαστονεἴη τω̃ν ὄντων</foreign>.] Quid res quælibet esset “ what each <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [B. IV. </note> <lb/>
            be justly defined by us as a pious man ?” “ So it appears to <lb/>
            me," said Euthydemus.</p>
          <p>5. "But is it allowable for a person to conduct himself <lb/>
            towards other men in whatever way he pleases ?" " No; but <lb/>
            with respect to men also, he who knows what is in conformity <lb/>
            with the laws, and how men ought, according to them, to <lb/>
            conduct themselves towards each other, will be an observer of <lb/>
            the laws." " Do not those, then, who conduct themselves <lb/>
            towards each other according to what is in conformity with <lb/>
            the laws, conduct themselves towards each other as they <lb/>
            ought?" "How can it be otherwise ?" "Do not those, there­ <lb/>
            fore, who conduct themselves towards each other as they <lb/>
            ought, conduct themselves well ?" " Certainly.” "Do not those, <lb/>
            then, that conduct themselves well towards each other, act pro­ <lb/>
            perlyin transactions between man and man?” "Surely." " Do <lb/>
            not those, then, who obey the laws, do what is just ?" “ Un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly." 6. “ And do you know what sort of actions are <lb/>
            called just?" " Those which the laws sanction." "Those, <lb/>
            therefore, who do what the laws sanction, do what is just, and <lb/>
            what they ought ? " " How can it be otherwise ? " " Those who <lb/>
            do just things, therefore, arc just ? " "I think so." " Do you <lb/>
            think that any persons yield obedience to the laws who do not <lb/>
            know what the laws sanction ?" "I do not." "And do you <lb/>
            think that any who know what they ought to do, think that <lb/>
            they ought not to do it ?" “ I do not think so." " And do you <lb/>
            know any persons that do other things than those which they <lb/>
            think they ought to do ?" " I do not." “ Those, therefore, who <lb/>
            know what is agreeable to the laws in regard to men, do what <lb/>
            is just?" "Certainly." "And are not those who do what is <lb/>
            just, just men?" “Who else can be so?" "Shall we not <lb/>
            define rightly, therefore," concluded Socrates, “ if we define <lb/>
            those to be just who know what is agreeable to the laws in <lb/>
            regard to men ? ” “ It appears so to me,” said Euthydemus.</p>
          <p>7. “ And what shall we say that WISDOM is ? Tell me, <lb/>
            whether do men seem to you to be wise, in things which they <lb/>
            know, or in things which they do not know?" "In what <lb/>
            they know, certainly ; for how can a man be wise in things of <lb/>
            which he knows nothing ?" “ Those, then, who are wise, are <lb/>
            wise by their knowledge?" "By what else can a man be <lb/>
            wise, if not by his knowledge?" "Do you think wisdom, <lb/>
            then, to be anything else than that by which men are wise?' <pb n="499"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. 6.] </note> <lb/>
            “ I do not." " Is knowledge, then, wisdom ? " “ It ap­ <lb/>
            pears so to me." " Does it appear to you, however, that it is <lb/>
            possible for a man to know all things that are?" " No, by <lb/>
            Jupiter; not even, as I think, a comparatively small portion <lb/>
            of them ?" “ It is not therefore possible for a man to be wise <lb/>
            in all things?" "No, indeed." "Every man is wise, there­ <lb/>
            fore, in that only of which he has a knowledge ?" "So it <lb/>
            seems to me."</p>
          <p>8. "Shall we thus, too, Euthydemus," said he, "inquire <lb/>
            what is GOOD?" “ How?” said Euthydemus. "Does the <lb/>
            same thing appear to you to be beneficial to everybody?" <lb/>
            "No." "And does not that which is beneficial to one person <lb/>
            appear to you to be sometimes hurtful to another?" " As­ <lb/>
            suredly." “ Would you say, then, that anything is good that <lb/>
            is not beneficial?" "I would not." “What is beneficial, <lb/>
            therefore, is good, to whomsoever it is beneficial?" “ It ap­ <lb/>
            pears so to me," said Euthydemus.</p>
          <p>9. “ And can we define the BEAUTIFUL in any other way <lb/>
            than if you term whatever is beautiful, whether a person, or <lb/>
            a vase, or anything else whatsoever, beautiful for whatever <lb/>
            purpose you know that it is beautiful ?”1 "No, indeed," said <lb/>
            Euthydemus. " For whatever purpose, then, anything may <lb/>
            be useful, for that purpose it is beautiful to use it ?" " Cer­ <lb/>
            tainly." "And is anything beautiful for any other purpose <lb/>
            than that for which it is beautiful to use it ?" “ For no other <lb/>
            purpose," replied he. " What is useful is beautiful, therefore, <lb/>
            for that purpose for which it is beautiful?" "So I think," <lb/>
            said lie.</p>
          <p>10. "As to COURAGE, Euthydemus,” said Socrates, "do <lb/>
            you think it is to be numbered among excellent things?" <lb/>
            " I think it one of the most excellent," replied Euthydemus. <lb/>
            But you do not think courage a thing of use for small occa­ <lb/>
            sions." " No, by Jupiter, but for the very greatest." “ Does <lb/>
            it appear to you to be useful, with regard to formidable and <lb/>
            dangerous things, to be ignorant of their character?" "By <note type="footnote">I I have translated this apparently corrupt passage according to <lb/>

            no means." ‟ They, therefore, who do not fear such things, <lb/>
            because they do not know what they are, are not courage­ <lb/>
            ous ?" " Certainly not; for, in that case, many madmen and <lb/>
            even cowards would be courageous." “ And what do you say <lb/>
            of those who fear things that are not formidable?" "Still <lb/>
            less, by Jupiter, should they be called courageous." " Those, <lb/>
            then, that are good, with reference to formidable and danger­ <lb/>
            ous things, you consider to be courageous, and those that are <lb/>
            had, cowardly ?" "Certainly." 11. “ But do you think that <lb/>
            any other persons are good, with reference to terrible and <lb/>
            dangerous circumstances, except those who are able to conduct <lb/>
            themselves well under them?" "No, those only," said he. <lb/>
            " And you think those bad with regard to them, who are of <lb/>
            such a character as to conduct themselves badly under them ?" <lb/>
            “ Whom else can I think so?" "Do not each, then, conduct <lb/>
            themselves under them as they think they ought?" " How <lb/>
            can it be otherwise?” "Do those, therefore, who do not <lb/>
            conduct themselves properly under them, know how they <lb/>
            ought to conduct themselves under them?" "Doubtless not." <lb/>
            " Those then who know how they ought to conduct them­ <lb/>
            selves under them, can do so?" "And they alone." " Do <lb/>
            those, therefore, who do not fail under such circumstances, <lb/>
            conduct themselves badly under them?" "I think not." <lb/>
            " Those, then, who do conduct themselves badly under them, <lb/>
            do fail?" .. It seems so." “ Those, therefore, who know how <lb/>
            to conduct themselves well in terrible and dangerous circum­ <lb/>
            stances are courageous, and those who fail to do so are cow­ <lb/>

            of government, but conceived that they differed greatly from <lb/>

            sent, and in conformity with the laws of free states, he re­ <lb/>
            garded as a monarchy; but a government over men against <lb/>
            their will, and not according to the law of free states, but just <lb/>
            as the ruler pleased, a tyranny; and wherever magistrates <lb/>
            were appointed from among those who complied with the <lb/>
            injunctions of the laws, he considered the government to be an <lb/>
            aristocracy ; wherever they were appointed according to their <lb/>
            wealth, a plutocracy; and wherever they were appointed <lb/>

            who had nothing definite to say, and who perhaps asserted, <lb/>
            without proof, that some person, whom he mentioned, was <lb/>
            wiser, or better skilled in political affairs, or possessed of <lb/>
            greater courage, or worthier in some such respect, [than some <lb/>
            other whom Socrates had mentioned,] he would recall the <lb/>
            whole argument, in some such way as the following, to the <lb/>
            primary proposition: 14. “ Do you say that he whom you <lb/>
            commend, is a better citizen than he whom I commend?" "I <lb/>
            do say so." " Why should we not then consider, in the first <lb/>
            place, what is the duty of a good citizen ? " “ Let us do so." <lb/>
            " Would not he then be superior in the management of the <lb/>
            public money who should make the state richer?" "Un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly." " And he in war who should make it victorious <lb/>
            over its enemies?" " Assuredly.” " And in an embassy he <lb/>
            who should make friends of foes ?" “ Doubtless." “ And he in <lb/>
            addressing the people who should check dissension and inspire <lb/>
            them with unanimity?" "I think so." When the discussion <lb/>
            was thus brought back to fundamental principles, the truth <lb/>
            was made evident to those who had opposed him.</p>
          <p>15. When he himself went through any subject in argu­ <lb/>
            ment, he proceeded upon propositions of which the truth was <lb/>
            generally acknowledged, thinking that a sure foundation was <lb/>
            thus formed for his reasoning. Accordingly, whenever he <lb/>
            spoke, he, of all men that I have known, most readily pre­ <lb/>
            vailed on his hearers to assent to his arguments ; and he used <lb/>
            to say that Homer 1 had attributed to Ulysses the character of <lb/>
            a sure orator, as being able to form his reasoning on points <lb/>
            acknowledged by all mankind.</p>

          <p>How Socrates rendered his followers <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηχανικοὐς</foreign>, ingenious and adapted for <lb/>
            business; his frankness and sincerity, 1. How far he thought that Geo­ <lb/>

            shouldbe pursued, 4—7. Vain investigations to be avoided, 8. Regard <lb/>
            to be paid to health, 9. Counsel to be asked of the gods, 10.</p>
          <p>I. THAT Socrates expressed his sentiments with sincerity to <lb/>
            those who conversed with him, is, I think, manifest from what <lb/>
            I have said. I will now proceed to show how much it was his <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyss. viii. 171 : ‘O <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ ἁσφαλέως ἁγορεύει</foreign> : a passage noticed by <lb/>

            care that his followers should be competently qualified for em­ <lb/>
            ployments suited to their powers. Of all men that I have <lb/>
            known, he was the most anxious to discover in what occupa­ <lb/>
            tion each of those who attended him was likely to prove skilful; <lb/>
            and of all that it becomes a man of honour and virtue to <lb/>
            know, he taught them himself, whatever he knew, with the <lb/>
            utmost cheerfulness ; and what he had not sufficient know­ <lb/>
            ledge to teach, he took them to those who knew, to learn.</p>
          <p>2. He taught them also how far it was proper that a well­ <lb/>
            educated man should be versed in any department of know­ <lb/>
            ledge.1 Geometry, for instance, he said that a man should <lb/>
            study until he should be capable, if occasion required, to take <lb/>
            or give land correctly by measurement; or to divide it or por­ <lb/>
            tion it out for cultivation ;2 and this, he observed, it was so <lb/>
            easy to learn, that he who gave any attention at all to mensur­ <lb/>
            ation, might find how large the whole earth was, and perfectly <lb/>
            understand how it was measured. 3. But of pursuing the <lb/>
            study of geometry to diagrams hard to understand, he disap­ <lb/>
            proved ; for he said that he could not see of what profit they <lb/>
            were,3 though he himself was by no means unskilled in <lb/>
            them ; but he remarked that they were enough to consume a <lb/>
            man's whole life, and hinder him from attaining many other <lb/>
            valuable branches of knowledge.</p>
          <p>4. He recommended his followers to learn astronomy also, <lb/>
            but only so far as to be able to know the hour of the night, <lb/>
            the month, and the season of the year, with a view to travel­ <lb/>
            ling by land or sea, or distinguishing the night-watches ; and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρἀγματος</foreign>.] "Negotii ex doctrinâ et scientiâ pendentis." <lb/>

            astronomy, but disapproved of the general practice of the philoso­ <lb/>

            questions concerning the figure of the earth, &amp;c., to the entire neg­ <lb/>

            to be competent, by knowing the divisions of the above-men­ <lb/>
            tioned times, to profit by the signs for whatever other things <lb/>
            are done at a certain period of the night, or month, or year. <lb/>
            These particulars, he said, were easily learned from men who <lb/>
            hunted by night, from pilots, and from many others whose <lb/>
            business it was to know them. 5. But to continue the study of <lb/>
            astronomy so far as to distinguish the bodies which do not move <lb/>
            in the same circle with the heaven,1 the planets, and the irre­ <lb/>
            gular stars,2 and to weary ourselves in inquiring into their <lb/>
            distances from the earth, the periods of their revolutions, and <lb/>
            the causes of all these things, was what lie greatly discoun­ <lb/>
            tenanced ; for he saw, he said, no profit in these studies <lb/>
            either, 3 though he had himself given attention to them ; since <lb/>
            they also, lie remarked, were enough to wear ont the life of a <lb/>
            man, and prevent him from attending to many profitable <lb/>
            pursuits.</p>
          <p>6. Concerning celestial matters in general, he dissuaded <lb/>
            every man from becoming a speculator how the divine power <lb/>
            contrives to manage them ; for he did not think that such <lb/>
            points were discoverable by man, nor did lie believe that those <lb/>
            acted dutifully towards the gods who inquired into things <lb/>
            which they did not wish to make known. He observed, too, <lb/>
            that a man who was anxious about such investigations, was <lb/>
            in danger of losing his senses, not less than Anaxagoras, who <lb/>
            prided himself highly on eXplaining the plans of the gods, lost <lb/>
            his. 7. For Anaxagoras, when he said that fire and the sun <lb/>
            were of the same nature, did not reflect that people can easily <lb/>
            look upon fire, but cannot turn their gaze on the sun, and that <lb/>
            men, if exposed to the rays of the sun, have complexions of a <lb/>
            darker shade, but not if exposed to fire; he omitted to con­ <lb/>
            sider, too, that of the productions of the earth, none can come <lb/>
            fairly to maturity without the rays of the sun, while, if warmed <lb/>
            by the heat of fire, they all perish ; and when he said that the <lb/>
            sun was a heated stone, he forgot that a stone placed in the <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὰ μὴ ὲν τη̃ αὐτῃ̃ περιφορᾳ̃ὄντα</foreign>.] Edwards refers to Diog. Laert. <lb/>

          <p>8. He advised his followers also to learn computations,1 but <lb/>
            in these, as in other things, lie exhorted them to avoid useless <lb/>
            labour; as far as it was of any profit, he investigated every­ <lb/>
            thing himself, and went through it with his associates,</p>
          <p>9. He earnestly recommended those who conversed with <lb/>
            him to take care of their health, both by learning whatever <lb/>
            they could respecting it from men of experience, and by at­ <lb/>
            tending to it, each for himself, throughout his whole life, <lb/>
            studying what food or drink, or what exercise, was most <lb/>
            suitable for him, and how he might act in regard to them so <lb/>
            as to enjoy the best health; for he said it would be difficult <lb/>
            for a person who thus attended to himself to find a physician <lb/>
            that would tell better than himself what was conducive to his <lb/>
            health.</p>
          <p>10. But if any one desired to attain to what was beyond <lb/>
            human wisdom, he advised him to study divination ; for he <lb/>
            said that he who knew by what signs the gods give indications <lb/>
            to men respecting human affairs, would never fail of obtaining <lb/>
            counsel from the gods.</p>

            that he relinquished only the most burdensome part of life, <lb/>
            in which all feel their powers of intellect diminished, while, in­ <lb/>
            stead of enduring this, he acquired great glory by proving <lb/>
            the firmness of his mind, pleading his cause, above all men, <lb/>
            with the greatest regard to truth, ingenuousness, and justice, <lb/>
            and bearing his sentence at once with the utmost resignation <lb/>
            and the utmost fortitude.</p>
          <p>2. It is indeed acknowledged that no man, of all that are <lb/>
            remembered, ever endured death with greater glory ; for he <lb/>
            was obliged to live thirty days after his sentence, because the <lb/>
            Delian festival1 happened in that month, and the law allowed <lb/>
            no one to be publicly put to death until the sacred deputation <lb/>
            should return from Delos ; and during that time he was seen <lb/>
            by all his friends living in no other way than at any preceding <lb/>
            period; and, let it be observed, throughout all the former <lb/>
            part of his life he had been admired beyond all men for the <lb/>
            cheerfulness and tranquillity with which he lived. 3.2 How <lb/>
            could any one have died more nobly than thus? Or what <lb/>
            death could be more honourable than that which any man <lb/>
            might most honourably undergo ? Or what death could be <lb/>
            happier than the most honourable ? Or what death more ac­ <lb/>

          <p>4. I will also relate what I heard3 respecting him from <lb/>
            Hermogenes,4 the son of Ilipponicus, who said that after <lb/>
            Meletus had laid the accusation against him, he heard him <lb/>
            speaking on any subject rather than that of his trial, and re­ <lb/>
            marked to him that he ought to consider what defence he <lb/>
            should make, but that he said at first, " Do I not appear to <lb/>

            from what was unjust, which he conceived to be the best <lb/>

            "Do you not see, Socrates, that the judges at Athens have <lb/>
            already put to death many innocent persons, from being <lb/>
            otfended at their language, and have allowed many that were <lb/>

            ter to the divinity that I should now close my life? Do you <lb/>
            not know, that, down to the present time, I would not admit to <lb/>
            any man that he has lived either better or with more pleasure <lb/>
            than myself? for I consider that those live best who study <lb/>
            best to become as good as possible ; and that those live with <lb/>
            most pleasure who feel the most assurance that they are daily <lb/>
            growing better and better. 7. This assurance I have felt, tc <lb/>
            the present day, to he the case with respect to myself; and <lb/>
            associating with other men, and comparing myself with others <lb/>
            I have always retained this opinion respecting myself; and, <lb/>
            not only I, but my friends also, maintain a similar feeling <lb/>
            with regard to me, not because they love me, (for those whc <lb/>
            Cove others may be thus affected towards the objects of <lb/>
            their love,) but because they think that while they associated <lb/>
            with me they became greatly advanced in virtue. 8. If I shall <lb/>
            live a longer period, perhaps I shall be destined to sustain the <lb/>
            evils of old age, to find my sight and hearing weakened, to <lb/>
            feel my intellect impaired, to become less apt to learn, and <lb/>
            more forgetful, and, in fine, to grow inferior to others in all <lb/>
            those qualities in which I was once superior to them. If I <lb/>
            should be insensible to this deterioration, life would not be <lb/>
            worth retaining; and, if I should feel it, how could I live <lb/>
            otherwise than with less profit, and with less comfort ? 9. If <lb/>
            I am to die unjustly, my death will be a disgrace to those who <lb/>
            unjustly kill me; for if injustice is a disgrace, must it not be <lb/>
            a disgrace to do anything unjustly? But what disgrace will <lb/>
            it be to me, that others could not decide or act justly with re­ <lb/>
            gard to me? 16. Of the men who have lived before me, I <lb/>
            see that the estimation left among posterity with regard to <pb n="507"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. 8.] </note> <lb/>
            such as have done wrong, and such as have suffered wrong, <lb/>
            is by no means similar; and I know that I also, if I now die, <lb/>
            shall obtain from mankind far different consideration from that <lb/>
            which they will pay to those who take my life ; for I know <lb/>
            that they will always bear witness to me that I have never <lb/>
            wronged any man, or rendered any man less virtuous, but <lb/>
            that I have always endeavoured to make those better who con­ <lb/>
            versed with me." Such discourse he held with Hermogenes, <lb/>
            and with others.</p>
          <p>11. Of those who knew what sort of man Socrates was, such <lb/>
            as were lovers of virtue, continue to regret him above all <lb/>
            other men, even to the present day, as having contributed in <lb/>
            the highest degree to their advancement in goodness. To <lb/>
            me, being such as I have described him, so pious that he <lb/>
            did nothing without the sanction of the gods; so just, that <lb/>
            he wronged no man even in the most trifling affair, but was <lb/>
            of service, in the most important matters, to those who enjoyed <lb/>
            his society ; so temperate, that lie never preferred pleasure to <lb/>
            virtue; so wise, that he never erred in distinguishing better <lb/>
            from worse, needing no counsel from others, but being suffi­ <lb/>
            cient in himself to discriminate between them ; so able to ex­ <lb/>
            plain and settle such questions by argument; and so capable <lb/>
            of discerning the character of others, of confuting those who <lb/>
            were in error, and of exhorting them to virtue and honour, <lb/>
            he seemed to be such as the best and happiest of men would <lb/>
            be. But if any one disapproves of my opinion, let him <lb/>
            compare the conduct of others with that of Socrates, and <lb/>
            determine accordingly.</p><pb n="508"/>

          <p>ON the sense of the phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">άναπτυσσμν το ρας</foreign>, Anab. i. 10. 9. <lb/>
            I might have expressed myself in the note with more decision. The <lb/>
            meaning of the words is evidently similar to that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπτύσσοντας <lb/>
            την φάλαγγα</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπτυχϧείσης τη̄ς φάλαγγος</foreign>, Cyrop. vii. 5. 3 and <lb/>
            5, where those expressions are fully explained by the context. A <lb/>
            portion of the men were withdrawn from one or both wings of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάλαγξ</foreign>, or main body, and sent to the rear, making the line at once <lb/>
            shorter and deeper. Thus the Greeks acted with regard to their <lb/>
            wing; they either drew back the wing altogether, and formed it be­ <lb/>
            hind the main body, or drew back a portion of the men from the <lb/>
            extremity of the wing, and formed them behind the front ranks of <lb/>
            the wing, in order to make the wing itself deeper and more com­ <lb/>
            pact. I think the latter supposition, which confines <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπτὺσσειν</foreign> to <unclear/> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸ κέρας</foreign>, the more probable. The Greeks " pu' the river in their <lb/>
            rear " by wheeling round.</p>
          <p>Of Professor Maiden's translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρἀ τὸν φᾱσιν ποταμόν</foreign>, <lb/>
            "along the river Phasis," I was not aware, until I saw it mentioned <lb/>
            by Mr. Ainsworth in his Commentary, p. 226, or I should have <lb/>
            adopted it.</p>
          <p>If the student should observe that the negative <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔκουν</foreign>, in Kühner's <lb/>
            text of the Memorabilia, is, in some few passages, not translated <lb/>
