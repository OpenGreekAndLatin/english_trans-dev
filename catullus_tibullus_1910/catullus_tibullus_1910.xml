            <title type="sub">CATULLUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>A MEAGRE array of facts more or less controverted, and a few critical <lb/>
            remarks, are all we can offer towards a biography of Valerius Catullus. <lb/>
            We learn from the testimony of many ancient writers, that he was a na­ <lb/>
            tive of Verona or its immediate neighbourhood; and the Marquis Scipiu <lb/>
            Maffei, himself a Veronese, asserts that in his day there were still traits <lb/>
            of the language of Catullus in the dialect of his countrymen. Whether <lb/>
            the poet's prænomen was Caius or Quintus is uncertain, the former being <lb/>
            assigned to him by Apuleius, the latter by Pliny. A more important ques­ <lb/>
            tion is that which concerns the dates of his birth and death. According <lb/>
            to Hieronymus, in the Eusebian chronicle, he was born B. c. 87, and died <lb/>
            in his thirtieth year, B. C. 57. The second date is undoubtedly erroneous, <lb/>
            for we have positive evidence from his own works that he was alive in the <lb/>
            consulship of Vatinius, B. c. 47. It is evident too that he must have sur­ <lb/>
            vived at least till B. c. 45, for Cicero, in his Letters, talks of the verses of <lb/>
            Catullus against Cæsar and Mamurra (xxix.) as newly written, and first <lb/>
            seen by Cæsar in that year. The chronologer's mistake as to the time <lb/>
            of the poet's death, throws some doubt also on that which he assigns to <lb/>
            his birth. We shall however be exact enough for all literary purposes, if <lb/>
            we conclude with Dunlop that Catullus " was nearly contemporary with <lb/>
            Lucretius, having come into the world a few years after him, and having <lb/>
            survived him but a short period."</p>
          <p>It is not certain that the poet belonged to the patrician family of the <lb/>
            Valerii, but his father must have been a person of some consideration, for <lb/>
            he was the friend and habitual entertainer of Julius Cæsar. The son took <lb/>
            up his abode in Rome in the very spring of youth (LXVIII. 15) and plunged <lb/>
            without restraint into all the expensive pleasures of the best-that is to <lb/>
            say, the most debauched-society. This is sufficient to account for the <lb/>
            jocular complaints of poverty interspersed through his writings. It is <lb/>
            easy to conceive that one whose only business was to enjoy life in an age <lb/>
            and in a city of unbounded luxury, and who was a liberal purchaser of <lb/>
            such commodities as were dealt in by the worthy Silo (ciii.), should have <lb/>
            been often " hard up''. for cash; and that he should have had occasion for <lb/>
            frequent intercourse with lawyers and orators, such as Alphenus Varus <note type="footnote"> A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            Licinius Calvus, and M. Tullius Cicero. Yet his fortune was by no means <lb/>
            small, for he possessed a noble villa on the beautiful promontory of Sir­ <lb/>
            mio, another near Tibur, and he made a voyage from the Pontus in his <lb/>
            own yacht. To improve his pecuniary circumstances, he adopted the <lb/>
            usual Roman expedient for quickly filling a lank purse, and accompanied <lb/>
            Caius Memmius, the celebrated patron of Lucretius, to Bithynia, when <lb/>
            he was appointed Prætor of that province. But it is plain from his direct <lb/>
            testimony, as well as from the bitterness of his invectives against his chief, <lb/>
            that he derived little profit from that expedition.</p>
          <p>Catullus repeatedly deplores with every mark of heartfelt grief the loss <lb/>
            of a brother who died in the Troad. This event is generally supposed to <lb/>
            have happened whilst the poet was in Bithynia; but, as Professor Ramsay <lb/>
            has well remarked, " any evidence we possess leads to a different conclu­ <lb/>
            sion. When railing against the evil fortune which attended the journey <lb/>
            to the East, he makes no allusion to any such misfortune as this; we <lb/>
            find no notice of the event in the pieces written immediately before quit­ <lb/>
            ting Asia and immediately after his return to Italy; nor does the language <lb/>
            of those passages in which he gives vent to his sorrow, in any way con­ <lb/>
            firm the conjecture."</p>
          <p>Gifted with a fine person, a vigorous constitution, and rare genius, Ca­ <lb/>
            tullus was meant by nature for better things: it was the curse of his times <lb/>
            that made him an idler and a voluptuary : <lb/>
            O blame not the bard if he fly to the bowers <lb/>
            Where Pleasure sits carelessly smiling at Fame ; <lb/>
            He was born for much more, and in happier hours <lb/>
            His soul might have glowed with a holier flame.</p>
          <p>That he was not indifferent to public wrongs is proved by the vehe­ <lb/>
            mence with which he assailed Cæsar in the plenitude of his power. A <lb/>
            man of fine sensibility and delicate fancy, he was no less remarkable <lb/>
            for the strength and depth of his feelings. Regarded as indications of <lb/>
            character, his poems to Lesbia are unique in Roman literature for the <lb/>
            intensity and self-oblivion of the passion they portray. Some of theIr <lb/>
            breathe the delicious frenzy of desire; or the sweet sadness that evei <lb/>
            mingles with the best of joy, and is so like it that we scarce know <lb/>
            whether to call it pain or pleasure ; the rest are heavy with the grief for <lb/>
            which there is no cure, the anguish of a heart that dotes, yet more than <lb/>
            doubts; that cannot cease to love what it loathes and scorns.</p>
          <p>Clodia, as we learn from Apuleius, was the real name of Lesbia, " but <lb/>
            this bare fact"—we again quote Ramsay—"by no means entitles us to <lb/>
            jump to the conclusion at which many have arrived, that she was the <lb/>
            sister of the celebrated Clodius slain by Milo. Indeed the presumption <lb/>
            is strong against such an inference. The tribute of high-flown praise paid <lb/>
            to Cicero would have been but a bad recommendation to the favour of <lb/>
            one whom the orator makes the subject of scurrilous jests, and who is <lb/>
            said to have cherished against him all the vindictive animosity of a woman <lb/>
            first slighted, and then openly insulted." Of other women with whom <lb/>
            he may have amused himself, Catullus names only Hypsithilla and Aufi­ <lb/>
            lina, ladies of Verona; but the language in which he writes of them de­ <lb/>
            notes an intercourse in which the senses were vividly interested, the affec­ <lb/>
            tions not at all. Some of his poems are hideous from the traces of a <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            turpitude to which we cannot without a painful effort make even a passing <lb/>
            allusion. But so are portions of almost every Roman poet; and amidst <lb/>
            our natural disgust at these abominations, and at the filthy ribaldry of <lb/>
            many of the short pieces of Catullus, it is right to remember that these <lb/>
            things were the vices of the age rather than of the individual. " The <lb/>
            filth of Catullus seldom springs from a prurient imagination revelling in <lb/>
            voluptuous images ; it rather proceeds from habitual impurity of expres­ <lb/>
            sion, and probably gives a fair representation of the manners and con­ <lb/>
            versation of the gay society of Rome at that period."</p>
          <p>In the contents of a very small book, Catullus has given proof of ex­ <lb/>
            traordinary versatility, and consummate skill in the most dissimilar <lb/>
            moods of his art. His compass is a wide one, and he is master of all <lb/>
            within it. His peculiar characteristics are neatness, racy simplicity <lb/>
            graceful turns of thought, and exquisite happiness of expression. In <lb/>
            these qualities he has never been surpassed;andthey are apparent <lb/>
            alike in his most playful trifles, and when he ascends to the mountain­ <lb/>
            heights of passion and imagination. Of him it may be affirmed with ab­ <lb/>
            solute truth, that he adorned all he touched ; hence the appropriateness <lb/>
            of the epithet doctus which was bestowed upon him by his poetic brethren, <lb/>
            not, as many have supposed, because of his proficiency in Greek liter­ <lb/>
            ature, but because of his mastery in the art he professed. Doctus does <lb/>
            not always mean book-learned ; it is often used to signify skill in any art <lb/>
            -as in that of archery for instance, when Tibullus calls Cupid's hands <lb/>
            doctas, after they had learned the use of the bow. Doctus means " taught," <lb/>
            and as one who is well taught is accomplished in his speciality, the epithet <lb/>
            came naturally to bear that secondary signification. That the English <lb/>
            epithet "learned" is restricted to one particular kind of proficiency, <lb/>
            is merely the result of arbitrary custom. The wider import of the Latin <lb/>
            word is better expressed in such obsolete phrases as " cunning of fence," <lb/>
            " cunning in music, in mathematics," &amp;c. In this sense Horace applies <lb/>
            it to the great actor Roscius; and in this sense it was applied by courtesy <lb/>
            to poets in general, and distinctively and emphatically to Catullus.</p>
          <p>Horace unjustly assumes to himself (Epist. 19, lib. i.) the credit of <lb/>
            having been the first to enrich the literature of his country with imi­ <lb/>
            tations of the Greek lyric poets; Catullus had preceded him in that field, <lb/>
            and with the more essential advantage which genius possesses over talent. <lb/>
            " Catullus," says Dunlop. " translated many of the shorter and more <lb/>
            delicate pieces of the Greeks; an attempt which hitherto had been thought <lb/>
            impossible, though the broad humour of their comedies, the vehement <lb/>
            pathos of their tragedies, and the romantic interest of the Odyssey, had <lb/>
            stood the transformation. His stay in Bithynia, though little advantageous <lb/>
            to his fortune, rendered him better acquainted than he might otherwise <lb/>
            have been with the productions of Greece ; and he was therefore in a <lb/>
            great degree indebted to this expedition (on which he always appears to <lb/>
            have looked back with mortification and disappointment) for those felici­ <lb/>
            tous turns of expression, that grace, simplicity, and purity, which are the <lb/>
            characteristics of his poems, and of which hitherto Greece alone had af­ <lb/>
            forded models. Indeed in all his verses, whether elegiac or heroic, we <lb/>
            perceive his imitation of the Greeks, and it must be admitted that he has <lb/>
            drawn from them his choicest stores. His Hellenisms are frequent; his <lb/>
            Images, similes, metaphors, and addresses to himself, are all Greek ; and <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            even in the versification of his odes we see visible traces of their origin. <lb/>
            Nevertheless he was the inventor of a new species of Latin poetry ; and <lb/>
            as he was the first who used such variety of measures, and perhaps in­ <lb/>
            vented some that were new, he was amply entitled to call the poetical <lb/>
            volume which he presented to Cornelius Nepos Lepidum Novum Libellum. <lb/>
            The beautiful expressions, too, and idioms of the Greek language, which <lb/>
            he has so carefully selected, are woven with such art into the texture of <lb/>
            his composition, and so aptly figure the impassioned ideas of his amorous <lb/>
            muse, that they have all the fresh and untarnished hues of originality." <lb/>
            It is certain that some, and probable that many, of the poems of Catul­ <lb/>
            lus have perished. Pliny makes mention of verses upon love-charms of <lb/>
            which no trace remains, and Terentianus Maurus mentions some Ithy­ <lb/>
            phallica. The scholiasts Servius and Nonius refer to passages which are <lb/>
            not to be found in the existing collection of the works of Catullus. On <lb/>
            the other hand, the Ciris and the Pervigilium Veneris have been errone­ <lb/>
            ously ascribed to him. We should have lost him wholly but for the for­ <lb/>
            tuitous discovery of a single manuscript in bad condition, which was found <lb/>
            in France in the year 1425. From this source were derived all the MSS. <lb/>
            on which the old editions were founded, and hence, as might be expected, <lb/>
            the text is very corrupt, and presents a greater number of various and <lb/>
            contradictory readings than that of almost any other classic. It is cer­ <lb/>
            tain too that it has been repeatedly interpolated.</p>
          <p>The present prose translation of Catullus, the first, we believe, that has <lb/>
            appeared in English, has been framed upon the principle of adhering as <lb/>
            closely to the letter of the original as is consistent with the genius of the <lb/>
            respective languages. For a faithful rendering of the letter, prose is the <lb/>
            best medium; but there its powers end ; for all beyond we must have <lb/>
            recourse to verse. The poetical versions that follow have been carefully <lb/>
            selected from many writers, and comprise all the best specimens of their <lb/>
            kind that have yet been published.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">TIBULLUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>ALBIUS TIBULLUS (his prænomen is unknown) was a Roman knight, <lb/>
            contemporary with Horace and Virgil. The date of his birth is uncertain, <lb/>
            but must be placed somewhere about B. C. 59, the year in which Livy <lb/>
            came into the world. A spurious distich in the fifth Elegy of book iii. <lb/>
            was long accepted as proof that Tibullus was born in the same year as <lb/>
            Ovid, who, on the contrary, invariably speaks of him as a more ancient <lb/>
            writer and an older man than himself, and particularly in a passage of the <lb/>
            Tristia, (IV. x.,) in which he fixes the order of succession of the Elegiac <lb/>
            poets :- <lb/>
            Virgil I but beheld ; and greedy fate <lb/>
            Denied Tibullus' friendship, wish'd too late : <lb/>
            He followed Gallus, next Propertius came ; <lb/>
            The last was I, the fourth successive name. ELTON.</p><pb n="5"/>
            
          <p>It appears from an epigram of Domitius Marsus, another contempt rary <lb/>
            of Tibullus, that he died soon after Virgil, that is to say, in or about B. a <lb/>
            19, while he was yet in the prime of life, or, as the epigram says, while <unclear>lv</unclear> <lb/>
            was still juvenis, for by that term the Romans meant one who had no­ <lb/>
            passed his forty-sixth year.</p>
          <p>Te quoque, Virgilio comitem, non æqua, Tibulle, <lb/>
            Mors juvenem campos misit ad Elysios : <lb/>
            Ne foret, aut elegis molles qui fleret amores, <lb/>
            Aut caneret forti regia bella pede. <lb/>
            Thee, young Tibullus, to th' Elysian plain <lb/>
            Death bade accompany great Maro's shade ; <lb/>
            Determined that no poet should remain, <lb/>
            Or to sing wars, or weep the cruel maid. GRAINGER.</p>
          <p>Tibullus was descended from an ancient and wealthy equestrian family; <lb/>
            but we learn from himself that he possessed only a small portion of the <lb/>
            estates of his forefathers. The cause of this decline of fortune has been <lb/>
            warmly debated among the learned ; some alleging, rightly, as it seems to <lb/>
            us, that we need not look further for it than to the confiscations of the tri­ <lb/>
            umviri, in which so many Italian estates were involved; others, that he was <lb/>
            ruined by his own extravagance. The father of Tibullus had been en­ <lb/>
            gaged on the side of Pompey in the civil wars, and died soon after Cæsar <lb/>
            had finally triumphed over the liberties of Rome. It is not to be doubted <lb/>
            that the patrimony of the son should have been involved in the subsequent <lb/>
            partition of the lands of Italy ; and though he saved something from the <lb/>
            wreck, probably through the interest of his patron, Messala, we do not <lb/>
            find in his Elegies a single expression of gratitude or compliment from <lb/>
            which it might be conjectured that Augustus had atoned to him for the <lb/>
            wrongs done by Octavius. It is certainly remarkable, in reference to this <lb/>
            question, and it raises our respect for the man, that the name of Augustus, <lb/>
            celebrated with such persevering and fulsome adulation by the other great <lb/>
            poets of the day, is nowhere to be found in the writings of Tibullus. The <lb/>
            notion that he wasted his large fortune in dissipation is little more than a <lb/>
            gratuitous assumption, the only evidence offered in support of it being a <lb/>
            poetical hyperbole. In the fourth Elegy of the second book he declares <lb/>
            himself ready to sacrifice all that was left of his hereditary possessions to <lb/>
            gratify the demands of his covetous mistress : whence some would have <lb/>
            us infer, that the man who could deliberately talk thus, in a good hex­ <lb/>
            ameter and pentameter distich, must certainly have made ducks and drakes <lb/>
            of his property. We rather think that the general tenour of his writings, <lb/>
            as well as the direct testimony of his friend Horace, leads to the opposite <lb/>
            conclusion. That discreet Epicurean would not have complimented a <lb/>
            reckless spendthrift on his knowledge of the art of enjoyment.</p>
          <p>Tibullus acquired at an early period the friendship of his great patron, <lb/>
            Messala, and retained it to the end of his life. He declined that com­ <lb/>
            mander's invitation to accompany him in th3 naval war which was des­ <lb/>
            tined to close with the decisive battle of Actium, doubtless because he <lb/>
            remained stedfast in his attachment to the cause for which his father had <lb/>
            Buffered. Immediately after that victory, Messala was detached by Cæsar <lb/>
            to suppress a formidable insurrection which had broker, out in Aquitaine ; <lb/>
            and Tibullus accompanied him in the honourable post of contubernalis <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            corresponding nearly to that of aid-de-camp. Part of the glory of the <lb/>
            Aquitanian campaign, for which Messala, four years later, obtained a tri­ <lb/>
            umph, and which Tibullus celebrates in language of unwonted loftiness, <lb/>
            redounds, according to the poet, to his own fame (book I. vii. 9—11). <lb/>
            In the following year, (B. c. 30,) Messala was sent to Asia, and again <lb/>
            Tibullus went with him, but was taken ill and obliged to remain in Cor­ <lb/>
            cyra, an incident which forms the theme of another beautiful poem <lb/>
            (book I. iii.).</p>
          <p>After his recovery he seems to have returned home, and to have spent <lb/>
            the rest of his days, excepting occasional visits to the capital, at his coun­ <lb/>
            try seat near Pedum, a small town of Latium on the skirts of the Apen­ <lb/>
            nines, between Præmeste and Tibur. That he lived there in the enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of a liberal competence is clear enough, and also that when he speaks <lb/>
            of his poverty, that term is only to be understood by contrast with the <lb/>
            overgrown fortunes of many of his noble countrymen. This is apparent <lb/>
            from many of his own expressions (e. g. book I. i. 5) ; as a Roman knight <lb/>
            he must have been worth upwards of three thousand pounds; and Horace <lb/>
            even speaks of him as wealthy. According to him, Tibullus possessed all <lb/>
            the blessings of life : he was beautiful in person (Horace on this point <lb/>
            confirms the strong language of the old biographers); he had a competent <lb/>
            fortune, favour with the great, fame, health ; and knew how to enjoy all <lb/>
            those blessings. Epist. iv. book i.</p>
          <p>Albius ! the candid critic of my strains, <lb/>
            What shall I say thou dost on Pedum's plains ? <lb/>
            Say, dost thou verses write that shall outvie <lb/>
            Cassius of Parma's darling poesy ? <lb/>
            Dost thou steal silent through some healthful wood, <lb/>
            And muse thoughts worthy of the wise and good ? <lb/>
            Thou wert not born a body void of mind ; <lb/>
            Yet heaven to thee a graceful form assigned. <lb/>
            Heaven gave thee riches, and it gave thee more, <lb/>
            The art to use and to enjoy thy store. <lb/>
            What beyond this could some fond nurse devise <lb/>
            To bless her foster-son ? whose thoughts are wise, <lb/>
            And graced with fluent speech ; whom favours crown <lb/>
            From the high great, and, from his muse, renown ; <lb/>
            Abundant health ; a style of life and board <lb/>
            Genteel with decency, and purse well stored. ELTON.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding all his personal and mental graces, and his singularly <lb/>
            Amiable disposition, Tibullus was not happy in love. The object of that <lb/>
            attachment, which we have Ovid's authority for considering as his first, is <lb/>
            celebrated under the poetic name of Delia, a Greek equivalent for ber real <lb/>
            name, which Apuleius tells us was Plania. It is evident (see book I. vi.) <lb/>
            that she was not of gentle blood (not ingenua, but libertinæ conditionis). <lb/>
            She belonged, says Milman, " to that class of females of the middle order, <lb/>
            not of good family, but above poverty, which answered to the Greek <lb/>
            hetairai." Tibullus became attached to her before his expedition tu <lb/>
            Aquitame, and thought of retiring to the country with her as his mistress. <lb/>
            But Delia was faithless during his absence. On <unclear>us</unclear> return from Corcyra <lb/>
            he found her ill, and attended her with affectionate solicitude, agai n hoping <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            to rea. ze his favourite project. But first a richer rival supplanted him ; <lb/>
            next there appears a husband in the way; and after the seventh Elegy oi <lb/>
            the first book we hear IN more of Delia. His last love was the mercen­ <lb/>
            ary Nemesis, tv whom the second book and the last two years of the <lb/>
            poet's life were devoted, apparently without any return. The third book <lb/>
            -if this indeed is the composition of Tibullus—is chiefly occupied with <lb/>
            his unfortunate passion for Neæra. Her, it would appear, he wished to <lb/>
            marry, he had indeed been actually betrothed to her, but she forsook <lb/>
            him on the eve of the nuptials. Lastly, there was Glycera, who gave him <lb/>
            great pain by forsaking him for a younger man, and whom wc have no <lb/>
            reason for confounding with any of the other three, though she is not <lb/>
            known to us from his own writings, but only from the Ode in which <lb/>
            Horace attempts to console him for her inconstancy.</p>
          <p>Tibullus belongs eminently to that class of poets whose works reflect <lb/>
            the form and colour of their own history. His lot fell upon the evil days <lb/>
            of his country, in which the remnant of its virtues perished with its rights. <lb/>
            A long series of civil wars and proscriptions had produced that general <lb/>
            dissoluteness of manners which invariably attends uncertainty of life and <lb/>
            property; Eastern conquests had filled Rome with the accumulated wealth, <lb/>
            and polluted her with the vices, of enslaved nations. Had her freedom <lb/>
            survived, the old Roman spirit might yet have rallied ; but the one died <lb/>
            out when the other was crushed under the despotism of Augustus. The <lb/>
            empire grew in might and majesty ; but its men and women became daily <lb/>
            viler; and the refinement gained by imitation of foreign examples, though <lb/>
            in itself a good thing, was a poor exchange for the honour and honesty of <lb/>
            the rough old republican days; for the racy freshness of home-grown <lb/>
            habits, thoughts, feelings, and affections ; for every native grace of life, <lb/>
            lost for ever. Imagine a man like Tibullus cast upon such times as those, <lb/>
            —a man of instinctive elegance of mind, of extreme sensibility and warm <lb/>
            affections, more given to contemplation than to action,-and you may go <lb/>
            near to anticipate much of the general tone of those effusions in which <lb/>
            his inward nature spontaneously reveals itself. Add to this, that he was <lb/>
            unhappy in love-how could he have been otherwise ?—less prosperous in <lb/>
            fortune than in early youth he had reason to expect, a member of a de­ <lb/>
            feated party, and faithful to the memory of a ruined cause ; and we shall <lb/>
            more clearly discern the sources of that tender melancholy which is his <lb/>
            habitual mood, and of those changeful and often impulsive emotions that <lb/>
            break its even flow, but always subside into it and leave it as before. III <lb/>
            at ef.se among the realities of the life that surrounded him, he flew to na­ <lb/>
            ture, the perpetual nurse of wounded spirits, and animating his solitude <lb/>
            with the traditions of the past, he lived in an ideal world. A relish for <lb/>
            the delights of the country was a national characteristic of the Romans; <lb/>
            in him it had the force of a passion. Hence all those exquisite pictures <lb/>
            of rural scenes and habits, which so strongly impress us with the idea of <lb/>
            the poet's kindly nature.</p>
          <p>The Latinelegylike the Greek epigram or inscription, had a latitude <lb/>
            beyond its title. Practically the name implies nothing more definite thai <lb/>
            a poem not, exceeding a certain length, and written in alternate hexa­ <lb/>
            meter and pentameter lines. Of that species which turns on love, Tibul­ <lb/>
            lus is confessedly the master. He is also the most original Latin poet ef <lb/>
            the A ucustan age, by which we do not mean that he is distinguished for <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            extraordinary powers of invention, but that he owed nothing to Greek <lb/>
            models. His subjects, method, diction, and tone, are all his own. His <lb/>
            thoughts are natural; he abounds with delicate strokes of sentiment and <lb/>
            expression ; his language is pure from conceit, and his stylethough highly <lb/>
            finished, has a perfectly easy and flowing simplicity. His range, however, <lb/>
            as may be supposed from what we have already said, is riot a wide one ; <lb/>
            and it must be admitted that he recurs to one set of themes and imagery <lb/>
            with something of a monotonous frequency. But this defect belongs only <lb/>
            to his elegies taken collectively. Separately, considered, each piece is re­ <lb/>
            markable for the copious variety of its thoughts and images, as well as for <lb/>
            the subtlety of the links by which it is made to cohere in the smoothest <lb/>
            and most unconstrained manner.</p>
          <p>The poems which bear the name of Tibullus are comprised in four bocks. <lb/>
            The authenticity of the filst two has never been questioned ; but a con­ <lb/>
            troversy was raised by 1. H. Voss, towards the close of the last century, <lb/>
            respecting the authorship of the third book, which is addressed to Neæra, <lb/>
            nominally by one Lygdamus. Who was he ? According to the common <lb/>
            opinion, he was either a fictitious personage, or, much more probably, Ti­ <lb/>
            bullus himself under an assumed name. Voss however contended that <lb/>
            Lygdamus, or whoever wrote under that name, was not Tibullus, but an­ <lb/>
            other and very inferior poet. This opinion found some adherents in Ger­ <lb/>
            many ; but Milman, so far as we are aware, is the only scholar of note by <lb/>
            whom it has been adopted in this country.' Bach, who at one time in­ <lb/>
            clined to the Vossian theory, has pronounced what we think a sounder <lb/>
            critical opinion in his edition of 1819. He says it appears that Tibullus <lb/>
            addressed the book in question to Neæra when he was very young, and <lb/>
            that this circumstance sufficiently explains the faults here and there ob­ <lb/>
            servable in a work which bears strong marks of resemblance to the manner <lb/>
            of Tibullus, and is on the whole not unworthy of his genius. As for the <lb/>
            fourth book, we see no reason to dissent from the judgment pronounced <lb/>
            upon it by Milman, in common with many of the best critics. " The hex­ <lb/>
            ameter poem on Messala," he says, " which opens the fourth book, is so <lb/>
            bad, that although a successful Elegiac poet may have failed when he at­ <lb/>
            tempted Epic verse, it cannot well be ascribed to a writer of the exquisite <lb/>
            taste of Tibullus. The smaller Elegies of the fourth book have all the <lb/>
            inimitable grace and simplicity of Tibullus. With the exception of the <lb/>
            thirteenth, (of which some lines are hardly surpassed by Tibullus himself,) <lb/>
            these poems relate to the love of Sulpicia, a woman of noble birth, for <lb/>
            Cerinthus, the real or fictitious name of a beautiful youth. Sulpicia <lb/>
            seems to have belonged to the intimate society of Messala (El. iv. 8). <lb/>
            Nor is there any improbability in supposing that Tibullus may have writ­ <lb/>
            ten Elegies in the name or by the desire of Sulpicia. If Sulpicia was her­ <lb/>
            self the poetess, she approached nearer to Tibullus than any other writer <lb/>
            of Elegies." <note type="footnote"> 1 Smith'a Diet. of Greek and Horn. Biog. art. Tibullus. </note> <pb n="9"/>

            is spurious, as Handius argues; nor is it likely that Catullus would <lb/>

            sport, as a solace, I believe, for the grief of absence, that the <lb/>
            painful smarting of her bosom may be still : to be able to <lb/>

            would like to devour the bird : <lb/>

            Tarn bellum sibi passerem Catulli <lb/>
            Intra viscera habere coucupiscit. <lb/>
            " I agree with Sannazarius," says Noel. "Take this piece in its natural <lb/>
            and obvious sense, and it is a model of grace and good taste : adopt the <lb/>
            licentious allegory, and nothing can be more forced and frigid." Martial, <lb/>
            the professed imitator of Catullus, and for that very reason to be dis­ <lb/>
            trusted as his interpreter, set the first example of this perverse refinement <lb/>
            oil the simple meaning of the poem. "Kiss me," he says, "and then <lb/>
            Donabo tibi passerem Catulli, I will give you Catullus's sparrow,"—by <lb/>
            which he does not mean a poem. Again, in the Apophoreta there is the <lb/>
            following passage about putting a bird in a cage. <lb/>
            Si tibi tans erit, qualem dilecta Catullo <lb/>
            Lesbia ploravit, hîc hahitare potest. <lb/>
            " If you have such a sparrow as Catullus's Lesbia deplored, it may lodge <lb/>
            here." Chaulieu has an epigram to the same purport <lb/>
            Autant et plus que sa vie <lb/>
            Phyllis aime un passereau; <lb/>
            Ainsi la jenne Lesbie <lb/>

            the swiftest of vessels, and never failed to outstrip the speed <lb/>
            of any craft that swam, whether the course was to be run <lb/>

            by Ovid, in his elegy on the death of a parrot, and by Stella, Martial's <lb/>

            what was the state of things there, and how much money had <lb/>
            I made in it. I answered as was the fact, that neither my­ <lb/>

            any one of us should show a better scented head3 on his return, <lb/>

            severe a test as though he asked them to accompany him upon one of <lb/>
            those formidable journeys he has enumerated. This explanation justifies the <lb/>
            geographical exordium, which would otherwise seem cold and out of place. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Marrucinus Asinius.] Whether Marrucinus is a name or an epithet, <lb/>
            and if the latter, what is to be understood by it, are questions much dis­ <lb/>
            puted. The Marrucini were a people of Campania, situate between the <lb/>
            Vestini and the Peligini : their chief town was Teate, now Chieti. They <lb/>
            were distinguished for their fidelity to the Romans; therefore Vulpius <lb/>
            and Doering suppose the epithet Marrucinian is meant to reproach <lb/>
            Asinius with his degeneracy from the high character of his countrymen. <lb/>
            Scaliger says, the Marrucini stood in equal repute with Bœotians for <lb/>
            stupidity, and accuses Avantius of proposing to read " Inter cœnam,” in­ <lb/>
            stead of " Marrucine," merely because he was himself a Marrucinian by <lb/>
            birth, and wished to destroy the record of the hebetude of his countrymen. <lb/>
            Many conceive that Asinius is merely styled of the country he belonged to, <lb/>
            without any reproach implied. Lastly, Marrucinus may be a proper name. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Left hand.] Thievish hand is implied. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Pollio.] Supposed to be Asillius Pollio, the poet, orator, and states­ <lb/>

            detestable words are used here only as coarse forms of threatening, with <lb/>

            expressed in the words, " the poet who is true to his vocation.” In Poem <lb/>
            xiv. the epithet impiorum is applied to bad poets. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 To be chaste, &amp;c.] Ovid has a distich to the same effect: <lb/>
            Crede mihi, distant mores a carmine nostri; <lb/>
            Vita verecunda est, musa jocosa mihi. <lb/>
            " Believe me there is a wide difference between my morals and my song; <lb/>
            my life is decorous, my muse is wanton." And Martial says: <lb/>
            Lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba est. <lb/>
            Which is thus translated by Maynard: <lb/>
            Si ma plume est une putain, <lb/>
            Ma vie est une sainte. <lb/>
            Pliny quotes this poem of Catullus to excuse the wantonness of his <lb/>
            own verses, which he is sending to his friend Paternus; and Apuleius <lb/>
            cites the passage in his Apology for the same purpose. " Whoever," says <lb/>
            Lambe, " would see the subject fully discussed, should turn to the Essay <lb/>
            on the Literary Character by Mr. Disraeli."' He enumerates as instances <lb/>
            of free writers who have led pure lives, La Motte le Vayer, Bayle, La <lb/>
            Fontaine, Smollet, and Cowley. ' The imagination,' he adds, 'may be a <lb/>
            volcano, while the heart is an Alp of ice.' It would, however, be diffi. <lb/>
            cult to enlarge this list, while on the other hand the catalogue of those <lb/>
            who really practised the licentiousness they celebrated, would be very <lb/>
            numerous. One period alone, the reign of Charles the Second, would <lb/>
            furnish more than enough to outnumber the above small phalanx of <lb/>
            purity. Muretus, whose poems clearly gave him every right to know. <lb/>
            ledge on the subject, but whose known debauchery would certainly have <lb/>
            forbidden any credit to accrue to himself from establishing the general <lb/>
            purity of lascivious poets, at once rejects the probability of such a con. <lb/>
            trast, saying: <lb/>

            the very thing to give them zest and charm, is that they be a <lb/>

            I do not say in beardless boys, but in the hardened fibres of <lb/>

            my truculent iambics,4 she would give the choicest productions <note type="footnote"> Myrionoma," a goddess of ten thousand names. Callimachus, in a hymn <lb/>
            to Diana, represents her as asking Jove for perpetual chastity and many <lb/>
            names; attributes which seem rather discordant to us, who are not <lb/>
            taught to esteem an alias as connected with any virtue. However, <lb/>
            she thought the distinction of value, for she preserved it more care­ <lb/>

            desses, the only one of quite unimpeached chastity, except the Furies. <lb/>
            This passage, begging Diana to choose the name she liked, was to avoid <lb/>

            It has been necessary greatly to mitigate the obscene ribaldry of this <lb/>

            " If I not love thee, Villiers, more <lb/>

          <p>But Acme gently bending back her head, and kissing the <lb/>
            love-drunken eyes of her sweet boy with that rosy mouth of <lb/>
            hers, said, “My own life, Septimillus, let us ever serve this <lb/>

            flutters the heart in my breast; for when I see thee, no voice comes from <lb/>

            overspreads me ; trembling seizes me all over; I am greener than grass, <lb/>
            and breathless, I seem all but dead." </note><note type="footnote"> The reader will perceive that Catullus has not translated Sappho's <lb/>
            last stanza, but has substituted for it (or some one else has done so) <lb/>
            one of a very common-place and inapposite character. It is scarcely <lb/>
            credible indeed that Catullus can have written such a piece of bathos at <lb/>
            all; it is more probably the patchwork of some stupid and conceited <lb/>
            pedant. Three attempts have been made to supply the missing stanza. <lb/>

            Insidens pallor, moriens nec auras <lb/>
            Ducere possum. <lb/>
            Another is by Jans Van der Does or Douza : <lb/>
            Frigidus sudor fluit; horror artus <lb/>
            Pallidos herbâ magis it per omnes, <lb/>
            Et pati mortem videor morans in <lb/>
            Limine mortis. <lb/>
            The third is by Henry Stephens : <lb/>
            Manat et sudor gelidus, tremorque <lb/>
            Occupat totam ; velut herba pallent <lb/>
            Ora; sperandi neque compos, orco <lb/>

            through my limbs ; my ears ring with their own sound ; both <lb/>

          <p>Ease is baneful to thee, Catullus; thou revellest and de­ <lb/>

            proposes salopygium, a “wagtail;” several editors have salaputium, an <lb/>

            of the prevalence and extent of Roman vices, than any other passage in <lb/>
            the Latin classics. Martial, and Catullus himself elsewhere, have branded <lb/>
            their enemies; and Juvenal, in bursts of satiric indignation, has re­ <lb/>
            proached his countrymen with the blackest crimes. But here in a com­ <lb/>
            plimentary poem to a patron and intimate friend, these are jocularly <lb/>
            alluded to as the venial indulgence of his earliest youth." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Over the threshold.] The bride entering her husband's house was <lb/>
            lifted over the threshold, that she might not touch it. Various reasons <lb/>
            have been assigned for this, among others, that the threshold was sacred <lb/>
            to Vesta, the goddess of chastity, who might be offended at the nuptials; <lb/>
            or that the bride should avoid touching any spell which some jealous <lb/>
            rival might have secretly laid there. Perhaps the true reason is less <lb/>
            recondite. Cicero speaks of the offensio pedis, (striking the threshold with <lb/>
            the foot,) generally as an ill omen; and Ovid and Tibullus both mention <lb/>
            it as to be avoided at the outset of any undertaking. Shakspeare, Henry <lb/>
            VI., part 3, makes Gloucester say, on finding the gates of York closed <lb/>
            against him and Edward IV,, <lb/>
            " The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this; <lb/>
            For many men, that stumble at the threshold, <lb/>

            conjecture. The " yellow poppy," luteum papaver, suggests to the <lb/>
            English reader an unfortunate image which was certainly not contem­ <lb/>
            plated by Catullus. According to Parthenias, the poet's meaning is, that <lb/>
            the fair complexion of the bride looks as beautiful through her yellow <lb/>
            marriage veil, as the white blossom of the parthenice does beside the <lb/>
            yellow poppy. Dr. Nott thinks this interpretation ingenious, but un­ <lb/>
            sound, for, he says, "When the bride is in bed (uxor in thalamo est) we <lb/>
            must suppose the flammeum or veil thrown aside: there is then no apt­ <lb/>
            ness in the comparison, which evidently relates to her blooming counten­ <lb/>
            ance (os floridulum): I should rather think luteus was meant to express <lb/>
            a colour bordering on red. We are very ignorant of the true meaning of <lb/>
            Latin words that have a reference to colours." Admitted : but luteus is <lb/>
            one of the least ambiguous words of its class, and is decidedly more sug­ <lb/>
            gestive of jaundice than of the roseate hue of youthful beauty. And <lb/>
            why must we suppose that the act of removing the bride's veil was not a <lb/>
            pleasure and a privilege reserved for the bridegroom himself, as is the <lb/>
            custom among some oriental nations to this day ? In the celebrated <lb/>
            Aldobrandini fresco-painting, found in the baths of Titus, the bride is <lb/>
            seated veiled on a bed, with the pronuba or bridesmatron near her, whilst <lb/>
            the bridegroom sits at the foot of the bed. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>

            mean, " the tympanum which serves in lieu of a trumpet in the mys­ <lb/>

            leading facts connected with the story of Theseus and Ariadne. The <lb/>
            Athenians having joined in the murder of Androgeus, son of Minos, king <lb/>
            of Crete, the latter made war on them, and compelled them to send every <lb/>
            year to Crete seven youths and as many virgins to be devoured by the <lb/>
            Minotaur. This monster was the fruit of an unnatural passion which <lb/>
            Pasiphaë, the daughter of the Sun, and the wife of Minos, had conceived <lb/>
            for a bull. Daedalus, who had lent his mechanical skill to the fulfilment <lb/>
            of the queen's desires, built the famous labyrinth to conceal her half­ <lb/>
            human, half-brute offspring. Theseus, son of Ægeus, king of Athens, <lb/>
            slew the monster, and made his way out of the labyrinth by means of a <lb/>
            clue supplied to him by Ariadne, one of the two daughters of Minos and <lb/>
            Pasiphaë. Theseus then departed for his home, taking with him Ariadne, <lb/>
            who was accompanied by her sister Phaedra ; but he deserted the former <lb/>
            at Naxos, and took the latter to Athens as his bride. Catullus, however, <lb/>
            omits this part of the story, and says expressly that Ariadne left her sister <lb/>
            behind when she fled from Crete. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Swift ship.] Classis must here stand for a single ship, for a fleet was <lb/>

            her body, and scattered at her feet. But thinking neither of <lb/>
            fillet, nor of floating veil, lost and undone, she was intent on <lb/>
            thee, Theseus, with her whole heart, and soul, and mind. <lb/>
            Ah wretched Ariadne, whom Venus doomed to distracting <lb/>
            sorrows,1 implanting thorny cares in thy bosom, what time <lb/>
            cruel Theseus, issuing from the curved shores of the Piræus,2 <lb/>
            reached the Gortynian3 abode of the unjust king.</p>
          <p>For ancient legends tell that, compelled by a dire pestilence <lb/>
            to atone for the murder of Androgeos, the Cecropian city4 <lb/>
            was wont to present choice youths and fairest virgins as food <lb/>
            for the Minotaur. Seeing that the little city was thus afflicted, <lb/>
            Theseus desired to sacrifice his own body for his dear Athens, <lb/>
            rather than that such unfuneralled funerals5 of Athens should <lb/>
            be carried to Crete. Borne therefore in a fleet ship by <lb/>
            gentle winds, he came to the arrogant6 Minos and his superb <lb/>
            abode. There as soon as the royal virgin beheld him with <lb/>
            desiring eye, she whom the chaste bed, breathing sweet <lb/>
            odours, cherished in her mother's soft embrace, lovely as the­ <lb/>
            myrtles which the waters of Eurotas7 rear, or the various- <lb/>
            coloured flowers which the breath of spring brings forth; <lb/>
            she did not take her glistening eyes off him until her whole <lb/>
            bosom was thoroughly on fire, and she burned to her inmost <lb/>
            marrow. Alas ! divine boy, who confoundest together human <lb/>
            joys and sorrows, with ruthless heart exciting wretched mor­ <lb/>

            says, " is not mentioned merely as the goddess of love, as seems to have <lb/>
            been conceived by most commentators. Pasiphaë, Ariadne's mother, was <lb/>
            the daughter of the Sun and Perseis, one of the Oceanides; and Venus <lb/>
            persecuted all the descendants of Apollo, because that god discovered her <lb/>
            amour with Mars. This is finely alluded to in tl e Phèdre of Racine: </note> <lb/>

            often sighing for the yellow-haired stranger ! What fears she <lb/>
            endured in her fainting heart! How often did she grow wan­ <lb/>
            ner than the sheen of gold ! When Theseus, eager to contend <lb/>
            with the dread monster, was about to encounter death or the <lb/>
            glory of victory, then did she timidly frame vows with silent, <lb/>
            lip 1 promising gifts to the gods, gifts not unacceptable to them, <lb/>
            but offered unprofitably for herself. For as an irresistible <lb/>
            whirlwind tears up an oak that shakes its branches on the <lb/>
            summit of Taurus, or a cone-bearing pine with oozing stem, <lb/>
            twisting the trunk with its. blast; uprooted it falls prone, <lb/>
            covering a wide space, and breaking all beneath it far and <lb/>
            near; so Theseus prostrated the carcase of the vanquished <lb/>
            monster, vainly tossing its horns to the empty air. Thence <lb/>
            he returned safely with great renown, directing his wander­ <lb/>
            ing steps by a slender thread, that the indistinguishable maze <lb/>
            might not baffle his attempt to issue from its labyrinthine <lb/>
            windings.</p>
          <p>But why, digressing from my first subject, need I tell more ? <lb/>
            How the daughter, forsaking her father's face, forsaking the <lb/>
            embrace of her sister, and even of her mother, who wept in <lb/>
            despair for her child, gladly preferred the sweet love of Theseus <lb/>
            to them all ? Or how their ship was borne to the foamy shores <lb/>
            of Dia ? Or how her husband, departing with ungrateful <lb/>
            breast, left her with her eyes closed in calamitous sleep ? Often, <lb/>
            'tis said, with a heart on fire with rage, she sent out shrill <lb/>
            shrieks in gushes2 from the bottom of her breast ; then sadly <lb/>
            climbed the precipitous mountains, whence she could stretch <lb/>
            forth her gaze over the wide billows ; then ran into the oppos­ <lb/>

            to the ignorant winds, which being endowed with no senses, <lb/>
            can neither hear uttered words, nor return any ? He is now <lb/>
            nearly mid-way on the sea, and no mortal appears on the <lb/>
            vacant beach. Thus cruel fortune, too much insulting me <lb/>
            in my last moments, grudges even ears to hear my lamenta­ <lb/>
            tions. Almighty Jove, would that neither in the beginning <lb/>
            the Cecropian ships had touched the Gnossian shores ; nor that <lb/>
            the perfidious mariner had ever unmoored for Crete, bringing <lb/>
            dire tribute to the unconquered bull ; nor that yon bad man, <lb/>
            concealing cruel purposes under a winning form, had rested <lb/>
            as a guest in our abode ! For whither shall I betake myself? <lb/>
            On what hope shall I, undone, rely ? Shall I seek the Cretan <lb/>
            mountains ? But the fierce severing sea divides me from them <lb/>
            with its wide expanse. Can I hope for aid from my father, <lb/>
            whom I left of my own accord to follow the youth stained <lb/>
            with my brother's gore ? Can I console myself with the <lb/>
            trusty love of a husband who flees from me, bending his <lb/>
            pliant oars in the deep ? If I pass from the shore, the <lb/>
            lonely island is without a roof; nor is there any exit open <lb/>
            from it, encompassed as it is by the waves. There is no <lb/>
            means of escape, no hope ; all around is silence and desolation ; <lb/>
            all around is death. Not however shall my eyes languish in <lb/>
            death, nor shall my senses depart from my weary body, before <lb/>
            I implore from the gods a just penalty for my betrayal, and <lb/>

            tent nod, whereat the earth and the rough sea trembled, and <lb/>
            the firmament shook its glittering stars. But Theseus him­ <lb/>

            bosom all those injunctions which he before held fast in mind, <lb/>
            and hoisted no glad signals for his sad father, to show that he <lb/>
            was in sight of harbour safe and rescued. For they say that <lb/>
            previously, when Ægeus intrusted his son to the winds, as he " <lb/>
            was leaving the city of the goddess Pallas with his fleet, em­ <lb/>
            bracing his son, he gave the young man these injunctions:</p>
          <p>" My only son, dearer to me than long life, my son, lately <lb/>
            restored to me at the end of an extreme old age,1 and whom <lb/>
            I am compelled to send away to dangerous adventures, since <lb/>
            my ill fortune and thy hot valour tear thee away from me so <lb/>
            loth to part with thee, for not yet have my dim eyes had <lb/>
            enough of my son's dear face: not in joy and gladness of heart <lb/>
            will I send thee away, nor will I let thee show tokens of pros­ <lb/>
            perous fortune ; but first I will send forth many a lamentation <lb/>
            from my heart, defiling my white hairs with earth and dust ; <lb/>
            and then I will hang dyed sails upon the flitting mast, that so <lb/>
            the Iberian canvass with its dark dye may declare my grief, and <lb/>
            the burning anguish of my mind.; But if the dweller on sacred <lb/>
            Itone (who has promised us, her trusting votaries, to defend <lb/>
            our race and these abodes) grants thee to stain thy right hand <lb/>
            with the blood of the bull, then be sure that these injunctions <lb/>
            have force, stored up in thy heart, and that no lapse of time <lb/>
            obliterate them. As soon as thine eyes behold our hills, let <lb/>

          <p>As clouds driven by the breath of the winds leave a snowy <lb/>

            memory of Theseus, who had previously retained them with <lb/>
            constant mind. But his father, as he looked out from the top <lb/>
            of the fortress, wasting his anxious eyes in ceaseless tears, <lb/>
            when first he beheld the canvass of the inflated sail, threw <lb/>
            himself headlong from the top of the rocks, believing that <lb/>
            Theseus was lost by a cruel fate. Thus exulting Theseus, <lb/>
            entering a house woe-stricken by his father's death,' himself <lb/>
            encountered such sorrow as he had inflicted by his forgetful­ <lb/>
            ness on the daughter of Minos; while she, wholly rapt, still <lb/>

            In wild joy they raved all around him, yelling Evoë, Evoë, <lb/>
            and rolling their heads about. Some of them brandished <lb/>

            who neither inhabited Olympus with Jupiter, nor were of rank enough <lb/>

            had promoted or were interested in the nuptials, or were connected by <lb/>
            some tie with the bride or bridegroom. The centaur Chiron, the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ant of Mount Pelion in Thessaly, the kingdom of Peleus, and afterwards <lb/>
            tutor of Achilles, the predestined offspring of the marriage, first bears his <lb/>
            offerings. Next Peneus, the offspring of Oceanus and Tethys, is selected <lb/>
            from the water deities as the most celebrated river of Thessaly, and as a <lb/>
            kinsman of the bride. He bears an appropriate offering of the trees that <lb/>
            grow on his banks, and with Chiron decks the palace with flowers and <lb/>
            boughs ; with which it was usual to decorate every part of the bride­ <lb/>
            groom's abode, and particularly the door, as we learn from Ovid, Fast. 4, <lb/>
            Juvenal, Sat. 6, and Plutarch in Erotico. To these are added Prome­ <lb/>
            theus, who, by his prophecy of the powerful offspring to spring from <lb/>
            Thetis, had induced Jupiter to sanction her union with Peleus, and might <lb/>
            regard the wedding as his own work. These three are the fitting fore­ <lb/>

          <p>Thus prophesying in days of yore, the Fates sang the happy <lb/>
            destinies of Peleus with divine omen. For formerly, ere virtue <lb/>
            was yet despised, the inhabitants of heaven were wont to visit <lb/>
            in person the guiltless abodes of heroes, and to show them­ <lb/>
            selves in mortal assemblies. Often did the father of the gods, <lb/>
            revisiting 1 his splendid temple, when the annual solemnities <lb/>
            arrived with the festal days, behold a hundred chariots run­ <lb/>
            ning along the ground. Often did roving Bacchus drive his <lb/>
            screaming Thyads with dishevelled hair from the highest <lb/>
            peak of Parnassus,2 when the Delphians, eagerly rushing out <lb/>
            from the whole city, joyfully welcomed the god with smoking <lb/>
            altars. Often, in the deadly strife of war, Mars, or the mistress <lb/>
            of the rapid Triton,3 or the Rhamnusian virgin,4 in person <lb/>
            exhorted armed troops of men. But after the earth was <lb/>
            stained with nefarious crime, and all men drove out justice <lb/>
            from their covetous souls; after brothers drenched their hands <lb/>
            in brothers' blood ; the son ceased to mourn his dead parents; <lb/>
            the father desired the death of his firstborn son, that he might <lb/>

            divinity was even borrowed from it. The parting of Egeus and Theseus <lb/>
            is the prototype of that of Evander and Pallas; the despair of Dido is <lb/>
            worked up with sentiment and passion probably suggested by that of Ari­ <lb/>
            adne ; and even the beautiful commemoration of Marcellus is an im­ <lb/>
            provement upon the prophecy of the career of Achilles.—Lambe. Ovid <lb/>
            has treated the subject of Ariadne not less than four times, and has bor­ <lb/>
            rowed largely from Catullus. In the Epistle of Ariadne to Theseus he <lb/>
            has painted, like his predecessor, her disordered person, her sense of de­ <lb/>
            sertion, and remembrance of the benefits she had conferred on Theseus. <lb/>
            But the epistle is a cold production, chiefly because her grief is not im­ <lb/>
            mediately presented before us; and she merely tells that she had wept, <lb/>
            and sighed, and raved. The minute detail, too, into which she enters, is <lb/>
            inconsistent with her vehement passion. She recollects too well each <lb/>
            heap of sand which retarded her steps, and the thorns on the summit of <lb/>
            the mountain. Returning from her wanderings, she addresses her couch, <lb/>
            of which she asks advice, till she becomes overpowered by apprehension <lb/>
            for the wild beasts and marine monsters, of which she presents her false <lb/>
            lover with a faithful catalogue. The simple ideas of Catullus are fre­ <lb/>
            quently converted into conceits, and his natural bursts of passion into <lb/>
            quibbles and artificial points. In the eighth book of the Metamorphoses, <lb/>
            the melancholy part of Ariadne's story is only recalled in order to intro­ <lb/>
            . duce the transformation of her crown into a star. In the third book of <lb/>
            the Fasti, she deplores the double desertion of Theseus and Bacchus. <lb/>
            It is in the first book of the Art of Love that Ovid approaches nearest to <lb/>
            Catullus, particularly in the sudden contrast between the solitude ar 1 <lb/>

            which she, outstretching her smooth arms, had promised to <lb/>
            many gods, at the time when the king, recently blest in mar­ <lb/>
            riage, and bearing marks of the nocturnal struggle in which <lb/>
            he had been engaged for the virgin's spoils, had gone to lay <lb/>
            waste the Assyrian territory. Is Venus odious to the newly <lb/>
            wedded ? Why do brides frustrate their parents' joys by the <lb/>
            feigned tears they pour out profusely within the nuptial <lb/>
            chamber ? Their grief is not real, so help me the gods! <note type="footnote"> cept the interpretation given by Muretus, " Do not think that your words <lb/>
            have lapsed from my mind like an apple from a girl's bosom," then indeed <lb/>
            the comparison is quite frigid. But this was not what Catullus intended ; <lb/>
            his meaning was, " It is true I forgot for a while what I had promised <lb/>
            you, but forgot it just as it sometimes happens to a maiden to forget a <lb/>
            thing she prizes most dearly, and to be overcome with shame and confu­ <lb/>
            sion when she is suddenly reminded of her inattention." </note><note type="footnote"> } Berenice's Hair.] According to Hyginus, whom all the commentators <lb/>
            have implicitly followed, Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus <lb/>
            and Arsinoe, married her brother Ptolemy Euergetes, in accordance with <lb/>
            the Egyptian custom. But we know from Justin, lib. xxvi. c. 3, that <lb/>
            Berenice was not really Ptolemy's sister, but his cousin-german, a rela­ <lb/>
            tionship to which ancient usage gave the name of sisterhood. Her hus­ <lb/>
            band having soon afterwards marched with his army into Syria, Berenice <lb/>
            devoted her beautiful locks to Venus on condition of her husband's vic­ <lb/>
            torious return. Her prayers were heard, and she suspended her locks <lb/>
            with her own hand in the temple of the goddess, whence they disappeared <lb/>
            before the next morning, to the great vexation of both the royal consorts. <lb/>
            Conon, a famous astronomer of Samos, and a no less adroit courtier, <lb/>
            averred that a divine hand had withdrawn them, and placed them among <lb/>
            the stars. On this hint Callimachus composed a poem, which Catullus <lb/>
            has here imitated. But though the poem of Callimachus may have been <lb/>
            seriously written, and gravely read by the court of Ptolemy, the lines of <lb/>
            Catullus often approach to something like pleasantry or persiflage. The <lb/>
            original is lost, which is the more unfortunate, as no work of Catullua <lb/>
            has been more disfigured by transcribers than this. </note> <lb/>

            This truth my queen taught me by her many lamentations, <lb/>
            when her newly-wedded spouse set out for grim battles. It <lb/>
            was not, however, for the loneliness of thy deserted bed that <lb/>
            thou didst grieve, but for the sad departure of thy dear bro­ <lb/>
            ther, when sorrow so consumed thy very marrow, and thy <lb/>
            whole bosom was so racked, that sense and reason departed! <lb/>
            But surely I have known thee magnanimous since thou wast <lb/>
            but a little maiden. Hast thou forgotten that good deed,' by <lb/>
            which thou didst win a royal marriage, a deed than which <lb/>
            none ever dared to do a bolder?2 But what words thou didst <lb/>
            utter at thy sad parting from thy husband ! 0 Jupiter ! how <lb/>
            often thou didst wipe thine eyes with thy hand! What <note type="footnote"> 1 That good deed.] Hyginus gives a romantic and incredible explana­ <lb/>
            tion of these verses, in which he is followed by modern commentators. <lb/>
            Berenice is represented as a heroine, who broke horses, drove chariots, <lb/>
            and practised all military exercises. The exploit here alluded to was, <lb/>
            they say, her rescue of her father in battle, when surrounded by enemies ; <lb/>
            in reward for which her brother married her. But the poet certainly <lb/>
            alludes to a memorable passage in history, related by Plutarch in his Life <lb/>
            of Demetrius. Magas, the uterine brother of Ptolemy Philadelphus, was <lb/>
            by the influence of his mother promoted to the government of Cyrene and <lb/>
            Libya. (Pausanias in Attic.) He governed those provinces many years <lb/>
            with ability, and having fortified his own power by the affection of the <lb/>
            natives and by his marriage with Apame, daughter of Antiochus Soter, <lb/>
            king of Syria, he determined to secure to his own family the dominion of <lb/>
            the countries which he had long ruled as a viceroy. His revolt was suc­ <lb/>
            cessful ; but the supposed contingency which had at first inspired him <lb/>
            with disaffection to his brother, failed to happen. He had reached the <lb/>
            extremity of old age, and his queen Apame had brought him no male <lb/>
            children, and only one daughter, Berenice. Under this disappointment <lb/>
            Magas expressed a desire to compose all differences with his brother <lb/>
            Ptolemy Philadelphus, by marrying his only daughter with Ptolemy's <lb/>
            eldest son, and giving as her dower the restored allegiance of Cyrene and <lb/>
            Libya. The treaty was accepted, but Magas died before the conditions <lb/>
            of it were executed. The ambitious Apame, unwilling that her husband's <lb/>
            independent kingdom should sink into a tributary province, invited to <lb/>
            Cyrene Demetrius, the brother of Antigonus Gonatas, king of Macedon, <lb/>
            promising him her daughter in marriage. But the figure and accomplish­ <lb/>
            ments of this young prince changed her resolutions and captivated her <lb/>
            affections. Demetrius, instead of marrying the daughter, became the <lb/>
            paramour of the mother. But the slighted Berenice determined to avenge <lb/>
            her wrongs. A conspiracy was formed in the palace. Demetrius was <lb/>
            slain in the embraces of Apame; the daughter conducting the assassins <lb/>
            to the chamber and bed of her mother. Apame was sent into Syria, and <lb/>
            Berenice repaired to Alexandria, and consummated her marriage with <lb/>
            young Ptolemy, afterwards called Euergetes.—Tytler. </note><note type="footnote"> 2A deed than which, &amp;c.] Quo nonfortius ausit alis. Alis for alius. </note> <lb/>

            mighty god thus changed thee ? Was this because lovers are <lb/>

            ever in the beginning instituted the practice of seeking out <lb/>
            veins under ground and forging hard iron ! My sister hairs, <lb/>
            just before separated from me, were bewailing my fate, when <lb/>
            Æthiopian Memnon’s brother, the winged steed of Chloris, <lb/>
            beating the air with quivering wings, presented himself in <lb/>
            Arsinoe's temple, and catching me up flew through the dusky <lb/>
            ether and laid me in the chaste bosom of Venus.4 Zephyritis <note type="footnote"> 1 Unwillingly, &amp;c.] Macrobius remarks that Virgil, who was well <lb/>

            herself had sent her servant to the pleasant regions on the <lb/>
            Canopian shores, to the end that not only the golden crown <lb/>

            of heaven, but that we, the consecrated spoils of Berenice's <lb/>

            truth from any fear; no, though the stars assail me with in­ <lb/>
            vectives, I will unfold the secret feelings of my sincere mind : <lb/>
            I am not so rejoiced by these events, as not to be tortured by <lb/>
            the thought that I am for ever parted from the head of my <lb/>
            mistress, with whom I imbibed many thousand fragrant oint­ <lb/>
            ments, though whilst she was yet a virgin I never had any.2</p>

            mythological intricacies to make this whole passage one of the most ob­ <lb/>
            scure in the works of Catullus. Briefly, its meaning appears to be this : <lb/>
            Zephyrus, son of Aurora, brother of Memnon, and husband of Chloris, <lb/>
            carried off the hair by order of Venus, who is also called Arsinoe, from <lb/>
            her temple in the town of that name founded by Ptolemy Philadelphia i <lb/>
            in honour of his sister-spouse; and Zephyritis, from the Egyptian pro­ <lb/>
            montory of Zephyrium where she was worshipped. Some commentators <lb/>
            make Zephyritis identical with Chloris. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The footsteps of the gods press me.] The Coma Berenices is situated <lb/>

            send me this epistle blotted with your tears, praying me to <lb/>
            raise you up as a shipwrecked man flung ashore by the foam­ <lb/>
            ing billows, and to rescue you from the gates of death; and <lb/>
            telling me that neither sacred Venus suffers you to enjoy soft <lb/>
            slumber in your lonely, deserted bed, nor do the Muses delight <lb/>
            you with the sweet strains of old poets, whilst your sorrow­ <lb/>
            ing mind knows no rest; this is gratifying to me, for as much <lb/>
            as you esteem me your friend, and therefore ask of me the <lb/>
            gifts of the Muses and of Venus. But that my sorrows may <lb/>
            not be unknown to you, Manlius, and that you may not sup­ <lb/>
            pose I shrink from the duties incumbent on your guest,2 hear <lb/>
            now in what billows of misfortune I myself am plunged, and <lb/>
            ask no more for the gifts of the happy from a wretch like <lb/>
            me.</p>
          <p>When first the white robe3 was conferred upon me, when <lb/>
            my flowery years were in their jocund spring, I disported <lb/>
            variously enough;4 I have not been unknown to the goddess <note type="footnote"> I To Manlius.] Most commentators conclude from the fifth and sixth lines <lb/>
            of this poem that it was addressed to Manlius on the occasion of the death <lb/>
            of his wife Julia, celebrated in the first epiihalamium. But this seems <lb/>
            incongruous with the wish expressed at the end of the piece, that Man­ <lb/>
            lius and the lady, whoever she was, who is emphatically termed " his <lb/>
            life," may long live happily together. Doering supposes that the fond <lb/>
            pair had quarrelled ; but that hypothesis fails also if tried by the same <lb/>
            test; besides, the poet offers no hint or inducement towards reconciliation, <lb/>
            as he would naturally have done in such a case. It is to be regretted that <lb/>
            we are left in the dark as to the occasion on which this poem was com­ <lb/>
            posed, for we are thus deprived of the means of clearing up many of its <lb/>
            obscurities, and of becoming reconciled to many things in it which now <lb/>
            appear as blemishes upon a work which presents many extraordinary <lb/>
            beauties. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Your guest.] The Romans regarded hospitality as a permanent <lb/>
            mutual relation, and assigned to it a high place among the duties of life. <lb/>
            Aulus Gellius thus classifies social duties in the order in which they are <lb/>
            to be preferred when they happen to clash with each other-First, the <lb/>
            duty towards parents and guardians; next, that towards clients and <lb/>
            adopted dependants; thirdly, the duties of those who accepted or inter- <lb/>
            changed hospitality; and lastly, duties towards kindred and relations. <lb/>

            death has absorbed all such tastes in grief. 0 my brother, <lb/>
            whose loss hath left me wretched ! Thou hast broken all my <lb/>
            enjoyments by thy death, brother; our whole house is buried <lb/>
            along with thee ; with thee have perished all my delights, <lb/>
            which thy dear love fostered in thy lifetime. Since thy de­ <lb/>
            parture I have wholly abandoned all my fondness for poetry, <lb/>
            and all my favourite pursuits. Therefore as for what you <lb/>
            write, that " It is a shame for Catullus to be at Verona, for <lb/>
            there a man of mark must warm his cold limbs in his solitary <lb/>
            bed ;"2 this is not shameful, Manlius ; say rather it is pitiable. <lb/>
            You will pardon me then if I do not send you those gifts of <lb/>
            which sorrow has bereft me, since I am unable. For that I <lb/>
            have no great stock of writings by me is a result of my living <lb/>
            at Rome; that is my home, my domicile; there my life is <lb/>
            passed. Only one case of books3 out of many has accom­ <lb/>
            panied me to this place. This being so, I would not have <lb/>
            you conclude that it is from ill will, or illiberality of mind on <lb/>
            my part, that both your requests are not fulfilled. I would <note type="footnote"> with the Muses ; others, I dallied with love; we rather think that <lb/>
            Catullus meant both. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Sweet bitterness.] This was a familiar idea with the ancients, and <lb/>
            Byron's imitation of Lucretius has naturalized it in England: <lb/>

            Surgit amari aliqnid quod in ipsis floribus angat. <lb/>
            Full from the fount of joy's delicious springs <lb/>
            Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings. <lb/>
            Anacreon, Ode 45, describes the manufacture of Cupid's arrow-heads: <lb/>
            Vulcan forges them, Venus then dips them in honey, and Cupid after­ <lb/>
            wards in gall. Claudian gives a somewhat different account of the mat­ <lb/>
            tar : <lb/>
            Labuntur gemini fontes, hie dulcis, amarus <lb/>
            Alter, et infusis corrumpit melle venenis, <lb/>
            Unde Cupidineas armavit fama sagittas. <lb/>
            In Cypris' isle two rippling fountains fall, <lb/>
            And one with honey rlows and one with gall; <lb/>

            the place he left vacant by Lesbia's side at home. </note><note type="footnote"> Case of books.] Capsula, a portable case in which the ancients kept <lb/>

          <p>I cannot forbear, 0 goddesses, to tell in what things <lb/>
            Manlius has aided me, and how great has been his kindness, <lb/>

            his for me. But I will tell you all: do you tell it again to <lb/>

            like the bowels of Ætna, or the Malian fountain in Œtæan <lb/>
            Thermopylæ;3 when my eyes were bedimmed with incessant <lb/>
            tears, and my cheeks were wet with sad showers. As the <lb/>

            threshold, pressing it with her shining foot and creaking san­ <lb/>
            dals.2 So came of yore Laodamia,3 burning with love, to the <lb/>
            home of Protesilaus, a home she entered with hopes doomed to <lb/>
            be frustrated, since no victim had yet propitiated the lords of <lb/>

            ever engage my affections so strongly, as that I should rashly <lb/>
            enter upon its enjoyment without the sanction of the gods. <lb/>
            Laodamia learned by the loss of her husband how hungrily <lb/>
            the altar craves for sacrificial blood ; for she was compelled to <lb/>
            quit the neck of her lately wedded spouse, before a second <lb/>

            that she could survive the dissolution of her marriage, which <lb/>
            the Fates knew would not be far remote in time, if her hus­ <lb/>
            band went in arms to the walls of Ilium. For Troy had then <lb/>

            rape of Helen : accursed Troy ! the common sepulchre of <lb/>
            Europe and Asia; Troy, the cruel grave of brave men and <lb/>
            noble qualities ; to which I also owe the lamentable death of <lb/>

            very whirlpool of love had sucked thee in, and plunged thee <lb/>
            down a gulf as deep as the rich soil which the Greeks tell us <lb/>
            was dried by the drainage of the marsh near Cyllenean Phe­ <lb/>

            said to have dug, when he cut through the hearts of moun­ <lb/>

            with his sure arrows, by command of a less valiant lord ;1 that <lb/>
            the gateway of heaven might be trodden by a divinity the <lb/>
            more, and that Hebe2 might not be long a virgin. But thy <lb/>
            deep love was deeper than that gulf which taught the god to <lb/>
            bear tamely the yoke of a master.3 For no only daughter <lb/>
            rears a late-born child so dear to his aged grandsire, a child <lb/>
            who, when hope was almost gone, appears at last as heir to <lb/>
            his ancestral wealth, has had his name inserted in the attested <lb/>
            will, and thus extinguishing the unkindly joy of the baffled <lb/>
            next of kin, drives away the vulture that hovered over the <lb/>
            grandsire's hoary head ; 4 nor did any dove ever delight so <lb/>
            much in its snowy mate, (though that bird is said to surpass <lb/>
            all others in the indefatigable ardour of its billing kisses,) as <lb/>
            thou didst, Laodamia. though woman is pre-eminently incon­ <lb/>

            poem is the Festival of Venus, which was celebrated on the first three <lb/>
            of April, beginning at nightfall on the last day of March. For, <lb/>
            Bays Macrobius, Saturnal. i. 21, " When the sun ascends above the <lb/>
            .ower parts of the earth, and passes the bounds of the vernal equinox, <lb/>
            lengthening the days, then is Venus glad, the fair fields are green with <lb/>
            corn, the meadows with grass, the trees with leaves. For this reason our <lb/>
            forefathers dedicated the month of April to Venus." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Produced Dione.] The " celestial blood” of which Dione or Venus <lb/>

          <p>She paints the year with flowers that purple it as with <lb/>
            gems ; she urges the buds, swelling with the breath of Zephyr, <lb/>
            into the warm bridal bed of air ;'2 she scatters the bright dewy <lb/>
            moisture left by the humid air of night; how its tears glitter <lb/>
            and tremble as if they would fall; but each pendent drop re­ <lb/>
            mains self-balanced by its little orb. That moisture which <lb/>
            the stars shed in the calm night loosens the virgin buds in the <lb/>
            morning from their humid robe, and displays the crimson <lb/>
            blushes of the flower. She has commanded that to-morrow <lb/>
            all the virgins shall wear roses. The rose tinged with the blood <lb/>
            of Venus,3 perfumed by the kisses of Love, and glowing with <lb/>
            the lustre of gems, of flames, of the sun's orient splendours, <lb/>
            to-morrow will not be ashamed to loose as a bride her last <lb/>

          <p>The goddess hath bidden the Nymphs assemble in the myrtle <lb/>

            trusted as a harmless associate in the festival if he carries his <lb/>
            arrows. Go, Nymphs; Love has laid aside his arms, he is <lb/>
            harmless. He is ordered to go unarmed and naked, that he <lb/>
            may do no mischief with his bow, or his arrows, or his torch. <lb/>
            Yet, Nymphs, beware, for Cupid is beautiful. Love is all <lb/>

          <p>Virgin of Delos, Venus sends thee virgins modest as thy­ <lb/>

            to her awhile unsullied by the slaughters of the chase. She <lb/>
            would fain invite thee if thy maiden modesty would yield to <lb/>
            her prayer. She would gladly see thee at her festival if the <lb/>
            scene were not repugnant to thy virgin mind. For three <lb/>
            nights thou wouldst see the festive choirs, crowned with <lb/>
            dowers, wandering through the groves, or disporting in its <lb/>
            myrtle bowers. Ceres and Bacchus1 will be there, and the <lb/>

            of the air with the earth, and it is renewed every year in spring. This <lb/>
            idea, and the very forms in which it is here expressed, are taken from <lb/>
            Virgil, Georg. ii. 325. Stanley cites a kindred passage from Euripides, <lb/>
            which he thus renders : <lb/>

            hoarse voice of the swan; and the goddess has forbidden the <lb/>
            tuneful birds to be silent. The nightingale sings in the shade <lb/>
            of the poplar, that you would suppose she was uttering in <lb/>
            music the emotions of love, not that she was complaining to <lb/>
            her sister of the barbarity of Tereus. She sings: we are silent! <lb/>
            When shall my spring come? When shall I be like Chelidon, <lb/>
            and silent never more? I have lost the Muse's favour by <lb/>

            Cuieta and Terracina. Its people having been frequently terrified by false <lb/>
            alarms of the approach of besiegers, passed a law forbidding that any <lb/>
            one should make report of danger on any grounds whatever. The be. <lb/>
            siegers came at last, and the place was taken by surprise. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It was with reference to this poem that Dousa (Van des Deos) plan­ <lb/>
            ned a hoax upon his learned contemporaries, like that which Muretus <lb/>
            practised on Scaliger. He gave out that one of his friends had seen <lb/>
            another Vigil in a library in France, and had retained these four lines of <lb/>
            it in his memory- <lb/>
            Nemo tentis mentulis det, nemo nervis otium. <lb/>
            Ecce passeres salaces, ecce rauci turtures, <lb/>

            Nemo tentis, etc. <lb/>
            The trick succeeded ; the learned unanimously recognised the genuine <lb/>
            air of antiquity in this fragment; and when they were undeceived, they <lb/>
            consoled them as Scaliger had done, by virulently abusing the clever <lb/>

            my poverty consign me to a life without excitement, whilst the <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy I.] An invitation from Messala to accompany him to the wars, <lb/>
            with a view to repairing the poet's fortunes, appears to have been the <lb/>
            occasion of this Elegy, in which Tibullus declares his determination to <lb/>
            abandon the pursuit of wealth and power, and to retire to the country, <lb/>
            there to lead a life of calm and simple enjoyment with the girl of his <lb/>
            heart. We may confidently fix the date of the poem about the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of B. c. 31, the year in which Messala won the battle of Actium <lb/>
            for Octavius. According to Scaliger and Bronkhusius, whose arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of the text we generally follow, this Elegy consists of 92 lines: <lb/>
            Heyne and the Vulgate give it 78. Tibullus has suffered a twofold injury <lb/>
            at the hands of ignorant copyists, who, not content with mutilating and <lb/>
            changing his words, have in many instances broken the order of his <lb/>
            lines, and shuffled them about in pairs and in scores in the most ran­ <lb/>
            dom manner. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gold, &amp;c.] The poet here specifies wealth in money and wealth in <lb/>
            land, both however with reference to the " præmia militiæ.” The soldier <lb/>
            acquired gold by direct plunder from his foes, and at this period it was the <lb/>
            practice to make an assignment of land to each veteran when discharged <lb/>
            from service. </note><note type="footnote"> a Many acres.] Jugera. The Roman jugerum contained two actus. <lb/>
            the actus being a square whose side was one hundred and twenty Roman <lb/>

            data it is easily calculated that the jugerum was not quite two-thirds of <lb/>

            the same word three lines before. On the other hand exiguo would per­ <lb/>
            haps imply sordid poverty, as Ramsay remarks. The " blazing hearth" <lb/>

            bodies of their triumphant generals, triumphantumque corpora, with red <lb/>

            was a title of honour, equivalent, apparently, to chief or prince. Thus we <lb/>
            read of Lar Porsenna, king of Clusinm, Lar Tolumnius, king of the <lb/>
            Veiientes. The testimony of those among the Romans who were best quali­ <lb/>
            fied to form an opinion upon such a subject is so precise that we can enter­ <lb/>
            tain no doubt that, according to the poopular belief, the deities denominated <lb/>
            Lares were certain spirits of dead men, who were supposed to watch over <lb/>
            and protect the, living. They were very numerous, and were ranked in <lb/>
            classes according to the departments over which they presided, the'first <lb/>
            grand division beinginto private and public Lares. The former were <lb/>
            tutelary spirits who received the homage of all the individuals residing <lb/>
            under the same roof.The spot peculiarly sacred to them was the focus </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            domain. In those days a slaughtered calf was the propitia­ <lb/>
            tory sacrifice for vast herds; now a lamb is a sumptuous vic­ <lb/>
            tim to come from my small estate. A lamb shall fall before <lb/>
            you, and round it the rustic youth shall cry : “ Io ! give us a <lb/>
            plenteous harvest and a good vintage.” Favour us with your <lb/>
            presence, gods ; scorn not the gifts of a poor table, nor liba­ <lb/>
            tions from clean pottery. Such vessels the husbandman of <lb/>
            yore made for himself and formed them of ductile clay. <lb/>
            And you, ye thieves and wolves, spare my few heads of <lb/>
            cattle, and take your prey from large herds. I do not regret <lb/>
            the wealth of my fathers, and the plenty which their stored <lb/>
            harvests afforded of yore. For me a small crop is enough; it <lb/>
            is enough to rest under my own roof, if I may, and to stretch <lb/>
            my limbs on my wonted couch. How delightful it is to hear <lb/>
            the pitiless winds as we lie in bed; and fold the mistress we <lb/>
            love to our bosom; or when the wintry south wind pours <lb/>
            down its sleety waters, to sleep on securely, lulled by the <lb/>
            plashing rain ! Let this be my lot. Let him grow rich, as is <lb/>
            but fair, who can bear the rage of the sea and the dismal rain. <lb/>
            Now I, who am content to live on a little, cannot do this, nor <lb/>

            the central point of the mansion. Here stood the altar for domestic <lb/>
            sacrifice, and near to this there was usually a niche, containing little <lb/>

            sumptuous palaces of later times was not unfrequently enlarged into a <lb/>
            chapel with magnificent decorations. The public Laic' were of several <lb/>
            kinds: e. g. Lares Rurales, guardians of flocks, herds, and fruits of the <lb/>
            earth: the poet addresses these in the lines before us : Lares Compitales, <lb/>
            worshipped at the spot where two or more roads crossed ; Lares Præstites, <lb/>
            protectors of the city, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Lares bear a striking resemblance to <lb/>
            the saints of modern Italy. Moreover the holy books of the Etruscans <lb/>
            described certain sacred rites, by means of which the souls of men might <lb/>
            be changed into gods, a process somewhat analogous to canonization. <lb/>
            The Penates were the deities worshipped in the penus, or innermost part <lb/>
            of the house. Penates is a generic term,and includes the Lares and cer­ <lb/>
            tain other gods-who were worshipped at the hearth, especially Vesta, who <lb/>
            was herself the Goddess of the Hearth.—Ramsay. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Now I, who am content, &amp;c.] <lb/>

            Rom. Lit.) we find a passage which commends itself especially to the reader <lb/>
            of Tibullus : “ The Romans, and particularly the Roman poets, as if the <lb/>
            rustic spirit of their Italian ancestry was not altogether banished by the <lb/>
            buildings of Rome, appear to have had a genuine and exquisite relish for <lb/>
            the delights of the country ; not as we are apt to enjoy it, for the sake of <lb/>
            exercise or field sports, but for its amenity and repose, and the mental <lb/>
            tranquillity which it diffused. With them it seems to have been truly­ <lb/>
            ' The relish for the calm delight <lb/>
            Of verdant fields and fountains bright; <lb/>
            Trees that nod on sloping hills, <lb/>
            And caves that echo tinkling rills.' <lb/>
            Love of the country among the Romans thus became conjoined with the <lb/>
            idea of a life of pastoral tranquillity and retirement, a life of friendship, <lb/>
            liberty, and repose, free from labour and from care, and from all turbu­ <lb/>
            lent passions. Scenes of this kind delight and interest us supremely, <lb/>
            whether they be painted as what is hoped or what is enjoyed. We feel <lb/>
            how natural it is for a mind with a certain disposition to relaxation and <lb/>
            indolence, when fatigued with the bustle of life, to long for serenity and <lb/>
            quiet, and for those sequestered scenes in which they can be most exqui­ <lb/>
            sitely enjoyed. There is much less of this in the writings of the Greeks. <lb/>
            who were originally a scafaring and piratical, not, like the Italians, a pas­ <lb/>
            toral, people. It is thus that even in their highest stage of refinement <lb/>
            the manners and feelings of nations bear some affinity to their original <lb/>
            rudeness, though that rudeness itself has been imperceptibly converted <lb/>
            into a source of elegance and ornament." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Gems.] Smaragdi. It appears extremely probable that the ancients <lb/>

            thee, my Delia, and to feed my flock on the lone mountain ; <lb/>
            and, if I may but hold thee in my fond arms, soft be my sleep <lb/>
            on the rude ground ! What boots it to lie down on a Tyrian <lb/>
            couch without favouring love, when the sleepless night must <lb/>
            be passed in tears ? Vain then are down, and richly dyed <lb/>
            tapestry, and even the gentle murmuring of water, to induce <lb/>
            slumber. The man were iron who, when he could have thee, <lb/>
            should stupidly prefer to follow arms and rapine. He may <lb/>
            drive before him vanquished troops of Cilicians, and pitch <lb/>
            his martial camp on the conquered soil ; caparisoned all over <lb/>
            with gold and silver, he may bestride his swift steed in all the <lb/>
            pomp of his glory. Let me behold thee when my last hour is <lb/>
            come, thee let me hold with my dying hand.' Thou wilt weep, <lb/>
            Delia, when I am laid on the funeral pile, and thou wilt give <lb/>
            me kisses mingled with sad tears ; thy bosom is not cased in <lb/>
            hard iron, nor hast thou flint in thy'tender heart. No youth, <lb/>
            no virgin will be able to return from that funeral with dry <lb/>
            eyes. But pain not my Manes ; spare thy dishevelled hair, <lb/>
            Delia, and spare thy tender cheeks.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, as long as the fates permit, let us indulge our <lb/>
            mutual love. Soon death will come with its head wrapt in <lb/>
            gloom ; soon sluggish age will creep upon us ; nor will it be <lb/>
            seemly to love or to talk amorously with hoary heads. Now <lb/>
            is our time to ply light Venus, whilst we may without blush­ <lb/>
            ing break doors, and commit riotous frolics. In this warfare <lb/>
            I am a captain and a good soldier. Banners and trumpets, <lb/>
            begone ! Bestow wounds and rich booty on heroes who long <lb/>
            for them; as for me, secure in the store I possess, I will <lb/>
            despise both opulence and penury. <note type="footnote"> 1 Let me behold thee.] No other poet so often introduces the dismal <lb/>
            images of death. Tibullus does not, like Anacreon or Catullus, present <lb/>
            them for a moment, or on the back-ground of his pictures of joy, but ex­ <lb/>
            hibits them at full length and on the front of the canvass. When he <lb/>
            thinks of death he thinks so profoundly, and so long contemplates its <lb/>
            image, that the ideas it suggests must have occupied a large space in his <lb/>
            soul. Even to the most joyous thoughts of Tibullus some mournful or <lb/>
            plaintive sentiment is generally united, and his most gay and smiling <lb/>
            figures wear chaplets of cypress on their brows. While deeming himself <lb/>
            happy in comparison with the great Messala, because he will pass his life <lb/>
            unknown in the arms of Delia, he thus concludes his address to this be­ <lb/>
            loved mistress: “Let me behold thee," &amp;c. Dunlop. </note></p><pb n="110"/>

            some youth assays new thresholds or a girl opens the barred <lb/>

            be gone, sprinkling them with milk. When she pleases, she <lb/>
            sweeps away the clouds from the sombre sky ; when she <lb/>
            pleases, she calls down the snow in summer by a word from <lb/>

            commonly depended upon before a journey was undertaken. An example <lb/>
            will better explain this obscure piece of superstition. A lady who was <lb/>
            betrothed went with a young companion to the temple of the goddess of <lb/>
            marriage to watch the first words spoken by a woman. Anxiously at­ <lb/>
            tentive, she seated herself while her companion stood. Two hours having <lb/>
            passed without a word being uttered, or anybody entering the temple, <lb/>
            the younger at last said, " My deal, 1 am tired ; will you permit me to </note> <lb/>

            console her, when I had already given orders for my departure, <lb/>
            still anxiously sought for pretexts to delay; and alleged <lb/>
            either an unpromising appearance of the birds, or dire omens, <lb/>
            or that Saturn's unlucky day1 detained me. Oh how often <lb/>
            at the outset of my journey did I say that a stumble at the <lb/>
            threshold2 had given me sinister warning ! Let no one dare <lb/>
            to set out on a journey in spite of love, or if lie does, let him <lb/>

            corded with them. The betrothed lady died soon after, and the other was <lb/>
            married to the bridegroom in her stead. Another way-of- taking the lots <lb/>
            was by means of slips of parchment or pieces of wood, upon which certain <lb/>
            words or sentences were inscribed. They were shuffled together in a box <lb/>
            or urn ; one was drawn or shaken out at random, and a conclusion drawn <lb/>
            from the import of its inscription. Fortune-tellers drove a brisk trade in <lb/>
            Rome, and frequented the Forum, the Circus Maximus, and other places <lb/>
            of public resort. In the case before us, Delia sent a boy to a place where <lb/>
            three ways met, that he might watch for an omen; or if we read trinis <lb/>

            may be healed by thee, is proved by many a picture in thy <lb/>
            temples. Let my Delia, dressed in linen,1 sit before thy sacred <lb/>
            doors, performing vigils vowed for me ; and twice a day, with <lb/>
            hair unbound, conspicuous among the Pharian crowd, let her <lb/>
            recite thy due praises; but be it my lot to celebrate my native <lb/>
            Penates, and to offer monthly incense to my ancient Lar.</p>
          <p>How happily men lived when Saturn reigned, before the <lb/>
            earth was laid open by long roads ! Not yet had the pine <lb/>
            contemned the azure waves, and shaken out its bellying sails <lb/>
            to the winds, nor had the roving mariner, seeking gain in un­ <lb/>
            known lands, loaded his ship with foreign merchandise. In <lb/>
            those days the strong bull did not bear the yoke; the horse <lb/>
            did not champ the bit in his subject mouth; no house had <lb/>
            doors; there was no stone fixed on the fields, to mark the <lb/>
            precise boundaries of each man's crop ; the very oaks yielded <lb/>
            honey, and the sheep spontaneously offered their milky udders, <lb/>
            and gave no trouble to those who wanted them. There were <lb/>
            no armies, no enmity, no wars ; nor had the cruel smith forged <lb/>
            the sword with ruthless art.</p>
          <p>Now under the rule of Jove, slaughter and swords are in­ <lb/>
            cessant ; now sea and land offer a thousand ways of sudden <lb/>
            death. Spare me, Father ; I have not a conscience frightened <lb/>
            by any perjuries, or impious words uttered against the holy <lb/>
            gods. But if I have now completed my destined years, let a <lb/>
            stone stand over my bones, with this inscription :-Here lies <lb/>
            Tibullus, consumed by pitiless death, while following Messala <lb/>
            by land and sea.</p>
          <p>But because I am always obsequious to tender Love, Venus <lb/>
            herself will conduct me to the Elysian fields. There dance <lb/>
            and song are perpetual, and birds flitting in all directions <lb/>
            warble sweetly with their small throats. The uncultivated <lb/>
            vegetation bears cinnamon, and the benignant ground blooms <lb/>
            all over with fragrant roses. Groups of youth sport with <note type="footnote"> 1 Linen.] The priests of Egypt were,compelled to pay the most scru­ <lb/>
            pulous regard to personal cleanliness. To insure this, they shaved their <lb/>
            heads, and wore no garmets but such as were made of linen, and per­ <lb/>
            haps cotton. It appears from this passage that the worshippers of Isis, <lb/>
            when they appeared at his shrine, wore habits of this description, which <lb/>
            would be very remarkable at Rome, where the clothing of all ranks was <lb/>
            chiefly weollen. The fullest account of the worship of Isis is given by <lb/>
            Apuleius in the eleventh book of his Metamorphoses. </note> <lb/>

            tender damsels, and love incessantly mingles them in pleasing <lb/>
            strife. There is the place of every one whom rapacious death <lb/>
            interrupts in the midst of his love, and he bears myrtle wreaths <lb/>
            on his distinguished head.</p>
          <p>But the abode of guilt lies buried in deep night, and black <lb/>
            floods roar around it. There rages Tisiphone with fierce <lb/>
            tangled snakes for hair, and the crowd of the wicked flies <lb/>
            hither and thither before her. Black Cerberus hisses with <lb/>
            his serpents1 at the entrance, and watches before the brazen <lb/>
            gates. There the guilty limbs of Ixion, who dared to attempt <lb/>
            Juno, are whirled round on the rapid wheel, and Tityos, ex­ <lb/>
            tended over nine acres of ground, feeds the ever-ravening <lb/>
            birds with his dark entrails. Tantalus is there, with a lake <lb/>
            around him; but the water baffles his hot thirst just as he is <lb/>
            about to drink: and the children of Danaus, who committed <lb/>
            sacrilege against Venus, carry the water of Lethe into pierced <lb/>
            casks. There let him be, whosoever troubled my love, and <lb/>
            wished for me the tedious anxieties of warfare.</p>
          <p>But, Delia, remain faithful, I implore, and let an old woman <lb/>
            always sit by your side, a sedulous guardian of your sacred <lb/>
            modesty. Let her tell you stories, and fill long spindles with <lb/>
            the threads she draws from the distaffby lamp-light ; and let <lb/>
            the girl near her, intent on her busy task, yield gradually to <lb/>
            sleep and leave off her work. Then I will come suddenly; <lb/>
            no one shall announce me, but I shall seem to you as if I had <lb/>
            dropped from the sky. Then run to me, Delia, just as you <lb/>
            are, with bare feet and your long hair in disorder. This is my <lb/>
            prayer; may fair Aurora bring us that bright day with her <lb/>
            rosy horses.</p>

          <p>So said I, and thus answered the rustic son of Bacchus <lb/>
            armed with his curved sickle. " Be not disheartened, if haply <lb/>
            a girl refuse you at first; by degrees she will give her neck to <lb/>
            the yoke. Time has taught lions to obey man ; with time soft <lb/>
            water cuts its way through stone. A year ripens the grapes <lb/>
            on the sunny hills; a year brings round the changes of the <lb/>
            constellations in sure order. Be not afraid to swear; the <lb/>
            oaths broken in the sight of Venus the winds scatter over <lb/>
            land and sea. For this, great thanks to Jove : the great father <lb/>
            himself has forbidden to have any force, whatever oaths <lb/>
            thoughtless love may have eagerly sworn ; and Diana allows <lb/>
            you to pledge yourself with impunity by her arrows, and <lb/>
            Minerva by her hair. But if you are not prompt you will <lb/>
            miss all. Time passes away ! The day does not stand still, <lb/>
            or return. How soon the earth loses its brilliant hues! How <lb/>
            soon the tall poplar its comely tresses! How helpless lies, <lb/>
            when the fates of old age are come upon him, the courser that <lb/>
            was first to bound forth from the Elæan starting-place. I have <lb/>
            seen one who was but now a youth, lamenting, when graver <lb/>
            years pressed upon him, the days that had passed foolishly <lb/>
            away. Cruel gods ! the serpent casts his skin and comes forth <lb/>
            anew every year: but the Fates have granted no delay to <lb/>
            beauty. Eternal youth belongs to Phœbus and Bacchus alone, <lb/>
            for unshorn locks adorn both gods.</p>
          <p>" Whatever your fair one has a mind to do, let her have <lb/>
            her own way. Love achieves many victories by compliance. <lb/>
            Do not refuse to accompany her, though a long journey <lb/>
            is intended, and the fiery dog-star parches the fields; though <lb/>
            the watery bow, marking the sky with its parti-coloured <lb/>
            dyes, portend the coming rain. Or if she desires to roam <lb/>
            over the azure waves, ply the oar yourself and speed the light <lb/>
            bark over the waters. Grudge not to undergo hard labour, <lb/>
            and to chafe your hands unused to such work. And if she <lb/>
            wishes to enclose deep valleys with the hunter's toils, let not <note type="footnote"> to gender. This change has occasioned some awkwardness in a few <lb/>
            places; but without it the poem, which is one of the most elegant of the <lb/>

            your shoulders refuse to carry the nets, if so you may please <lb/>
            her. If she will practise arms, you will try to fence with a <lb/>
            light hand, and often expose your unguarded side that she may <lb/>
            make a hit. Then she will be indulgent; then you will be <lb/>
            allowed to snatch sweet kisses; she will struggle, but give <lb/>
            them after all. First she will give what you steal; afterwards <lb/>
            she will offer them for you to take, and at last she will freely <lb/>
            clasp your neck.</p>
          <p>" Alas, how vilely these times treat unfortunate art. The <lb/>
            tender girl is now grown used to desire presents. Now may <lb/>
            the stone press wretchedly on thy bones, whoever thou art, <lb/>

            song were not, ivory would not have shone from the shoulder <lb/>

            has trees, the sky has stars, the river rolls waters. But whoso <lb/>
            hears not the Muses, whoso [buys or] sells love, be it theirs <lb/>
            to follow the chariot of Idan Ops, let them fill three hundred <lb/>
            cities with their wanderings, and mutilate their vile bodies in <lb/>
            Phrygian fashion. Venus desires that there be room for the <lb/>
            winning ways of courtship ; she favours plaintive supplica­ <lb/>
            tions and piteous tears."</p>
          <p>These precepts the god delivered to me that I might sing <lb/>
            them to Titia, but Titia's spouse bids her not mind them. <lb/>
            “ 0 beware of trusting the amorous crowd of youths," he says. <lb/>
            " for they never want a plausible pretext for love. This one <lb/>
            finds favour because he reins the steed with address; that <lb/>
            one, because he cleaves the calm waters with snowy breast; <lb/>
            another captivates, because he is strong and daring; and a <lb/>
            fourth, because maiden modesty sits upon his soft cheeks."</p>
          <p>Let her obey her monitor ; but as for you, whom the wily <lb/>

            work of a cunning bawd who interferes for my destruction. <lb/>
            May she eat bloody food, and drink with gory mouth cups all <lb/>
            bitter with gall. May souls complaining of their fate always <lb/>
            hover round her, and the screech-owl hoot wildly on her roof. <lb/>
            Goaded to madness by hunger, may she pluck grass from the <lb/>
            sepulchres, and the bones left by ravening wolves. May she <lb/>
            run naked and howling through the towns, and snarling packs <lb/>
            of dogs hunt her from the cross-ways. It will come to pass; <lb/>
            a god forebodes it; there is a divinity in a lover, and Venus <lb/>
            unjustly forsaken takes dire vengeance.</p>
          <p>But you, my girl, reject forthwith the counsels of this <lb/>

          <p>LOVE, thou offerest me always a smiling countenance in <lb/>
            order to allure me; but afterwards I find thee, to my sorrow, <lb/>
            gloomy and severe. What quarrel hast thou with me, cruel <lb/>
            boy ? Is it a great glory for a god to have laid snares for a <lb/>
            man ? Toils are now spread for me ; now crafty Delia fur­ <lb/>
            tively cherishes I know not whom2 in the silent night. She <lb/>
            indeed denies this over and over again; but it is hard to be­ <lb/>
            lieve her, for she makes just as pertinacious denials about me <lb/>
            to her husband. Unfortunate that I am, I taught her myself <lb/>
            how to elude her guardians; alas, alas ! I am now the victim <lb/>
            of my own art. She has now learned how to invent pre­ <lb/>
            tences for lying alone, and how to make the doors turn on <lb/>
            noiseless hinges. And then I gave her juices and herbs, for <note type="footnote"> I Elegy VII.] This must have been written before the preceding Elegy, <lb/>
            (and probably in A. U. c. 724,) for here he only suspects what there he <lb/>
            speaks of as a fact already beyond all doubt. The unfortunate lover <lb/>
            complains that he is caught in his own trap, for he has taught Delia how <lb/>
            to deceive. Then he appeals to her husband, makes a clean breast of it, <lb/>
            and invites the poor man to make common cause with him. This is <lb/>
            rather a bold step, it must be owned ; it is asking too much, as Ovid says, <lb/>
            Trist. ii. 457 : <lb/>

            Grainger and Dunlop are shocked at the impropriety of this proceeding, <lb/>
            but without much reason. They forget the class to which Delia belonged, <lb/>
            and the probability that her intimacy with Tibullus was no news to her <lb/>
            husband. The address to that person is an exquisite piece of persiflage <lb/>
            and nothing more. </note><note type="footnote"> a / know not whom.] Nescio quern: this is not to be understood liter <lb/>

          <p>But you, incautious husband of the tricksome girl, keep <lb/>
            me too, that she may be hindered from erring at all. Take <lb/>
            care that she is not profuse in her compliments to young <lb/>
            men, nor let her recline with her robe loose so as to ex­ <lb/>
            pose her bosom ; let her not betray you with secret looks and <lb/>
            nods, nor dip her finger in liquid, and draw marks on the table. <lb/>
            If she goes out very often, be on your guard; or if she says <lb/>
            she intends to visit the rites of the Bona Dea to which males <lb/>
            are not admitted. But if you will intrust her to me, I will <lb/>
            follow her alone to the altar; and then far it be from me to <lb/>
            doubt the vigilance of my own eyes. I remember that I often <lb/>
            touched her hand under pretence of examining her jewels or <lb/>
            her seal. Often I plied you with strong wine till you fell <lb/>
            asleep, while I secured my victory by drinking sober draughts <lb/>
            mingled with water. I did not wrong you intentionally; for­ <lb/>
            give me, as I confess my fault; Love commanded it should be <lb/>
            so, and who can fight against the gods ? I am the very man, <lb/>
            nor will I now be ashamed to tell the truth, at whom your dog <lb/>
            used to bark all night long. It is not for nothing that some <lb/>
            one just now is always stopping before your threshold; that he <lb/>
            looks about, retreats, pretends to pass the house, and presently <lb/>
            comes back alone, and hawks and hems close by the door. Some <lb/>
            furtive amour is preparing for you, I know not what; bestir <lb/>
            yourself, I beg, while you may; as yet your boat swims in <lb/>
            smooth water. What use is it to have a charming wife, if you <lb/>
            cannot keep what you have got ? It is in vain you have locks <lb/>
            to your doors. While she embraces you, she sighs for other <lb/>
            absent loves, and suddenly feigns a head-ache. But intrust <lb/>
            her to my keeping; I do not refuse to endure stripes, I do <lb/>
            not object to have my feet put in fetters, if I let her escape. <lb/>
            Then keep off, all you who dress your hair with art, whose <lb/>
            tunics hang loose upon your breasts. Any man that comes <lb/>
            this way, to hinder all chance of his doing mischief, let him <lb/>
            keep off, and not stop until he is far away in another street.</p>
          <p>Thus the god himself commands it to be done; thus the <lb/>
            great priestess has conveyed to me the injunctions of the <lb/>
            divine oracle. Once she is agitated and distraught by the <lb/>
            impulse of Bellona, she fears neither scorching flame, nor <lb/>
            lashes; she lacerates her own arms with an axe, and unmur­ <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            muringly sprinkles the goddess with her blood ; with a spike <lb/>
            thrust through her side, and her bosom torn, she stands, and. <lb/>
            chants the events which the great goddess foretells. " For­ <lb/>
            bear from assailing a girl whom Love guards, lest you be <lb/>
            afterwards taught a terrible lesson. Touch her, and your <lb/>
            wealth shall pass away, like the blood from my wounds, like <lb/>
            these ashes scattered by the winds." And on you, my Delia, <lb/>
            she denounced I know not what penalties: but if you receive <lb/>
            me, I will pray her to be light with you. I do not spare you <lb/>
            for your own sake ; but your mother moves me, and the ex­ <lb/>
            cellent old woman subdues my resentment. She brings you <lb/>
            to me in the dark, and mutely and in great fear joins our <lb/>
            hands together. She waits for me by night, fixed to the door, <lb/>
            and recognises the sound of my footstep a long way off. Long <lb/>
            may you live for me, sweet old woman: fain would I com­ <lb/>
            pound my own years with yours, were it possible. I will <lb/>
            always love you, and your daughter for your sake ; whatever <lb/>
            she does, she is, after all, your blood. Teach her only to be <lb/>
            chaste, though no fillet binds her hair, no long robe impedes <lb/>
            her feet.! And on me, too, let hard laws be imposed, nor let <lb/>
            it be possible for me to praise any beauty, unless she is before <lb/>
            my eyes. And if I am adjudged to have offended in any <lb/>
            way, and am pulled by the hair undeservedly, and am dragged <lb/>
            along the sloping street ; 2 let me not think of striking of you ; <lb/>
            but if such madness seizes me, I should wish myself without <lb/>
            hands. And be not chaste through fear alone, but let mutual <lb/>
            love keep you faithful in mind to me when I am absent. The <lb/>
            girl who was faithful to no lover, after age has overcome her, <lb/>
            sinks into want, and draws out the twisted threads with her <note type="footnote"> 1 Though no fillet, &amp;c.] The vitta and the stola were worn only by <lb/>

            in this Elegy. The poet enumerates Messala's exploits in Gaul, Cilicia, <lb/>

            Each individual had a separate Genius who regulated his lot, and was re­ <lb/>
            presented as black or white according to his fortunes. The Genius of <lb/>
            women was called a Juno. It was natural that the birthday should be <lb/>
            particularly set apart for the worship of the Genius, and that the marriage <lb/>
            bed should be under his special protection, and hence called genialis torus. <lb/>
            Genialis is used generally as an epithet for anything which conduces to <lb/>
            festivity, mirth, or pleasure. To practise abstinence is " to defraud one's <lb/>

            public ways ranked among the most important works of Roman magnifi­ <lb/>
            cence. Amazing labour, with vast expense, were devoted and combined <lb/>
            in extending them from the capital to the utmost limits of the known <lb/>
            world ; and in many instances they seem to have been calculated by their <lb/>
            construction to outlast the empire, of which they have not inaptly beer <lb/>
            termed the arteries. Nor was their construction alone the object of soli­ <lb/>
            citude, the care of looking to their repair was not thought unworthy the <lb/>
            greatest men of the republic. None but those of the highest rank were <lb/>
            eligible to the office of superintending that service; and we find Augustus <lb/>
            himself taking the charge of a district. The Appian Way, the most an­ <lb/>

            Rome to Capua. It was composed of three strata ; the lower of rough <lb/>
            stones or flint cemented together formed a foundation or-statumen ; the <lb/>
            middle stratum or rudera was of gravel; the upper of well-jointed stones <lb/>
            of irregular forms. It remains in many places perfect to the present <lb/>

          <p>IT cannot be concealed from me what import there is in a <lb/>
            lover's language of signs, and his softly-whispered words. <lb/>
            I have not the gift of sortilege, or of reading the secrets of <lb/>
            the gods in entrails; nor does the song of birds forewarn me <lb/>
            of things to come; but Venus, binding my arms behind me <lb/>
            with a magic knot, hath thoroughly instructed me, not without <lb/>
            many stripes.</p>
          <p>Cease to dissemble. The god of love burns more merci­ <lb/>

            you now to have bestowed such pains on your soft locks, and <lb/>
            to have so often changed their arrangement ? to have adorned <lb/>
            your cheeks with shining dye ? to have had your nails trim­ <lb/>
            med by the artist's skilful hand ? In vain are your garments <lb/>

            no pains to beautify, and though she has not spent much time <lb/>

            witched you with incantations and potent herbs in the silent <lb/>

            incantations attempt to drag down the moon from her chariot, <lb/>
            and would do it, were it not for the sound of the clashing <lb/>

            magic auxiliaries. The charm that is really noxious, is to <lb/>
            have touched the fair body, to have given long kisses, to have <lb/>
            been mutually entwined.</p>
          <p>Remember this, Pholoë, and be not unkind to the youth; <lb/>
            Venus punishes such misdeeds. Ask not for presents; let <lb/>
            the white-headed lover give presents, that you may warm his <lb/>
            frigid frame in your bosom. More precious than gold is a <lb/>
            youth with smooth shining face, and no rough beard to scrape <lb/>
            the bosom be embraces. Put your white arms beneath his <lb/>
            shoulder, and despise the treasures of kings. Venus will find <lb/>
            you opportunities to yield furtively to the ardent boy, when <lb/>
            he presses your tender bosom, and to give him moist kisses <lb/>
            with tilting tongue as he pants for breath, and to mark his <lb/>
            neck with your teeth.</p>
          <p>No joy can precious stones and jewels yield to her who <lb/>
            sleeps alone in the cold, and who is an object of desire to no <lb/>
            man. Alas, too late is love, too late is youth recalled, when <lb/>
            age has shed its whiteness on the head. Then is the <lb/>
            toilette a serious business; then are the locks tinctured and <lb/>
            changed with the green husk of the walnut, to disguise the <lb/>
            effect of years ; then what pains are taken to root out white <lb/>
            hairs, and to make the face cast its skin and be new again.</p>
          <p>But you whose life is in its blooming prime, use it while <lb/>
            you may; it is gliding away with no slow foot. And torture <lb/>
            not Marathus: what glory is there in smiting .a boy? Be <lb/>
            obdurate to the old; but spare the tender youth, I beseech <lb/>
            you. It is not bodily ailment, but excessive love, that tinges <lb/>
            his complexion with yellow. Poor lad! How often, when <lb/>
            you are far away, he pours out piteous complaints and sheds <lb/>
            no end of tears !</p>
          <p>“ Why does she scorn me?" he says. " The vigilance of <lb/>
            those who watch her might be defeated. The god of love <lb/>
            himself has given lovers the power of eluding restraint. I <lb/>
            know the arts of furtive Venus, how to breathe softly, and <lb/>
            how to snatch kisses without letting them be heard. I can <lb/>
            creep in noiselessly even in the dead of night, and open the <lb/>
            doors without the least sound. But what avail these arts, if <lb/>
            she spurns her wretched lover, and flies, cruel girl, from the <lb/>
            very bed in which I would embrace her ? Even when she <lb/>
            promises, with sudden perfidy she breaks her word, and I <lb/>
            must watch the livelong night in countless torments. While <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            I delude myself with the thought that she will come, I think <lb/>
            every movement I hear is the sound of her steps. Ah, perish <lb/>
            all vain arts and observances of wooing! I will clothe my <lb/>
            squalid body in shaggy garments. If my girl's door is shut, <lb/>
            if I have few opportunities of seeing her, alas, what good does <lb/>
            it do an unfortunate wretch like me to wear a flowing toga?"</p>
          <p>Cease your tears, poor youth ; her hard heart is unmoved, <lb/>
            and your wearied eyes are swollen with weeping. The gods <lb/>
            hate disdain, I warn you, Pholoë, and those who are guilty of <lb/>
            it offer incense in vain at their holy altars. This Marathus <lb/>
            used formerly to mock unhappy lovers, not aware that an <lb/>
            avenging god was behind him. He is said even to have often <lb/>
            laughed at the tears of an anguished lover, and purposely to <lb/>
            have thrown obstacles in his way. Now he hates all arrogant <lb/>
            disdain ; now he loathes every door that is shut fast at night. <lb/>
            Your punishment too will come unless you cease to be haughty. <lb/>

            you give me pledges in the name of the gods, which were to <lb/>
            be secretly broken? Ah! cruel one, though perjuries be at <lb/>
            first concealed, yet chastisement comes at last with noiseless <lb/>
            steps. Spare her, gods; it is just that the lovely should be <lb/>
            free once to break with impunity oaths sworn by your sacred <lb/>
            names. In hope of gain the husbandman yokes his bulls to <lb/>

            of gain unstable ships are led by sure stars over seas that obey <lb/>
            the winds. My girl has been seduced by gifts: but may an <lb/>

            shall be roughened by the winds ; her face and her locks shall <lb/>
            be sun-burnt, and her delicate feet shall be way-worn.</p>

            stream. You wept too; and I, unpractised in deceit, and <lb/>
            credulous, wiped your moist cheeks assiduously. How would <lb/>
            you treat me, were you not yourself in love ? 1 I pray that <lb/>

            the wars of Venus grow hot; a woman complains of locks <lb/>
            cut off her head, and of her doors broken open ; she weeps <lb/>
            and shows the bruises on her tender cheeks; and then the <lb/>
            victor himself weeps to think that his mad hands were so <lb/>
            strong. Meanwhile wanton Love suggests spiteful words to <lb/>
            swell the quarrel, and seats himself at his ease between the <lb/>
            angry pair. Ah, he must be stone or iron, who beats his own <lb/>
            girl; he brings down the swift vengeance of the gods from <lb/>
            heaven. Be it enough to cut off the fine hem of her robe ; to <lb/>
            undo the arrangement of her tresses ; to make her shed tears ; <lb/>
            thrice happy he whose anger has the power to make a gentle <lb/>
            girl weep. But whoever shall be guilty of ill usage with his <lb/>
            hands, let him carry shield and pike, and keep far aloof from <lb/>
            gentle Venus.</p>
          <p>Come to us, bounteous peace, holding ears of corn in thy <lb/>
            hand, whilst thy lap overflows with fruit.</p>

            is the ambarvalia celebrated in spring for the purification of the fields and <lb/>

            ears of corn. Let the earth rest on this sacred day; let the <lb/>
            ploughman rest, and suspend the hard labour of the furrow. <lb/>
            Unfasten the yokes ; the oxen must now stand at the full man­ <lb/>

            the sleek rustic, cheered by the plenteousness of his fields, will <lb/>
            heap large logs on the blazing hearth ; and a crowd of born­ <lb/>

            thanks to the rural gods. I sing the country and the gods of <lb/>
            the country: under their instruction, mankind ceased to re* <lb/>
            lieve their hunger with acorns. They first taught how to <lb/>
            cover the little log-but with green thatch. They too are said <lb/>
            to have first taught bulls to serve under the yoke, and to have <lb/>
            put wheels to the cart. Then wild food was dressed; then <lb/>
            apples were grafted; then the fertile garden drank irrigating <lb/>
            waters; then the golden grape yielded its pressed juices to <lb/>
            the feet; and sober water was mingled with the care-dispel­ <lb/>
            ling liquor of the vine. The country yields harvests, when <lb/>
            the earth annually sheds its locks in the season of the hot star. <lb/>
            In the vernal country the light-winged bee gathers the spoil of <lb/>
            flowers in its hive, and busily fills its combs with sweet honey. <lb/>
            The husbandman, wearied with the continual labours of the <lb/>
            plough, first sang rustic words in determinate measure ; and <lb/>
            first modulated, after his repasts, on the dry oaten pipe, the <lb/>
            airs he prepared to sing before the adorned images of the gods. <lb/>
            The husbandman, with cheeks reddened with ochre, first led <lb/>
            thy unfashioned chorus, 0 Bacchus; a he-goat, the leader of <lb/>
            the flock, was given to him from the full fold-a notable re­ <lb/>
            ward.2 In the country the youth first wove crowns of flowers, <lb/>
            and placed them on the heads of his ancient Lares. In the <lb/>
            country too the bright-fleeced sheep bears on its back the <lb/>
            wool that is to be the care of the tender damsels. Hence is <lb/>
            derived the labour of the females in the household, the dis­ <lb/>
            taff clothed with wool, and the spindle that revolves under <note type="footnote"> 1 Rough-haired ancestors.] Barbers were unknown in Rome until four <lb/>
            hundred and fifty four years after the foundation of the city, when they <lb/>
            were imported from Sicily. In earlier times the Romans universally wore <lb/>
            flowing hair and long beards; Scipio Africanus is said to have first set <lb/>
            the example of shaving. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A he-goat, &amp;c.] Tragedy was at first nothing but an annual hymn, <lb/>

            who sings as she busily plies the work of Minerva, and the <lb/>
            web sounds to the stroke of the lay.</p>
          <p>Cupid himself too issaid to have been born in the fields <lb/>
            among the herds and the unbroken mares. There he made <lb/>
            his first inexpert efforts with the bow: ah me ! what ex­ <lb/>
            pert hands he has now ! Nor does he take cattle for his <lb/>
            mark, as he did then; his delight is to transfix girls and to <lb/>
            bring down proud-spirited men. He strips the young man of <lb/>
            his wealth ; and constrains the old man to utter words that <lb/>
            disgrace him at the angry fair one's door. Led by him, the <lb/>
            girl steps furtively over the bodies of the sleeping watch, and <lb/>
            meets the youth alone in the dark. Timorously she treads the <lb/>
            ground on tiptoe, and gropes her blind way. Alas, unhappy <lb/>
            they whom the god severely persecutes; and happy lie on <lb/>
            whom kind Love breathes gently.</p>
          <p>Come, sacred boy, to our festive banquet; but lay aside thy <lb/>
            arrows, and hide far, far hence, thy glowing torch. Celebrate <lb/>
            the god, all of you, in song, and summon him with your <lb/>
            voices to the flock; let each summon openly to the flock, and <lb/>
            secretly to himself; or even openly each to himself, for the <lb/>
            jocund rout is boisterous, and the curved pipe dins in Phry­ <lb/>

            the yellow Stars are following the chariot of their mother in <lb/>

            after the example of Apollo, who in similar circumstances became the <lb/>
            herdsman of Admetus. So exasperated is he by the departure of his <lb/>

            in their anxiety, but found them not, and the crowd returned <lb/>
            home, frustrated, from the temple. Often did Latona grieve <lb/>
            to see the rough disorder of those sacred locks, which a step­ <lb/>

            execrates her venality, but is ready to indulge it at all hazards. " The <lb/>
            whole poem," says Grainger, " is a tempest of amorous and contrary <lb/>
            affections. By these our author is particularly distinguished from Ovid <lb/>

            the same passion ; whereas the reader will often find in one of Tibullus's <lb/>
            all those contrarieties and transitions which peculiarly characterize the <lb/>
            passion of love, and are so beautiful in poetry. This justifies the elegant <lb/>
            encomium which Joannes Baptista Pius bestows on our author: Princeps <lb/>

          <p>THY favour, Phœbus ! A new priest enters thy temple : <lb/>
            hither, come hither with harp and song; I entreat thee now <note type="footnote"> respecting this mysterious ingredient of witchcraft. Aristotle and The­ <lb/>
            ocritus mention a plant of that name, the smell of which made mares <lb/>
            turn mad for the stallion. Pliny says the hippomanes was a fig-like ex­ <lb/>
            crescence on the forehead of the new-born foal, which the dam immedi­ <lb/>
            ately bit off and swallowed; and if she was prevented, she would not let <lb/>
            the foal suck. Virgil, Georg. iii., agrees with Tibullus in making it a <lb/>
            liquid exudation. </note><note type="footnote"> I Elegy V.] The subject of this Elegy is the appointment of Messalinus, <lb/>
            Messala's eldest son, as one of the Quindecemviri, the fifteen priests of <lb/>
            Apollo, who had charge of the Sibylline books. " The Romans," says <lb/>
            Grainger, " were proud of being thought the posterity of the Trojans; <lb/>
            and their poets embraced every opportunity of making their court to the <lb/>
            people by adopting that notion. Nor was this prejudice confined to the <lb/>
            meaner sort of Romans; Julius Caesar, and his successor, either believed, <lb/>
            or affected from political motives to believe, that they were descendants <lb/>
            of Æneas. Nay, so far was this folly carried, that Augustus entertained <lb/>
            a design of transferring the seat of empire from.. Rome to Troy. This <lb/>
            the Romans dreaded not a little; and to such a height did their ap­ <lb/>
            prehensions increase, A. u. c. 734, when Augustus was in Syria, that Ho­ <lb/>
            race, all courtier as he was, is supposed to have written that noble ode, <lb/>
            Justum et tenacem, lib. iii. od. 5, obliquely to dissuade the emperor from <lb/>
            that measure. As this, however, was a very delicate subject, and none <lb/>
            knew better how to flatter his patron than Horace, he abruptly breaks off, <lb/>
            -non hæc jocosæ conveniunt lyræ : these things are unsuited to the <lb/>
            sportive lyre. Tibullus, however, not lying under the same obligations <lb/>
            to Augustus as the lyric poet, and neither courting the smiles nor dread­ <lb/>
            ing the frowns of the court, he, like a true patriot in all the enthusiasm <lb/>
            of poetry, introduces the Sibyl pushing on Æneas to the new settlement <lb/>
            destined by heayen for him and his followers in Italy. As Augustus pro­ <lb/>
            fessed a great veneration for the Sibylline books, and was anxious to be <lb/>
            thought the son pf Apollo, who, he said, fought for him at the battle of <lb/>
            Actium; the people (whose prejudices to the removing of their seat of <lb/>
            empire must have been augmented by our poet's well-timed prophecy) <lb/>
            would have regarded Augustus's breach of the Sibyl's orders as the most <lb/>
            impious of violations. Besides, so flagrant a disrespect, and in one too of <lb/>
            such eminence, might have produced the most fatal consequences to his <lb/>
            government, by weakening the reverence which his subjects entertained <lb/>
            for the Sibylline writings. This, Augustus was too sensible not to per­ <lb/>
            ceive, and too politicnot to avoid " </note> <lb/>

            aruspex forecasts the future, when a god has set marks on <lb/>
            the slippery entrails. Guided by thee, the Sibyl who sings <lb/>
            in hexameters the hidden things of fate, has never misled the <lb/>
            Romans. Phœbus, suffer Messalinus to touch the books of <lb/>
            the prophetess, and expound to him thyself, I beseech thee, <lb/>
            what she sings.</p>
          <p>She made known his destiny to Æneas, after, as the legend <lb/>
            tells, he bore off his father and his rescued Lares, nor thought <lb/>
            that Rome would be, when he looked back in sorrow from the <lb/>
            deep on Ilion and its burning gods. Romulus had not yet <lb/>
            formed the walls of the eternal city, in which his associate <lb/>
            Remus was not destined to dwell; but cows fed there on <lb/>
            the grassy Palatine, and humble cabins stood on the site of <lb/>
            Jove's citadel. Milk-swilling Pan lodged there under the <lb/>
            shade of the holm-oak, and wooden Pales carved with a rustic <lb/>
            bill-hook. The garrulous pipe, sacred to the woodland god, <lb/>
            hung on a tree, as the homage of the roving shepherd : the pipe, <lb/>
            in which the range of reeds decreases continually, for a smaller <lb/>
            tube is joined with wax to the first, and so on to the end. <lb/>
            But where the open region of the Velabrum2 extends, a little <lb/>
            boat used to ply over the water. In it the girl who was to <lb/>
            charm the rich master of the flock, was often ferried over to <lb/>
            the youth on festal days. Gifts of the fruitful country re­ <lb/>

          <p>“Intrepid Æneas,” sang the Sibyl, “brother of winged Love, <lb/>
            who carriest the sacred things of Troy in thy ships as thou <lb/>
            fliest, Jupiter now assigns to thee the Laurentian fields; that <lb/>
            hospitable land now invites thy wandering Lares. Troy will <lb/>
            then indeed marvel at itself, and own that thou hast done <lb/>
            wisely in traversing so long a way. There thou wilt be sanc­ <lb/>
            tified when the honoured water of Numicus1 shall have sent <lb/>
            thee to heaven as one of the Dii Indigetes. Lo, victory hovers <lb/>
            over thy wave-worn ships. At last the haughty goddess joins <lb/>
            the Trojans. Lo, the flames gleam before me in the camp of <lb/>
            the Rutuli; now I foretell death to thee, barbarian Turnus. <lb/>
            Before my eyes is the Laurentian camp and the wall of La­ <lb/>
            vinium, and Alba Longa founded by Prince Ascanius. Thee, <lb/>
            too, I see, priestess, who wilt charm Mars; Ilia, thou hast <lb/>
            deserted the altars of Vesta; I see your stealthy embraces, <lb/>
            and the fillets cast on the ground, and the arms of the ardent <lb/>
            god left on the shore. Pluck, bulls, the grass from the seven <lb/>
            mountains while now you may ; this will be the site of a great <lb/>
            city. Rome, thy name is destined by fate to rule the earth, <lb/>
            wherever Ceres looks down from heaven on her fields, from <lb/>
            where the rising of the sun is seen, to where his panting steeds <lb/>

            were heard in the sky, and that the sacred groves predicted <lb/>
            flight. The cloudy year, too, saw the rayless sun yoke his pale <lb/>
            horses ; and the images of the gods shedding warm tears; and <lb/>
            heard oxen foretelling the fates with human voices.</p>
          <p>These things were of old ; but now, mild Apollo, sink such <lb/>
            portents beneath the tameless ocean; and may the lighted <lb/>
            laurel crackle well in the sacred fire, giving omen of a happy <lb/>
            and sacred year. Ho, the laurel bath given good tokens; <lb/>
            farmers, rejoice ! Ceres will distend the full granaries with <lb/>
            corn, and the rustic, tipsy with must, will tread the grapes <lb/>
            till cisterns and vats shall fail to hold the abundant liquor. <lb/>
            The shepherd bedewed by Bacchus shall celebrate his festival <lb/>
            of Pales ; then keep aloof from the stalls, ye wolves. Filled <lb/>
            with drink he will set fire solemnly to heaps of straw, and leap <lb/>
            through the sacred flames. And the matron will bear chil­ <lb/>
            dren, and the son will catch hold of his father by the ears <lb/>
            and kiss him; nor will the grandfather weary of watching <lb/>
            over his little grandson, and prattling broken words with the <lb/>
            child. Then the lads who have done service to the gods will <lb/>
            stretch themselves on the grass where falls the light shade of <lb/>
            an ancient tree. Or they will spread out their garments for <lb/>
            screens and tie them with flowery sprays; and a crowned <lb/>
            goblet shall stand before them. Each spreads a banquet for <lb/>
            himself, and erects, a table and a couch of turf.' There the <lb/>
            youth will fling spiteful words at his girl in his drink, which <lb/>
            he will soon wish unsaid ; for savage as he is just now, he will <lb/>
            weep when he is sober, and swear that he was not in his right <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>So please thee, Phœbus, perish bows, perish arrows, only <lb/>
            let Love roam the earth unarmed. Good is the art of archery, <lb/>
            but since Cupid took up arms, alas, alas, to how many has <lb/>
            that art been woeful! And to myself especially, for I have <lb/>

            marl blasphemies.</p>
          <p>But come, whoever thou art, to whom Cupid is a grim­ <lb/>
            visaged commander, come to my tent and let us share the toils <lb/>
            of war together. This iron age prizes not Venus, but booty; <lb/>
            yet booty is won with many hardships. Booty hath girded <lb/>
            fierce ranks with hostile arms; hence comes bloodshed, and <lb/>
            slaughter, and expedited death. Booty impelled men to double <lb/>
            their dangers on the restless sea, when it put warlike prows <lb/>
            to insecure ships. He who fights for booty longs to possess <lb/>
            immense fields, that he may have countless flocks feeding <lb/>
            over multitudes of acres. He is anxious to procure foreign <lb/>
            stone; a column is carried to his mansion, amidst the con­ <lb/>
            fusion of the city, by a thousand strong pairs of oxen ; and a <lb/>
            mole locks in the tameless sea, that the fish at ease within it <lb/>
            may disregard the wintry billows. But let Samian pottery, <lb/>
            and plastic clay fashioned on the Cuman wheel, bear glad <lb/>
            cheer for you. Alas, alas, I see that our girls delight in <lb/>
            wealthy lovers. Come then spoil and plunder, if Venus <lb/>
            craves for opulence; that my Nemesis may swim in luxury, <lb/>
            and be made conspicuous by my presents as she walks through <lb/>
            the city. Let her wear thin robes spun by the Coan women <lb/>
            and inwoven with gold; let her be attended by dark-skinned <lb/>
            servants scorched in India, and blackened by the fire from <lb/>
            the near chariot of the sun; let Africa and Tyre vie in sup­ <lb/>
            plying her with their choicest colours, their purples of violet <lb/>
            and crimson tinge.</p>
          <p>I speak things notorious to all lovers: that fellow is now <lb/>
            royally installed, who was often forced to show his chalked <lb/>
            feet1 on the barbarian platform. <note type="footnote"> 1 Chalked feet.] Slaves imported from abroad, when they were ex­ <lb/>

          <p>I WOULD ere this have put an end to my woes by death; <lb/>
            but credulous hope cherishes life, and always says that to- <lb/>
            morrow will be better. Hope cheers the husbandman ; hope <lb/>
            commits the seed to the ploughed furrow, to be repaid by <lb/>
            the field with large interest. She catches birds with the <lb/>
            snare, and fishes with the rod, when the bait has previ­ <lb/>
            ously concealed the fine hooks. Hope consoles even the <lb/>
            slave who is fastened in strong fetters: the irons rattle on his <lb/>
            legs, yet he sings at his work. Hope assures me that Neme­ <lb/>
            sis will be kind; but she refuses. Oh, stubborn girl, be not <lb/>
            stronger than a goddess! Spare me, I implore you by the <lb/>
            bones and premature death of your sister; so may the little <lb/>
            one rest well beneath the gentle earth. She is sacred to me ; <lb/>
            I will offer gifts upon her tomb, and garlands wet with my <lb/>
            tears. I will fly to her tomb, and sit there a suppliant, and <lb/>
            complain of my fate to her mute dust. She will not suffer <lb/>
            me, her client, always to weep for your sake. I deprecate <lb/>
            her words, that you be kind to me, lest her neglected manes <lb/>
            send you bad dreams, and your sad sister stand before your <lb/>
            bed as you sleep, such in appearance as when, falling head­ <lb/>
            long from a high window, she went all bloody to the shades.</p>
          <p>I drop the subject, lest the bitter grief of my mistress be <lb/>
            renewed. I am not worth that she should weep once through <lb/>
            me; nor does she deserve that her speaking eyes should be <lb/>
            spoiled with tears. It is a bawd that injures me ; my girl <lb/>
            herself is good-natured. Phryne, the bawd, denies me ad­ <lb/>
            mittance, and goes backwards and forwards carrying notes <lb/>
            concealed in her bosom. Often when I hear sweet tones <lb/>
            from my mistress's hard threshold, that old wretch says she <lb/>
            is not at home. Often when a night has been promised me <lb/>
            she brings me word that my girl is ill, or that she is frightened <lb/>
            by some threatening events or other. Then I am mortally <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy VII.] The poet would long ago have ended his woes by death, <lb/>
            had he not been sustained by the catholic cordial of hope. He implores <lb/>

            whose tomb he will repair as a suppliant; and he inveighs against the go- <lb/>

          <p>HE was made of iron who first tore the beloved maid from <lb/>

            was he who could bear such grief, and survive the loss of his <lb/>
            mistress. I have not such fortitude; such power of endur­ <lb/>
            ance is not in my nature. Sorrow breaks even stout hearts. <lb/>
            Nor am I ashamed to speak the truth, and to confess my dis­ <lb/>
            gust for a life that has suffered so many woes. So when I <lb/>
            shall have been changed into a thin shade, and the black dust <lb/>
            shall cover my white bones, may Neæra with long dishevelled <lb/>
            hair come and weep before my funeral pile. But let her come <lb/>
            accompanied by her dear sorrowing mother; and let the one <lb/>

            when they have collected them, let them first sprinkle them <lb/>

            soak the moisture from them with linen cloths, and lay them <lb/>
            dry in their marble home. Then be there poured upon them <lb/>

          <p>WHAT avails it, Nerera, to have wearied the gods with <lb/>
            vows, and to have offered them pleasing incense with many <lb/>
            prayers ? I have not done this that I might issue forth from <lb/>
            a marble mansion, as the distinguished scion of an illustrious <lb/>
            house; or that my oxen might till many acres of land, and <lb/>
            the kindly earth yield me large crops ; but that I might share <lb/>
            with you the joys of a long life, and that my age might sink <lb/>
            to rest on your bosom, when I should have completed my <lb/>
            allotted span of life, and should be compelled to be ferried <lb/>
            naked in the Lethæan boat. For what were I the better for <lb/>
            a vast weight of gold ? Or though a thousand oxen tilled my <lb/>
            fertile land ? What to me were a mansion supported on <lb/>
            Phrygian columns, or on those from your quarries, Tænarus <lb/>
            or Caristus ?2 Or to have in my house plantations resembling <lb/>
            sacred groves, and gilded beams, and a marble floor ? What <lb/>
            delight have I in cloths dyed with the shell collected on the <lb/>
            Red Sea's shore, or with the murex of Sidon, or in all the <lb/>
            things besides which the vulgar admire ? These things excite <lb/>
            envy. The things which the vulgar love are mostly worthless. <lb/>
            A man's mind is not lightened or his cares removed by wealth, <lb/>

            thee I care for no gifts of kings. 0 brightly fair day, that <lb/>
            shall restore thee to me ! 0 day for me thrice and four times <lb/>

            vows are offered for that sweet return, I care not for kingdoms, <note type="footnote"> 1 Elegy III.] Tibullus complains of the inflexible cruelty of Neæra, <lb/>

          <p>MAY the gods grant me better things ; nor let those dreams <lb/>
            be true which hateful sleep presented to me last night. Avaunt, <lb/>
            dreams ; turn away your false, delusive faces, and expect no <lb/>
            longer to be believed. The gods give true warnings of com­ <lb/>

            flowed down his long neck, and breathed Syrian perfumes. <lb/>

            rare art, shining with tortoise-shell and gold. Striking its <lb/>
            chords with an ivory plectrum as soon as he entered, he gave <lb/>

            be able to see the laws of fate, and the events of coming <lb/>
            time. Hear therefore what I, unfailing prophet, what I, the <lb/>

            thee as no daughter is to her mother, as no fair girl is to the <lb/>
            eager bridegroom; she for whom thou dost weary the gods <lb/>
            with vows, who suffers not thy days to pass in peace, and <lb/>
            who mocks thee with nightly visions when sleep has wrapped <lb/>
            thee in her sombre mantle; she who is celebrated in thy <lb/>
            songs, the beautiful Neæra, prefers to be the bride of another. <lb/>
            The unkind girl has her own amorous cares which arc not <lb/>
            for thee ; Neæra rejoices not in the thought of entering a pure <lb/>
            house as a bride. Ah, cruel sex! woman, faithless name! <lb/>
            All perish whosoever she be that has learned to betray a <lb/>
            lover's hopes ! But she may be bent; their minds are change­ <lb/>

            Harsh Love hath taught his votaries to perform stubborn <lb/>
            tasks ; harsh Love hath taught them to bear stripes. That <lb/>
            I once pastured the white herds of Admetus, is not a tale in­ <lb/>

            the latter, who was so minutely communicative, should have omitted so <lb/>
            remarkable a fact, the mention of which would seem naturally prompted <lb/>
            by his esteem for Tibullus. But on the contrary he leaves us to suppose, <lb/>
            from a successive enumeration of poets, that Tibullus was considerably <lb/>
            his senior; and he regrets that fate had not allowed him to cultivate his <lb/>
            friendship. Moreover the chronology which these lines would establish, <lb/>
            can by no means be reconciled with various known events of our poet's <lb/>
            life. For instance, it would show him to have been only thirteen or <lb/>
            fourteen years of age when he bore a distinguished part in his patron <lb/>
            Messala's victorious campaign in Gaul. Tibullus fell sick at Corcyra on <lb/>
            his voyage with Messala to Syria, which was undertaken at the latest in <lb/>
            726 (B. c. 28); and it appears from the Elegy which he wrote on that oc­ <lb/>
            casion that he must have been for some time the favoured lover of Delia. <lb/>
            That Elegy is one of his most successful compositions, and his precocity <lb/>
            is unexampled, if before reaching the age of sixteen, he had earned all <lb/>
            these triumphs in war, and love, and poetry. Lastly, Horace must have <lb/>
            jeen forty when he wrote the Epistle in which he compliments Tibullus as <lb/>

            out springs of fresh water; how the approach may be made <lb/>
            easy for thy own men, and difficult for the enemy, and how <lb/>
            the soldier may be kept in vigour by continual rivalry for <lb/>
            praise; who best casts the heavy javelin or the light arrow, <lb/>
            or bursts through impediments with the stiff pike; who can <lb/>
            restrain the swift steed with a tight rein, or throw the reins <lb/>
            loose to the slow one, and urge the animal straight forward, <lb/>
            or compel it to wheel round in a narrow circle; who excels <lb/>
            with the shield, in guarding right or left, whether the shock <lb/>
            of the spear come this way or that; or in hitting the mark <lb/>
            with the sling. When comes the strife of bold Mars, and the <lb/>
            adverse lines prepare to meet, then thy promptitude is seen in <lb/>
            forming the order of battle, whether it is requisite that the <lb/>
            forces should be drawn up in a square with a long and even <lb/>
            front, or in two wings, so that the right, should attack the <lb/>
            enemy's left, the left his right, and that the two should achieve <lb/>
            a double victory. Nor does my song praise at random; for <lb/>
            I state things prowed in war: witness for me the brave soldier <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            of the vanquished Iapydia; witness the crafty Pannonian, <lb/>
            everywhere driven back into the cold Alps ; and witness that <lb/>
            poor Arupinian, a soldier born, to see whom, so unbroken by <lb/>
            age, might make one wonder less at Pylian Nestor's reputed <lb/>
            three centuries. For though the old man may have seen <lb/>
            Titan bring back a hundred fruitful years, yet he will spring <lb/>
            boldly on a swift courser's back, and govern him with the <lb/>
            reins. Under thy command the horse-taming nation, that <lb/>
            never turned their backs before, bent their free necks to the <lb/>
            Roman chain.</p>
          <p>Nor shalt thou be content with these things ; for greater <lb/>
            are at hand, as I have ascertained by veracious auguries such <lb/>
            as Melampus son of Amythaon1 could not surpass. Thou <lb/>
            hadst just put on a garment shining with Tyrian woof at the <lb/>
            dawn of the day that led in the fertile years; when the Sun <lb/>
            rose brighter out of the waves, and the discordant winds held <lb/>
            their rude breath, nor did the sinuous streams run their ac­ <lb/>
            customed course ; even the stormy sea was calm, no bird <lb/>
            swept through the air, no rough quadruped depastured the <lb/>
            dense woods, when deep silence was afforded for the hearing <lb/>
            of thy wishes. Jupiter himself came in his light chariot <lb/>
            through the empty air, left the heaven-touching top of Olym­ <lb/>
            pus, lent an attentive ear to thy prayers, and assented to <lb/>
            them all with his infallible nod. The fire applied to the altar <lb/>
            shone out joyously above the heaped brands. Begin then <lb/>
            with divine encouragement to do great deeds ; be thy triumphs <lb/>
            unlike those of others. Neighbouring Gaul will not be able <lb/>
            to withstand thee in war, nor the bold warriors of broad Spain; <lb/>
            nor the wild land possessed by the Tyrian colonists, nor those <lb/>

            the Getæ, whose country is watered by the Hebrus, the Tanai's, <lb/>
            and the Mosynos. Why dwell on details ? Far as Oceanus <lb/>
            bounds the habitable globe with his waters, there is no region <lb/>
            which will stand against thee in arms. The Briton, yet un­ <lb/>
            conquered by Roman warfare, awaits thee, and the other part <lb/>
            of the world beyond the course of the sun. For the earth is <lb/>
            seated in the midst of the ambient air, and its whole orb is <lb/>
            divided into five parts; and two of these are always made <lb/>
            waste by icy cold. There the ground is always covered with <lb/>
            thick mist, and the flowing wave is arrested in its course by <lb/>
            frost, and stiffens into dense ice and snow; for Titan has <lb/>
            never carried his beams above those regions. But the middle <lb/>
            region is always exposed to the heat of Phoebus, whether he <lb/>
            approaches nearer the earth in his summer orbit, or hurries <lb/>
            swiftly through the short days of winter. There therefore <lb/>
            the earth is not thrown up by the ploughshare, nor does it <lb/>
            yield corn-crops or fodder. Neither Bacchus nor Ceres blesses <lb/>
            the fields, nor do animals inhabit the scorched region. Be­ <lb/>
            tween it and the cold regions are placed the two fertile zones, <lb/>
            our own and that which is opposite to it. Both these are <lb/>
            tempered alike by the climate that adjoins them on either <lb/>
            hand, in such wise that the one climate counteracts the other. <lb/>
            Hence the year revolves for us through mild seasons; hence <lb/>
            the bull has learned to submit his neck to the yoke, and the <lb/>
            flexible vine to ascend the lofty branches of the elm; the <lb/>
            annual crop yields mature harvests, the earth is cleft with <lb/>
            steel, the sea with the keel, and towns arise with walls of <lb/>
            masonry. So when thy deeds shall have marched through <lb/>
            new triumphs, thou alone wilt be declared the greatest in the <lb/>
            two worlds.</p>
          <p>I am not adequate to the heralding of such glory, not <lb/>
            though Phœbus himself should dictate to me the strains I <lb/>
            should sing. Thou hast Valgius, who may gird himself up <lb/>
            for this great effort; no one comes nearer than he to immortal <lb/>
            Homer. I too will not be idle, but will devote my labour to <note type="footnote"> 1The Araxes for boundary.] Tomyris, queen of the Scythians, de. <lb/>

            thy praises, though Fortune, adverse to me, impairs my powers, <lb/>
            as is her wont. For whereas of old my house shone with <lb/>
            great wealth, I had yellow crops to enrich granaries that were <lb/>
            too small for my exuberant harvests, and vast flocks and herds <lb/>
            feeding on the hills, plenty for their master, and too much for <lb/>
            thieves and wolves ; now regret remains ; for my grief is re­ <lb/>
            newed as often as sad memory recalls the years that are past. <lb/>
            But though worse befall, and I am despoiled of what is left, <lb/>
            my Muses will not fail to celebrate thee. Nor shall Pierian <lb/>
            honours alone be paid to thee ; for thee I would dare to go <lb/>
            through the wild waves, though the wintry billows swell be­ <lb/>
            neath the winds ; for thee I would stand alone in the thick of <lb/>
            battle, or cast my small body into the flames of AEtna. All I <lb/>
            am is thine; if then thou hast a little regard for me ; be it as <lb/>
            much or as little as thou wilt, if it be but at all; the Lydian <lb/>
            realm or the fame of Gylippus' were not more precious to <lb/>
            me, nor would I choose in preference the ability to write <lb/>
            books like Homer's. But if this poem of mine, the whole or <lb/>
            a part of it, be either well approved or slightly skimmed by <lb/>
            thee, no Fates shall put an end to my poetic laudations of <lb/>
            thee. Even when the tomb shall have covered my bones; <lb/>
            whether my death is near at hand, or a long life remains for <lb/>
            me; should I be transformed, and range the solid plains as a <lb/>
            horse, or become a bull, the glory of the slow herd, or as a <lb/>
            bird be wafted with wings through the liquid air, whatever <lb/>
            human form I may assume again after a long lapse of time, <lb/>
            I will add new poems in thy praise to those I have begun.</p>

            of no avail for thee to have whetted thy hard teeth for fight, <lb/>
            but may Love preserve him safe for me. But Diana and the <lb/>
            chase drive all thoughts of me from his mind. Oh perish the <lb/>
            forests and the hounds ! What infatuation to wish to hurt <lb/>
            your soft hands in enclosing thick-wooded hills with toils ! <lb/>
            What pleasure is it to creep stealthily into the lairs of wild <lb/>
            beasts, and scar your white legs with hooked brambles ? Yet <lb/>
            that I might roam with you, Cerinthus, I myself would carry <lb/>
            the twisted nets through the mountains. I myself would <lb/>
            track the steps of the swift stag, and loose the iron chains <lb/>
            from the hound. Then, then would the forests please me, <lb/>
            though I be convicted of lying down with you, light of my <lb/>
            eyes, before the very toils. Then let the boar come to them ; <lb/>
            he shall escape unhurt, rather than he shall disturb the joys of <lb/>
            eager Venus. Now let there be no Venus without me; but, <lb/>
            obedient to Diana's law, spread the nets, chaste youth, with <lb/>
            chaste hands. And whosoever shall surreptitiously trespass <lb/>
            upon my delight, may she fall into the grasp of wild beasts <lb/>
            and be torn to pieces. But you, Cerinthus, leave the chase <lb/>

            sweeter than the city ? Is a villa a fit place for a girl ? And <lb/>
            the cold Arnus in the Aretine district ? Now stay here, <lb/>
            Messala, who indeed are too importunately anxious about me, <lb/>
            and too often ready to take me on an unseasonable journey. <lb/>
            Carried hence, I leave my soul and my senses behind me, <lb/>
            since you will not let me exercise my own will.</p>

            A fearful quantity of rhymes. <lb/>
            I think a thousand lines, ay ten, <lb/>

            Not written upon foolscap base, <lb/>
            To blot, and alter, and erase ; <lb/>
            On royal paper smooth and fine <lb/>

            And silver clasp, and silken clew, <lb/>
            Its shape by rule exactly right, <lb/>

            Such different lights to those will show him <lb/>
            Who see himself, or read his poem.</p>
          <p>What title can this creature fit, <lb/>

            Or aught, if ever aught arises, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>BORNE swiftly o'er the seas to Phrygia's woody strand, <lb/>
            Atys with rapid haste infuriate leap'd to land; <lb/>
            Where high-inwoven groves in solemn darkness meet, <lb/>
            Rush'd to the mighty deity's remote and awful seat, <lb/>
            And wilder'd in his brain, fierce inspiration's prey, <lb/>
            There with a broken flint he struck his sex away.</p>
          <p>Soon as he then beheld his comely form unmann'd, <lb/>
            While yet the purple blood flow'd reeking on the land <lb/>
            Seized in his snowy grasp the drum, the timbrel light, <lb/>
            That still is heard, dread Cybele, at thine initiate rite, <lb/>
            And struck the quivering skin, whence hollow echoes flew, <lb/>
            And raised this panting song to his infuriate crew.</p>
          <p>" Ye priests of Cybele, or rather let me say, <lb/>
            For ye are men no longer, ye priestesses, away ! <lb/>
            Together pierce the forest, great Cybele's domains, <lb/>
            Ye vagrant flocks of her on Dindymus who reigns. <lb/>
            Ye, like devoted exiles, who, seeking foreign lands, <lb/>
            Have follow'd me your leader, have bow'd to my commands ; <lb/>
            Have cross'd the salt-sea wave, have dared the raging storms, <lb/>
            And, loathing woman's love, unmann'd your lusty forms; <lb/>
            The sense of error past let laughing frenzy blind; <lb/>
            Let doubt, let thought itself be driven from the mind. <lb/>
            Haste, haste, together haste to Cybele divine ! <lb/>
            Seek we her Phrygian grove and dark sequester'd shrine, <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            Where cymbals clash, where drums resound their deepening <lb/>
            tone, <lb/>
            Where Phrygia's crooked pipe breathes out its solemn drone, <lb/>
            Where votaresses toss their ivy-circled brows, <lb/>
            And urge with piercing yells their consecrated vows, <lb/>
            Where the delirious train disport as chance may lead: <lb/>
            Thither our vows command in mystic dance to speed."</p>
          <p>Thus Atys, female now, to female comrades sung. <lb/>
            The frantic chorus rose from many a panting tongue; <lb/>
            He-echoes the deep timbrel, the hollow cymbals ring, <lb/>
            And all to verdant Ida run madly as they sing. <lb/>
            Though breathless, still impetuous with inspiration's force, <lb/>
            Raving and bewilder'd, scarce conscious of her course, <lb/>
            As the unbroken heifer will By the threaten'd yoke, <lb/>
            Atys through gloomy woods, where never sun-beam broke, <lb/>
            Loud-striking the light timbrel, rush'd on with bounding stride, <lb/>
            And all the frantic priestesses pursue their rapid guide. <lb/>
            The fearful fane at length their panting ardour stops, <lb/>
            Each, faint and unrefresh'd, in leaden slumber drops. <lb/>
            In languor most profound their eyelids are deprest, <lb/>
            And all ecstatic rage is lull'd in torpid rest.</p>
          <p>But when again the sun returning to the skies <lb/>
            Put forth his golden brow, when now his radiant eyes <lb/>
            Throughout white heaven, and earth, and ocean pour'd their <lb/>
            light, <lb/>
            And with thunder-pacing steeds he chased the shades of night, <lb/>
            Sleep then leaving Atys, who started from her rest, <lb/>
            To fair Pasithea fled, and sunk upon her breast. <lb/>
            When slumber's reign serene had frenzy's flame subdued ; <lb/>
            When Atys her fell deed in clearer reason view'd, <lb/>
            Beheld in what abode her future lot was placed, <lb/>
            And, ah ! how low she stood in nature's rank disgraced ; <lb/>
            Then, hurried to despair by passion's rising tide, <lb/>
            Again she wildly sought the country's sea-girt side ; <lb/>
            There, casting her full eyes o'er boundless ocean's flow, <lb/>
            Address'd her native land in plaintive words of woe.</p>
          <p>" My country, oh my mother! creatress, parent earth ! <lb/>
            My country, oh my nurse that fed me from my birth ! <lb/>
            From whom, as churlish slaves their kindly lord have fled, <lb/>
            To Ida's gloomy wood an exile I have sped, <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            With beasts their frozen dens for my abode to share. <lb/>
            And madly roaming rouse the fierce one from his lair. <lb/>
            Ah ! where, in what far point of this surrounding sky, <lb/>
            Shall I now deem, my native land, thy loved shores lie? <lb/>
            My longing eyeballs strain to cast their sight to thee, <lb/>
            While yet awhile my mind is from its frenzy free. <lb/>
            Must I for dreary woods forsake my native shore, <lb/>
            And see my friends, my home, my parents never more ? <lb/>
            No more the Forum seek, the gay Palestra's court, <lb/>
            The Stadium, urge no more each famed gymnastic sport ? <lb/>
            O wretched, wretched man ! while years shall slowly roll <lb/>
            For ever o'er and o'er again, grieve, grieve, my soul!</p>
          <p>" What grace, what beauty is there, that I did not enjoy ? <lb/>
            I, when in manhood's prime, a youth, or yet a boy, <lb/>
            The flower of all who trod the firm gymnastic soil, <lb/>
            The victor 'mid the crowd who wore the wrestler's oil. <lb/>
            My gates were ever thronged, and full my threshold swarm'd ; <lb/>
            With blooming garlands hung, that lovesick maidens form'd; <lb/>
            My mansion gaily glittered each morning as I sped <lb/>
            At earliest blush of sunrise with lightness from my bed.</p>
          <p>" And must I ever now a maniac votaress rave, <lb/>
            Heaven's devoted handmaid, to Cybele a slave, <lb/>
            Her frantic orgies ply, disgraced in nature's plan, <lb/>
            A part of what I was, a maim'd, a barren man ; <lb/>
            And dwell in Ida's caves which snow for ever chills ; <lb/>
            And pass my savage life on Phrygia's rugged hills, <lb/>
            Placed with the sylvan stag, the forest-ranging boar ? <lb/>
            Oh! now how soon I rue the deed, how bitterly deplore !"</p>
          <p>As from her rosy lips these wandering murmurs broke, <lb/>
            They rose to heaven and bore th' unwonted words she spoke <lb/>
            Indignantly unyoking her lions on the plain, <lb/>
            And rousing the grim beast that bore the left-hand rein, <lb/>
            Great Cybele, enraged, her dread injunction told ; <lb/>
            And thus to fury waked the tyrant of the fold.</p>
          <p>" Haste, fierce one, haste away! rush on with glaring ire ; <lb/>
            With inspiration's rage, with frenzy's goad of fire, <lb/>
            Drive the too-daring youth, who would my service <unclear>ny</unclear>, <lb/>

            Let all around re-echo to thine appalling roar: <lb/>
            Toss with thy sinewy neck on high thy glossy mane." <lb/>
            So spake terrific Cybele, and loosed her lion's rein. <lb/>
            Gladly the beast awakes his ruthlessness of mind, <lb/>
            Bounds, rages, reckless leaves the thicket crush'd behind, <lb/>
            Then swiftly gained the beach, washed by the foamy flood, <lb/>
            Where Atys in despair amid the breakers stood, <lb/>
            And springing fiercely forth-the wretch, no longer brave, <lb/>
            Into the forest plunged, and in a living grave <lb/>
            There pass'd her long devoted life, a priestess and a slave.</p>

          <p>ATYS o'er the distant waters, driving in his rapid, bark, <lb/>
            Soon with foot of wild impatience touched the Phrygian forest <lb/>
            dark, <lb/>
            Where amid the awful shades possessed by mighty Cybele, <lb/>
            In his zealous frenzy blind, <lb/>
            And wand'ring in his hapless mind, <lb/>
            With flinty knife he gave to earth the weights that stamp <lb/>
            virility. <lb/>
            Then as the widow'd being saw its wretched limbs bereft of <lb/>
            man, <lb/>
            And the unaccustom'd blood that on the ground polluting ran, <lb/>
            With snowy hand it snatch'd in haste the timbrel's airy <lb/>
            round on high, <lb/>
            That opens with the trumpet's blast, thy rites, Maternal <lb/>

            And upon its whirling fingers, while the hollow parchment <lb/>
            rung, <lb/>
            Thus in outcry tremulous to its wild companions sung:­ <lb/>
            " Now come along, come along with me, <lb/>

            Who seeking strange lands, like the banish'd of home, <lb/>
            With Atys, with Atys distractedly roam ; <lb/>
            Who your limbs have unmann'd in a desperate hour, <lb/>
            With a frantic disdain of the Cyprian power; <lb/>
            Who have carried my sect through the dreadful salt sea, <lb/>
            Rouse, rouse your wild spirits careeringly ! <lb/>
            No delay, no delay, <lb/>
            But together away, <lb/>
            And follow me up to the Dame all-compelling, <lb/>
            To her high Phrygian groves, and her dark Phrygian <lb/>
            dwelling, <lb/>
            Where the cymbals they clash, and the drums they resound, <lb/>
            And the Phrygian's curved pipe pours its meanings around ; <lb/>
            Where the ivy-crown'd priestesses toss with their brows, <lb/>
            And send the shrill howl through their deity's house ; <lb/>
            Where they shriek, and they scour, and they madden about,­ <lb/>
            'Tis there we go bounding in mystical rout."</p>
          <p>No sooner had spoken <lb/>
            This voice half-broken, <lb/>
            When suddenly from quivering tongues arose the universal cry. <lb/>
            The timbrels with a boom resound, the cymbals with a clash <lb/>
            reply, <lb/>
            And up the verdant Ida with a quicken'd step the chorus flew, <lb/>
            While Atys with the timbrels' smite the terrible procession <lb/>
            drew ; <lb/>
            Raging, panting, wild, and witless, through the sullen shades <lb/>
            it broke, <lb/>
            Like the fierce, unconquer'd heifer bursting from her galling <lb/>
            yoke ; <lb/>
            And on pursue the sacred crew, till at the door of Cybele, <lb/>
            Faint and fasting, down they sink, in pale immovability: <lb/>

            And lock d in dead repose the rabid frenzy lies. <lb/>
            But when the Sun look'd out with eyes of light <lb/>
            Found the firm earth, wild seas, and skies of morning white, <lb/>
            Scaring the lingering shades <lb/>
            With echo-footed steeds, <lb/>

            Sleep took his flight from Atys, hurrying <lb/>

            To memory woke and to collected madness.- <lb/>
            Struck with its loss, with what it was, and where, <lb/>
            Back trod the wretched being in despair <lb/>
            To the sea-shore, and stretching forth its eye <lb/>
            O'er the wide waste of waters and of sky, <lb/>
            Thus to its country cried with tears of misery:­</p>

            Fain, while my wits a little space are free, <lb/>

            On all thy past variety of bliss. <lb/>
            I was the charm of life, the social spring, <lb/>

            Thick as the flowers that hang at lovers' doors :- <lb/>

            A slave to bear what never senses can,- <lb/>
            Half of myself, sexless,-a sterile man ? <lb/>
            And must I feel, with never-varied woes, <lb/>
            The overhanging winter of these mountain snows, <lb/>
            Skulking through ghastly woods for evermore, <lb/>
            Like the lean stag, or the brute vagrant boar ? <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            Ah me ! all me ! Already I repent; <lb/>
            E'en now, e'en now I feel my shame and punishment</p>
          <p>As thus with rosy lips the wretch grew loud, <lb/>
            Startling the ears of heaven's imperial crowd, <lb/>
            The Mighty Mistress o'er her lion yoke <lb/>
            Bow'd in her wrath, -and loosening as she spoke <lb/>
            The left-hand savage, scatterer of herds, <lb/>
            Roused his fell nature with impetuous words. <lb/>
            " Fly, ruffian, By, indignant and amain, <lb/>

            Back to the horror-breathing woods again. <lb/>

            Thine ireful hair, and as at dead of night <lb/>
            Fill the wild echoes with rebellowing fright." <lb/>
            Threatening she spoke, and loosed the vengeance dire <lb/>
            Who gathering all his rage and glaring fire, <lb/>
            Starts with a roar, and scours beneath her eyes, <lb/>

            Down by the sea he spies the wretch at List, <lb/>
            And springs precipitous:—the wretch as fast, <lb/>
            Flies raving back into his living grave, <lb/>
            And there for ever dwells, a savage and a slave</p>
          <p>0 goddess ! Mistress. Cybele ! dread name ! <lb/>

            The chosen strength of all the youth of Greece, <lb/>
            Resolved to plunder Colchos of its fleece, <lb/>
            In their swift vessel braved the salt domain, <lb/>
            And swept with oars of fir its azure plain; <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            (For them the goddess, whose proud empire frowns <lb/>

            Soon as its beak the turbid billows clove, <lb/>
            And with the wreathing foam the steerage strove; <lb/>
            Strange forms arose amid the tossing spray, <lb/>
            Sea-Nereids wondering at the monster's way. <lb/>
            For two succeeding suns the gallant crew, <lb/>

            Then Peleus first with love for Thetis burn'd, <lb/>
            Nor Thetis then a mortal bridegroom spurn'd ; <lb/>
            Then Jove himself, to whom all nature bows, <lb/>
            Deem'd Peleus worthy a celestial spouse.</p>
          <p>Oh ! born in that proud day, that age of earth <lb/>
            Most blest, hail, heroes ! hail, of heavenly birth ! <lb/>
            Hail, mighty bark, that like a mother bore <lb/>
            The living host enwomb'd from shore to shore ! <lb/>
            Ye I '11 invoke ; ye shall my verse address ; <lb/>
            And Peleus, thee, whom glorious spousals bless, <lb/>
            Thessalia's shield, to whom all-powerful Jove <lb/>
            Yielded the fair himself had sought with love : <lb/>
            Thetis, of all the offspring of the sea <lb/>
            The loveliest nymph, bestows her love on thee ; <lb/>
            Ocean, who earth encircles with his tide, <lb/>
            And Tethys, give their grandchild as thy bride.</p>
          <p>At length the weary interval was spent <lb/>
            'Twixt love's avowal and its full content. <lb/>
            Thessalia's crowds with gifts the palace seek, <lb/>
            And looks of greater joy than words can speak. <lb/>
            The throng from Tempe's vale, from Scyros roams, <lb/>
            From Cranon's turrets and Larissa's homes, <lb/>
            And seek from every side the rich Pharsalian domes. <lb/>
            The earth's untill'd, the bullock's callous throat, <lb/>
            Free from the yoke, regains its softer coat:</p><pb n="240"/>
            
          <p>The lowly vineyard knows no weeding rakes, <lb/>
            Nor ox with sloping share the furrow breaks : <lb/>
            No pruner lops the trees' encumbering boughs, <lb/>
            And rust grows thick on the neglected ploughs. <lb/>
            But through the halls of Peleus' vast abode <lb/>
            Pale silver shone, or gold more warmly glow'd ; <lb/>
            Thrones white with ivory, tables rich with plate; <lb/>
            The dome all gladden'd with its regal state. <lb/>
            'Twas in the central chamber had been spread <lb/>
            For her, the bride divine, the nuptial bed ; <lb/>
            Of Indian ivory form'd, it shunn'd the eye, <lb/>
            Veil'd by its covering of the crimson dye. <lb/>
            On that were pictured men and times of old,- <lb/>
            And wondrous art the deeds of heroes told. <lb/>
            There Ariadne, whose distracted soul <lb/>
            Felt every passion that defies control, <lb/>
            From Dia's coast, where foaming billows beat, <lb/>
            On Theseus gazed and his receding fleet. <lb/>
            She scaree believes, though sleep beguiles no more, <lb/>
            Though waking sense beholds the lonely shore, <lb/>
            That she, so lately to her Theseus dear, <lb/>
            Can be the wretched maid forsaken here. <lb/>
            But he, the treacherous youth, spreads all his sails, <lb/>
            And gives his vows of love to passing gales. <lb/>
            Him Minos' daughter, left to weep alone,, <lb/>
            Like some wild Bacchant's form in sculptured stone <lb/>
            Looks on afar from ocean's barren side, <lb/>
            While anguish heaves her with its silent tide. <lb/>
            No more the fillet wreaths her locks of gold ; <lb/>
            Her snowy bosom no light garments fold, <lb/>
            Nor the thin laces of the girdle bind <lb/>
            Her swelling breast that scarce will be confined: <lb/>
            Before her feet the scattered vestments fall, <lb/>
            And restless surf is sporting with them all. <lb/>
            She nor her fillet heeds, nor floating vest : <lb/>
            Theseus, on thee alone her turbid breast, <lb/>
            Her tearful eyes, her thoughts are all engrost, <lb/>
            And every sense is in thy falsehood lost.</p>
          <p>Ah how thy mind was madden'd, hapless fair! <lb/>

            When <unclear>cruel</unclear> Theseus from th' Athenian road <lb/>
            Sail'd to proud Crete, thy tyrant sire's abode. <lb/>
            For Athens, forced by pestilence's reign <lb/>
            To dire atonement for Androgens slain, <lb/>
            Took from her sons the glories of the race, <lb/>
            Cull'd from her virgin train the flower and grace, <lb/>
            And to the Minotaur desponding bore <lb/>
            Recurring banquets on her native gore. <lb/>
            When Theseus learnt his noble country's woes, <lb/>
            Peril and painful death he rather chose, <lb/>
            Than still to see from Athens sadly led <lb/>
            These woeful funerals of the living dead. <lb/>
            Swiftly with pleasant gales his vessel gain'd <lb/>
            The sea-girt realm where awful Minos reign'd ; <lb/>
            There with enraptured eyes the royal maid, <lb/>
            There Ariadne first his form survey'd. <lb/>
            Her bed yet breathed its fragrance o'er her charms <lb/>
            To lull them chastely in a mother's arms, <lb/>
            Pure as the myrtle on Eurotas' side <lb/>
            That draws its limpid nurture from the tide, <lb/>
            Or as the flower, whose varied colours blow <lb/>
            Warm'd by the breath of spring with all their glow. <lb/>
            Now, ere she turn'd away her doting sight, <lb/>
            Her eyes were glistening with impassion'd light; <lb/>
            Her breast was heated with the fiercest flame, <lb/>
            And springing pulses throbb'd o'er all her frame.</p>
          <p>O maddener of the mind ! immortal boy, <lb/>
            Whose power still blends with woe our richest joy ! <lb/>
            0 beauty's goddess ! 0 celestial queen <lb/>

            With what wild storms ye toss'd that virgin's breast, <lb/>
            Who sigh'd whene'er she met the fair-hair'd guest <lb/>
            What chilling terror made her heart-blood cold ; <lb/>
            How sicklier far her cheek than pallid gold, <lb/>
            When Theseus, burning the fell brute to tame, <lb/>
            Sought instant death or everlasting fame ! <lb/>
            Rich gifts in secret to the gods she vow'd <lb/>
            To gain the wish she dared not breathe aloud : <lb/>
            Those pious offerings could another save. <lb/>

            The oak, and twists like reeds each giant bough. <lb/>
            Or thick with cones the oozy pine will tear; <lb/>
            And whirl the massive trunk aloft in air: <lb/>
            Far from the broken roots it falls to ground, <lb/>
            And scatters crashing devastation round : <lb/>
            So Theseus down the ponderous monster cast, <lb/>
            Who vainly raging gored the passing blast. <lb/>
            Thence back the victor bent his cautious tread, <lb/>
            Led through the labyrinth by a slender thread, <lb/>
            Which marked those tortuous paths, that thought in vain <lb/>
            Had toil'd to. trace, or memory to retain. <lb/>
            But why in long digression need I tell <lb/>
            The further fortune that the fair befell ? <lb/>
            Who from a sister's arms, a father's eye, <lb/>
            And e'en a mother's dear embrace could fly, <lb/>
            (Ah ! mother doom'd with flowing tears to moan !) <lb/>
            And gave up all for Theseus' love alone. <lb/>
            Nor need I tell, how the swift vessel bore <lb/>
            The pair to Dia's isle ; how from that shore <lb/>
            The traitor fled, while sleep her eyelids prest, <lb/>
            And lull'd her senses in unkindly rest. <lb/>
            Then, as with burning pangs she madly grieved, <lb/>
            Oft piercing shrieks her bursting heart relieved : <lb/>
            Often she climb'd the craggy cliff to gain <lb/>
            A larger prospect o'er the boundless main ; <lb/>
            Then rush'd, her ankles naked to the breeze, <lb/>
            Amid the breakers of repelling seas, <lb/>
            And there with half-drawn sighs, and meanings faint, <lb/>
            And streaming eyes, pour'd forth this wild complaint.</p>
          <p>" And hast thou, Theseus, on this desert strand <lb/>
            Left her, who fled for thee my native land; <lb/>

            Did rising pity never touch thy mind; <lb/>
            Nor e'er thy bosom to itself pourtray <lb/>

            But festive spousals and connubial bliss. <lb/>
            The oaths thy passion urged thee then to swear <lb/>
            Are now all scattered to the senseless air. <lb/>
            Then let no woman hence in man believe, <lb/>
            Or think a lover speaks but to deceive. <lb/>
            He, while ungratified desire is high, <lb/>
            Shrinks from no oath, no promise will deny ; <lb/>
            Soon as his lust is satiate with its prize, <lb/>
            He spurns his vows and perjury's curse defies. <lb/>
            I snatch'd thee, lost, from death's ingulfing wave, <lb/>

            Though by the will of thy harsh father tied <lb/>
            Thou couldst not wed, and hail me as thy bride; <lb/>
            Thou might'st have borne me to thy native soil, <lb/>

            No means, no hope of flight, no living breath, <lb/>

            Now light as clouds, when tempests rudely sweep <lb/>

          <p>Thus, when his natal threshold Theseus prest, <lb/>
            A father's death reproach'd his reckless breast. <lb/>
            Scarce less his woe, scarce lighter was his care <lb/>
            Than he had heap'd on the deserted fair ; <lb/>
            Whose hopeless gaze there linger'd to descry <lb/>
            His sails just fading into viewless sky, <lb/>

            Some from the cymbals their thin tinklings clash : <lb/>
            Some wake the trumpet's hoarser blast and strife, <lb/>
            Or the sharp note of the discordant fife.</p><pb n="247"/>
            
          <p>Such were the portraitures profusely spread <lb/>
            O'er the rich covering of the nuptial bed. <lb/>
            Pall'd with the sight the throng now bending home <lb/>
            Left for celestial guests the festal dome. <lb/>
            As when young Zephyr flits across the plain, <lb/>
            Rippling with early breath the placid main ; <lb/>
            What time Aurora smiles on day begun <lb/>
            With all the freshest glory of the sun ; <lb/>
            Soft break the waves, and low their laughing sound, <lb/>
            But soon with blasts increasing swell around, <lb/>
            And loud and louder roar, and far away <lb/>
            Raging toss back the purple beams of day ; <lb/>
            So the close crowd, that left the palace, spread, <lb/>
            And wide dispersing urged their quickening tread.</p>
          <p>Chiron the first, when all the dome was still, <lb/>
            His rural offering bore from Pelion's hill. <lb/>
            Whatever flowers the meads produce, whatever <lb/>
            Thessalia's broad and fertile mountains bear, <lb/>
            Whatever blossom some poor streamlet near <lb/>
            The tepid breezes of Favonius rear, <lb/>
            He brought in chaplets of promiscuous bloom ; <lb/>
            And all the palace breathed their glad perfume.</p>
          <p>Then Peneus came from Tempe's verdant glades, <lb/>
            Tempe, encircled by overhanging shades, <lb/>
            Where Nessos' lovely maids their carols pour. <lb/>
            Peneus the towering beech uprooted bore, <lb/>
            The plane, whose leaves in every zephyr play, <lb/>
            The lofty cypress, and the tapering bay, <lb/>
            And that tall tree whose form the sisters fair <lb/>
            Of blasted Phaeton were doom'd to bear. <lb/>
            These round the dome he placed, a blooming screen, <lb/>
            And veil'd the porch with interwoven green.</p>
          <p>Next came Prometheus, rich in craftiest lore, <lb/>
            Who yet faint marks of ancient penance bore ; <lb/>
            When erst his limbs in flinty bondage stiff <lb/>
            Were hung extended on the dizzy cliff.</p>
          <p>Then with his sacred queen and all his race <lb/>
            The sire of gods the palace deign'd to grace; <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            All, save thee, Phœbus, and thy sister bright, <lb/>
            The sylvan huntress upon Ida's height; <lb/>
            Alike ye Peleus both beheld with scorn. <lb/>
            Nor Thetis' nuptials would as guests adorn. <lb/>
            Soon as the glorious host were seated round, <lb/>
            A lavish feast the costly table crown'd ; <lb/>
            Then through their frames while aged tremors ran, <lb/>
            The ancient Fates their prescient song began. <lb/>
            Round their weak bodies a white robe was flung, <lb/>
            Whose crimson border o'er their ankles hung ; <lb/>
            Their purple locks with snowy bands were tied; <lb/>
            And aye their hands the sacred labour plied. <lb/>
            The left the distaff grasp'd, the right hand drew <lb/>
            The wool from thence, and twisted in the clew, <lb/>
            On the bent thumb the winding spindle held, <lb/>
            And as the whirlwind moves its course impell'd. <lb/>
            Still as they spun they bit off every shred <lb/>
            That roughly hung about the new-made thread; <lb/>
            And the coarse fibres rent in ragged strips <lb/>
            Clung white and dry upon their shrivell'd lips. <lb/>
            Rush-baskets held of wool a snowy choice : <lb/>
            Still as they toil'd they pour'd a piercing voice, <lb/>
            And hymn'd prophetic destiny's behest, <lb/>
            Whose truth all future ages shall attest.</p>

          <p>Such was the bliss to Peleus which of old <lb/>
            In lofty song the prescient Fates foretold. <lb/>
            For oft, while piety was yet revered <lb/>
            By pristine man, the gods on earth appear'd; <lb/>
            And, entering oft some hero's pure abode, <lb/>
            To human crowds immortal beauty show'd.</p>
          <p>Oft heaven's dread father, when the festal day <lb/>
            Would to his name its yearly rite display, <lb/>
            Himself would visit the resplendent fane, <lb/>
            And see his hundred chariots scour the plain. <lb/>
            Oft from Parnassus Bacchus drove his flocks <lb/>
            Of Thyads rev'lling with dishevell'd locks ; <lb/>
            When all the Delphians from their city pour'd, <lb/>
            And glad with smoking shrines the god adored. <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            Oft 'mid the deadly warfare, proudly seen, <lb/>
            Would horrid Mars, or rapid Triton's queen, <lb/>
            Or Nemesis, Rhamnusian maid, incite <lb/>
            Their armed throngs to brave the thickest fight. <lb/>
            But when this earth with impious crime was stain'd, <lb/>
            When virtue fled from man, and passion reign'd ; <lb/>
            When brothers dyed their hands in brothers' gore ; <lb/>
            When children wept a parent's death no more ; <lb/>
            When the harsh father sigh'd for early fate <lb/>
            To snatch the first-born of his buried mate ; <lb/>
            And leave him free from fonder ties, to press <lb/>
            Some blooming stepdame in his faint caress ; <lb/>
            When e'en the mother, warm'd by youthful charms, <lb/>
            Lured her unconscious offspring to her arms ; <lb/>
            Bade incest's curse her household gods condemn, <lb/>
            Impious alike to nature and to them ; <lb/>
            When rival honour crime and virtue knew ; <lb/>
            Their favour justly all the gods withdrew ; <lb/>
            No more to visit sinful earth would deign, <lb/>
            Nor let the eye of man their forms profane. LAMB.</p>

          <p>No peasant tills the fields ; the steers are eased <lb/>

            The palace, through its inner space discern'd <lb/>

            Rose high with plumy cushions. It was carved <lb/>
            From teeth of Indic elephants, and spread <lb/>
            With the shell purple's crimson of the se?</p><pb n="252"/>
            
          <p>l'he tapestried covering, wrought with antique forms <lb/>
            Of men, display'd heroic lore, in threads <lb/>
            Of wondrous art. For there upon the shore <lb/>
            Long echoing to the flowing sound of waves <lb/>
            Stood Ariadne, casting a far look <lb/>
            On Theseus as in rapid bark he passed <lb/>
            Away ; and pangs of furious wild despair <lb/>
            Master'd her throbbing heart. Nor yet believed <lb/>
            That she was Ariadne ; while scarce waked <lb/>
            From her deceiving sleep, she saw herself <lb/>
            Left wretched on the solitary sands. <lb/>
            The youth, who could forget her, flying beat <lb/>
            The billows with his oars, and left his vows <lb/>
            Light scatter'd to the winds and to the storms. <lb/>
            Him when the princess from the weedy shore <lb/>
            Discerned remote, she bent her straining eyes, <lb/>
            In posture like the statue of a nymph <lb/>
            Nodding in Bacchic orgies ; troubled thoughts <lb/>
            Rush'd on her soul, like waves; nor suffer'd she <lb/>
            The slender mitre on her yellow hair ; <lb/>
            Or the transparent scarf that o'er her breast <lb/>
            Spread light its covering ; or the girdle's grasp <lb/>
            'Gainst which her bosom's struggling orbs rebell'd ; <lb/>
            But all torn wildly off from all her form <lb/>
            Lay strewn on every side, and the salt seas, <lb/>
            White foaming at her feet, broke over them. <lb/>
            She nor her mitre, nor her floating zone <lb/>
            Regarded aught : on thee, 0 Theseus !-still <lb/>
            On thee she dwelt with heart and mind and soul <lb/>
            Distracted. Ah ! unhappy one ! how grief <lb/>
            And senseless frenzy seized her ! and what thorns <lb/>
            Of anguish Venus planted in her breast ! <lb/>
            In that heroic age did Theseus leave <lb/>
            Piræus' winding bay, and visited <lb/>
            The Cretan walls of that inhuman king. <lb/>
            For legends tell that Athens, erst constrain'd <lb/>
            By cruel pestilence, atoned the death <lb/>
            Of slain Androgeos ; and a tribute sent <lb/>
            Of chosen youths, and maids in beauty's flower, <lb/>
            To glut the monstrous Minotaur. When thus <lb/>
            The noble city underneath its curse <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            Groan'd heavily, the gallant Theseus chose <lb/>
            To perish self-devoted, in behalf <lb/>
            Of his dear Athens, rather than these maids <lb/>
            Find graves in Crete, yet need a funeral rite. <lb/>
            So, in light bark, with gentle breeze he sail'd <lb/>
            To awful Minos, and his stately court. <lb/>
            When on the stranger fell the eager gaze <lb/>
            Of that same royal virgin, who reposed <lb/>
            Within her mother's arms, on pillow chaste <lb/>
            That breathed sweet perfumes, like the myrtle buds <lb/>
            On green Eurotas' river-banks, or breath <lb/>
            Of the spring gale, that draws the colours forth <lb/>
            From all the streaky flowers. No sooner then <lb/>
            The gazing maid withdrew her glowing eyes, <lb/>
            And bent them on the floor, than all her breast <lb/>
            Conceived a flame, and all her vitals burn'd.</p>
          <p>Oil sacred boy ! that, merciless of heart, <lb/>
            Troubles!, alas, how cruelly ! the soul <lb/>
            With passion's fury, yet with human griefs <lb/>
            Minglest delights ; and thou, 0 Venus ! queen <lb/>
            Of Golgos and Idalia's leafy lawns ; <lb/>
            With what a sea of troubles did ye toss <lb/>
            The maiden's heart; with what a flame consume ! <lb/>
            When for the stranger of the yellow locks <lb/>
            She drew full many a sigh. How langnish'd she <lb/>
            In heart-struck terrors ! how her cheek grew pale <lb/>
            With yellowing tinge, like the wan shine of gold, <lb/>
            When Theseus, match'd against the monster, sought <lb/>
            Death or the palm of glory ! Nor to heaven <lb/>
            Vow'd she unpleasing offerings, though to her <lb/>
            Fruitless ; nor vainly on her silent lips <lb/>
            Whisper'd suspended hopes. For as the blast <lb/>
            Of irresistible whirlwind with a rush <lb/>
            Of sudden eddy shakes a branching oak <lb/>
            On the Mount Taurus ; or cone-rustling pine, <lb/>
            Dropping with gum ; and smites the knotted trunk; <lb/>
            Wrench'd from the roots, the tree falls headlong down, <lb/>
            And crushes all beneath it: with such force <lb/>
            Did Theseus quell the savage prostrated <lb/>
            In dust, and beating with his horns the wind.</p><pb n="254"/>
            
          <p>Then, in his glory, he secure retraced <lb/>
            His footsteps, governing with silken skein <lb/>
            His wandering feet; lest measuring forth his way <lb/>
            From winding of the labyrinth, he should err, <lb/>
            Foil'd by the cunning edifice, that spread <lb/>
            Its undiscoverable maze around. <lb/>
            But why, thus starting from my theme, recount <lb/>
            Superfluous tales ? how Ariadne left <lb/>
            Her father's aspect, and her sister's kiss, <lb/>
            And mother's folding arms ; who, wretched made, <lb/>
            Should with flush'd weeping mourn her daughter lost ? <lb/>
            But Theseus' love was dearer than them all. <lb/>
            Or how the ship was wafted to the shore <lb/>
            Of Naxos' foaming isle ; or how, when closed <lb/>
            Her heavy eyes in that disastrous sleep, <lb/>
            Ingrate lie fled, and left her.—Oft, they say, <lb/>
            With burning indignation she pour'd forth <lb/>
            Shrill outcries from the bottom of her heart; <lb/>
            Climb'd sad the steepy mountains, and threw out <lb/>
            A long glance o'er the vast and foamy deep ; <lb/>
            Or on the flat shore ran amidst the waves, <lb/>
            That swell'd their rippling surface opposite, <lb/>
            From her bared leg lifting the drapery light ; <lb/>
            Then, in extremity of anguish, spoke <lb/>
            These wild upbraidings, with her cheek all bathed <lb/>
            In tears, while shivering sobs confused her words:</p>
          <p>"And is it thus, perfidious man ! led far <lb/>
            From my own country, thou forsak'st me now, <lb/>
            Perfidious Theseus ! on a desert shore ? <lb/>
            And dost thou then depart, of watchful gods <lb/>
            Heedless, and ah ! bear with thee to thy home <lb/>
            Those vows, accurs'd by me ? Could nothing turn <lb/>
            Thy cruel purpose ? did no sudden thought <lb/>
            Of pity cross thee ? did thy hard heart feel <lb/>
            No soft, compunctious visitings for me ? <lb/>
            Not such thy utter'd promises ; not these <lb/>
            The hopes thy lips convey'd to me undone ; <lb/>
            But wedding joys and wishes all fulfill'd <lb/>
            Of marriage love : now to the winds of air <lb/>
            Blown and dispersed ! Let never woman trust <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            The oath of man ; let never woman hope <lb/>
            Faith in his tender speeches ! He, while aught <lb/>
            Inflames his ardour to possess, will fear <lb/>
            No oath, will spare no promise. But when once <lb/>
            His gust is sated, fears not what he spoke ; <lb/>
            Heeds not his perjured promise. Yet 'twas I <lb/>
            That from death's whirlpool snatch'd thee, and resolved <lb/>
            To sacrifice my brother Minotaur, <lb/>
            That I might spend with thee life's latest hour, <lb/>
            Deceiver as thou art !-and 'tis for this <lb/>
            That forest beasts must tear me ; birds of prey <lb/>
            Dismember ; and no heap of friendly earth <lb/>
            Be scattered o'er my corpse !- What lioness <lb/>
            In wilderness of rocks first brought thee forth ? <lb/>
            What sea conceived thee in its roaring depths, <lb/>
            And from its foaming billows cast thee out ? <lb/>
            Syrt, Scylla, or Charybdis, which, or what <lb/>
            Art thou, that for the sweets of life bestow'd <lb/>
            Mak'st this return ? But if thy heart repell'd <lb/>
            Union with me ; and if to thee seem stern <lb/>
            The laws of marriage which old Cecrops framed ; <lb/>
            Thou couldst at least have brought me to thy home, <lb/>
            That I with pleasant labour might have been <lb/>
            Thy handmaid ; tenderly thy snowy feet <lb/>
            Laving in limpid waters, or thy couch <lb/>
            Spreading with purple coverings. Ah ! what boots <lb/>
            This frenzy of misfortune ? Why complain <lb/>
            To the unconscious air, that neither hears <lb/>
            My utter'd speech, nor can in words reply ? <lb/>
            He now has nearly pass'd the middle seas ; <lb/>
            And not one solitary mortal meets <lb/>
            My gaze along the ocean's weedy shore ; <lb/>
            And Fate, insulting even my dying hour, <lb/>
            Envious denies the blessing of complaint <lb/>
            To listening ears. Oh, mighty Jupiter ! <lb/>
            Would that in time long past no ships had touch'd <lb/>
            From Athens on our coast ; no mariner <lb/>
            With dreadful tribute to the bull had loosed <lb/>
            His cable, and, perfidious, sail'd for Crete ! <lb/>
            Nor e'er that stranger, masking in sweet form <lb/>
            His cruel purpose, rested in my home 1 <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            Whither shall I betake me ? on what hope <lb/>
            Lean for support? Say, shall I seek again <lb/>
            The hills of Cretan Ide ? ah me ! the deep <lb/>
            Rolls broad its severing flood, and cruel forms <lb/>
            Of the wide seas a gulf impassable. <lb/>
            Or might I hope my father's succouring hand? <lb/>
            I, who could leave him, following this stern youth <lb/>
            While reeking with my brother's sprinkled blood ? <lb/>
            Shall I console my sorrows with the love <lb/>
            Of that so faithful spouse, while now his oars <lb/>
            Bend pliant in the billows, as he flies ? <lb/>
            Shall I pass inland, and forsake the shore ? <lb/>
            No dwelling has this lone, unpeopled isle : <lb/>
            There is no egress hence ; the sea-waves roll <lb/>
            A girdle round ; no plan, no hope of flight; <lb/>
            All solitary, silent, desolate ; <lb/>
            A prospect of inevitable death. <lb/>
            But let not yet my dying eyes grow dim, <lb/>
            Nor sense my faint limbs leave, ere, thus betray'd, <lb/>
            I ask the gods for vengeance, and attest <lb/>
            With my last breath the holy faith of heaven. <lb/>
            Ye, then, that with retributive revenge <lb/>
            Visit the deeds of men ; whose forehead 'twined <lb/>
            With snaky hair, waves with th' avenging wrath <lb/>
            Of my expiring breast, arise and hear ! <lb/>
            Come to my side : come listen the complaints, <lb/>
            Which, oh me miserable ! I perforce <lb/>
            Now from my inmost vitals breathe, thus lost, <lb/>
            Burning, and blind with my delirious rage, <lb/>
            Since from the very bottom of my heart <lb/>
            I heave this plaintive voice, oh suffer not <lb/>
            My tears and groans to vanish on the winds ! <lb/>
            But in the spirit that within him wrought, <lb/>
            When he forsook me on the desert shore, <lb/>
            In that same spirit, deadly to himself <lb/>
            And to his kindred, let him stain his house <lb/>
            With horror and pollution." <lb/>
            When she thus <lb/>
            Had given her sorrows utterance, and had call'd <lb/>
            In her distraction heavenly vengeance down <lb/>
            On Theseus' cruel deed, heaven's ruler bow'il <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            His head, and at his unresisted nod <lb/>
            Earth and sea trembled, and the firmament <lb/>
            Rock'd its bright orbs. But Theseus, dark of mind, <lb/>
            Dismiss'd from memory all injunctions past, <lb/>
            Though long with heed retain'd : nor lifted up <lb/>
            The gladdening symbol, that he safe return'd <lb/>
            To his own country's harbours, in the eyes <lb/>
            Of his long sorrowing father. Story tells <lb/>
            That when old Ægeus trusted to the winds <lb/>
            His son, who bent his galley's sails to leave <lb/>
            Minerva's towers, he clasp'd him in his arms, <lb/>
            And gave this mandate :­ <lb/>
            " Oh, my only son ! <lb/>
            More pleasant in mine eyes than length of life <lb/>
            My son ! whom I, perforce, dismiss to cope <lb/>
            With doubtful perils ; son ! so lately lent <lb/>
            Again to these fond arms, in the last stage <lb/>
            Of feeble years: since now my mournful hap <lb/>
            And thy own fervid valour tear thee hence <lb/>
            From these unwilling eyes, whose languid orbs <lb/>
            Still gaze unsated on my son's dear face; <lb/>
            Not glad I send thee hence; nor shalt thou beai <lb/>
            Symbols of prosperous Fortune. I will ease <lb/>
            My bosom of complaint, and soil in dust <lb/>
            My hoary locks; and on thy flitting mast <lb/>
            Suspend discolour'd sails; that this my grief <lb/>
            And soul-inflaming anguish may be read <lb/>
            In thy Iberian canvass, while its folds <lb/>
            Are tinged with dusky blue. If she, who dwelt <lb/>
            In blest Itonus, Pallas, who defends <lb/>
            Our race and city, grant that in the blood <lb/>
            Of that half human bull thy hand be red ; <lb/>
            Then bury these injunctions in thy heart; <lb/>
            Let them take growth, and flourish, so that time <lb/>
            May never root them out. Soon as thine eyes <lb/>
            Behold our hills again, then let thy crew <lb/>
            The dismal canvass on the yard-arm furl, <lb/>
            And hoist with ropes the sails of snowy white: <lb/>
            That, seeing, I may recognise the joy <lb/>
            Of that blest moment, when auspicious time <lb/>
            Returns thee present to mine eyes again." <note type="footnote"> S </note> <pb n="258"/>
            </p>
          <p>These mandates, which before with constant mind <lb/>
            He cherish'd, now from Theseus' memory fled, <lb/>
            Like mists from airy ridge of snowy Alp <lb/>
            Swept by the whirlwind. Still the father bent <lb/>
            From a high turret's top his straining eyes, <lb/>
            Anxious, and dim with weeping. When he saw <lb/>
            The sable swelling sails, from the steep rocks <lb/>
            He cast himself down headlong ; deeming then <lb/>
            His Theseus lost by an inhuman death. <lb/>
            So Theseus, glorying in the monster slain, <lb/>
            Enter'd beneath his father's roof, now changed <lb/>
            With funeral horror; and himself now felt <lb/>
            A portion of that anguish, which, ingrate <lb/>
            Of soul, he fix'd in Ariadne's breast: <lb/>
            When, wounded to the heart, a thousand griefs <lb/>
            Roll'd in her bosom, while she pensive bent <lb/>
            On the receding ship her lengthening gaze.</p>
          <p>But in another part, Iacchus, flush'd <lb/>
            With bloom of youth, came flying from above, <lb/>
            With choirs of Satyrs, and Silent, born <lb/>
            In Indian Nyse : seeking thee he came, <lb/>
            O Ariadne ! with thy love inflamed. <lb/>
            They, blithe, from every side came revelling on, <lb/>
            Distraught with jocund madness: with a burst <lb/>
            Of Bacchic outcries, and with tossing heads. <lb/>
            Some shook their ivy-shrouded spears ; and some <lb/>
            From hand to hand, in wild and fitful feast, <lb/>
            Snatch'd a torn heifer's limbs: some girt themselves <lb/>
            With twisted serpents : others bore along, <lb/>
            In hollow arks, the mysteries of the god: <lb/>
            Mysteries to uninitiated ear <lb/>
            In silence wrapt. On timbrels others smote <lb/>
            With tapering hands, or from smooth orbs of brass <lb/>
            Clank'd shrill a tinkling sound; and many blew <lb/>
            The horn's hoarse blare, and the barbaric pipe <lb/>
            Bray'd harsh upon the ear its dinning tune.</p>
          <p>Thus gorgeously with colour'd figures wrought <lb/>

          <p>When now the throng of Thessaly had gazed <lb/>
            Their eager fill, they reverently gave place <lb/>
            To step of gods approaching. As the gale, <lb/>
            Ruffling the calm sea with its murmuring breeze. <lb/>
            Stirs the sloped waves, at rising of the dawn, <lb/>
            Beneath the flitting lustre of the sun: <lb/>
            They, forward driven with gentle blast, roll on <lb/>
            Slowly, and as with sounds of laughter shrill <lb/>
            Dash their soft echo; till the growing wind <lb/>
            Freshens, and more and more in heaving swell <lb/>
            They float far glittering in the purple light: <lb/>
            So from the palace vestibule the throng <lb/>
            Flow'd gradual forth, and wandered wide away. ELTON.</p>

            Flush'd with its spoil and proud of amorous wounds, <lb/>

          <p>Do brides, 0 Venus ! hate the bridal bed, <lb/>

            Such, where Canopus crowns the fertile wave, <lb/>
            The mandate Flora to her Zephyr gave.</p>
          <p>" Permit no more," she cried, " the crown, that shed <lb/>
            Its radiance erst round Ariadne's head, <lb/>
            Alone in heaven to lift its lovely flame, <lb/>
            Nor any star possess congenial fame : <lb/>
            Bid the rich spoil of Berenice's brow <lb/>
            Dart rival beams and share that glory now."</p>
          <p>To heaven the goddess raised me, bathed in tears, <lb/>
            An added splendour to the starry spheres. <lb/>
            Betwixt the Lion and the Virgin chaste, <lb/>
            Close to Lycaon's child Callisto placed, <lb/>
            Turn'd from the east, I slow Boötes guide <lb/>
            In tardy progress to the western tide. <lb/>
            I stud that way, in that bright path I lie, <lb/>
            Oft pass'd by gods when journeying o'er the sky : <lb/>
            When night is still, and dark the solar blaze, <lb/>
            They tread my light, and trample on my rays ; <lb/>
            But dawn returning bids me Tethys greet, <lb/>
            And hide my splendour in her cool retreat.</p>
          <p>But still—and let me. Nemesis, reveal <lb/>
            In peace the truth no terror shall conceal ; <lb/>
            Let every star reproachful curses dart, <lb/>
            I will unfold the secret of my heart ! <lb/>
            Though high 'mid heaven's immortal splendour placed, <lb/>
            I still regret the fair whom erst I graced. <lb/>
            Upon her polish'd brows, while yet a maid, <lb/>
            Unbraided, unperfumed, my ringlets stray'd ; <lb/>
            And drank the breath in wedlock's costlier hours <lb/>
            Of rarest unguents and the balmiest flowers.</p>
          <p>And, 0 ye fair ! allured by Hymen's light, <lb/>
            Ere yet the husband gains his dearest right, <lb/>
            Ere your smooth bosoms heave from cincture free. <lb/>
            Let sweets in rich libation flow to me.</p><pb n="263"/>
            
          <p>Dear is the incense on my altar spread <lb/>
            By all who seek the chaste, the nuptial bed ; <lb/>
            But the foul offering of disgraceful lust <lb/>
            Shall sink forgotten in the barren dust: <lb/>
            Adulterers' gifts with loathing I reject, <lb/>
            Nor prize their worship, nor their love protect. <lb/>
            But bliss and passion ever young reside <lb/>
            With the fond bridegroom and the faithful bride.</p>
          <p>But, queen, when thou shalt gaze upon the skies, <lb/>
            And bid thine orisons to Venus rise, <lb/>
            Though blood must never stain the Paphian shrine ; <lb/>
            Hope not by prayers alone to make me thine : <lb/>
            With purest offerings urge thy costly vows, <lb/>
            And speed my wish'd return to deck thy brows. <lb/>
            There will I wave, nor heed what ills betide, <lb/>
            Though dark Orion seek Aquarius' side, <lb/>
            And constant storms and elemental wars <lb/>
            Proclaim the wild disorder of the stars. LAMB.</p>

            Why dim eclipse obscures the blazing sun; <lb/>
            Why stars at certain times to darkness run ; <lb/>
            How Trivia nightly stole from realms above <lb/>

            Immortal Conon, blest with skill divine, <lb/>

            The lock she fondly vow'd with lifted arms, <lb/>

            Of softer triumphs and nocturnal wars.</p>
          <p>O sacred queen, do virgins still despise <lb/>
            The joys of Venus and the nuptial ties, <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            When oft in bridal rooms their sighs and tears <lb/>
            Distract the parent's heart with anxious fears ? <lb/>
            The tears descend from friendly powers above; <lb/>
            The sighs, ye gods ! are only sighs of love. <lb/>
            With tears like these fair Berenice mourn'd <lb/>
            When for her virgin spoils the monarch burn'd ; <lb/>
            With sighs like these she gave him all her charms, <lb/>
            And bless'd the raptured bridegroom in her arms.</p>
          <p>But on the widow'd bed you wept alone, <lb/>
            And mourn'd the brother in the husband gone. <lb/>
            What sorrow then my pensive queen opprest, <lb/>
            What pangs of absence tore her tender breast; <lb/>
            When, lost in woe, no trace remained behind <lb/>
            Of all her virgin mirth and strength of mind. <lb/>
            Hadst thou forgot the deed thy worth achieved, <lb/>
            For which thy brows the imperial crown received ; <lb/>
            The wondrous deed that placed thee far beyond <lb/>
            Thy fair compeers and made a monarch fond ?</p>
          <p>But when for wars he left your tender arms, <lb/>
            What words you spoke, with what endearing charms, <lb/>
            Still breathed your soft complaints in mournful sighs, <lb/>
            And wiped with lifted hands your streaming eyes. <lb/>
            Didst thou, fair nymph, lament by power divine, <lb/>
            Or for an absent lover only pine ? <lb/>
            Then to the gods you vow'd with pious care <lb/>
            A sacred offering, your immortal hair, <lb/>
            With blood of slaughtered bulls, would heaven restore <lb/>
            Your lord in triumph to his native shore ; <lb/>
            Should lie, returning soon, with high renown <lb/>
            Add vanquished Asia to the Egyptian crown : <lb/>
            And I, fair lock, from orbs of radiance now <lb/>
            Diffuse new light to pay thy former vow. <lb/>

            By thy bright head, and yet remaining hair, <lb/>

            And well I know what woes the perjured feel: <lb/>
            But none can conquer unresisted steel. <lb/>
            Steel heaved the mightiest mountain to the ground <lb/>
            That Sol beholds in his diurnal round, <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            Through Athos' rocky sides a passage tore, <lb/>
            When first the Medes arrived at Phthia's shore. <lb/>
            Then winds and waves drove their swift ships along. <lb/>
            And through the new-made gulf impell'd the throng. <lb/>
            If these withstood not steel's all-conquering blow, <lb/>
            What could thy hairs against so dire a foe ? <lb/>
            O mighty Jove ! may still thy wrath divine <lb/>
            Pour fierce destruction on their impious line, <lb/>
            Who dug with hands accurst the hollow mine ; <lb/>
            Who first from earth could shining ore produce, <lb/>
            First temper'd steel, and taught its various use.</p>
          <p>As thy bright locks bewail'd their sister gone, <lb/>
            Arsinoe's horseman, Memnon's only son, <lb/>
            On flutt'ring wings descended from on high, <lb/>
            To bear the beauteous hairs above the sky ; <lb/>
            Then upward bent his flight, and softly placed <lb/>
            Thy radiant lock in chaste Arsinoe's breast, <lb/>
            Whom we Zephyritis and Venus name, <lb/>
            And on Canopus' shores her altars flame ; <lb/>
            When late the winged messenger came down <lb/>
            At her desire, lest Ariadne's crown <lb/>
            Should still unrivall'd glitter in the skies ; <lb/>
            And that thy precious hair, a richer prize, <lb/>
            The spoils devoted to the powers divine, <lb/>
            Might from the fields of light as brightly shine. <lb/>
            Yet bathed in tears I wing'd my rapid flight, <lb/>
            Swift from her shrine to this ethereal height, <lb/>
            And, placed amidst the fair celestial signs, <lb/>
            Thy lock for ever with new glory shines, <lb/>
            Just by the Virgin in the starry sphere, <lb/>
            The savage Lion, and the Northern Bear. <lb/>
            Full to the west with sparkling beams I lead, <lb/>
            And bright Boötes in my course precede, <lb/>
            Who scarcely moves along the ethereal plain, <lb/>
            And late and slowly sinks beneath the main.</p>
          <p>Though feet of gods surround my throne by night; <lb/>
            And in the seas I sleep with morning light, <lb/>
            Yet, 0 Rhamnusian maid, propitious hear <lb/>
            The words of sacred truth unawed by fear.</p><pb n="266"/>
            
          <p>The words of truth I wish not to conceal, <lb/>
            But still the dictates of my breast reveal. <lb/>
            Though these resplendent orbs in wrath should rise <lb/>
            And hurl me headlong from the flaming skies, <lb/>
            Though placed on high, sad absence I deplore, <lb/>
            Condemned to join my lovely queen no more, <lb/>
            On whose fair head, while yet in virgin bloom, <lb/>
            I drank unmeasured sweets and rich perfume.</p>
          <p>But now, ye maids, and every beauteous dame, <lb/>
            For whom on nuptial nights the torches flame, <lb/>
            Though fondly wedded to some lovely boy, <lb/>
            Your virgin choice, and partner of your joy, <lb/>
            Forbear to taste the pleasures of a bride, <lb/>
            Nor from your bosoms draw the veil aside, <lb/>
            Till oils in alabaster ye prepare, <lb/>
            And chastely pour on Berenice's hair. <lb/>
            But I th' impure adulteress will confound, <lb/>
            And dash the ungrateful offering on the ground. <lb/>
            From her no rich libation I demand ; <lb/>
            I scorn the gift of her unhallow'd hand : <lb/>
            But if the virtuous fair invoke my power, <lb/>
            Unbounded bliss shall crown the nuptial hour ; <lb/>
            To her shall concord from high heaven descend, <lb/>
            And constant love her soft retreats attend.</p>
          <p>And when, bright queen, on solemn feasts your eyef <lb/>
            Shall hail Arsinoe radiant in the skies ; <lb/>
            When she demands, bright opening on your view, <lb/>
            The sacred rites to heavenly Venus due ; <lb/>
            If thy loved lock appear resplendent there, <lb/>
            Let me with her an equal offering share. <lb/>
            But why should these surrounding stars detain <lb/>
            Thy golden hairs in this ethereal plain ? <lb/>
            Oh could I join thy beauteous head once more, <lb/>
            The sacred head on which I grew before ; <lb/>
            Though I should ever lose my light divine, <lb/>
            And moist Arcturus next the Virgin shine. TITLES</p><pb n="267"/>

            Can soothe my mind where anguish never rests ; <lb/>
            That hapless letter still my bosom cheers, <lb/>
            Those lines are dear, though written with thy tears: <lb/>
            For, ah ! they speak thy love, and bid me send <lb/>
            Verse from the bard, affection from the friend. <lb/>
            Think not I wish my duty to disown <lb/>
            To the first friend my life has ever known ; <lb/>
            But, Manlius, learn my own unhappy state; <lb/>
            Learn in how rough a sea of troublous fate <lb/>

            His early fate has from my bosom chased <lb/>
            All former joys, and all the mind can taste. <lb/>
            Then cry not, " Shame, Catullus should be known <lb/>
            To droop and linger in Verona's town, <lb/>
            While any noble's frigid form partakes <lb/>

            No, Manlius, call it not disgrace or shame, <lb/>
            For keenest misery is the fitter name. <lb/>
            Forgive me then, if thou shalt ask in vain <lb/>
            The gifts that sorrow from myself has ta'en. <lb/>
            No hoard of writers here their fires infuse, <lb/>
            To guide my taste and cheer my drooping Muse: <lb/>
            Few favourite volumes serve to fill the void, <lb/>
            And chase the gloom of leisure unemploy'd. <lb/>
            Rome holds my home, my comfort, and my care. <lb/>
            And life is only life when I am there.</p><pb n="270"/>
            
          <p>Then think not fretful envy prompts my part. <lb/>
            Or gratitude is irksome to my heart ; <lb/>
            Forced to refuse to each request of thine <lb/>
            Gifts I had sent unask'd, bad they been mine. <lb/>
            Yet can I not, ye Nine, the tale repress, <lb/>
            How Manlius still has toil'd my life to bless ; <lb/>
            Nor let oblivious time its gloom extend <lb/>
            O'er the dear memory of so true a friend. <lb/>
            To you I speak his praise, do ye unfold <lb/>
            To countless crowds the praises I have told. <lb/>
            Let this time-honour'd verse for ever tell <lb/>
            To future days the name I loved so well; <lb/>
            And when at length, alas ! his aged head <lb/>
            Shall rest inurn'd among the noble dead, <lb/>
            Wider and wider still his praise proclaim, <lb/>
            When all of him that lives will be his fame. <lb/>
            Thus, by its theme immortal, shall my page <lb/>
            Live still perused in every distant age ; <lb/>
            Nor spider ever venture to profane <lb/>
            With lazy web my laudatory strain.</p>
          <p>Ye know how Venus false my life oppress'd, <lb/>
            With what destroying flame she scorch'd my breast, <lb/>
            Hot as the fires that Etna's crater fill, <lb/>
            Or Malia's springs that boil near Eta's hill. <lb/>
            With wasting tears my eyes were dim and weak, <lb/>
            And sorrow's drops for ever bathed my cheek. <lb/>
            As, springing on some mountain's airy throne, <lb/>
            The crystal streamlet from the mossy stone <lb/>
            Through the slope valley hurrying headlong down, <lb/>
            Crosses the busy road to some rich town ; <lb/>
            A blest refreshment to the trav'ller's toil, <lb/>
            When arid heat has crack'd the fever'd soil. <lb/>
            As, when through storms the sailor long has pray'd <lb/>
            To Pollux now, and now for Castor's aid, <lb/>
            Soft breathes the favouring air and calms the sea ; <lb/>
            Such Manlius was, such help and bliss to me. <lb/>
            When narrow bounds confined my poor domain, <lb/>
            He made me master of a spacious plain ; <lb/>
            He bounteous placed me in a rich abode, <lb/>
            And the fond girl. whose love we shared, bestow'd. <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            That home my goddess blest: that mansion bore <lb/>
            Her graceful foot upon its tell-tale floor; <lb/>
            There oft her creaking sandal, sweet to hear, <lb/>
            Foretold the fair one to her lover's ear.</p>
          <p>Thus erst, while love warned every blissful thought, <lb/>
            Her husband's home Laodamia sought. <lb/>
            Too eager bride ! No victim led to die <lb/>
            Had yet propitiated the gods on high. <lb/>
            (Thy power, dread Nemesis, hath still suppress'd <lb/>
            All hopes unsanction'd by the heavens' behest: <lb/>
            Hapless, who grasp, unless the gods approve, <lb/>
            The proffer'd gift of glory, wealth, or love !) <lb/>
            Soon did she learn how keen the thirsty fine <lb/>
            Desires the sacred blood of victims slain, <lb/>
            Forced from her parting husband's neck to tear <lb/>
            The close embrace that long'd to linger there; <lb/>
            Ere yet two winters in their length of nights <lb/>
            Had glutted passion with its own delights ; <lb/>
            Or taught the bride, a strength how hard to give ! <lb/>
            To lose the mate she loved, and yet to live. <lb/>
            The Fates well knew this doom not distant far <lb/>
            If the bold chieftain sought the Trojan war. <lb/>
            For then had Troy by stealth of Helen's charms <lb/>
            Roused 'gainst herself the kings of Greece to arms. <lb/>
            Troy, baleful, impious Troy ! the common grave <lb/>
            Of Europe's warriors and of Asia's brave ! <lb/>
            Troy, whose vast ruin the sad ashes boasts <lb/>
            Of wisdom, valour, and unnumber'd hosts ! <lb/>
            Troy, where my brother died, untimely torn <lb/>
            From the lone wretch whom he has left to mourn ! <lb/>
            Alas ! his eyes are closed in lasting gloom ! <lb/>
            Brother, our house lies with thee in the tomb ; <lb/>
            Thy friendship still my life with pleasures fed, <lb/>
            And all my pleasures now with thee are dead. <lb/>
            Not 'mid ancestral tombs for ages traced, <lb/>
            Nor with the urns of kindred ashes placed ; <lb/>
            But hateful Troy, Troy's melancholy plains <lb/>
            Hold in ungenial soil thy loved remains. <lb/>
            To Troy then hastening, the assembled band <lb/>
            Of Grecian youth had left their native land, <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            To burst on Paris with the din of arms, <lb/>
            To rouse him from th' adulteress matron’s charms ; <lb/>
            Nor let his wrong its lawless rapture shed <lb/>
            On days of quiet or a peaceful bed.</p>
          <p>'Twas in that hour, that he, beloved too well, <lb/>
            Thine heart-dear spouse, Laodamia, fell; <lb/>
            And wild despair with overwhelming flow <lb/>
            Hurried thee down the deep abyss of woe. <lb/>
            Less deep that gulf described in Grecian lands, <lb/>
            Where Pheneus flows and high Cyllene stands, <lb/>
            Which pour'd the waste of waters through its drain, <lb/>
            And gave to man the firm and fertile plain. <lb/>
            Amphytrion's falsely-father'd son, they say, <lb/>
            Through the broad mountain clove its lofty way, <lb/>
            When, by a worthless lord's command employ'd, <lb/>
            His darts the birds of Stymphalus destroy'd: <lb/>
            'Twas for a throne in heaven his task he plied, <lb/>
            And blooming Hebe for his virgin bride.</p>
          <p>How vast, how deep that gulf upon whose soil <lb/>
            A slaving god had spent a lengthen’d toil ! <lb/>
            More vast the love that warm'd thy bridal vows ; <lb/>
            More deep thy sorrow for thy plighted spouse. <lb/>
            Not to the sire so dear, when grey with years, <lb/>
            The late-born son an only daughter rears ; <lb/>
            Who, soon as first he draws the vital air, <lb/>
            Named by his grandsire for his only heir, <lb/>
            Blasts the fond hopes that hungry kinsmen fed ; <lb/>
            And drives like vultures from the hoary head. <lb/>
            Not e'en so much the tender sports of love <lb/>
            Please the soft partner of the snowy dove, <lb/>
            Who still with fire, to which her mate's is weak, <lb/>
            Plucks ceaseless kisses with a clinging beak. <lb/>
            (Never can love to manly breasts impart <lb/>
            The doting ardour of the female heart.) <lb/>
            With all their fires thy glowing passion vied, <lb/>

          <p>Thus erst, thy bright compeer in love and charms, <lb/>
            Light of my life, the damsel sought my arms ; <lb/>

            While Cupid, then in saffron vest array'd, <lb/>

            Her love at times may bless some other youth ; <lb/>
            Well may her favourite uncomplaining bear <lb/>
            The stolen falsehoods of the modest fair. <lb/>
            Vex not your amorous lives with jealous pain, <lb/>
            Juno, (if such compare be not profane,) <lb/>
            Imperial Juno knew the lusts of Jove, <lb/>
            Still daily false, yet view'd him still with love. <lb/>
            Love, independent love, no care requires, <lb/>
            No chilling sanction of intrusive sires ; <lb/>
            For by no father's formal conduct brought, <lb/>
            No Syrian odours fill'd the home she sought: <lb/>
            But on that wondrous night, all nights above ! <lb/>
            She gave at once the fullest gift of love ; <lb/>
            In that same night <unclear>hastow’d</unclear>, in that possessed, <lb/>

            Enough that I that night of rapture pass'd, <lb/>

            A kiss from thy lips, dearest maid of my soul; <lb/>
            And all heaven's ambrosia itself could not match <lb/>
            The ravishing sweetness of that which I stole.</p>
          <p>Ah ! 'twas not unpunish’d.—I suffer'd more pain <lb/>
            Than the crucified wretch left to linger awhile. <lb/>
            For pardon I sued ; but not tears could obtain <lb/>
            One accent of kindness, one favouring smile.</p>
          <p>You scornfully cleansed from the lip I'd possess'd <lb/>
            Every trace, every feeling by mine left behind ; <lb/>
            And wash'd it, as if by some profligate prest, <lb/>
            The foulest in person and basest in mind:</p>
          <p>You sought every method to banish my bliss, <lb/>

            Till all its ambrosia was lost to the kiss, <lb/>

            From such thefts I for ever an abstinence vow ; <lb/>

            And those who always loved, now love the more</p>
          <p>She paints the purple year with varied show, <lb/>
            Tips the green gem, and makes the blossom glow. <lb/>
            She makes the turgid buds receive the breeze, <lb/>
            Expand io leaves and shade the naked trees. <lb/>
            When gathering damps the misty nights diffuse, <lb/>
            She sprinkles all the morn with balmy dews ; <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            Bright trembling pearls depend at every spray, <lb/>
            And kept from falling, seem to fall away. <lb/>
            A glossy freshness hence the rose receives, <lb/>
            And blushes sweet through all her silken leaves ; <lb/>
            (The drops descending through the silent night, <lb/>
            While stars serenely roll their golden light <lb/>
            Close till the morn her humid veil she holds ; <lb/>
            Then decked with virgin pomp the flower unfolds. <lb/>
            Soon will the morning blush, ye maids, prepare: <lb/>
            In rosy garlands bind your flowing hair; <lb/>
            'Tis Venus' plant: the blood fair Venus shed, <lb/>
            O'er the gay beauty pour'd immortal red : <lb/>
            From love's soft kiss a sweet ambrosial smell <lb/>
            Was taught for ever on the leaves to dwell; <lb/>
            From gems, from flames, from orient rays of light, <lb/>
            The richest lustre makes her purple bright ; <lb/>
            And she to-morrow weds ; the sportive gale <lb/>
            Unties her zone; she bursts the verdant veil ; <lb/>
            Through all her sweets the rifling lover flies, <lb/>
            And as he breathes, her glowing fires arise.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before; <lb/>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>Now fair Dione to the myrtle grove <lb/>
            Sends the gay Nymphs, and sends her tender love. <lb/>
            And shall they venture ? Is it safe to go, <lb/>
            While nymphs have hearts and Cupid wears a bow ? <lb/>
            Yes, safely venture ;'tis his mother's will ; <lb/>
            He walks unarm'd and undesiring ill; <lb/>
            His torch extinct, his quiver useless hung, <lb/>
            His arrows idle, and his bow unstrung. <lb/>
            And yet, ye nymphs, beware, his eyes have charms : <lb/>
            And love that's naked, still is love in arms.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <lb/>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>From Venus' bower to Delia's lodge repairs <lb/>
            A virgin train complete with modest airs : <lb/>
            " Chaste Delia, grant our suit! oh shun the wood; <lb/>
            Nor stain this sacred lawn with savage blood.</p><pb n="295"/>
            
          <p>Venus, 0 Delia, if she could persuade, <lb/>
            Would ask thy presence, might she ask a maid." <lb/>
            Here cheerful choirs for three auspicious nights <lb/>
            With songs prolong the pleasurable rites : <lb/>
            Her crowds in measures lightly decent move ; <lb/>
            Or seek by pairs the covert of the grove, <lb/>
            Where meeting greens for arbours arch above, <lb/>
            And mingling flowerets strew the scenes of love. <lb/>
            Here dancing Ceres shakes her golden sheaves ; <lb/>
            Here Bacchus revels, deckt with viny leaves ; <lb/>
            Here wit's enchanting god, in laurel crown'd, <lb/>
            Wakes all the ravish'd hours with silver sound. <lb/>
            Ye fields, ye forests, own Dione's reign, <lb/>
            And Delia, huntress Delia, shun the plain.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <lb/>
            And those who always loved now love the more.</p>
          <p>Gay with the bloom of all her opening year, <lb/>
            The Queen at Hybla bids her throne appear, <lb/>
            And there presides ; and there the fav'rite band, <lb/>
            Her smiling Graces, share the great command. <lb/>
            Now, beauteous Hybla ! dress thy flowery beds <lb/>
            With all the pride the lavish season sheds; <lb/>
            Now all thy colours, all thy fragrance yield, <lb/>
            And rival Enna's aromatic field. <lb/>
            To fill the presence of the gentle court <lb/>
            From every quarter rural Nymphs resort, <lb/>
            From woods, from mountains, from these humble vales, <lb/>
            From waters curling with the wanton gales. <lb/>
            Pleased with the joyful train, the laughing Queen <lb/>
            In circles seats them round the bank of green ; <lb/>
            And, "lovely girls," she whispers, "guard your hearts; <lb/>
            ‘ My boy, though stript of arms, abounds in arts."</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <lb/>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>Let tender grass in shaded alleys spread ; <lb/>
            Let early flowers erect their painted head ; <lb/>
            To-morrow's glory be to-morrow seen ; <lb/>
            That day old Ether wedded Earth in green.</p><pb n="296"/>
            
          <p>The vernal father bade the spring appear, <lb/>
            In clouds he coupled to produce the year ; <lb/>
            The sap descending o'er her bosom ran, <lb/>
            And all the various sorts of soul began <lb/>
            By wheels unknown to sight, by secret veins <lb/>
            Distilling life ; the fruitful goddess reigns <lb/>
            Through all the lovely realms of native day, <lb/>
            Through all the circled land and circling sea ; <lb/>
            With fertile seed she fill'd the pervious earth, <lb/>
            And ever fix'd the mystic ways of birth.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <lb/>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>'Twas she, the parent, to the Latian shore <lb/>
            Through various dangers Troy's remainder bore. <lb/>
            She won Lavinia for her warlike son, <lb/>
            And winning her, the Latian empire won. <lb/>
            She gave to Mars the maid whose honoured womb <lb/>
            Swell'd with the founder of immortal Rome. <lb/>
            Decoy'd by shows the Sabine dames she led, <lb/>
            And taught our vigorous youth the means to wed. <lb/>
            Hence sprung the Romans, hence the race divine <lb/>
            Through which great Cæsar draws his Julian line.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before ; <lb/>
            And those who always loved, now love the more.</p>
          <p>In rural seats the soul of pleasure reigns ; <lb/>
            The love of Beauty fills the rural scenes ; <lb/>
            Ev'n Love (if fame the truth of Love declare) <lb/>
            Drew first the breathings of a rural air, <lb/>
            Some pleasing meadow pregnant Beauty prest, <lb/>
            She laid her infant on its bowery breast; <lb/>
            From nature's sweets he supp'd the fragrant dew, <lb/>
            He smiled, he kiss’d them, and by kissing grew.</p>

          <p>Now bulls o'er stalks of broom extend their sides, <lb/>
            Secure of favours from their lowing brides. <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            Now stately rams their fleecy consorts lead, <lb/>
            Who bleating follow through the wand'ring shade. <lb/>
            And now the goddess bids the birds appear, <lb/>
            Raise all their music, and salute the year ; <lb/>
            Then deep the swan begins, and deep the song <lb/>
            Runs o'er the water where he sails along; <lb/>
            While Philomela tunes a treble strain, <lb/>
            And from the poplar charms the listening plain. <lb/>
            We fancy love exprest at every note; <lb/>
            It melts, it warbles in her liquid throat. <lb/>
            Of barbarous Tereus she complains no more, <lb/>
            But sings for pleasure, as for grief before. <lb/>
            And still her graces rise, her airs extend, <lb/>
            And all is silence till the syren end. <lb/>
            How long in coming is my lovely spring ? <lb/>
            And when shall I, and when the swallow sing ? <lb/>
            Sweet Philomela, cease or here I sit, <lb/>
            And silent loose my rapturous hour of wit. <lb/>
            'Tis gone ; the fit retires, the flames decay; <lb/>
            My tuneful Phœbus flies averse away. <lb/>
            His own Amyclæ thus, as stories run, <lb/>
            But once was silent, and that once undone.</p>
          <p>Let those love now, who never loved before, <lb/>
            And those who always loved, now love the more. <lb/>

          <p>LOVE he to-morrow, who loved never ; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>The spring appears, in which the earth <lb/>
            Receives a new harmonious birth ; <lb/>
            When all things mutual love unites ; <lb/>
            When birds perform their nuptial rites ; <lb/>
            And fruitful by her watery lover, <lb/>
            Each grove its tresses doth recover. <lb/>
            Love's Queen to-morrow, in the shade, <lb/>
            Which by these verdant trees is made, <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            Their sprouting tops in wreaths shall bind, <lb/>
            And myrtles into arbours wind; <lb/>
            To-morrow, raised on a high throne, <lb/>
            Dione shall her laws make known.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who bath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>Then the round ocean's foaming flood <lb/>
            Immingled with celestial blood, <lb/>
            ’Mongst the blue purple of the main, <lb/>
            And horses whom two feet sustain, <lb/>
            Rising Dione did beget <lb/>
            With fruitful waters dropping wet.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>With flowery jewels everywhere <lb/>
            She paints the purple-eolour'd year ; <lb/>
            She, when the rising bud receives <lb/>
            Favonius' breath, thrusts forth the leaves, <lb/>
            The naked roof with these t' adorn ; <lb/>
            She the transparent dew o' th' morn, <lb/>
            Which the thick air of night still uses <lb/>
            To leave behind, in rain diffuses; <lb/>
            These tears with orient brightness shine, <lb/>
            Whilst they with trembling weight decline, <lb/>
            Whose every drop, into a small <lb/>
            Clear orb distill'd, sustains its fall. <lb/>
            Pregnant with these the bashful rose <lb/>
            Her purple blushes doth disclose. <lb/>
            The drops of falling dew that are <lb/>
            Shed in calm nights by every star, <lb/>
            She in her humid mantle holds, <lb/>
            And then her virgin leaves unfolds. <lb/>
            I' th' morn, by her command, each maid <lb/>
            With dewy roses is array'd; <lb/>
            Which from Cythera's crimson blood, <lb/>
            From the soft kisses Love bestow'd, <lb/>
            From jewels, from the radiant flame, <lb/>
            And the sun's purple lustre, came. <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            She to her spouse shall married be <lb/>
            To-morrow ; not ashamed that he <lb/>
            Should with a single knot untie <lb/>
            Her fiery garment's purple dye.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>The goddess bade the nymphs remove <lb/>
            Unto the shady myrtle grove ; <lb/>
            The boy goes with the maids, yet none <lb/>
            Will trust, or think Love tame is grown, <lb/>
            If they perceive that anywhere <lb/>
            He arrows doth about him bear. <lb/>
            Go fearless, nymphs, for Love hath laid <lb/>
            Aside his arms, and tame is made. <lb/>
            His weapons by command resigned, <lb/>
            Naked to go he is enjoin'd, <lb/>
            Lest he hurt any by his craft, <lb/>
            Either with flame, or bow, or shaft. <lb/>
            But yet take heed, young nymphs, beware <lb/>
            You trust him not, for Cupid's fair, <lb/>
            Lest by his beauty you be harm'd ; <lb/>
            Love naked is completely arm'd.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>Fair Venus virgins sends to thee, <lb/>
            Indued with equal modesty: <lb/>
            One only thing we thee desire, <lb/>
            Chaste Delia, for a while retire ; <lb/>
            That the wide forest, that the wood, <lb/>
            May be unstain'd with savage blood. <lb/>
            She would with prayers herself attend thee, <lb/>
            But that she knew she could not bend thee; <lb/>
            She would thyself to come have pray'd, <lb/>
            Did these delights beseem a maid. <lb/>
            Now might'st thou see with solemn rites <lb/>
            The Chorus celebrate three nights ; <lb/>
            ’Mongst troops whom equal pleasure crowns, <lb/>
            To play and sport upon thy downs; <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            ’Mongst garlands made of various flowers, <lb/>
            ’Mongst ever-verdant myrtle bowers. <lb/>
            Ceres nor Bacchus absent be, <lb/>
            Nor yet the poet's deity. <lb/>
            All night we wholly must employ <lb/>
            In vigils, and in songs of joy; <lb/>
            None but Dione must bear sway <lb/>
            Amongst the woods; Delia, give way</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who bath loved, persevere</p>
          <p>She the tribunal did command <lb/>
            Deck'd with Hyblæan flowers should stand ; <lb/>
            She will in judgment sit; the Graces <lb/>
            On either side shall have their places; <lb/>
            Hybla, thy flowers pour forth, whatever <lb/>
            Was brought thee by the welcome year; <lb/>
            Hybla, thy flowery garment spread, <lb/>
            Wide as is Enna's fruitful mead; <lb/>
            Maids of the country here will be; <lb/>
            Maids of the mountain come to see; <lb/>
            Hither resort all such as dwell <lb/>
            Either in grove, or wood, or well. <lb/>
            The wing'd boy's mother every one <lb/>
            Commands in order to sit down ; <lb/>
            Charging the virgins that they must <lb/>
            In nothing Love, though naked, trust.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>Let the fresh covert of a shade <lb/>
            Be by these early flowers displayed, <lb/>
            To-morrow (which with sports and play <lb/>
            We keep) was Æther’s wedding day ; <lb/>
            When first the father of the spring <lb/>
            Did out of clouds the young year bring. <lb/>
            The husband Shower then courts his spouse, <lb/>
            And in her sacred bosom flows, <lb/>
            That all which that vast body bred <lb/>
            By this defluxion may be fed: <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            Produced within, she all there sways <lb/>
            By a hid spirit, which by ways <lb/>
            Unknown diffused through soul and veins, <lb/>
            All things both governs and sustains. <lb/>
            Piercing through the unsounded sea, <lb/>
            And earth, and highest heaven, she <lb/>
            All places with her power doth fill, <lb/>
            Which through each part she doth distil; <lb/>
            And to the world the mystic ways <lb/>
            Of all production open lays.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever</p>
          <p>She to the Latins did transfer <lb/>
            The Trojan nephews; and by her <lb/>
            Was the Laurentian virgin won, <lb/>
            And joined in marriage to her son. <lb/>
            By her assistance did Mars gain <lb/>
            A votaress from Vesta's fane. <lb/>
            To marriage Romulus betrayed <lb/>
            The Sabine women, by her aid, <lb/>
            (Of Romans the wide-spreading stem,) <lb/>
            And in the long descent of them <lb/>
            In whom that offspring was dilated, <lb/>
            Cæsar her nephew she created.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who bath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>The fields are fruitful made by pleasure; <lb/>
            The fields are rich in Venus' treasure; <lb/>
            And Love, Dione's son, fame yields <lb/>
            For truth, his birth had in the fields; <lb/>
            As soon as born the field reliev'd him, <lb/>
            Into its bosom first received him ; <lb/>
            She bred him from his infant hours <lb/>
            With the sweet kisses of the flowers.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never ; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who bath loved, persever.</p>
          <p>See how the bulls their sides distend, <lb/>

            The bleating flocks beneath the shade. <lb/>
            The warbling birds on- every tree <lb/>
            The goddess wills not silent be. <lb/>
            The vocal swans on every lake, <lb/>
            With their hoarse voice a harsh sound make; <lb/>
            And Tereus' hapless maid beneath <lb/>
            The poplar's shade her song doth breathe; <lb/>
            Such as might well persuade thee, love <lb/>
            Doth in those trembling accents move; <lb/>
            Not that the sister in those strains <lb/>
            Of the inhuman spouse complains. <lb/>
            We silent are whilst she doth sing, <lb/>
            How long in coming is my spring? <lb/>
            When will the time arrive, that I <lb/>
            May swallow-like my voice untie ? <lb/>
            My muse for being silent flies me, <lb/>
            And Phcebus will no longer prize me: <lb/>
            So did Amielse once, whilst all <lb/>
            Silence observed, through silence fall.</p>
          <p>Love he to-morrow, who loved never; <lb/>
            To-morrow, who hath loved, persever. <lb/>

          <p>THE glittering ore let others vainly heap, <lb/>
            O'er fertile vales extend th' enclosing mound; <lb/>
            With dread of neighboring foes forsake their sleep, <lb/>
            And start aghast at every trumpet's sound.</p>
          <p>Me humbler scenes delight, and calmer days; <lb/>
            A tranquil life fair poverty secure ! <lb/>
            Then boast, my hearth, a small but cheerful blaze, <lb/>
            And, riches grasp who will, let me be poor.</p>
          <p>Nor yet be hope a stranger to my door, <lb/>
            But o'er my roof, bright goddess, still preside ! <lb/>
            With many a bounteous autumn heap my floor, <lb/>
            And swell my vats with must, a purple tide.</p>
          <p>My tender vines I'll plant with early care, <lb/>
            And choicest apples with a skilful hand; <lb/>
            Nor blush, a rustic, oft to guide the share, <lb/>
            Or goad the tardy ox along the land.</p>
          <p>Let me, a simple swain, ,with honest pride, <lb/>
            If chance a lambkin from its dam should roam, <lb/>
            Or sportful kid, the little wanderer chide, <lb/>
            And in my bosom bear exulting home.</p>
          <p>Here Pales I bedew with milky showers, <lb/>
            Lustrations yearly for my shepherd pay, <lb/>
            Revere each antique stone bedeck'd with flowers <lb/>
            That bounds the field, or points the doubtful way.</p><pb n="304"/>
            
          <p>My grateful fruits, the earliest of the year, <lb/>
            Before the rural god shall duly wait. <lb/>
            From Ceres' gifts I'll cull each browner ear, <lb/>
            And hang a wheaten wreath before her gate.</p>
          <p>The ruddy god shall save my fruit from stealth, <lb/>
            And far away each little plunderer scare : <lb/>
            And you, the guardians once of ampler wealth, <lb/>
            My household gods, shall still my off'rings share.</p>
          <p>My numerous herds that wanton'd o'er the mead <lb/>
            The choicest falling then could richly yield; <lb/>
            Now scarce I spare a little lamb to bleed <lb/>
            A mighty victim for my scanty field.</p>
          <p>And yet a lamb shall bleed, while, ranged around, <lb/>
            The village youths shall stand in order meet, <lb/>
            With rustic hymns, ye gods, your praise resound, <lb/>
            And future crops and future wines entreat,</p>
          <p>Then come, ye powers, nor scorn my frugal board, <lb/>
            Nor yet the gifts clean earthen bowls convey; <lb/>
            With these the first of men the gods adored, <lb/>
            And form'd their simple shape of ductile clay.</p>
          <p>My little flock, ye wolves, ye robbers, spare, <lb/>
            Too mean a plunder to deserve your toil; <lb/>
            For wealthier herds the nightly theft prepare; <lb/>
            There seek a nobler prey, and richer spoil.</p>
          <p>For treasured wealth, nor stores of golden wheat, <lb/>
            The hoard of frugal sires, I vainly call; <lb/>
            A little farm be mine, a cottage neat, <lb/>
            And wonted couch where balmy sleep may falL</p>
          <p>“What joy to hear the tempest howl in vain, <lb/>
            And clasp a fearful mistress to my breast; <lb/>
            Or lull'd to slumber by the beating rain, <lb/>
            Secure and happy sink at last to rest."</p>
          <p>These joys be mine !—0 grant me only these, <lb/>
            And give to others bags of shining gold, <lb/>
            Whose steely heart can brave the boist'rous seas, <lb/>
            The storm wide-wasting, or the stiffening cold.</p>
          <p>Content with little, I would rather stay <lb/>
            Than spend long months amid the wat'ry waste; <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            In cooling shades elude the scorching ray, <lb/>
            Beside some fountain's gliding waters placed.</p>
          <p>Oh perish rather all that's rich and rare, <lb/>
            The diamond quarry, and the golden vein, <lb/>
            Than that my absence cost one precious tear, <lb/>
            Or give some gentle maid a moment's pain.</p>
          <p>With glittering spoils, Messala, gild thy dome, <lb/>
            Be thine the noble task to lead the brave ; <lb/>
            A lovely foe me captive holds at home, <lb/>
            Chain'd to her scornful gate, a watchful slave.</p>
          <p>Inglorious post!-and yet I heed not fame : <lb/>
            Th' applause of crowds for Delia I'd resign: <lb/>
            To live with thee I'd bear the coward's name, <lb/>
            Nor 'midst the scorn of nations once repine.</p>
          <p>With thee to live I'd mock the ploughman's toil. <lb/>
            Or on some lonely mountain tend my sheep ; <lb/>
            At night I'd lay me on the flinty soil, <lb/>
            And happy 'midst thy dear embraces sleep.</p>
          <p>What drooping lover heeds the Tyrian bed, <lb/>
            While the long night is pass'd with many a sigh; <lb/>
            Nor softest down with richest carpets spread, <lb/>
            Nor whisp'ring rills can close the weeping eye.</p>
          <p>Of threefold iron were his rugged frame, <lb/>
            Who, when he might thy yielding heart obtain, <lb/>
            Could yet attend the calls of empty fame, <lb/>
            Or follow arms in quest of sordid gain.</p>
          <p>Unenvied let him drive the vanquish'd host, <lb/>
            Through captive lands his conquering armies lead ; <lb/>
            Unenvied wear the robe with gold emboss'cl, <lb/>
            And guide with solemn state his foaming steed.</p>
          <p>Oh may I view thee with life's parting ray, <lb/>
            And thy dear hand with dying ardour press: <lb/>
            Sure thou wilt weep-and on thy lover's clay, <lb/>
            With breaking heart, print many a tender kiss !</p>
          <p>Sure thou wilt weep-and woes unntter’d feel, <lb/>
            When on the pile thou seest thy lover laid ! <lb/>
            For well I know, nor flint, nor ruthless steel, <lb/>
            Can arm the breast of such a gentle maid. <note type="footnote"> x </note> <pb n="306"/>

          <p>From the sad pomp, what youth, what pitying fair, <lb/>
            Returning slow, can tender tears refrain ? <lb/>
            O Delia, spare thy cheeks, thy tresses spare, <lb/>
            Nor give my ling'ring shade a world of pain.</p>
          <p>But now while smiling hours the Fates bestow, <lb/>
            Let love, dear maid, our gentle hearts unite ! <lb/>
            Soon death will come and strike the fatal blow; <lb/>
            Unseen his head, and veil'd in shades of night.</p>
          <p>Soon creeping age will bow the lover's frame, <lb/>
            And tear the myrtle chaplet from his brow: <lb/>
            With hoary locks ill suits the youthful flame, <lb/>
            The soft persuasion, or the ardent vow.</p>
          <p>Now the fair queen of gay desire is ours, <lb/>
            And lends our follies an indulgent smile : <lb/>
            'Tis lavish youth's t' enjoy the frolic hours, <lb/>
            The wanton revel and the midnight broil.</p>
          <p>Your chief, my friends and fellow-soldiers, I <lb/>
            To these light wars will lead you boldly on: <lb/>
            Far hence, ye trumpets, sound, and banners fly; <lb/>
            To those who covet wounds and fame begone.</p>
          <p>And bear them fame and wounds ; and riches bear ; <lb/>
            There are that fame and wounds and riches prize. <lb/>
            For me, while I possess one plenteous year, <lb/>
            I'll wealth and meagre want alike despise. GRAINGER.</p>

            Or in my arms to bear the straggling lamb, <lb/>

            With rural rites my careful shepherd here <lb/>
            I'm used to lustrate each revolving year; <lb/>
            Propitious sacred Pales to retain, <lb/>
            I sprinkle milk upon the rising grain. <lb/>

            With flowery garlands crown'd in open field, <lb/>
            Or where three ways decisive limits yield. <lb/>
            The rural gods as offerings shall receive <lb/>
            The earliest fruit my loaded orchards give. <lb/>

            And in my orchard let Priapus stand <lb/>
            With the dire sickle in his ruddy hand, <lb/>

            Though clad in silver, cover'd o'er with gold, <lb/>

            With hoary hairs soft toys will not agree. <lb/>

          <p>LET others pile their yellow ingots high, <lb/>
            And see their cultured acres round them spread; <lb/>

            Where some o'er-branching tree might shade my head, <lb/>

            Ne'er for my shepherd due lustrations fail; <lb/>

            What boots the purple couch, if cruel charms <lb/>
            In wakeful tears the midnight hours have drown'd?</p>

          <p>In gold and silver mail conspicuous he <lb/>
            May stride the steed, that, pawing, spurs the sand; <lb/>
            May I my last looks fondly bend on thee, <lb/>
            And grasp thee with my dying, faltering hand !</p>
          <p>And thou wilt weep when, cold, I press the bier, <lb/>
            That soon shall on the flaming pyre be thrown ; <lb/>
            And print the kiss, and mingle many a tear; <lb/>
            Not thine a breast of steel, a heart of stone.</p>
          <p>Yes—thou wilt weep. No youth shall thence return <lb/>
            With tearless eye, no virgin homeward wend : <lb/>
            But thou forbear to violate my urn, <lb/>
            Spare thy soft cheeks, nor those loose tresses rend.</p>
          <p>Now fate permits, now blend the sweet embrace: <lb/>
            Death, cowl'd in darkness, creeps with stealing tread , <lb/>
            III suits with sluggish age love’s sprightly grace, <lb/>
            And murmur'd fondness with a hoary head.</p>
          <p>The light amour be mine ; the shiver'd door ; <lb/>
            The midnight fray; ye trumps and standards, hence ! <lb/>

            Asleep, take heed no whisper stirs the air, <lb/>
            For waked, my boy, I wake to heart-felt care. <lb/>
            Now is my Delia watch'd by ruthless spies, <lb/>

            Love aids the dauntless, and will blind your spies! <lb/>
            Those who the godhead's soft behests obey, <lb/>

            On tip-toe traverse unobserv'd the floor ; <lb/>

            Their speaking fingers assignations make. <lb/>
            Nor will the god impart to all his aid: <lb/>
            Love hates the fearful, hates the lazy maid ; <lb/>
            But through sly windings and unpractis'd ways <lb/>
            His bold knight-errants to their wish conveys: <lb/>
            For those whom he with expectation fires <lb/>
            No ambush frightens, and no labour tires; <lb/>
            Sacred the dangers of the dark they dare, <lb/>
            No robbers stop them, and no bravoes scare. <lb/>
            Though wintry tempests howl, by love secure, <lb/>
            The howling tempest I with ease endure: <lb/>
            No watching hurts me, if my Delia smile, <lb/>
            Soft turn the gate, aud beckon me the while.</p>
          <p>She's mine. Be blind, ye ramblers of the night, <lb/>
            Lest angry Venus snatch your guilty sight: <lb/>
            The goddess bids her votaries'joys to be <lb/>
            From every casual interruption free : <lb/>
            With prying steps alarm us not, retire, <lb/>
            Nor glare your torches, nor our names inquire: <lb/>
            Or if ye know, deny, by heaven above, <lb/>

            From blood and seas vindictive Venus sprung, <lb/>
            And sure destruction waits the blabbing tongue ! <lb/>
            Nay, should they prate, you, Delia, need not fear; <lb/>
            Your lord (a sorceress swore) should give no ear ! <lb/>
            By potent spells she cleaves the sacred ground, <lb/>

            I've seen her tear the planets from the sky ! <lb/>
            Seen lightning backward at her bidding fly ! <lb/>
            She calls ? from blazing pyres the corse descends, <lb/>
            And, re-enliven’d, clasps his wondering friends ! <lb/>
            The friends she gathers with a magic yell, <lb/>
            Then with aspersions frights them back to hell! <lb/>

            She wills,—glad summer gilds the frozen pole ! <lb/>
            She wills,-in summer wintry tempests roll! <lb/>
            She knows ('tis true) Medea’s awful spell! <lb/>
            She knows to vanquish the fierce guards of hell! <lb/>
            To me she gave a charm for lovers meet, <lb/>
            (" Spit thrice, my fair, and thrice the charm repeat.”) <lb/>
            Us in soft dalliance should your lord surprise, <lb/>

            This incantation me befriends alone. <lb/>
            Nor stopped she here; but swore, if I'd agree, <lb/>
            By charms or herbs to set thy lover free. <lb/>
            With dire lustrations she began the rite ! <lb/>
            (Serenely shone the planet of the night,) <lb/>
            The magic gods she call'd with hellish sound, <lb/>
            A sable sacrifice distain'd the ground— <lb/>
            I stopp'd the spell: I must not, cannot part: <lb/>

            Venus herself the dauntless pair rewards ; <lb/>

            And helps the girl who opes forbidden doors!</p>
          <p>To glide in silence from the downy bed, <lb/>

            Till, safely nestling in their fair one's arms, <lb/>
            They feel the glowing change exalt her charms.</p>
          <p>No lawless robber in my path shall rove, <lb/>
            For sacred is the messenger of love ; <lb/>
            Nor storm nor howling rain shall cloud my road, <lb/>
            If Delia beckon to the dear abode; <lb/>
            Draw the soft bolt, and silently advise <lb/>
            My sounding footsteps with her fearful eyes, <lb/>
            With eager finger on her lip imprest, <lb/>
            Impatient brow, and quickly-beating breast. <lb/>
            Veil, veil your lamps, whoever travel nigh, <lb/>
            The thefts of Venus shun the curious eye. <lb/>
            Nor tread too loudly, nor inquire my name, <lb/>
            Nor to my face advance your taper's flame. <lb/>
            And ye, who chance to see, the sight forswear, <lb/>
            And vow by all the gods ye were not there. <lb/>
            The prating babbler shall confess with pain <lb/>
            That Venus issued from the savage main. <lb/>
            Nay, e'en your lord the tell-tale shall distrust, <lb/>
            And scorn the lying rumour of your lust.</p>
          <p>So sang the witch, whose prophecy divine <lb/>
            Assured my hopes, and made thee wholly mine. <lb/>
            She draws the stars from heaven with influence strong, <lb/>
            And turns the course of rapid streams by song ; <lb/>
            Cleaves the firm ground, the dead with life inspires, <lb/>
            Bids rattling bones start forth from burial fires, <lb/>
            With magic yell the gathering ghosts commands, <lb/>
            Or purifies with milk their parting bands. <lb/>
            Wills she—the clouds of thunder disappear ! <lb/>

            Sole mistress she of dire Medea's charms, <lb/>
            Her power alone the dogs of hell disarms. <lb/>
            A rhyme she framed, which if thou thrice rehearse, <lb/>
            Thy lord shall yield such homage to the verse, <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            That not a tale his spies relate of me, <lb/>
            No, nor the hot embrace his eyes may see, <lb/>

            To snatch the slightest favour from my fair, <lb/>
            Her jealous lord shall every theft perceive, <lb/>
            Know all lie suffers, all he hears believe.</p>
          <p>Shall I too trust the sorceress' potent art, <lb/>
            By herb, or song, to free my captive heart? <lb/>
            The lustral torches blazed at midnight hour, <lb/>
            Fell the black victim to each magic power, <lb/>
            And thus I pray’d—“Oh ! cure me not of love ! <lb/>
            But Delia's breast with mutual fondness move ! <lb/>
            I would not wish for freedom from my pains, <lb/>

            With love's victorious joys at last be crown'd:</p>
          <p>With sudden step let none our bliss surprise, <lb/>
            Or check the freedom of secure delight- <lb/>
            Rash man, beware, and shut thy curious eyes, <lb/>
            Lest angry Venus snatch their guilty sight.</p>
          <p>But shouldst thou see, th' important secret hide, <lb/>
            Though questioned by the powers of earth and heaven <lb/>
            The prating tongue shall love's revenge abide, <lb/>
            Still sue for grace, and never be forgiven.</p>
          <p>A wizard dame, the lover's ancient friend, <lb/>
            With magic charm has deaft thy husband's ear; <lb/>
            At her command I saw the stars descend, <lb/>
            And winged lightnings stop in mid career.</p>
          <p>I saw her stamp and cleave the solid ground, <lb/>
            While ghastly spectres round us wildly roam ; <lb/>
            I saw them hearken to her potent sound, <lb/>
            Till, scared at day, they sought their dreary home.</p>
          <p>At her command the vigorous summer pines, <lb/>
            And wintry clouds obscure the hopeful year; <lb/>
            At her strong bidding, gloomy winter shines, <lb/>
            And vernal roses on the snows appear.</p>
          <p>She gave these charms, which I on thee bestow; <lb/>
            They dim the eye, and dull the jealous mind; <lb/>
            For me they make a husband nothing know, <lb/>
            For me, and only me, they make him blind.</p>
          <p>But what did most this faithful heart surprise, <lb/>
            Site boasted that her skill could set it free: <lb/>
            This faithful heart the boasted freedom flies; <lb/>
            How could it venture to abandon thee ? HAMMOND.</p>

          <p>WHILE you, Messala, plough th' Ægean sea, <lb/>
            Oh sometimes kindly deign to think of me: <lb/>
            Me, hapless me, Phæacian shores detain, <lb/>
            Unknown, unpitied, and oppress'd with pain. <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            Yet spar.- me, death, ah spare me, and retire: <lb/>
            No weeping mother's here to light my pyre: <lb/>
            Here is no sister, with a sister's woe, <lb/>
            Rich Syrian odours on the pile to throw: <lb/>
            But chief, my soul's soft partner is not here, <lb/>
            Her locks to loose, and sorrow o'er my bier.</p>
          <p>What though fair Delia my return implored, <lb/>
            Each fane frequented, and each god adored ; <lb/>
            What though they bade me every peril brave, <lb/>
            And Fortune thrice auspicious omens gave; <lb/>
            All could not dry my tender Delia's tears, <lb/>
            Suppress her sighs, or calm her anxious fears; <lb/>
            E'en as I strove to minister relief, <lb/>
            Unconscious tears proclaim'd my heart-felt grief: <lb/>
            Urged still to go, a thousand shifts I made, <lb/>
            Birds now, now festivals my voyage stay'd: <lb/>
            Or, if I struck my foot against the door, <lb/>
            Straight I return'd, and wisdom was no more. <lb/>
            Forbid by Cupid, let no swain depart; <lb/>
            Cupid is vengeful, and will wring his heart.</p>
          <p>What do your offerings now, my fair, avail ? <lb/>
            Your Isis heeds not, and your cymbals fail! <lb/>
            What though array'd in sacred robes you stood, <lb/>
            Fled man's embrace, and sought the purest flood? <lb/>
            While this I write, I sensibly decay,­ <lb/>
            " Assist me, Isis, drive my pains away : <lb/>
            That you can every mortal ill remove, <lb/>
            The numerous tablets in your temple prove: <lb/>
            So shall my Delia, veil'd in votive white, <lb/>
            Before your threshold sit for many a night; <lb/>
            And twice a day, her tresses all unbound, <lb/>
            Amid your votaries famed, your praises sound: <lb/>

            Then had no steer submitted to the yoke ; <lb/>
            No house had gates, (blest times !) and, in the grounds, <lb/>
            No scanty land-marks parcelled out the bounds: <lb/>
            From every oak redundant honey ran, <lb/>
            And ewes spontaneous bore their milk to man: <lb/>
            No deathful arms were forged, no war was waged, <lb/>
            No rapine plunder'd, no ambition raged. <lb/>
            How changed, alas ! Now cruel Jove commands; <lb/>
            Gold fires the soul, and falchions arm our hands: <lb/>
            Each day, the main unnumber’d lives destroys: <lb/>
            And slaughter, daily, o'er her myriads joys. <lb/>
            Yet spare me, Jove, I ne'er disowned thy sway, <lb/>
            I ne'er was perjur'd ; spare me, Jove, I pray.</p>
          <p>But, if the Sisters have pronounced my doom, <lb/>

            Tibullus followed over land and seas."</p>
          <p>Then Love my ghost (for Love I still obey'd) <lb/>
            Will grateful usher to th' Elysian shade : <lb/>
            There joy and ceaseless revelry prevail; <lb/>
            There soothing music floats on every gale; <lb/>
            There painted warblers hop from spray to spray, <lb/>
            And, wildly-pleasing, swell the general lay: <lb/>
            There every hedge, untaught, with cassia blooms, <lb/>
            And scents the ambient air with rich perfumes: <lb/>
            There every mead a various plenty yields ; <lb/>
            There lavish Flora paints the purple fields: <lb/>
            With ceaseless light a brighter Phœbus glows, <lb/>
            No sickness tortures, and no ocean flows; <lb/>
            But youths associate with the gentle fair, <lb/>
            And stung with pleasure to the shade repair: <lb/>
            With them Love wanders wheresoe'er they stray, <lb/>
            Provokes to rapture, and inflames the play: <lb/>

            Those should they pass, impassable the gate <lb/>
            Where Cerberus howls, grim sentinel of fate. <lb/>

            Rack'd anguish bellows, and the deeps resound: <lb/>
            There he, who dared to tempt the queen of heaven, <lb/>
            Upon an ever-turning wheel is driven : <lb/>
            The Danaids there still strive huge casks to fill, <lb/>
            But strive in vain, the casks elude their skill: <lb/>
            There Pelops' sire, to quench his thirsty fires, <lb/>
            Still tries the flood, and still the flood retires: <lb/>
            There vultures tear the bow'Is, and drink the gore, <lb/>
            Of Tityus, stretch'd enormous on the shore. <lb/>
            Dread love, as vast as endless be their pain <lb/>
            Who tempt my fair, or wish a long campaign.</p>
          <p>0 let no rival your affections share, <lb/>
            Long as this bosom beats, my lovely fair ! <lb/>
            Still on you let your prudent nurse attend ; <lb/>
            She'll guard your honour, she's our common friend. <lb/>
            Her tales of love your sorrowings will allay, <lb/>
            And, in my absence, make my Delia gay: <lb/>
            Let her o'er all your virgin-train preside, <lb/>
            She'll praise th' industrious, and the lazy chide. <lb/>
            But see ! on all enfeebling languors creep ; <lb/>
            Their distaffs drop, they yawn, they nod, they sleep. <lb/>
            Then, if the destinies propitious prove, <lb/>
            Then will I rush, all passion, on my love: <lb/>
            My wish'd return no messenger shall tell, <lb/>
            I'll seem, my fair, as if from heaven I fell. <lb/>
            A soft confusion flushes all your charms, <lb/>
            Your graceful dishabille my bosom warms, <lb/>
            You, Delia, fly and clasp me in your arms.</p>
          <p>For this surprise, ye powers of love, I pray, <lb/>

          <p>How well they lived in Saturn's golden times. <lb/>
            Ere earth lay open to her farthest climes; <lb/>
            Ere hollow pine-trees mounted on the wave, <lb/>
            And to the wind their swelling canvass gave; <lb/>

            No house was guarded by the jealous wall, <lb/>
            No selfish landmark robb'd the wealth of all. <lb/>
            Spontaneous oaks distill'd their honey'd dews, <lb/>
            Their milk was offer'd by the teeming ewes : <lb/>
            War had not yet his iron front displayed, <lb/>

            Uncultured cassia scents the teeming ground, <lb/>

            There the false brides who shed their husbands' blood, <lb/>
            Through hollow vessels pour the ceaseless flood. <lb/>

            There be the wretch who wishes me to rove, <lb/>

            Thy aged nurse still watching at thy side, <lb/>
            Telling sweet tales of seasons long gone by- <lb/>
            While, at their lamps, the circling damsels ply <lb/>
            The curious labours of the length’ning thread, <lb/>
            Or o'er the distaff bend their drowsy head. <lb/>
            Then, on a sudden, will thy lover come, <lb/>
            As if from heaven descending to his home: <lb/>
            No courier's speed my Delia shall prepare, <lb/>
            But in her chance undress I'll find the fair. <lb/>
            Then will she run these smiling eyes to meet, <lb/>

            Shall prove, believe the bard, or soon, or late, <lb/>

            No, no domestic care shall touch my soul; <lb/>
            You, Delia, reign despotic o'er the whole ; <lb/>
            And will Messala fly from pomp of state, <lb/>
            And deign to enter at my lowly gate ? <lb/>
            The choicest fruitage that my trees afford <lb/>

            The fruit present, thy blushing hand-maid she.</p>

            For crimes like these I'd abject crawl the ground, <lb/>
            Kiss her dread threshold, and my forehead wound.</p>
          <p>But ye who, falsely wise, deride my pains, <lb/>

            I've known them, in the street, her maid detain; <lb/>

          <p>LOVE still invites me with a smiling eye ! <lb/>
            Beneath his smiles what pains and anguish lie ! <lb/>
            Yet since the gods, dread power, must yield to thee, <lb/>
            What laurels canst thou gain from conquering me ? <lb/>
            Me Delia loved ; but by thy subtle wiles, <lb/>
            The fair, in secret, on another smiles : <lb/>
            That my suspicion's false, 'tis true, she swears ; <lb/>
            And backs her imprecations with her tears ! <lb/>
            False fair, your oaths and Syren tears refrain ; <lb/>
            Your Syren tears and oaths no credit gain ; <lb/>
            For when your lord suspected me of yore, <lb/>
            As much you wept, as many oaths you swore.</p>
          <p>Yet wherefore blame I Love ? the blame is mine; <lb/>
            I, wretched I, first taught her to design! <lb/>
            I first instructed her her spies to foil; <lb/>
            Back on myself my wanton arts receil : <lb/>
            Herbs of rare energy my skill supplied, <lb/>
            All marks of too-fond gallantry to hide ! <lb/>
            More artful now, alone the wanton lies; <lb/>
            And new pretexts her cozening brains devise.</p>
          <p>Uncautious lord of a too cunning spouse ! <lb/>
            Admittance grant me, she shall keep her vows ! <lb/>
            Be warn'd, my friend, observe her when her tongue <lb/>
            Commends in wanton phrase the gay-dress'd young; <lb/>
            Oh let her not her heaving bosom bare, <lb/>
            Exposed to every fop's immodest stare. <lb/>
            When leaning on the board, with flowing wine, <lb/>
            She seems to draw some inconsiderate line ; <lb/>
            Take heed, take heed, (I know the warning true,) <lb/>
            These random lines assign an interview. <lb/>
            Nor let your wife to fanes so frequent roam, <lb/>
            A modest wife's best temple is at home: <lb/>
            But if your prohibitions all are vain, <lb/>

            I'll bring her wanton privacies to light.</p>
          <p>Some gem she wore, I'd oft pretend to view <lb/>
            But squeez'd her fingers unperceiv'd of you: <lb/>

            Oft with full racy bowls I seal'd your eyes, <lb/>
            Water my bev'rage, and obtain'd the prize. <lb/>
            Yet since I tell, forgive the pranks I play'd, <lb/>
            Love prompted all, and Love must be obey'd!</p>
          <p>Nay, 'twas at me (be now the truth avow'd) <lb/>
            Your watchful mastiff used to bark so loud; <lb/>
            But now some other, with insidious wait, <lb/>
            Intent observes each creaking of your gate, <lb/>
            At which, whoever of the house appears, <lb/>
            Passing, the mien of quick despatch he wears; <lb/>
            But comes again the minute they remove, <lb/>
            And coughs, sure signal of impatient love !</p>
          <p>What boots, though marriage gave a wife so fair, <lb/>
            If careless you, or she eludes your care ? <lb/>
            While men are artful, and your wife can feign, <lb/>
            Vain are your brazen bolts, your mastiffs vain.</p>
          <p>Cold to the raptures of the genial bed, <lb/>
            She lays the fault upon an aching head: <lb/>
            'Tis false; the wanton for some other sighs; <lb/>
            From this her coolness, this her aches arise.</p>
          <p>Then, then be warn'd, intrust her to my care; <lb/>
            Whips, chains I laugh at, if you grant my prayer. <lb/>

            Where’er she walks, not distant I'll attend, <lb/>
            And guard your honour from the casual friend ! <lb/>
            " Off, gallants, off: for so the gods ordain, <lb/>
            So the dread priestess in unerring strain !” <lb/>
            (When holy fury fires the frantic dame, <lb/>
            She mocks all torture, and exults in flame; <lb/>
            Her snow-white arms and heaving breast she tears ; <lb/>
            And with the gushing gore Bellona smears ; <lb/>
            Deep in her side she plants the glittering sword; <lb/>

            Still, still, though much abus'd, I Delia prize ; <lb/>

            Teach her what decent modesty requires, <lb/>
            To crown my fire, alone, with equal fires. <lb/>

          <p>IN vain would lovers hide their infant-smart <lb/>
            From me, a master in the amorous art; <lb/>
            I read their passion in their mien and eyes, <lb/>
            Overhear their whispers, and explain their sighs. <lb/>
            This skill no Delphian oracles bestow'd, <lb/>
            No augurs taught me, and no victims showed; <lb/>
            But Love my wrists with magic fillets bound, <lb/>
            Lash'd me, and lashing, muttered many a sound. <lb/>
            No more then, Maratlius, indifference feign, <lb/>
            Else vengeful Venus will enhance your pain !</p>
          <p>What now, sweet youth, avails your anxious care, <lb/>
            So oft to essence, oft to change your hair ? <lb/>
            What though cosmetics all their aid supply, <lb/>
            And every artifice of dress you try ? <lb/>
            She's not obliged to bredes, to gems, to clothes, <lb/>
            Her charms to nature Pholoe only owes.</p>
          <p>What spells devote you ? say, what philtres bind ? <lb/>
            What midnight sorceress fascinates your mind ? <lb/>
            Spells can seduce the corn from neighbouring plains ! <lb/>
            The headlong serpent halts at magic strains ! <lb/>
            And did not cymbals stop thy prone career, <lb/>
            A spell thee, Luna, from thy orb would tear!</p>
          <p>Why do I magic for your passion blame, <lb/>
            Magic is useless to a perfect frame ! <lb/>
            You squeezed her hands, your arms around her threw, <lb/>
            Joined lip to lip, and hence your passion grew.</p>
          <p>Cease then, fair maid, to give your lover pain <lb/>
            Love hates the haughty, will avenge the swain. <lb/>
            See youth vermilions o'er his modest face ! <lb/>
            Can riches equal such a boy's embrace ? <lb/>
            Then ask no bribe-when age affects the gay, <lb/>
            Your every smile let hoary dotage pay; <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            But you your arms around the stripling throw, <lb/>
            And scorn the treasure monarchs can bestow. <lb/>
            But she who gives to age her charms for pay, <lb/>
            May her wealth perish and her bloom decay. <lb/>
            Then when impatience thrills in every vein, <lb/>
            May manhood shun her, and the young disdain.</p>
          <p>Alas ! when age has silver'd o'er the head, <lb/>
            And youth that feeds the lamp of love isfled, <lb/>
            In vain the toilette charms ; 'tis vain to try, <lb/>
            Grey scanty locks with yellow nuts to die ; <lb/>
            You strip the tell-tales vainly from their place, <lb/>
            And vainly strive to mend an aged face.</p>
          <p>Then in thine eyes while youth triumphant glows, <lb/>
            And with his flowers thy cheeks, my fair one, sows, <lb/>
            Incline thine heart to love and gentle play, <lb/>
            Youth, youth has rapid wings, and flies away! <lb/>
            The fond old lover vilify, disdain ; <lb/>
            What praise can crown you from a stripling's pain ? <lb/>
            Spare then the lovely boy ; his beauties die, <lb/>
            By no dire sickness sent him from the sky : <lb/>
            The gods are just; you, Pholoe, are to blame ; <lb/>
            His sallow colour from your coyness came.</p>
          <p>Oh, wretched youth ! how oft, when absent you, <lb/>
            Groans rend his breast, and tears his cheeks bedew! <lb/>
            “Why dost thou rack me with contempt?" he cries, <lb/>
            " The willing ever can elude their spies. <lb/>
            Had you, oh had you felt what now I feel, <lb/>

            Poor fruitless skill ! my skill if she despise, <lb/>

            How am I duped ! I wakeful listen round, <lb/>

            No more complain, for oh ! she stops her ears. <lb/>
            The gods, I warn you, hate the haughty fair, <lb/>
            Reject their incense, and deny their prayer. <lb/>
            This youth, this Marathus, who wears your chains, <lb/>
            Late laugh'd at love, and ridiculed its pains ! <lb/>
            Th' impatient lover in the street would stay! <lb/>
            Nor dreamt that vengeance would his crimes repay. <lb/>
            Now, now he moans his past misdeeds with tears, <lb/>
            A prey to love, and all its frantic fears: <lb/>
            Now he exclaims at female scorn and hate ; <lb/>
            And from his soul abhors a bolted gate !</p>

            Not Bacchus' vineyards shall my faith betray."</p>
          <p>Such strong professions, in so soft a strain, <lb/>

            Nay more, you wept, unpractised to betray, <lb/>

          <p>WHO was the first that forged the deadly blade ? <lb/>
            Of rugged steel his savage soul was made; <lb/>
            By him, his bloody flag ambition waved, <lb/>
            And grisly carnage through the battle raved. <lb/>
            Yet wherefore blame him ? we're ourselves to blame; <lb/>
            Arms first were forged to kill the savage game: <lb/>
            Death-dealing battles were unknown of old; <lb/>
            Death-dealing battles took their rise from gold. <lb/>

            And first gay-laughing prest the ruddy wine; <lb/>
            The father quaffs, deep quaff his joyous friends, <lb/>
            Yet to his son a well-stored vault descends.</p>
          <p>Bright shine the ploughshare, our support and joy ! <lb/>
            But rust, deep rust, the veteran's arms destroy !</p>
          <p>The villager, (his sacred offerings paid <lb/>
            In the dark grove and consecrated shade,) <lb/>
            His wife and sons, now darkness parts the throng, <lb/>
            Drives home, and whistles as he reels along. <lb/>
            Then triumphs Venus ; then love-feuds prevail; <lb/>
            The youth all jealous then the fair assail; <lb/>
            Doors, windows fly, no deference they pay, <lb/>
            The chastest suffer in th' ungentle fray: <lb/>
            These beat their breasts and melt in moving tears; <lb/>
            The lover weeps and blames his rage and fears; <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            Love sits between, unmoved with tears and sighs, <lb/>
            And with incentives sly the feud supplies.</p>
          <p>Ye youths, though stung with taunts, of blows beware <lb/>
            They, they are impious, who can beat the fair: <lb/>
            If much provoked, or rend their silken zone, <lb/>
            Or on their tresses be your anger shown: <lb/>
            But if nor this your passion can appease, <lb/>
            Until the charmer weep, the charmer tease ! <lb/>
            Blest anger, if the fair dissolves in tears! <lb/>
            Blest youth, her fondness undisguised appears ! <lb/>
            But crush the wretch, 0 war, with all thy woes, <lb/>
            Who to rough usage adds the crime of blows.</p>
          <p>Bland Peace, descend with plenty on our plains, <lb/>
            And bless with ease and laughing sport the swains. <lb/>

            The fields we lustrate, and the rising grain: <lb/>
            Come, Bacchus, and thy horns with grapes surround ; <lb/>
            Come, Ceres, with thy wheaten garland crown'd ; <lb/>
            This hallow'd day suspend each swain his toil, <lb/>

            Unyoke the steer, his racks heap high with hay, <lb/>

            Be all your thoughts to this grand work applied! <lb/>

            Thou noblest splendour of an ancient race; <lb/>
            Thou whom the arts all emulously crown, <lb/>
            Sword of the state, and honour of the gown; <lb/>
            My theme is gratitude, inspire my lays ! <lb/>
            Oh be my Genius ! while I strive to praise <lb/>
            The rural deities, the rural plain, <lb/>
            The use of foodful corn they taught the swain. <lb/>
            They taught man first the social hut to raise, <lb/>
            And thatch it o'er with turf, or leafy sprays: <lb/>
            They first to tame the furious bull essay'd, <lb/>
            And on rude wheels the rolling carriage laid. <lb/>
            Man left his savage ways; the garden glow'd, <lb/>
            Fruits not their own admiring trees bestow'd, <lb/>
            While through the thirsty ground meandering runnels <lb/>
            flow'd. <lb/>
            There bees uf sweets despoil the breathing spring, <lb/>
            And to their cells the dulcet plunder bring. <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            The ploughman first to soothe the toilsome day, <lb/>
            Chanted in measured feet his sylvan lay: <lb/>
            And, seed-time o'er, he first in blithesome vein. <lb/>
            Piped to his household gods the hymning strain. <lb/>
            Then first the press with purple wine overran, <lb/>
            And cooling water made it fit for man. <lb/>
            The village lad first made a wreath of flowers <lb/>
            To deck in spring the tutelary powers: <lb/>
            Blest be the country, yearly there the plain <lb/>
            Yields, when the dog-star burns, the golden grain ; <lb/>
            Thence too thy chorus, Bacchus, first began, <lb/>
            The painted clown first laid the tragic plan. <lb/>
            A goat, the leader of the shaggy throng, <lb/>
            The village sent it, recompensed the song. <lb/>
            There too the sheep his woolly treasure wears; <lb/>
            There too the swain his woolly treasure shears; <lb/>
            This to the thirsty dame long work supplies; <lb/>
            The distaff hence, and basket took their rise. <lb/>
            Hence too the various labours of the loom, <lb/>
            Thy praise, Minerva, and Arachne's doom ! <lb/>
            Mid mountain herds Love first drew vital air, <lb/>
            Unknown to man, and man had nought to fear ; <lb/>
            'Gainst herds, his bow th' unskilful archer drew ; <lb/>
            Ah my pierced heart, an archer now too true ! <lb/>
            Now herds may roam untouched, 'tis Cupid's joy, <lb/>
            The brave to vanquish, and to fix the coy. <lb/>
            The youth whose heart the soft emotion feels, <lb/>
            Nor sighs for wealth, nor waits at grandeur's heels ; <lb/>
            Age fired by Love is touch'd by shame no more, <lb/>
            But blabs its follies at the fair one's door! <lb/>
            Led by soft Love, the tender, trembling fair <lb/>
            Steals to her swain, and cheats suspicion's care, <lb/>
            With outstretched arms she wins her darkling way. <lb/>
            And tiptoe listens that no noise betray !</p>
          <p>Ah wretched those on whom dread Cupid frowns! <lb/>
            How happy they whose mutual choice lie crowns ! <lb/>
            Will Love partake the banquet of the day ? <lb/>
            O come-but throw thy burning shafts away.</p>
          <p>Ye swains, begin to mighty Love the song, <lb/>
            Your songs, ye swains, to mighty Love belong ! <lb/>

            Breathe out aloud your wishes for my fold, <lb/>
            Your own soft vows in whispers may be told. <lb/>

            Ye now may venture to request aloud !</p>
          <p>Pursue your sports ; night mounts her curtain'd wain <lb/>
            The dancing stars compose her filial train; <lb/>
            Black muffled sleep steals on with silent pace, <lb/>

            Your wish I guess; you wish a beauteous spouse, <lb/>

          <p>My fair, Cornutus, to the country's flown, <lb/>
            Oh how insipid is the city grown ! <lb/>
            No taste have they for elegance refined, <lb/>
            No tender blossoms, who remain behind : <lb/>
            Now Cytherea glads the laughing plain, <lb/>
            And smiles and sports compose her sylvan train. <lb/>
            Now Cupid joys to learn the ploughman's phrase, <lb/>
            And clad a peasant, o'er the fallows strays. <lb/>
            Oh how the weighty prong I'll busy wield ! <lb/>
            Should the fair wander to the labour'd field ; <lb/>
            A farmer then, the crooked ploughshare hold, <lb/>
            Whilst the dull ox prepares the vigorous mould: <lb/>
            I'd not complain though Phœbus burnt the lands, <lb/>
            And painful blisters swell'd my tender hands.</p>
          <p>Admetus' herds the fair Apollo drove, <lb/>
            In spite of med'cine's power, a prey to love ; <lb/>
            Nor aught avail'd to soothe his amorous care, <lb/>
            His lyre of silver sound, or waving hair. <lb/>
            To quench their thirst the kine to streams he led, <lb/>
            And drove them from their pasture to the shed: <lb/>
            The milk to curdle, then, the fair he taught, <lb/>
            And from the cheese to strain the dulcet draught. <lb/>
            Oft, oft his virgin sister blush'd for shame, <lb/>
            As bearing lambkins o'er the field he came ! <lb/>
            Oft would he sing the list'ning vales among, <lb/>
            Till lowing oxen broke the plaintive song. <lb/>
            To Delphi trembling, anxious chiefs repair, <lb/>
            But got no answer, Phœbus was not there. <lb/>
            Thy curling locks that charm'd a step-dame's eye, <lb/>
            A jealous step-dame now neglected fly! <lb/>
            To see thee, Phœbus, thus disfigured stray, <lb/>
            Who could discover the fair god of day ? <lb/>
            Constrained by Cupid in a cot to <unclear>pine</unclear>, <lb/>
            Where was thy Delos, where thy Pythian shrine ? <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            Thrice happy days, when Love almighty sway'd! <lb/>
            And openly the gods his will obey'd. <lb/>
            Now Love's soft power's become a common jest- <lb/>
            Yet those who feel his influence in their breast, <lb/>
            The prude's contempt, the wise man's sneer despise, <lb/>
            Nor would his chains forego to rule the skies.</p>
          <p>Curst farm ! that forced my Nemesis from town, <lb/>
            Blasts taint thy vines, and rains thy harvests drown. <lb/>
            Though hymns implore your aid, great god of wine! <lb/>
            Assist the lover, and neglect the vine; <lb/>
            To shades, unpunish'd, ne'er let beauty stray ; <lb/>
            Not all your vintage can its absence pay! <lb/>
            Rather than harvest should the fair detain, <lb/>
            May rills and acorns feed th' unactive swain ! <lb/>
            The swains of old no golden Ceres knew, <lb/>
            And yet how fervent was their love and true ! <lb/>
            Their melting vows the Paphian queen approved, <lb/>
            And every valley witness'd how they loved. <lb/>
            Then lurk'd no spies to catch the willing maid; <lb/>
            Doorless each house; in vain no shepherd pray'd. <lb/>
            Once more, ye simple usages, obtain ! <lb/>
            No-lead me, drive me to the cultur'd plain ! <lb/>
            Enchain me, whip me, if the fair command ; <lb/>

            Oh, freedom of my fathers ! fare thee well ! <lb/>
            A slavery wretched, and a chain severe, <lb/>

            Bitter the day, and all! the nightly shade; <lb/>
            And all my hours in venom'd stream have roll'd ; <lb/>
            No elegies, no lays of Phœbus, aid; <lb/>

          <p>Away, ye Muses ! if ye serve not Love : <lb/>

            Away, ye Muses ! with the useless lore ; <lb/>
            Through blood and pillage I must gifts prepare; <lb/>
            Or weep, thrown prostrate at her bolted door.</p>
          <p>Suspended spoils I'll snatch from pompous fanes ; <lb/>
            But Venus first shall violated be ; <lb/>
            She prompts the sacrilege, who forged the chains; <lb/>

            Or paints the snowy fleece with Tyrian red ! <lb/>
            Through filmy Coan robes her limbs are seen, <lb/>
            And India's pearls gleam lucid from her head.</p>
          <p>'Tis pamper'd avarice thus corrupts the fair; <lb/>
            The key is turn'd ; the mastiff guards the door : <lb/>

          <p>But she, unbribed, unbought, yet melting kind, <lb/>
            May she a hundred years, unfading, bloom ; <lb/>

            Honouring the raptures that his youth had blest, <lb/>
            Shall hang the wreath, and slow-departing say, <lb/>
            " Sleep !-and may earth lie light upon thy breast !”</p>
          <p>Truth prompts my tongue ; but what can truth avail ? <lb/>
            The love her laws prescribe must now be mine ; <lb/>
            My ancestors' loved groves I set to sale- <lb/>
            My household gods, your title I resign !</p>

            The Sibyl-leaves if Rome ne'er sought in vain, <lb/>

            To charge the clarion sounded in the sky, <lb/>
            Arms clash'd, blood ran, and warriors seem'd to die: <lb/>
            With monstrous prodigies the year began ; <lb/>
            An annual darkness the whole globe o'erran ; <lb/>
            Apollo, shorn of every beamy ray, <lb/>
            Oft strove, but strove in vain, to light the day: <lb/>
            The statues of the gods wept tepid tears; <lb/>

          <p>These were of old : no more, Apollo ! frown, <lb/>
            But in the waves each adverse omen drown. <lb/>
            Oh ! let thy bays in crackling flames ascend, <lb/>

            From every cot unnumbered children throng, <lb/>

            And while in mirth the hours they thus employ, <lb/>
            At home the grandsire tends his little boy; <lb/>
            And in each feature pleased himself to trace, <lb/>

          <p>The sylvan youth, their grateful homage paid, <lb/>

            Or stretched on soft enamel'd meadows lie, <lb/>
            Where thickest umbrage cools the summer sky: <lb/>

          <p>THOUSANDS in death would seek an end of woe, <lb/>
            But hope, deceitful hope ! prevents the blow ! <lb/>
            Hope plants the forest, and she sows the plain, <lb/>
            And feeds with future granaries the swain ; <lb/>
            Hope snares the winged vagrants of the sky, <lb/>
            Hope cheats in reedy brooks the scaly fry; <lb/>
            By hope the fetter'd slave, the drudge of fate, <lb/>
            Sings, shakes his irons, and forgets his state; <lb/>
            Hope promised you, you haughty still deny; <lb/>
            Yield to the goddess, 0 my fair ! comply. <lb/>
            Hope whisper'd me, " Give sorrow to the wind! <lb/>
            The haughty fair one shall at last be kind." <lb/>
            Yet, yet you treat me with the same disdain: <lb/>
            O let not hope's soft whispers prove in vain !</p>
          <p>Untimely fate your sister snatch'd away; <lb/>
            Spare me, 0 spare me, by her shade I pray! <lb/>
            So shall my garlands deck her virgin-tomb ; <lb/>
            So shall I weep, no hypocrite, her doom! <lb/>
            So may her grave with rising flowers be drest, <lb/>
            And the green turf lie lightly on her breast.</p><pb n="357"/>
            
          <p>Ah me! will nought avail ? the world I'll fly, <lb/>
            And, prostrate at her tomb, a suppliant sigh ! <lb/>
            To her attentive ghost, of you complain ; <lb/>
            Tell my long sorrowing, tell of your disdain. <lb/>
            Oft, when alive, in my behalf she spoke: <lb/>
            Your endless coyness must her shade provoke: <lb/>
            With ugly dreams she'll haunt your hour of rest, <lb/>
            And weep before you, an unwelcome guest! <lb/>
            Ghastly and pale as when besmeared with blood, <lb/>
            Oh fatal fall! she pass'd the Stygian flood.</p>
          <p>No more, my strains ! your eyes with tears o'erflow, <lb/>
            This moving object renovates your woe: <lb/>
            You, you are guiltless ! I your maid accuse ; <lb/>
            You generous are ! she, she has selfish views. <lb/>
            Nay, were you guilty, I'll no more complain ; <lb/>
            One tear from you overpays a life of pain ! <lb/>
            She, Phryne, promised to promote my vows: <lb/>
            She took, but never gave my billet-doux. <lb/>
            You're gone abroad, she confidently swears, <lb/>
            Oft when your sweet-toned voice salutes mine care : <lb/>
            Or, when you promise to reward my pains, <lb/>
            That you're afraid, or indisposed, she feigns: <lb/>
            Then madding jealousy inflames my breast; <lb/>
            Then fancy represents a rival blest; <lb/>
            I wish thee, Phryne ! then, a thousand woes ;- <lb/>
            And if the gods with half my wishes close, <lb/>
            Phryne ! a wretch of wretches thou shalt be, <lb/>
            And vainly beg of death to set thee free ! GRANGER.</p>

          <p>MANY by death their fatal ills would end, <lb/>
            Credulous hope does still their reign extend, <lb/>
            And promise wonders from the following day; <lb/>
            To-morrow's sun shines always bright and gay. <lb/>
            Hope feeds the husbandman, and soothes his toil; <lb/>
            Hope lends the seed-corn to the furrow'd soil. <lb/>
            That with a large increase the fertile field <lb/>
            May to his thirsty wishes golden harvests yield: <lb/>
            This to the snare the heedless birds betrays, <lb/>
            This to the hidden hook the finny race. <lb/>

            The galley-slave, bound fast in solid gyves, <lb/>
            From this a comfort in his woes derives ; <lb/>
            Who, whilst his legs resound with clinking chains, <lb/>
            Tugs at the oar and sings amidst his pains. <lb/>
            Hope shows me Nemesis all soft and kind, <lb/>
            But still averse the froward nymph I find. <lb/>
            Let not the goddess of thy name appear, <lb/>
            Ah ! cruel maid ! less fierce and less severe, <lb/>
            Ah ! spare my anguish and thy hate abate, <lb/>
            I be- this for thy sister's timeless fate. <lb/>
            Disturb not with thy cruelty her grave, <lb/>
            But with a speedy smile thy votary save. <lb/>
            She is my saint, I to her tomb will bear <lb/>
            My gifts and chaplets wet with many a tear; <lb/>
            Yes, to her tomb I'll fly, her suppliant prove, <lb/>
            And with her silent urn deplore my love: <lb/>
            She will not leave her client to his pain, <lb/>
            Nor let his tears for thee be ever vain. <lb/>
            I charge thee therefore in her name to prove <lb/>
            More swiftly kind to my complaining love. <lb/>
            Lest her neglected manes in the night <lb/>
            Thy conscious slumbers with sad dreams affright; <lb/>
            And stand before thee all besmear'd with blood, <lb/>
            As she fell downward to the Stygian flood. <lb/>
            But hold-that dismal story I'll forbear, <lb/>
            Lest I renew my fair one's anxious care; <lb/>
            I am not so much worth to call from her one tear, <lb/>
            Nor is it fit that tears should e'er disguise <lb/>
            The lustre of those dear loquacious eyes. <lb/>
            The bawd's my foe, and makes my vows all vain; <lb/>
            The tender maid would pity else my pain: <lb/>
            Phryne the bawd against me bars the door, <lb/>
            A bawd is still obdurate to the poor. <lb/>
            Within her secret bosom she conveys <lb/>
            The amorous billets for the man that pays. <lb/>
            Oft when the pleasing music of her voice <lb/>
            Alarms my heart with the approaching joys, <lb/>
            Though to the door the well-known accents come, <lb/>
            This cursed bawd will swear she's not at home. <lb/>
            And often when my soul is all on fire, <lb/>
            Summon'd by love, and swelling with desire, <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            E'en in the harbour all my joys are split, <lb/>
            The eager lover Phryne won't admit; <lb/>
            But with dissembled terror in her air, <lb/>
            Pretends that sudden pangs have seized my fair; <lb/>
            Or that some threatened danger must that night <lb/>
            Prorogue the promised moments of delight. <lb/>
            Oh ! then my wounded soul in cares expires, <lb/>
            And feels new anguish from my jealous fires: <lb/>
            My pregnant fancy soon begets alarms, <lb/>
            And paints some happy lover in her arms; <lb/>
            Paints all the tumults of the ravish'd pair, <lb/>
            And all the several ways he grasps the fair. <lb/>
            Then fall my curses on thy destin'd head, <lb/>
            Detested Phryne ! better thou wert dead, <lb/>
            Than that the gods but one of them should hear; <lb/>
            For all the racks that the most guilty fear, <lb/>
            Would be thy hated lot, thy cursed share. OTWAY.</p>

          <p>LAST night's ill-boding dreams, ye gods, avert! <lb/>
            Nor plague, with portents, a poor lover's heart! <lb/>
            But why? From prejudice our terrors rise; <lb/>
            Vain visions have no commerce with the skies: <lb/>
            Th' event of things the gods alone foresee, <lb/>
            And Tuscan priests foretell what they decree. <lb/>
            Dreams flit at midnight round the lover's head, <lb/>
            And timorous man alarm with idle dread: <lb/>
            And hence oblations to divert the woe, <lb/>
            Weak, superstitious minds on heaven bestow. <lb/>
            But since whate'er the gods foretell is true, <lb/>
            And man's oft warn'd, mysterious dreams ! by you; <lb/>
            Dread Juno! make my nightly visions vain, <lb/>
            Vain make my boding fears, and calm my pain ! <lb/>
            The blessed gods, you know, I ne'er reviled, <lb/>
            And nought iniquous e'er my heart defiled.</p>
          <p>Now night had laved her coursers in the main, <lb/>
            And left to dewy dawn a doubtful reign ; <lb/>
            Bland sleep, that from the couch of sorrow flies, <lb/>
            (The wretch's solace,) had not closed my eyes <lb/>
            At last, when morn unbarr'd the gates of light, <lb/>
            A downv slumber shut my labouring sight: <lb/>
            A youth appear'd, with virgin laurel crown'd, <lb/>
            He moved majestic, and I heard the sound. <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            Such charms, such manly charms, were never seen, <lb/>
            As fired his eyes, and harmonized his mien ; <lb/>
            His hair, in ringlets of an auburn hue, <lb/>
            Shed Syrian sweets, and o'er his shoulders flew <lb/>
            As white as thine, fair Luna ! was his skin, <lb/>
            So vein'd with azure, and as smoothly thin ; <lb/>
            So soft a blush vermilion'd o'er his face, <lb/>
            As when a maid first melts in man's embrace; <lb/>
            Or when the fair with curious art unite <lb/>
            The purple amaranth and lily white. <lb/>
            A bloom like his, when tinged by autumn's pride, <lb/>
            Reddens the apple on the sunny side; <lb/>
            A Tyrian tunic to his andes flow'd, [show'd <lb/>
            Which through its sidled plaits his godlike beautify <lb/>
            A lyre, the present mulciber, bestow'd, <lb/>
            On his left arm with easy grandeur glow'd; <lb/>
            The peerless work of virgin gold was made <lb/>
            With ivory, gems, and tortoise interlaid; <lb/>
            O'er all the vocal strings his fingers stray, <lb/>
            The vocal strings his fingers glad obey, <lb/>
            And, harmonized, a sprightly prelude play: <lb/>
            But when he join'd the music of his tongue, <lb/>
            These soft, sad elegiac lays he sung :</p>
          <p>" All hail, thou care of heaven ! (a virtuous bard, <lb/>
            The god of wine, the Muses, I regard;) <lb/>
            But neither Bacchus nor the Thespian Nine, <lb/>
            The sacred will of destiny divine: <lb/>
            The secret book of destiny to see, <lb/>
            Heaven's awful sire has given alone to me; <lb/>
            And I, unerring god, to you explain <lb/>
            (Attend and credit) what the Fates ordain.</p>
          <p>" She who is still your ever-constant care, <lb/>

            Whose beauties bloom in every soften'd line, <lb/>
            Her sex's envy, and the love of thine: <lb/>
            Not with more warmth is female fondness moved. <lb/>
            Not with more warmth are tenderest brides beloved. <lb/>
            For whom you hourly importune the sky, <lb/>
            For whom you wish to live, nor fear to die, <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            Whose form, when night has wrapt in black the pole, <lb/>
            Cheats in soft vision your enamour'd soul; <lb/>
            Neæra! whose bright charms your verse displays, <lb/>
            Seeks a new lover, and inconstant strays ! <lb/>
            For thee no more with mutual warmth she burns, <lb/>
            But thy chaste house and chaste embrace she spurns.</p>
          <p>" Oh cruel, perjured, false, intriguing sex ! <lb/>
            Oh born with woes poor wretched man to vex! <lb/>
            Whoe'er has learn'd her lover to betray, <lb/>
            Her beauty perish, and her name decay !</p>
          <p>" Yet, as the sex will change, avoid despair ; <lb/>
            A patient homage may subdue the fair. <lb/>
            Fierce Love taught man to suffer, laugh at pain ; <lb/>
            Fierce Love taught man, with joy, to drag the chain , <lb/>
            Fierce Love, nor vainly fabulous the tale, <lb/>
            Forced me, yes, forced me, to the lonely dale: <lb/>
            There I Admetus' snowy heifers drove, <lb/>
            Nor tuned my lyre, nor sung, absorb'd in love. <lb/>
            The favourite son of heaven's almighty sire, <lb/>
            Preferr'd a straw-pipe to his golden lyre.</p>
          <p>" Though false the fair, though Love is wild, obey, <lb/>
            Or, youth, you know not Love's tyrannic sway. <lb/>
            In plaintive strains address the haughty fair; <lb/>
            The haughty soften at the voice of prayer. <lb/>
            If ever true my Delphian answers prove, <lb/>
            Bear this my message to the maid you love.</p>
          <p>" Pride of your sex, and passion of the age ! <lb/>
            No more let other men your love engage ; <lb/>
            A bard on you the Delian god bestows, <lb/>
            This match alone can warrant your repose."</p>
          <p>He sung. When Morpheus from my pillow flew, <lb/>
            And plunged me in substantial griefs anew.</p>
          <p>Ah ! who could think that thou hadst broke thy vo <lb/>

            Such horrid crimes as all mankind detest, <lb/>
            Could they, how could they, harbour in thy breast ? <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            The ruthless deep, I know, was not thy sire : <lb/>
            Nor fierce Chimæra, belching floods of fire: <lb/>
            Nor didst thou from the triple monster spring, <lb/>
            Round whom a coil of kindred serpents cling; <lb/>
            Thou art not of the Libyan lion's seed, <lb/>
            Of barking Scylla's, nor Charybdis' breed; <lb/>
            Nor Afric's sands, nor Scythia gave thee birth; <lb/>
            But a compassionate, benignant earth. <lb/>
            No ! thou, my fair ! deriv'st thy noble race <lb/>
            From parents deck'd with every human grace.</p>
          <p>Ye gods ! avert the woes that haunt my mind, <lb/>

          <p>Now heaven forefend !-nor bring those dreams to light <lb/>
            That haunted the pale close of yesternight! <lb/>
            Away! far hence, ye false, vain shadows, fly ! <lb/>
            Hope not to win my fond credulity: <lb/>
            From gods alone unerring warnings come, <lb/>
            When seers in entrails read the future doom. <lb/>
            Dreams, like the cheating shades of night, we find, <lb/>
            Play with false fears upon the timid mind. <lb/>
            Such midnight omens superstition sees, <lb/>
            Which crackling salt and holy meal appease. <lb/>
            But whether truth to others shadowed seem <lb/>
            In the seer's warning, or the lying dream ; <lb/>
            At least may Luna chase these fears in air, <lb/>

            If pure my conscience from crime's deepening dye, <lb/>
            Nor e'er my tongue blasphemed the powers on high.</p>
          <p>Night now had measured heaven's cærulean steep <lb/>
            With sable steeds; her laved wheels touch'd the deep <lb/>
            But sleep, that soothes the wretched, soothed not me; <lb/>
            Still from an anxious chamber prompt to flee: <lb/>
            Till, when the sun peep'd faint from eastern skies, <lb/>
            Late slumber settled on my languid eyes. <lb/>
            When lo! a youth was seen my floor to tread, <lb/>
            Chaste laurels nodding round his wreathed head. <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            No form so fair adorn'd the age of gold: <lb/>
            No form so fair could spring from human mould: <lb/>
            Loose o'er his tapering neck the ringlets flew, <lb/>
            That breathing myrtle dropp'd with Tyrian dew: <lb/>
            White as the moon did his complexion show, <lb/>
            And tinting crimson flush'd his skin of snow. <lb/>
            As virgin cheeks with tender blushes dyed, <lb/>
            When to the youth consents the yielded bride: <lb/>
            As girls with purple am'ranths lilies thread; <lb/>
            As apples pale catch autumn's streaky red. <lb/>
            A sweeping robe around his ankles trail'd; <lb/>
            His dazzling limbs the gorgeous vesture veil'd: <lb/>
            On his left side a harp suspended hung, <lb/>
            Of precious shell, with gold resplendent strung: <lb/>
            Soft, at his first approach, the chord he smote <lb/>
            With ivory quill, with sweet-breathed vocal note: <lb/>
            His fingers and his voice preluded clear, <lb/>
            Then sweet, but sad, his accents thrill'd my ear. <lb/>
            " Hail, care of heaven ! the bard of spotless love <lb/>
            Apollo, Bacchus, and the Nine approve: <lb/>
            But ah ! not Bacchus, not the Nine, have power <lb/>

            For whom thy feverish days are cross'd with care; <lb/>
            And who, when sleep its umber'd mantle throws, <lb/>
            With nightly phantoms haunts thy vain repose: <lb/>
            She—fair Neæra-in thy verse divine, <lb/>

            No more my voice responsive cadence made; <lb/>
            But on a flimsy oat I whispered love: <lb/>
            E'en I, Latona's son, the son of Jove. <lb/>
            Ah ! youth ! thou know'st not love ! unless thou <unclear>bear</unclear> <lb/>

            Yet, 0 my friends ! whatever the Fates decree, <lb/>
            Joy guide your steps, and still remember me !</p>
          <p>Meantime, to deprecate the fierce disease, <lb/>
            And hasten glad returns of vigorous ease, <lb/>
            Milk, mix'd with wine, 0 promise to bestow, <lb/>

          <p>MESSALA, thee I sing, although thy name, <lb/>
            Thy well-known merit, and thy spreading fame <lb/>
            Startle me, lest I feebly should repeat <lb/>
            A verse inferior to desert so great; <lb/>
            But though unequal to the theme I raise, <lb/>
            Yet I'll attempt at least to sing thy praise: <lb/>
            I, the designer of an humble verse, <lb/>
            Since none with justice can thy praise rehearse, <lb/>
            Unless he had thy language to express, <lb/>
            And clothe thy mighty deeds with manly dress; <lb/>
            A task superior to my trifling skill, <lb/>
            Yet take (if the performance fails) the will; <lb/>
            Let that suffice, nor thou the gift refuse, <lb/>
            The humble tribute of an humble Muse.</p>
          <p>Thus Phcebus kind received with smiling cheer <lb/>
            The little gift the Cretan could prefer. <lb/>
            Thus Icarus, by his celestial guest, <lb/>
            Bacchus, was far preferr'd before the rest, <lb/>
            As those bright signals in the heavens declare, <lb/>
            Fair Virgo, and the scorching Syrian star: <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            Alcides, destined for unbounded power <lb/>
            Oft visited the poor Molorchus' bower. <lb/>
            The gods above do not mean offerings scorn. <lb/>
            Nor always claim the ox with gilded horn; <lb/>
            So may this humble verse, so small it be, <lb/>
            Come an accepted off'ring due to thee; <lb/>
            That I encouraged may, in time, repeat <lb/>
            A verse more worthy, and thy praise more <unclear>great</unclear>.</p>
          <p>Others, inspired with a sublimer flame, <lb/>
            May sing the vast creation's wondrous frame; <lb/>
            And how the earth is press'd with air around, <lb/>
            And how the circling sea confines the ground; <lb/>
            And how the fluid body of the air <lb/>
            Is moved with constant motion here and there; <lb/>
            And lightly wafting upwards does aspire <lb/>
            To join the high and pure ethereal fire; <lb/>
            And lastly, how different those bodies lie <lb/>
            Enclosed with the vast concave of the sky.</p>
          <p>But if my verse can well express thy praise, <lb/>
            Or (what's a desperate thought) can higher raise; <lb/>
            Or if it cannot to thy name be just, <lb/>
            But sinks below thy worth, as sure it must; <lb/>
            Whatever thoughts are spread in every line, <lb/>
            Whate'er I sing, the votive verse be thine.</p>
          <p>You, though your race illustriously are known, <lb/>
            Unsatisfied with honours handed down ; <lb/>
            Still follow glory with a steady pace, <lb/>
            And emulate the greatness of your race, <lb/>
            Thus all those merits which your fathers knew, <lb/>
            Your sons may see again revived in you.</p>
          <p>Nor shall an empty title hold thy fame, <lb/>
            But endless volumes shall record your name: <lb/>
            Crowds shall contend to have thy worth declared. <lb/>
            The orator, historian, and the bard: <lb/>
            But may the task at length on me be laid, <lb/>
            That so my name may with thy deeds be read.</p>
          <p>For who can greater cause for praises yield <lb/>
            Than you ? Or in the forum or the field, <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            With equal worth you claim a just renown, <lb/>
            Braced in the helmet, or the peaceful gown. <lb/>
            The spreading laurels lie in equal scales, <lb/>
            And neither pendent hemisphere prevails.</p>
          <p>You, if the giddy vulgar rise to rage, <lb/>
            Appease their fury and their heat assuage. <lb/>
            Nor Pylus, nor could Ithaca contain <lb/>
            So great a worthy in their boasted train: <lb/>
            Nor Nestor, noted for his vast renown, <lb/>
            Nor great Ulysses of a little town ; <lb/>
            Though one had seen three hundred suns go round <lb/>
            Their annual courses, and revive the ground; <lb/>
            The other all the cities did explore, <lb/>
            Where'er the farthest sea includes the shore.</p>
          <p>He overcame the Thracians, fierce in arms, <lb/>
            Nor was subdued by Lotophagian charms. <lb/>
            He checked the one-eyed monster's fell design, <lb/>
            Making him drunk with Maronean wine. <lb/>
            Æolian gales he carried o'er the sea, <lb/>
            And to the Lestrygonians took his way, <lb/>
            Rough race! o'er whom Antiphates was king, <lb/>
            Where cool Artacia spreads her limpid spring. <lb/>
            Circe's bewitching arts by him were known; <lb/>
            Circe ! the powerful daughter of the Sun, <lb/>
            Who by her skill in magic simples knew <lb/>
            To change old Nature's forms to bodies new: <lb/>
            Then to Cimmerian eaves he took his way, <lb/>
            Wherever Phœbus roused the lightsome day, <lb/>
            Whether above the earth, or underneath the sea. <lb/>
            He view'd the dark Plutonian coasts below, <lb/>
            There saw the demi-gods and heroes go, <lb/>
            Mingled among the spectres to and fro. <lb/>
            Secure his easy vessel sail'd along, <lb/>
            Unstopp'd by the alluring Syren's song: <lb/>
            Him steering 'twixt the jaws of death his course, <lb/>
            Nor Scylla could affright with rapid source ; <lb/>
            Though dreadful and tremendously she raves, <lb/>
            Girt round with barking dogs beneath the waves; . <lb/>
            Nor could Charybdis, with tempestuous sea, <lb/>
            Destroy his vessel in her usual way: <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            Nor when to heaven uprose the waves profound, <lb/>
            Nor when dividing they disclosed the ground: <lb/>
            Nor shall I pass great Jove's severe award, <lb/>
            Declared for Phoebus’ violated herd: <lb/>
            Nor how at length he fair Calypso found, <lb/>
            Her generous love and hospitable ground: <lb/>
            Nor how Phæacia was the happy isle <lb/>
            That closed his journey and relieved his toil.</p>
          <p>Now whether these were in the world we know, <lb/>
            Or fables feign them in some world below; <lb/>
            Let him his labour boast and hardy deed, <lb/>
            While you in moving eloquence exceed.</p>
          <p>In you the ready skill of war is found, <lb/>
            How to intrench the camp and raise the ground; <lb/>
            And how against the adverse host oppose, <lb/>
            Defensive palisadoes placed in rows, <lb/>
            And where to lead the ditch and ground enclose ; <lb/>
            And ere you pitch the camp, to choose that ground <lb/>
            Which does with pure refreshing springs abound. <lb/>
            Swift through your troops communications go, <lb/>
            Which are cut off before they reach the foe. <lb/>
            You various sports and active games devise, <lb/>
            To keep the troops in manly exercise.</p>
          <p>What chief like you can toss the pond'rous spear? <lb/>
            Or send the flying arrow through the air ? <lb/>
            Or throw the jav'lin with an arm so strong, <lb/>
            To cut the air and drive the clouds along ? <lb/>
            Or who direct the fiery courser's will, <lb/>

            And-lead the soldiers to a spreading wing ; <lb/>
            That either may a mutual aid dispense, <lb/>
            And guard each other with a joint defence.</p>
          <p>But let me not uncertain trophies raise, <lb/>
            For wars I sing, and wars confirm thy praise: <lb/>
            Witness the Illyrians taught the Roman sway, <lb/>
            The base Pannonian rebels to obey: <lb/>
            And Arupinum taken, which did yield <lb/>
            One born to arms, and constant in the field: <lb/>
            Poor and unknown, him whosoe'er had seen, <lb/>
            Unbroke with age, and e'en in winter green, <lb/>
            With less surprise would hear the story told <lb/>
            Of rev'rend Nestor's fame, three centuries old: <lb/>
            For though since first he had received his birth, <lb/>
            A hundred annual suns had warm'd the earth; <lb/>
            He springing in the saddle pressed the horse, <lb/>
            And fix'd, he sat him in the swiftest course: <lb/>
            An able vet'ran for the dusty plains, <lb/>
            And a just moderator of the reins. <lb/>
            Subdued by thee, when all their power was vain, <lb/>
            They bent their necks beneath the Roman chain.</p>
          <p>But these shall not suffice to speak thy praise, <lb/>
            Actions to come shall greater honours raise; <lb/>
            For I have more surprising things in view, <lb/>
            From omens sure as e'er Melampus knew. <lb/>
            For on that day when you, sublimely great, <lb/>
            Was clothed in purple and enrobed in state, <lb/>
            The sun above the ocean raised his head, <lb/>
            And o'er the earth uncommon lustre spread: <lb/>
            The seas with swelling billows rise no more, <lb/>
            But roll'd their silent waters to the shore ; <lb/>
            The struggling winds their noisy discord cease, <lb/>
            And every whispering gale lay hush'd in peace. <lb/>
            No bird did through the air his journey steer, <lb/>
            Or shook his whistling pinions in the air: <lb/>
            No savage beasts were grazing in the shade; <lb/>
            But all stood silent at the vows you made. <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            Jove, in his chariot wafted through the air, <lb/>
            Left his Olympus to receive thy prayer ; <lb/>
            And seem'd intent to bend a listening ear. <lb/>
            Th' assenting power to every word you said <lb/>
            Gave the majestic nod, and waved his head: <lb/>
            Sudden the shining altars seem'd more bright, <lb/>
            And shooting flames diffused a greater light.</p>
          <p>The gods approve! begin the mighty deed, <lb/>
            For thee uncommon triumphs are decreed. <lb/>
            Not neighbouring Gallia shall confine thy course, <lb/>
            Nor vast Hispania with its savage force; <lb/>
            Nor wealthy confines which the Tyrians sow, <lb/>
            Nor where the Nile and great Choaspes flow; <lb/>
            Nor where swift Gyndes does the land divide, <lb/>
            The lasting proof of Cyrus' foolish pride ; <lb/>
            Nor where the waters through their sulph'rous veins <lb/>
            Diffuse the heat to Arectæan plains; <lb/>
            Nor that vast land where Thomyris bore sway, <lb/>
            And swift Araxes rolls his rapid way; <lb/>
            Nor vile Padæans at the farthest east, <lb/>
            Who load their tables with a hateful feast; <lb/>
            Nor where the Hebrus spreads his golden sand, <lb/>
            Nor where the Tanais laves the Scythian land.</p>
          <p>But why should I insist on these alone, <lb/>
            When thy vast conquest the whole world shall own : <lb/>
            For thee remains the distant British shore, <lb/>
            Unbent by Roman power, a conquest yet in store; <lb/>
            For thee remains the farthest torrid zone, <lb/>
            Regions remote, and countries yet unknown.</p>
          <p>For air does this terraqueous globe surround, <lb/>
            And five divisions in the orb are found; <lb/>
            Two parts whereof in chilly regions lie, <lb/>
            Perpetual frosts, and an inclement sky. <lb/>
            The earth is there with darkness wrapped around, <lb/>
            And sullen night sits brooding o'er the ground: <lb/>
            No living waters there the earth divide, <lb/>
            Nor cheerful streams in pleasant wand'rings glide ; <lb/>
            But everlasting ice the floods constrains, <lb/>
            And drifts of snow o'erspread the dreary plains; <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            There never did :he sun diffuse a ray, <lb/>
            Or give the cheerful promise of a day.</p>
          <p>The middle regions feel the scorching sun, <lb/>
            Whether he nearer brings our summer on; <lb/>
            Or when he does a swifter course display, <lb/>
            And wheels in circles short the wintry day: <lb/>
            Therefore the plough is never there in use, <lb/>
            No corn the fields, nor herbs the lands produce: <lb/>
            No god indulgent makes the fields his care, <lb/>
            Bacchus and Ceres never visit there. <lb/>
            No cattle there can graze the smoking ground; <lb/>
            There nothing that possesses life is found.</p>
          <p>Between this freezing cold and scorching heat <lb/>
            Our temperate zone is placed, a happy seat: <lb/>
            To this opposed, a fellow climate lies, <lb/>
            The same meridian holds, and temperate skies. <lb/>
            Here first the stubborn steer to toil was broke, <lb/>
            And oxen bent their neck beneath the yoke. <lb/>
            Here vines were taught their flexile shoots to ease, <lb/>
            And hang their clusters on the neighbouring trees, <lb/>
            And annual harvest gave a large increase. <lb/>
            Here first the earth received the vexing plough, <lb/>
            And first the sea was raised with brazen prow: <lb/>
            Then by degrees at distance cities rise, <lb/>
            And swelling walls and towers divide the skies.</p>
          <p>Therefore where'er by fame thy acts are hurl'd, <lb/>
            They shall be known by all in either world. <lb/>
            For me, I cannot so much praise rehearse, <lb/>
            Though Phœbus should himself inspire my verse. <lb/>
            But Valgius, he can swell a warrior's name ; <lb/>
            Valgius, next Homer in eternal fame. <lb/>
            The works will not my leisure hours decay, <lb/>
            Though Fortune vexes me, as is her way.</p>
          <p>For I could once command a stately seat, <lb/>
            Splendidly wealthy, and sublimely great: <lb/>
            And yellow harvests waving o'er the plain, <lb/>
            Seem'd to o'ercrowd my fields with golden grain. <lb/>
            When my unnumbered flock of flocks were fled, <lb/>
            And o'er the hills in crowded herds were spread. <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            Sufficient for their lord my lambs did stray, <lb/>
            And too, too many for the beasts of prey; <lb/>
            But now of every pleasing view bereft, <lb/>
            Reflection on their loss is all I've left. <lb/>
            Fresh grief I feel, and still repeated cares, <lb/>
            Oft as I cast my eye on former years.</p>
          <p>But though the Fates, with more severe decrees <lb/>
            Shall fix a train of heavier woes than these, <lb/>
            Yet still unwearied with my misery, <lb/>
            The Muse shall never fail to sing of thee.</p>
          <p>Nor will the Muse alone suffice to prove <lb/>
            How much I prize my friend, how much I love. <lb/>
            For thee I'd run the hazard of the sea, <lb/>
            And tempt the roughest of the waves for thee. <lb/>
            For thee I singly could whole troops oppose, <lb/>
            Or throw myself where flaming Ætna glows.</p>
          <p>And while I think you but regard my name, <lb/>
            I neither wish the Lydian realms to claim, <lb/>
            Nor the vast honours of Gylippus' fame: <lb/>
            Nor would I ask Apollo to inspire <lb/>
            My Muse with Homer's strength and lasting fire; <lb/>
            If but this humble verse can pleasing be, <lb/>
            No time shall stop my tongue from praising thee.</p>
          <p>And when I've suffer'd Fate's unalter'd doom, <lb/>
            Closed in the gloomy mansion of a tomb ; <lb/>
            If death in time shall make his forceful rape, <lb/>
            Or I survive, though in a different shape; <lb/>
            If as a horse I beat the dusty plain, <lb/>
            Or in a bull's majestic form remain; <lb/>
            Or if I as a feather'd fowl appear, <lb/>
            And beat with flutt'ring wings the fluid air; <lb/>
            Or in a human form increase my days, <lb/>
            I'll always fill whole volumes with thy praise. DART.</p>

          <p>GREAT god of war ! Sulpicia, lovely maid, <lb/>
            To grace your calends, is in pomp array'd. <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            If beauty warms you, quit th' ethereal height, <lb/>
            E'en Cytherea will indulge the sight: <lb/>
            But while you gaze o'er all her matchless charms. <lb/>
            Beware your hands should meanly drop your arms ! <lb/>
            When Cupid would the gods with love surprise, <lb/>
            He lights his torches at her radiant eyes. <lb/>
            A secret grace her every act improves, <lb/>
            And pleasing follows wheresoe'er she moves: <lb/>
            If loose her hair upon her bosom plays, <lb/>
            Unnumbered charms that negligence betrays: <lb/>
            Or if 'tis plaited with a laboured care, <lb/>
            Alike the labour'd plaits become the fair. <lb/>
            Whether rich Tyrian robes her charms invest, <lb/>
            Or all in snowy white the nymph is drest, <lb/>
            All, all she graces, still supremely fair, <lb/>
            Still charms spectators with a fond despair. <lb/>
            A thousand dresses thus Vertumnus wears, <lb/>
            And beauteous equally in each appears.</p>
          <p>The richest tints and deepest Tyrian hue, <lb/>
            To thee, 0 wondrous maid ! are solely due: <lb/>
            To thee th' Arabian husbandman should bring <lb/>
            The spicy produce of his eastern spring: <lb/>
            Whatever gems the swarthy Indians boast, <lb/>
            Their shelly treasures, and their golden coast, <lb/>
            Alone thou merit'st! Come, ye tuneful choir ! <lb/>
            And come, bright Phoebus ! with thy plausive lyre ! <lb/>

            But oh beware ! lest, gazing on her charms, <lb/>
            Fierce as thou art, thou drop thy shameful arms. <lb/>
            For from her eyes, when gods are Cupid's aim, <lb/>

             <pb n="384"/>
            In every act, and step, and motion seen, <lb/>
            Grace stealthy glides, and forms her easy mien: <lb/>
            Graceful her locks in loose disorder spread ; <lb/>
            Graceful the smoother braid that binds her head <lb/>
            She charms, when Tyrian purple folds her limbs ; <lb/>
            She charms, when white her snowy drapery swims: <lb/>
            Thus blithe Vertumnus in th' Olympian hall <lb/>
            Shifts all his thousand shapes, and charms in all. <lb/>
            She only of her sex deserves the grain <lb/>
            Of wool twice dipped in Tyrus' crimson stain: <lb/>
            Hers to possess whatever the Arab reaps <lb/>
            Of harvest shrubs, whence liquid fragrance weeps: <lb/>
            Whatever pearls the sable Indian's hand <lb/>
            Culls on his eastern ocean's ruddy sand. <lb/>
            Her on these calends, 0 ye Muses ! sing: <lb/>
